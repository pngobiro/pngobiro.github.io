                        <p><strong>Pillars of PE&E.</strong><br>The Guidelines on PE&E are premised on two pillars namely: Empowerment and Engagement.</p>
                        <p><strong>Parental Empowerment</strong></p>
                        <p>Empowerment refers to the enhancement of knowledge, skills, attitudes and practices of an individual or a group in pursuit of a mutual goal. It is the process of becoming stronger and more confident in performing one's role. Therefore, parental empowerment is the process or activity that is undertaken to enhance the capacity of parents so that they can actively nurture the potential of their children in and out of school. However, optimal learning can best be achieved through a multi-dimensional approach involving all members of a school community. These members include learners, parents, teachers, support staff, Board of Management (Bo M) and the Parent Association (PA).</p>
                        <p>This approach will create parental awareness through advocacy on their responsibilities in the learning of their children.</p>

                        <p><strong>Parental Engagement</strong></p>
                        <p>Parental engagement is the active participation of parents in their children's learning and holistic development in collaboration with teachers and other stakeholders. Learning experiences at home should take place to reinforce what is learnt in school. These connections can be maintained through various activities and provision of opportunities to parents to render services.</p>
                        <p><strong>N/B</strong> Parents, teachers, BoM, school management and the community need to be empowered in order to be engaged. Capacity building of all stakeholders is critical to ensure active parental involvement in school activities. This will help nurture the potential of learners in and out of school.</p>

                        <p>Parents should be involved in the formulation of decisions affecting the learner's overall wellbeing within and outside the school.</p>
                        <h5>Immediate outcome</h5>
                        <p>Enhanced parental participation and ownership of decisions affecting children's education.</p>
                        <h5>Activities to be undertaken to realize the immediate outcomes</h5>

                        <p>Parents are key stakeholders in the school community. Timely and effective communication enables parents to collaborate with the school towards the improvement of their children's well-being.

                        <h5>Immediate Outcome Activities</h5>
                        <p>Communication and collaboration between the school and parents can be enhanced through the following activities:</p>

                        <p>Quality learning should facilitate holistic growth and development. As learners grow, they negotiate various developmental milestones in the following six dimensions: physical, social, intellectual, emotional, moral and spiritual. Parents should be actively involved in monitoring and providing support to their children as they negotiate the developmental milestones. For instance, adolescents require the assurance of parental love and support throughout their schooling. Parents should create enabling environments to nurture values and develop character in their children.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>PE &E Guidelines are anchored in the existing legal frameworks and policies, which include</p>
                        <p><strong>a) The Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC - 1990)</strong><br>The Convention lays the foundational principles from which all rights are derived. Helping children to understand their rights will require parents to guide them to make choices with knowledge of accompanying consequences. These principles require children to respect the rights of others, especially their parents. Rights of children should be respected by all educational stakeholders.</p>
                        <p><strong>b) The African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child (1999)</strong><br>The Children's Charter originated because the member states of the African Union believed that the CRC missed important socio-cultural and economic realities particular to Africa. It emphasizes the need to include African cultural values and experiences when dealing with the rights of the child.</p>
                        <p><strong>c) The Constitution of Kenya (CoK 2010)</strong><br>The Constitution of Kenya in Article 26 recognizes the dignity and sanctity of life by acknowledging the right to life. Article 45 then goes on to acknowledge the family as a fundamental unit of society and the necessary basis of social order.</p>
                        <p>Article 53 is premised on the provisions of the CRC and the African charter. It states that a child is entitled to:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>A name, nationality, basic education, nutrition, shelter and healthcare.</li>
                            <li>Protection from abuse, neglect, harmful cultural practices, all forms of violence as well as exploitative labour.</li>
                            <li>Provision from both parents whether married or not.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>d) Basic Education Act, 2013</strong><br>According to the Basic Education Act, 2013, Article 31 (3) indicates that a parent or guardian has a right to participate in the character development of their children. This fosters good habits, acceptable values and behaviour for effective living as an individual member of the society.</p>
                        <p><strong>e) The Sessional Paper No. 1 of 2019 on Reforming Education and Training</strong><br>The Sessional paper states that a child's school life should be enriched to enable him or her experience and cope better with life.</p>
                        <p><strong>f) Basic Education Curriculum Framework (BECF -2016)</strong><br>The BECF captures the aspirations of most Kenyans in relation to the provision of Basic and Teacher Education in the country. The BECF has identified PE&E as one of the critical components of the competency based curriculum. The Guidelines on PE&E have been developed to actualize this aspiration. The Guidelines will support the realization of learning outcomes by enhancing the capacity of curriculum implementers. Indeed, teachers require the right skills to enable them create and strengthen partnerships with parents.</p>
