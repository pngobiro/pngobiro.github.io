                        <p>Philosophical foundation of curriculum refers to the nature of man in respect to his policy to select, design and formulate objectives to develop and evaluate his objectives and evaluate his knowledge, attitudes and skills of man in decision making for situational, society's and learning needs. Man also derives his methods of presentation, expression, skills to develop and formation of desirable attitudes from philosophical foundation of curriculum.</p>
                        <p>Objectives of the lecture on philosophical foundation of curriculum are to:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Identify major philosophies of education in ancient and modern periods</li>

                        </ul>
                        <p>Decisions are made on; communities, societies and learners needs. Methods of presentation, skills to be developed and desirable attitudes to be formed, require correct decision making denved from philosophy and policy of a country.

                        </ul>
                        <p>Philosophical foundation of curriculum has contributed to Kenyans Education systems since Independence. Tyler's (1949) view of philosophy in relation to school purposes is based on five criteria for selecting educational purposes.</p>
                        <p>We shall examine four major schools of philosophy, which have guided the writing, organizing and designing of school curriculum. Some of these philosophies are known by names. We shall refer to them as reconstructionism, progressivism, essentialism and perennialism. Reconstructionism is the most liberal of the four philosophies and prennialism as the most conservative. Most educational practitioners have used a combination of essentialism and progressivism in curriculum planning construction.</p>
                        <p>Philosophical or value foundations constitute the values and beliefs that make up the philosophies of life and of education and have a permeating influence on the other foundations. Statements of educational philosophy point to methodical efforts by philosophers to:</p>
                        <ol type="i">
                            <li>Examine values in society</li>
                            <li>Derive meanings from facts</li>
                            <li>Organize experiences in a manner useful to educational practitioners and the pupils in the school system.</li>
                            <li>Justify one or some educational beliefs over others.</li>
                            <li>Develop new proposals of educational practice for translation into action.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>In utilizing knowledge of philosophy in curriculum, the curriculum planner is seeking to establish ideas and notions that will indicate a priority of values in selecting experiences for the curriculum. The value or philosophical orientations which the educational system is charged with promoting form an integral part of the culture of a nation.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Philosophical Schools</h4>
                        <p>They include:</p>
                        <ol type="i">
                            <li>Traditional school represented by perennialism and Essentialism</li>
                            <li>The progressive school represented by progressivists</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>The three schools have advanced three theories of subject matter as shown below</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">1. Perennialists</h4>
                        <p>They believe subject matter should be taught for its own sake. They also believe that permanence of curriculum content and experiences is more important than change. Subject matter has a value which is inherent in the subject being taught. It's also their belief that educational system should be stable and its purposes steady.</p>
                        <p>The school of perennialist teaches subjects in their customary separate forms, history as history, geography as geography etc. Rather than in the combination as general (social) studies. The teachers and patrons of this school are sure that some subject is too trivial to be included in the curriculum. Only subject matter that is alleged to be hard to learn is admissible. They do not believe in the feelings and emotions of body movement, memory and thinking. Perennialsm can afford education, which is suitable to a small percentage of students who possess high verbal and academic aptitude. The ideal education is not directed to immediate needs, specialization but it is education calculated to develop the mind.</p>
                        <h5>Approaches to subject matter</h5>
                        <ol type="i">
                            <li>Emphasis is laid on the classical subjects. These are subjects valuable in their own right and any educated person was expected to have had exposure to them.</li>
                            <li>Emphasis is laid on the desire to make children literate and moral to enable them earn a living as well as find a useful place in society.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <h5>Principles of Perennialists</h5>
                        <ol type="i">
                            <li>Human nature remains the same</li>
                            <li>Man's highest attribute is rationality</li>
                            <li>Students should be taught certain basic subjects</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>To the essentialists subject matter should be taught for use. They maintain that there are certain essentials that each student in school ought to know. The essentialists devote their time to:</p>
                        <ol type="i">
                            <li>Re-examining curricula matters</li>
                            <li>Distinguishing the essential and the non-essentials in school programmes</li>
                            <li>Re-establishing the authority of the teacher in the classroom</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>To the essentialists and perennialists agree on certain fundamental principles such as:</p>
                        <ol type="i">
                            <li>Learning involves hard work often couple with unwilling application.</li>
                            <li>The teacher's role is to mediate between the adult world and the world of the child.</li>
                            <li>The heart of the educational process is the assimilation of prescribed subject matter.</li>
                            <li>The school should retain traditional methods of mental discipline.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">2. The Progressivists</h4>
                        <p>In the late nineteeth and early twentieth centuries. Progressivism also known as pragmatism, swept through the educational structure of America challenging the time honoured doctrines of essentialism. This movement was led by Joh Dewey, Willian H. Kippatrick, Hohn Childs, George S. Counts (faculty Mmebers at Teachers Collee, Columbia University). Boyd Bodode the progressivist maintained that it was time to subordinate subject matter to the learner. Borrowing from time European philosophers like Rousseau who advocated rearing a child in a relaxed environment without forcing learning, the progressivists created the child- centered school. John Dewey formulated progressive beliefs in a series of publications that included among other Democracy and Education, Experiences and Education. How we think and my pedagogic creed progressivists captured the attention of educators when they insisted that the needs and interests of learners bring their bodies; needs and interests or learners bring their bodies, emotions and spirits to school with their minds.</p>
                        <p>Progressivists view education not as a product to be learned (E.g. facts, and motor skills) but as a process that continues as long as one lives. To their way of thinking a child learns best when actively absorbing presented content. If experiences in school are designed to meet the needs and interests of individual learners, it follows that no single pattern of subject matter can be appropriate to all learners.</p>
                        <p>At the heart of progressivism thinking is an abiding faith in democracy. Hence the progressivists see little place of authoritariam practices in the classroom and the school pupils and facilitators of learning rather than expounders of the subject matter. Cooperation is fostered in the classroom rather than competition. Individual growth in relationship to one's ability is considered more important than growth in comparison to others.</p>
                        <p>They believed that subject matter is a medium for teaching life processes and skills. They take the pragmatist view that change, is the essence of reality. Educators must be ready to modify methods and policies in light of new knowledge and changes in the environment To progressivists, a good school is not a place of compulsory instruction but a community of old and young engaged in learning by co-operative experience.</p>
                        <h5>Progressivists' principles</h5>
                        <ol type="i">
                            <li>Education should be life itself not a preparation for living</li>
                            <li>Learning should be directly related to the interests of the child</li>
                            <li>Learning through problem solving should take precedence over the inculcating of subject matter</li>
                            <li>Teachers have to advise not direct pupils</li>
                            <li>The school should encourage co-operation as opposed to competition</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Philosophical positions</h4>
                        <p>The three prominent philosophical positions that are closely related to perenialism and progressivism are Idealism, Realism and Pragmatism.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">3. Idealism</h4>
                        <p>In considering the influence of philosophy though on curriculum, several classification schemes are possible. The cluster of ideas as organized in idealism are those that often evolve during curriculum development. Plato is the father of idealist/philosophy.</p>
                        <p>Idealism emphasizes moral and spiritual development reality as the drier explanation of the world. Truth and values are seen as absolute, timeless and universal. The world of mind and ideas is permanent, regular and orderly, it represents a perfect order. The idealist educator prefers the order and pattern or subject matter curriculum that relates ideas and concepts to each other. It is largely a traditionalist view which is a carry over from Plato's writings Idealism uses deductive reasoning in its quest for answers to current day problems. They believe in the independence of truth from the individual or the society. There is over emphasis on the intellectual aspects. Idealism stresses the role of education in the transmission of the cultural heritage as handed through the ages from the past. Hence it is a preserving function. It allows the concurrent study of liberal and vocational education, as a means to living completely through understanding life.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">3. Realism</h4>
                        <p>Aristotle of often linked to the development of realism, which is another school of thought in philosophical foundation of curriculum. The realism views the world in terms of objects and matter. People came to know the world through their serieses and reason. Everything is derived from nature and is subject to its laws. When behavior is relational, it conforms to the laws of nature and is governed by physical and social laws.</p>
                        <p>Like the idealist, the realist stresses a curriculum consisting or organized, separate subject matter, content and knowledge that classifies objectives. The realist locates the most general and obstract subjects at the top of the curriculum literally and gives particular and transitory subjects a lower order of priority.</p>
                        <p>They believe that the main aim of education is the disciplining of the mind, the development of the ability of reason and pursuit of truth. Therefore, curriculum should emphasize grammar, rhetoric, logic, classical and modern languages, mathematics and the great books of the truth, which is the same today as it was then and always, shall be. These thinkers add to the curriculum the study of the Bible and Theological writings.</p>
                        <p>The realist believes in the existence of a real world, divorced from the imaginations of the perceiver. To the realist, the real world is the physical world of the physical matter of man and has a specific role to play in daily routine and actions. Here, the problems of man in life are approached through the inductive method by which data is gathered to form a basis for new principles and generalizations. Realism accepts God as the motive cause of all existence. Realism argues that education should induct learners into their culture and help them to adjust to the natural order of things in order to live in harmony with the universe. Teachers act as guides: making children aware of the true nature of real world. Realists advocate a study of physical and social sciences which are instrumental to explaining natural phenomena.Mathematics is also encouraged.</p>
                        <p>The realism views the world in terms of objects and matter. People come to know the world through their senses and reason. Everything is derived from nature and is subject to its laws. When behavior is relational, it conforms to the laws of nature and is governed by physical and social laws. Advocates of realism include John Amos Comenius, John Locke and John Herbart.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">4. Pragmatism</h4>
                        <p>This philosophy is sometimes referred as experimentalism, which is based on change process and relativity while idealism and realism philosophies emphasize subject matter, disciplines and content or ideas, pragmatism construes knowledge as progress in which reality is constantly changing. Learning goes on as the student engages variety of subjects and environment and are constantly changing. To a pragmatism nothing can be viewed intelligently except in relation to a pattern. It is a progressivist position that sees reality as being in a state of flux or constant change. Pragmatists employ the realist approach in gathering information and facts, and idealist approach in generalizing about the facts gathered.</p>
                        <p>Pragmatism seeks meaning in the immediate situation according to pragmatists education</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Should enable the learner to experience situations in practice</li>
                            <li>Is a means for recreating, controlling and redirecting, experience.</li>
                            <li>Should help learners to solve their problems and is to be considered an integral part of life. Systematic sequencing of learning experiences is emphasized by pragmatists.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Teachers should provide an atmosphere in which learners identify the problems and seek solutions to them. Teachers should also arrange an environment that provides experience for learners. The curriculum should be organized on the basis of the learners' interests and the subject matter selected should help the learner to solve problems.</p>
                        <p>Sometimes referred as experimentalism, which is based on change process and relativity while idealism and realism philosophies emphasize subject matter, disciplines and content or ideas, pragmatism construes knowledge as progress in which reality is constantly changing. Learning goes on as the student engages in problem solving. The idea of problem solving, is however transferable to a wide variety of subjects and situations, knowing is considered a transaction between the student and environment and are constantly changing.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">6. Reconstruction</h4>
                        <p>Reconstructionism is a philosophical school of thought that broke off from the progressive movement because of unresolved problems of democracy when they wanted to rebuild the social order. They see education as a powerful instrument for effecting planned social changes in given society. It is most likely to be favored in times of economic, political and technological turbulence such as has been experienced recently by the newly independent countries of Africa. They believe that new education can make new and better men and women therefore the school should transmit cultural heritage. Also the school is seen as an agent of solving political and social problems.</p>
                        <p>These schools of thought can be regrouped into two big schools.</p>
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li>Progressivism (Reconstructionism)</li>
                            <li>Traditionalism (Perennialism and Essentialism)</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>However, progressivists and traditionalists disagress on many points concerning subject matter which is to be included in the curriculum, such as;</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Which knowledge is most worthy?</li>
                            <li>Should we emphasize process or information?</li>
                            <li>Should a curriculum be fixed or flexible, constant or differentiated, practical or liberal?</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>To a large extent one's answers to these questions depends upon one's system of values.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">7. Essentialism</h4>
                        <p>Historically, essentialism and progressivism have succeeded in commanding education in the western world. But essentialism is the more powerful than the progressivism. It was only in the early 1950s specifically 1957 the year of sputnik that the progressivism emerged for a short time as the victor among the world philosophies of education. This did not last long. During the 1970s upto now, essentialism has proven that it was not the looser but the leader.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">2.2.2 THE INFLUENCE OF PSYCHOLOGY TO CURRICULUM: FOUR MAJOR FOUNDATIONS</h3>
                        <p>The curriculum is influenced by psychology. Psychology provides information about the teaching and learning process. It also seeks answers as to how a curriculum will be organized to achieve students' learning at the optimum level and what amount of information they can absorb in learning the various contents of the curriculum.</p>
                        <p>These are insights gained from psychology which have a bearing on the learning process. Psychologists believe that learning experiences have to be introduced to the learner when such exposure is most effective and most beneficial to him.</p>
                        <p>The following issues should be taken into account when dealing with learning experiences in the curriculum.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Capability of the learner</li>
                            <li>Maturational level of the learner</li>
                            <li>Students' rate of learning as well as how they learn</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Psychology as a discipline helps the curriculum designer and the teacher to reach decisions in relation to:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Sequence - in the stages of development</li>
                            <li>Organization - grouping of learning experiences for optimal effect.</li>
                            <li>Methodology - dealing with the question of what methods and approaches are likely to promote and guiding learning most effectively.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Psychology also contributes to:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Formulation of appropriate educational goals</li>
                            <li>Decisions regarding the scope of curriculum</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The following are some psychological theories in learning that served as major foundations of curriculum development:</p>

                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>BEHAVIORISM</strong><br>Education in the 20th century was dominated by behaviorism. The mastery of the subject matter is given more emphasis. So, learning is organized in a step-by-step process. The use of drills and repetition are common. For this reason, many educational psychologists viewed it as mechanical and routine. Though many are skeptical about this theory, we can't deny the influences it had on our educational system.</li>
                            <li><strong>COGNITIVISM</strong><br>Cognitive theorists focus on how individuals process information, monitor and manage their thinking. The basic questions that cognitive psychologists zero in on are:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>How do learners process and store information?</li>
                                    <li>How do they retrieve data and generate conclusions?</li>
                                    <li>How much information can they absorb?</li>
                                </ul>
                                With their beliefs, they promote the development of problem-solving and thinking skills and popularize reflective thinking, creative thinking, intuitive thinking, discovery learning, and others.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>HUMANISM</strong><br>Humanism is taken from Gestalt's theory, Abraham Maslow's theory, and Carl Rogers' theory. This group of psychologists is concerned with the development of human potential. In this theory, the curriculum is after the process, not the product; focuses on personal needs, not on the subject matter; and clarifying psychological meanings and environmental situations. In short, curriculum views founded on humanism posits that learners are human beings who are affected by their biology, culture, and environment. They are neither machines nor animals. Along this line, curriculum developers must craft a more advanced, more comprehensive curriculum that promotes human potential. Teachers don't only educate the minds, but the hearts as well.</li>
                            <li><strong>SOCIOLOGY AND CURRICULUM</strong><br>Among the major foundations of curriculum development, the sociological theory emphasizes the influence of society to education. It is founded on the belief that there is a mutual and encompassing relationship between society and curriculum because it exists within the societal context. Though schools are formal institutions that educate the people, other units of society educate or influence the way people think, such as families and friends, and communities. Since society is dynamic, many developments are difficult to cope with and adjust to. But the schools are made to address and understand the changes not only in one's country but in the world as well.</li>
