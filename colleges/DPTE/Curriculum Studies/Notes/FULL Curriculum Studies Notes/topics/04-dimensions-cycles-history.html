                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">4.1.2 What is education?</h4>
                        <p>Education is a gradual process which brings positive changes in human life and behavior. We can also define education as "a process of acquiring knowledge through study or imparting the knowledge by way of instructions or some other practical procedure".</p>
                        <p>Education brings a natural and lasting change in an individual's reasoning and ability to achieve the targeted goal. It facilitates us to investigate our own considerations and thoughts and makes it ready to express it in various shapes.</p>
                        <p>Education is the main thing that encourages us to distinguish between right and wrong because in the absence of education, we can't do what we need or we can't achieve our goal.</p>
                        <p>Straightforwardly, we can say, "education is the passage to progress". It is additionally the way to our fate as achievements can only be accomplished when individuals have information, aptitudes, and frame of mind. In this way, education resembles a medium through which we can associate with various individuals and offer our thoughts.</p>
                        <p>To tackle issues and do inventiveness we first need to gain proficiency with some essential abilities. We require learning and abilities to wind up increasingly imaginative. So education is fundamentally learning of abilities and ideas that can make us increasingly innovative and issue solver. Education is to pick up the capacity to develop and take care of issues in order to achieve their lawful motives.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">4.1.3 Dimensions of curriculum</h4>
                        <p>Education goes beyond what takes places within the four walls of the classroom. A child gets the education from his experiences outside the school as well as from those within on the basis of these factors. There are three main types of curriculum, namely, Formal, Informal and Non-formal. Each of these types is discussed below.</p>
                        
                        <h5>1. Formal curriculum</h5>
                        <p>Formal education or formal learning usually takes place in the premises of the school, where a person may learn basic, academic, or trade skills. Small children often attend a nursery or kindergarten but often formal education begins in elementary school and continues with secondary school.</p>
                        <p>Post-secondary education (or higher education) is usually at a college or university which may grant an academic degree. It is associated with a specific or stage and is provided under a certain set of rules and regulations.</p>
                        <p>The formal education is given by specially qualified teachers they are supposed to be efficient in the art of instruction. It also observes strict discipline. The student and the teacher both are aware of the facts and engage themselves in the process of education.</p>

Informal education is when you are not studying in a school and do not use any particular learning method. In this type of education, conscious efforts are not involved. It is neither pre-planned nor deliberate. It may be learned at some marketplace, hotel or at home.</p>
                        <p>Unlike formal education, informal education is not imparted by an institution such as school or college. Informal education is not given according to any fixed timetable. There is no set curriculum required. Informal education consists of experiences and actually living in the family or community.</p>

                        <p>Non-formal education equivalency preparation includes adult basic education, adult literacy education or school. In nonformal education, someone (who is not in school) can learn literacy, other basic skills or job skills.</p>
                        <p>Home education, individualized instruction (such as programmed learning), distance learning and computerassisted instruction are other possibilities.</p>
                        <p>Non-formal education is imparted consciously and deliberately and systematically implemented. It should be organized for a homogeneous group. Non-formal, education should be programmed to serve the needs of the identified group. This will necessitate flexibility in the design of the curriculum and the scheme of evaluation.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">(a) The 7-4-2-3 Education System</h4>
                        <p>Introduction of 7-4-2-3 System of Education. According to Ominde (1964), the chairman of the first educational commission in the independent Kenya, "during colonial era, there was no such thing as a nation" only several nations living side by side in the same territory. Education, like society, was stratified along racial lines, there existed an 'African education', a 'European Education', and an 'Asian Education'; three separate systems divided by rigid boundaries (Ominde 1964). This stratification was based on the colonialist's assertion that the mental development of the average African adult was equivalent to that of the average 7-8 year old European boy (Gachathi, 1976).</p>
                        <p>African education' therefore tended to be a hybrid, precariously hovering between a European model with a European subject matter, and an education deemed suitable to the place in colonial life considered 'appropriate' to the African population (Ominde 1964).</p>
                        <p>Thus the eve of independence brought with it sweeping reforms in the educational system. With the creation of a single nation came the emergence of a single educational system, no longer stratified along racial lines. Ominde Commission was formed to introduce changes that would reflect the nation's sovereignty. The commission focused on identity and unity, which were critical issues at the time. Changes in the subject content of history and geography were made to reflect national cohesion. Between 1964 and 1985, the 7-4-2-3-system was adopted, seven years of primary, four years of lower secondary (form 1-4), two years of upper secondary (form 5-6), and three years of university. This does not include the 'pre-primary' schooling provided to children under the age of six. The principle preoccupation for Ominde's report was introduce an education system that promoted national unity and inculcated in the learners the desire to serve their nation (Simuyu, 2001).</p>

                        <p>7-4-2-3 system of education lacked the capacity and flexibility to respond to the changing aspirations of individual Kenyans and the labour market needs, in terms of new skills, new technologies and the attitude to work (Owino, 1997).</p>
                        <p>According to Simuyu (2001), the 7-4-2-3 policy was criticized in two major areas (2001):</p>
                        <ol type="i">
                            <li>The policy was being too academic and therefore not suitable for direct employment. Thus the policy lacked orientation to employment.</li>
                            <li>The policy encouraged elitist and individualistic attitudes among school leavers, something that was considered incompatible to the African socialist milieu.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>The Gachathi Report (GoK, 1976, p 33-34) raised the issue of unemployment in relation to 7-4-2-3 policy: The report maintained that "One of the largest problems confronting the country is that of unemployment. The problem is aggravated by the annual outputs of school leavers whose number continue to swell following the enormous expansion of the education. Among those who made calls for change of educational policy were, the Kenya National Assembly's Select Committee on unemployment (1970) as cited in Maleche (1976, p.13) Therefore, education, which was regarded by Kenyans as a medium for social mobility and national economic development failed to deliver as the number of unemployed school leavers continued to grow system in the first years of independence. ILO also called for a change to the education system in order to help reduce unemployment. The change consisted of increasing the technical and vocational aspects of the curriculum. The move by ILO towards vocationalising the education system won support from the World Bank.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">(b) 8-4-4 Education System</h4>
                        <p>The 8-4-4 system of education was introduced in January 1985, following the Mackay report of 1982. King and McGrath (2002) claims that the 8-4-4 policy arose out of the concerns that a basic academic education might lack the necessary content to promote widespread sustainable (self) employment". Therefore the 8-4-4 policy emanated from the assumption that it would equip pupils with employable skills thereby enabling school dropouts at all levels to be either self-employed or secure employment in the informal sector. King &McGrath, 2002 observes that the new policy would orient youths towards self-employment. The system strongly emphasizes attitudinal and skills preparations for the world of work and especially self-employment. According to Sifuna (1990), there are three events that led to implementation of the 8-4-4 system: the 1966 conference on education at Kericho in Kenya, which stressed the need for integrating rural development; the International Labor Organization mission report entitled "Employment, Incomes and Equality: A Strategy for Increasing Productive Employment of 1972;" and the recommendation of the National Committee on Educational Objectives and Policies of 1975.</p>
                        <p>In 1979 the Ministry of Education was changed to the Ministry of Basic Education with an introductory nine-year basic education system program. The rationale was that the previous program was too short and not rigorous enough to give graduates enough practical education. It also recommended that the first six years of primary were to concentrate on numeric and literacy skills and the last two years on basic education with practical orientation. This represented a shift from a focus on enrollment to restructuring the program as a means to cater to the influx of unemployed.</p>
                        
                        <h5>(c) The structure of 8-4-4 System</h5>
                        <p>The 8-4-4 System is divided into primary, secondary and university excluding the pre-school years. This sections gives a brief description of the structure.</p>
                        <h6>a) Primary Education</h6>
                        <p>It starts at age of six years and consists of eight years of schooling, out of which first three may be in the mother tongue, while English is invariably the language of instruction from standards 4 to 8. Most schools are public and run on the basis of harambee system, but the number of private schools, though small as yet, is rising very fast. Most schools are co-ed though a few only-girls schools also exist. The primary education ends with an exam for Kenya Certificate of primary education. Enrolment levels in primary education are reasonable by third world standards - partly a result of the making it free.</p>
                        <h6>b) Secondary School</h6>
                        <p>Secondary school consists of four years. Majority of secondary schools are run on the Harambee system. About one fourth are Government schools, but only the most meritorious are able to enter them. The private schools charge high fees and many offer British O-levels, followed by A-levels or the International Baccalaureate. The enrolment in secondary school is far less compared to the primary school, as it is not free, though some plans to do that are being prepared.</p>
                        <h6>c) University and College Education</h6>
                        <p>Since the establishment of University of Nairobi in 1970, the first public University in Kenya, seven more general public Universities and a number private Universities have been introduced, most of them run by religious organizations.</p>

                        <h5>Debate over 8-4-4 System</h5>
                        <p>However, although the 8-4-4 policy has been described a major educational reform in the history of Kenya's education system since independence in 1963, there are views that it is a great devastation. The 8-4-4 system has been the subject of national debate since its inception. It has been criticized for being broad, expensive and burdensome to pupils and parents".</p>
                        <p>Since its inception, 8-4-4 system was changed to be more accommodative. Several commission have been formed with the view of improving the system: The Wanjigi Report (GoK, 1983); The Kamunge Report (GoK, 1985), The Mungai Report (GoK, 1995); The Ndegwa Report (GoK, 1991) and The Koech Report (GoK, 1999). The Kamunge Report (GoK, 1985) on Education and training which recommended the reduction of examination subjects under the 8-4-4, was implemented in secondary schools but ignored at the primary schools level; The president (Moi) rejected the Koech Report.</p>
                        <p>Those commissions' reports, that were implemented, made profound contributions to certain aspects of the education system in Kenya, for instance, the Gachathi and Mackay Reports contributed to the change of education policy from 7-4-2-3 to 8-4-4. The Gathachi report noted with great concern the rising rate of unemployment among school leavers and recommended the restructuring of the education system curriculum in order to have more streams of science, mathematics and, technical and vocational subjects (Republic of Kenya, 1976). The Mackay Report influenced the extension of primary education from seven to eight years and thus influenced the restructuring of the education system from 7-4-2-3 to 8-4-4 and hence the introduction of technical and vocational i.e. practical subjects in primary schools. They both commission reports emphasized the integration of technical and vocational education in the entire Kenyan educational system right from primary to tertiary levels (Simiyu, 2001).</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">(d) 2-6-3-3-3 SYSTEM OF EDUCATION</h4>
                        <p>The new curriculum has been touted as the ultimate remedy to limitations identified in the 8-4-4 system because it is entirely skills-based.</p>
                        <p>It was piloted this year between May and September across 470 schools - 10 in each county. Learners will not sit exams but they will be evaluated through Continuous Assessment Tests (CATs) on the skills acquired as opposed to cramming for exams as has been the case.</p>
                        <p>Experts are of the view that it will enable learners to develop beyond academics and also focus on how best they can use their specific talents to make a living. The needs of special needs children have also been incorporated in the curriculum which will integrate ICT at all levels of education.</p>
                        <p>The 2-6-3-3-3 model places emphasis on formative years of learning where learners will spend a total of eight years - 2 in pre-primary and six in primary. Subjects to be taught in lower primary are Kiswahili, English, literacy, and mother tongue as well as science, social studies and agricultural activities. Upper primary will include Kiswahili, English, Mathematics, Home Science, Agriculture, Science and Technology, Creative Arts (art, craft and music), Moral and Life Skills and Physical and Health Education. Others are social studies (citizenship, geography and history) with an option of a foreign language (French, German, Chinese and Arabic).</p>
                        <p>Junior Secondary (grades 7, 8 and 9) and Senior Secondary Education (grades 10,11 and 12) will each take three years.</p>
                        <p>Twelve core subjects will be taught at junior secondary - Mathematics, Kiswahili, English, life skills, health education, social studies, integrated science, business studies, religious education, agriculture, life skills, sports and physical education.)</p>
                        <p>Learners at this level will also be required to take a minimum of one and a maximum of two optional subjects that suit their career choices, personalities, abilities and interests.</p>
                        <p>Home science, foreign languages, Kenyan sign language, indigenous languages, visual arts, performing arts, Arabic and computer science will be optional at junior secondary.</p>
                        <p>Learners at senior secondary (ages 15-17) will focus on three areas of specialization depending on their skills, talents and interests.</p>
                        <p>These are arts and sports science, social sciences and Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM). Graduates from this level will have the option to join vocational training centres or pursue university education for three years.</p>
