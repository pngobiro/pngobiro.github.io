                        <p>It combines classroom learning and community service, giving students the opportunity to work with community members to solve local problems. This integration of theory and practice enables learners to experience, reflect, and learn from the projects they undertake. CSL creates rich learning experiences, and delivers benefits to the community. At a personal level, global research shows it develops learners' personal values, critical thinking, problem-solving, imagination and creativity.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Project Based Learning in CSL</h4>
                        <p>Project Based Learning is a research-backed pedagogical approach where learners solve real-world problems through planning and executing a project in partnership with the community and under the supervision of the teacher.</p>

                        <p>Community service is unpaid work performed by a person or group of people for the benefit and betterment of their community without any form of compensation. Community service can be distinct from volunteering, since it is not always performed on a voluntary basis and may be compulsory While community service learning combines classroom learning and community service, giving students the opportunity to work with community members to solve local problems. Community service learning is intended to equip learners with skills to enable them use their talents to turn around problems into solutions.</p>

                        <ol>
                            <li>CSL was a timely idea whose conceptualisation had deviated from past practices where education had concentrated on theory and not practical learning. it exposed the learners to more practical learning to translate what is in their minds into hands-on skills.</li>
                            <li>That CSL is a positive reinforcement in the curriculum. It does not only focus on knowledge capture but also gives students relevant skills.</li>
                            <li>It add value to the students as the practical component led to opportunities for development of talents.</li>
                            <li>That CSL had impacted on learners' motivational levels because it encourages them to take personal initiatives and plan to make the environment better.</li>
                            <li>Is a good program for the learners who are not very endowed in academic performance. It offers them a chance to acquire and diversify skills and talents.</li>
                            <li>CSL equips learners with knowledge and skills that will enable them to solve problems in the community.</li>
                            <li>That CSL is interesting and learner-centred and is the only hands-on subject that enables learners to apply what they have learnt in solving problems facing their communities</li>
                            <li>CSL helps learners to love their own school and become more responsible and self-driven</li>
                            <li>That recycling of waste products had been enhanced.</li>

                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Academic Credit Is for Learning, Not for Service</strong><br>Academic credit is not awarded for doing service or for the quality of the service, but rather for the student's demonstration of academic and civic learning.</li>
                            <li><strong>Establish Learning Objectives</strong><br>It is a service-learning maxim that one cannot develop a quality service-learning course without first setting very explicit learning objectives. This principle is foundational to service-learning.</li>
                            <li><strong>Establish Criteria for the Selection of Service Placements</strong><br>Requiring students to serve in any community-based organization as part of a service-learning course is tantamount to requiring students to read any book as part of a traditional course.</li>
                            <li><strong>Provide Educationally-Sound Learning Strategies To Harvest Community Learning and Realize Course Learning Objectives</strong><br>Requiring service-learning students to merely record their service activities and hours, as their journal assignment is tantamount to requiring students in engineering to log their activities and hours in the lab.</li>
                            <li><strong>Prepare Students for Learning from the Community</strong><br>Most students lack experience with both extracting and making meaning from experience and in merging it with other academic and civic course learning strategies. Therefore, even an exemplary reflection journal assignment will yield, without sufficient support, uneven responses.</li>
                            <li><strong>Minimize the Distinction between the Students' Community Learning Role and Classroom Learning Role</strong><br>Classrooms and communities are very different learning contexts. Each requires students to assume a different learner role. The solution is to shape the learning environments so that students assume similar learning roles in both contexts.</li>
                            <li><strong>Rethink the Faculty Instructional Role</strong><br>If faculty encourage students' active learning in the classroom, what would be a commitment and consistent change in one's teaching role? Commensurate with the proceeding principle's recommendation for an active student learning posture, this principle advocates that service-learning teachers, too, rethink their role.</li>
                            <li><strong>Maximize the Community Responsibility Orientation of the Course</strong><br>One of the necessary conditions of a service-learning course is purposeful civic learning. Designing classroom norms and learning strategies that not only enhance academic learning but also encourage civic learning are essential to purposeful academic learning.</li>

                        <p>Community engagement: 6 tips to engage your community Community engagement depends on the benefits for the members constituting it. Here are some techniques to start community engagement and more important, to keep it going.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Get people to tell stories.</strong><br>People love to share themselves with others. If you become a conduit for this type of communication between people, you will capture the emotions of your audience like no other. You get bonus points if you provide a large audience for the true performers in your ranks.</li>
                            <li><strong>Use images.</strong><br>Images are better able to convey emotion. Make sure that the images that you publish have as much emotional impact as you can put into them.</li>
                            <li><strong>Be a responsive community engagement leader.</strong><br>Make sure that you respond to the people that take the time to respond to you. There is nothing more emotionally satisfying than receiving encouragement and understanding from a leader of a social circle.</li>
                            <li><strong>Make sure that your contributions stay grounded</strong><br>It is easy to become irrelevant once your network begins to grow a little. You may start to think that you must cater to a wider spectrum by glossing up your image. What ends up happening is that you try too hard and people begin to see through you.</li>
                            <li><strong>Community engagement starts with understanding and adding value.</strong><br>If you always come from the mindset of making someone else's day better, you will get great emotional responses from your audience. No matter if your posts are entertaining in nature or serious in scope, if they are relevant and precise, you will always get a great response.</li>
                            <li><strong>Fall back on entertainment and education.</strong><br>If you cannot find something with the appropriate gravitas for the day, you can always fall back on entertaining and educational content. It is sometimes good to break up the monotony with a light-hearted story that everyone can get into.</li>

                            <li><strong>Financial Literacy:</strong> Financial literacy helps learners raise funds and invest funds in learners' business projects. Learners will be able to join or start community groups (such as savings SACCOs), understanding methods of saving, and saving goals.</li>
                            <li><strong>Research:</strong> This enables learners to start practicing research skills while still at a young age. Learners will be able to analyse information, identify the root cause of issues, identify effective solutions, report on their findings and make recommendations.</li>
