                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">CURRICULUM FRAMEWORK IN JAPAN.</h4>
                        <p><strong>What is the purpose of education in Japan?</strong><br>The goals of compulsory education are to enhance students' individual abilities and develop a basis for their social independence and basic abilities as citizens of the nation.</p>
                        <p><strong>Curriculum Outline</strong><br>The Japanese school system primarily consists of six-year elementary schools, three-year junior high schools and three-year high schools, followed by a two-or-three-year junior colleges or a four-year colleges. Compulsory education lasts for 9 years through elementary and junior high school. School exchanges during Japan Educational Travel are mainly implemented in junior high and high schools. For physically or mentally challenged students, there is a system called "Special Needs Education" to support special students to develop their self-reliance and thus enhance their social participation.</p>
                        <p><strong>School Timetable.</strong><br>Public schools in Japan have classes five days a week, from Monday to Friday. There are also schools that have classes on Saturday. In junior high and high schools, there are six class periods each day, typically lasting 50 minutes for each. After classes, students clean the classrooms in shifts and then start their club activities. There are a variety of clubs such as cultural and sports ones.</p>
                        <p><strong>Academic Calendar.</strong><br>In principle, the school year begins in April and ends in March of the following year. Most schools adopt a three-semester system, with the first semester from April to August, the second semester from September to December, and the third semester from January to March. There is also a summer break (from the end of July to the end of August), a winter break (from the end of December to the beginning of January), and a spring break (from the end of March to the beginning of April).</p>
                        <p><strong>School Organization.</strong><br>Each school has a principal, a vice principal, teachers, a school nurse and other administration staff. As the chief executive, the principal assumes all responsibilities of the school including the courses provided and related administrative work. The vice principal supports the principal to manage administrative affairs of the school and to be in charge of student's educational activities and curriculum as well. Furthermore, in order to ensure school's smooth operation, teachers take on various responsibilities, such as taking care of educational activities, students'school life and employment guidance for students after graduation. Many schools also establish their own committees, for example a International Exchange Promotion Committee, and others.</p>
                        <p><strong>Regarding the Level of Education.</strong><br>The level of Japanese education is high even by world standards particularly in science related areas.</p>
                        <p><strong>Foreign Language Education.</strong><br>English is a compulsory subject in junior high and high schools. There are also elementary schools that introduce English education from intermediate grade classes. In some high schools, apart from English, students are also allowed to take courses in Chinese, Korean, French, German, etc.</p>
                        <p><strong>Student Clubs.</strong><br>Student clubs are a characteristic part in Japan's school education. Under teachers' guidance, students with the same interests in sports, cultural activities, or fields of study voluntarily gather together after classes and on days off. There are also numerous student clubs revolving around Japanese traditional sports and culture. Club activities provide students with the chance to participate in school exchange and friendly matches. Japan's primary school curriculum is divided into three main categories: compulsory subjects, moral education, and special activities. Compulsory subjects are Japanese language, Japanese literature, mathematics, social studies, science, music, arts and handicrafts, and physical education. Reading and writing are perhaps the most important parts of the elementary school curriculum.</p>
                        <p><strong>What makes Japanese education system special?</strong><br>The Japanese education system believes that requiring students to clean up after themselves teaches them to work in a team and help each other. Besides, spending their own time and effort sweeping, mopping, and wiping makes kids respect their own work and the work of others.</p>
                        <p><strong>Why Japan has the best education system?</strong><br>Children are taught to respect other people and to be gentle to animals and nature. They also learn how to be generous, compassionate and empathetic. Besides this, pupils are taught qualities like grit, self-control and justice. Education is one of the most important aspects of Japan's national identity and a source of pride for Japanese citizens. Japan ranks highly among wealthy nations in providing equal opportunities to students of all socioeconomic backgrounds.</p>
                        <p>Japan's primary school curriculum is divided into three main categories: compulsory subjects, moral education and special activities.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">CURRICULUM FRAMEWORK OF SINGAPORE</h4>
                        <p><strong>Overview.</strong><br>At the end of World War II, Singapore implemented the first in a succession of economic development strategies rooted in improved education and training. Singapore is an extraordinary success story. Since becoming an independent republic in 1965, it has transformed from an impoverished island with no natural resources and a mostly illiterate population to a country of 5.8 million people whose living standards match those of the most highly-developed industrial nations. From the very beginning, Lee Kuan Yew, the prime minister who led Singapore to this achievement, understood that an educated workforce would be essential to fulfilling his ambitious economic goals. Since the 1990s, the nation has focused on boosting creativity and capacity for innovation in its students. In 2004, the government developed the "Teach Less, Learn More" initiative, which moved instruction further away from its early focus on rote memorization and repetitive tasks and toward deeper conceptual understanding and problem-based learning. Educators abandoned the practice of funneling students into ability-based tracks and began sorting them into three different "bands" in secondary school based on their ultimate educational goal. Although students take most of their classes within their bands, they can take classes in other bands depending on their aptitude and interest in a given subject. The goal is to achieve full subjectbased banding, with students freely mixing and matching classes from different bands, by 2024. Singapore's current priorities for its education system are reflected in the title of its initiative "Every School a Good School." This set of reforms aims to ensure that all schools have adequate resources to develop customized programs for their students; raise professional standards for teachers; encourage innovation; and foster partnerships between schools and communities. In addition, Singapore launched the "Learn for Life" initiative in 2018 to promote greater flexibility in teaching, learning and assessment. With more opportunities for self-directed learning in and out of school, Singapore hopes to encourage lifelong learning for all Singaporeans, in ways that bring them satisfaction and meaning.</p>
                        <p><strong>Governance Structure</strong><br>Singapore's education system is highly centralized. The Ministry of Education oversees kindergarten (ages four to five) through higher education and lifelong learning. The Ministry allocates funding for all schools, sets course syllabi and national examinations, oversees teacher credentialing, manages the teacher and principal evaluation and promotion system, and hires and assigns principals and teachers to schools. Schools are grouped into geographic clusters, each overseen by a superintendent, to provide local support for the Ministry's policies and initiatives. The cluster superintendents, who are successful former principals, collaborate with principals in their cluster on how to implement the curriculum and which teaching materials to choose from among a set the Ministry approves and strongly encourages teachers to use. The cluster superintendents also facilitate the sharing of resources and best practices between cluster schools. While the Ministry sets the framework for the educational system, other entities operate within that framework. Independent or semi-autonomous agencies such as the National Institute of Education (teacher training), the Examinations and Assessment Board (national assessments), and the Institute of Technical Education (vocational education) have clearly defined areas of responsibility and work closely with the Ministry.</p>
                        <p><strong>Planning and Goals.</strong><br>Singapore articulates clear and comprehensive system-wide goals for education. These goals, which the nation revisits regularly, emerge from widespread discussion with partners in the system and with the public, as well as from extensive benchmarking of other leading education systems. Singapore structures policy initiatives around its education goals and creates benchmarks to measure progress. For example, in 2013, Singapore held a National Conversation to gather input on a vision for the 2030 education system strategic plan. Goals included; improving character and citizenship education, strengthening digital literacy, building more knowledge and understanding of the history and cultures throughout Asia, expanding supports for disadvantaged students and building more adult education opportunities.</p>
                        <p>In addition, Singapore's leaders monitor educational research and benchmark best practices from around the world so that the system can continue to match the performance of the world's best.</p>
                        <p><strong>Education Finance.</strong><br>The Ministry of Education directly funds all schools based on the number of pupils. In addition, all schools receive a set grant (called an Opportunity Fund) to use for their low-income students and students from ethnic minority groups. Although this supplemental funding is distributed by the Ministry, schools can choose how to spend it. The Ministry also provides funding directly to students from low-income families in the form of subsidies called Financial Assistance Schemes for educational materials and activities, and funds for school meals. In addition, the Ministry in 1970 created the Education Fund, which collects contributions from Singapore residents to both support all students and low-income students through scholarships and by providing textbooks, meals and uniforms for students who need these but do not otherwise qualify for financial assistance.</p>
                        <p><strong>School Accountability.</strong><br>Schools in Singapore conduct annual self-evaluations of their practices and outcomes using the Ministrydeveloped School Excellence Model, which includes nine criteria for performance. Schools then develop improvement plans based on the results. Additionally, external inspectors evaluate each school every five years. The external inspectors, made up of university professors and successful school leaders, provide feedback to the schools and offer coaching and support for improvement. Improvement efforts are organized through Singapore's school cluster system. Cluster superintendents meet regularly with principals to monitor their improvement efforts. High-performing schools are eligible for awards. The Ministry annually awards schools that demonstrate outstanding achievement in a single year or over a period of years. The highest award, the School Excellence Award, is given to one school each year.</p>
                        <p><strong>Teacher Accountability.</strong><br>Singapore uses the Enhanced Performance Management System (EPMS) to conduct annual teacher evaluations. EPMS assesses teachers' performance based on 16 different competencies, including their work in the classroom and their interaction with the greater school community. Teachers first conduct a self-appraisal and then supervisors evaluate them against the EPMS. These evaluations are qualitative and consist of written feedback rather than numeric scores of specific indicators. Teachers base their professional development plans on EPMS feedback. Principals, alongside the School Staff Developer (in charge of professional learning) and the Cluster Superintendent, co-construct a "Current Estimated Potential" for each teacher using the results of the EPMS. This estimate, or snapshot of the teacher's short-term career trajectory is shared with the teacher and used to help them articulate their career goals. Teachers can earn rewards based on EPMS results including honors and salary bonuses. The Ministry also selects teachers for awards and recognition at the national level.</p>
                        <p><strong>Supports for School Aged Children.</strong><br>All students in Singapore receive an Edusave account, to which the government contributes funds so that it can invest in their future. Families can draw on these accounts for any type of educational expense; disadvantaged students receive additional funding. The Ministry of Education also provides financial assistance for students from low-income families. The aid supports school fees and other expenses for students in government or government-aided private schools. Financial aid for independent schools is also available. These supports are available in the context of a broader safety net for children. The government's Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) administers ComCare, which provides cash grants to low- and moderate-income families on a sliding scale. It also covers long-term assistance needed for care and school-related expenses for children of disabled parents. The MSF also oversees the National Council of Social Service, an umbrella group of 450 private organizations that provide services to Singapore citizens. Services include school-based social work and support for students at risk of dropping out of school.</p>
                        <p><strong>Learning System</strong></p>
                        <p><strong>Preschool</strong><br>In Singapore, children aged three through six can attend either a public or private kindergarten or a childcare center. But in 2013, the government created the Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA) to coordinate oversight of all early childhood education. ECDA has developed the Nurturing Early Learners Kindergarten Curriculum Framework as suggested guidance for children ages 4 to 6 . The government does not assess learning outcomes for students in kindergarten or childcare; the first nationwide screening of children's literacy and numeracy skills takes place in the first month of primary school.</p>
                        <p><strong>Primary and Secondary Education.</strong><br>In Singapore, the system includes six years of primary school followed by four to six years of secondary school and one to three years of postsecondary school. The curriculum for primary schools is common for all students in years one to four. For years five and six, students can take individual courses at the foundation or standard level. Foundational level courses are designed to provide more support for students. As they enter secondary school, students, their parents and their teachers jointly agree on one of three bands or "streams" they will join: Express, Normal (Academic) and Normal (Technical). All streams offer the same course of study but Express is accelerated and Normal (Technical) offers more applied work. In most cases, students' scores on the Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE) are the primary determinant of the stream they will join but parents and students can advocate for different streams if they demonstrate accelerated learning or need more help. Singapore is piloting and implementing a system under which students choose streams for specific subjects, rather than their overall course of study, a practice known as subject-based banding. Subject-based banding currently exists in all primary schools and the goal is to have full subject-based banding in all secondary schools by 2024.</p>
                        <p>In addition to these options, Singapore has four specialized schools for students who perform poorly on the PSLE. These schools offer foundational coursework in mathematics and literacy, alongside vocational offerings leading to skill certificates and extensive social supports. There are also specialized independent schools that focus on the arts, sports and mathematics and science. These schools receive public funding and use the MOE curriculum but have more flexibility in their program offerings.</p>
                        <p>Students who want to apply to university stay in secondary school for an additional two years to take A-level courses, as part of the Integrated Program. Those who do not do that have multiple postsecondary pursue these options: Polytechnics, the Institute of Technical Education (ITE), Junior Colleges, a Polytechnic Foundation program and a small set of Arts Institutions. Students choose their postsecondary school based on their secondary school stream as well as results from the General Certificate of Education (GCE) examinations. Polytechnics offer three-year diploma programs. Graduates may pursue university education after they earn their Polytechnic diploma without taking A-level exams, if they so choose. ITE offers shorter technical or vocational education programs, through National ITE Certificate (Nitec) aligned courses and work-based learning. Students graduate from ITE with a Nitec or Higher Nitec qualification and can then continue their vocational studies at a polytechnic or at university. They can also stay at ITE and earn a technical or work study diploma, which also allows a pathways to slect university programs. Junior Colleges offer two- or three-year pre-university education, preparing students for the required examinations to enroll in universities or for entry into Polytechnics.</p>
                        <p><strong>Standards and Curriculum</strong><br>The Ministry of Education oversees the development of the national curriculum which includes "Desired Outcomes of Education." The desired outcomes are student excellence in life skills, knowledge skills and subject discipline knowledge organized into eight core skills and values: character development, self-management skills, social and cooperative skills, literacy and numeracy, communication skills, information skills, thinking skills and creativity, and knowledge application skills.</p>
                        <p>The primary school curriculum includes ten subject areas: English, mother tongue language (available for Chinese-, Malay- and Tamil-speaking students), mathematics, science, art, music, physical education, social studies and character and citizenship education. A coding class was added to the curriculum in 2019. And in 2021, the Ministry introduced an updated character and citizenship education curriculum which focuses on mental health and cyber-wellness and on the establishment of peer support structures within every school, among other topics. For primary students who qualify as gifted, Singapore offers individualized enriched curriculum opportunities..</p>
                        <p>Secondary education varies depending on school and program type. Students in the express and Normal (academic program) are required to take English, mother tongue language, mathematics, science, and humanities (geography, history, and English literature). For students in the Normal (Technical) program, compulsory subjects include English, mother tongue language, mathematics, computer applications and social studies. There are electives available for both the Technical and Normal program as well.</p>
                        <p>The Ministry of Education has been very involved with the implementation of its primary and secondary curriculum. During the shift from rote learning to the current model emphasizing student engagement and creativity, Ministry officials were very "hands-on" in schools. They met regularly with school leaders and developed extensive professional learning opportunities for teachers around the new curriculum. However, in recent years, the Ministry has taken a step back, encouraging schools to consider the curriculum as a framework which they should adapt to their students' needs. The Ministry also encourages secondary schools to differentiate themselves through theme courses or special programs designed to attract students with shared interests.</p>
                        <p><strong>Assessment and Qualifications.</strong><br>Teachers perform continuous assessment of their students at all levels of education. On a day-to-day basis, this assessment is informal and based on student work in and out of the classroom. Previously, all students in primary school took school-based exams throughout the year and at the end of each year but in 2019, the government dropped the exams for Primary 1 and 2 and in 2021 dropped the mid-year exams for Primary 3 and 5 as well as Secondary 3. By removing these exams, the government hopes to shift focus away from grades and competition and toward learning for its own sake.</p>
                        <p>At the end of primary school, all students take the Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE) in four subjects: English, math, science, and mother tongue. Students take exams at one of two levels, based on the level of subjects they took in years five and six. In 2021, the Ministry began to update the PSLE scoring process. Going forward, students will be graded based on individual performance in subjects rather than benchmarked against each other. The Ministry also allows some schools to admit students based on their talents in academic areas, sports or co-curricular activities without factoring in PSLE results, to provide greater diversity in student talents and interests. Since 2018, schools have been able to offer up to 20 percent of their places to students through this process, called direct school admission. The Ministry of Education helps place those students who are not accepted into their schools of choice.</p>
                        <p>At the secondary level, student take subject-based exams, depending on their band. After four years of study, students take O-level exams in the express and N-level exams in the Normal (Technical) program. Students in the Normal (Academic) program can take the N-level exams after four years of study or the O-level exams after five years. Students who wish to study at university take A-level exams after an additional two years of study.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Special Education</strong><br>Whenever possible, the government encourages students with special needs to enroll in mainstream schools either initially or after having met certain benchmarks in special education. Currently, about 80 percent of all students with special needs attend mainstream schools. To help facilitate their integration, learning support specialists known as Allied Educators help students with conditions such as dyslexia or autism. As of 2018, there was at least one Allied Educator in every mainstream primary and public school, a 40 percent increase over the previous five years. The Ministry has also provided specialized training in special education to a designated group of general education teachers within each mainstream school, to create a strong support system for students with special needs; about 15 percent of teachers in mainstream schools had completed this training by 2019. In addition, since 2020 the Ministry has provided all teachers in mainstream schools with access to online professional learning focused on supporting students with special needs.</p>
                        <p>In 2019, the Ministry implemented two peer mentoring interventions to support students with special needs in mainstream schools. Circle of Friends allows students with social, emotional or behavioral difficulties to meet with their teacher or Allied Educator along with a group of six to eight of their peers. Over five to eight sessions, the students work together to find solutions for the student in difficulty. Facing Your Fears is a similar program designed to support students suffering from anxiety. In this intervention, groups of two to four students meet with facilitators and Allied Educators to learn self-management strategies over 10 weekly sessions.</p>
                        <p>For students who need more intensive or specialized assistance, Singapore has 19 government-funded special education schools run by 12 social service agencies. These schools serve populations with highly specific needs: the deaf, the blind, students with autism, or those with the most severe cognitive challenges. Special needs education is available through the postsecondary level, where students with intellectual disabilities are prepared for the workforce through special training programs.</p>
                        <p>The Ministry allocates extra funds for special needs students at 150 percent or 300 percent of the base per student cost, depending on whether they attend mainstream or special schools. The Ministry increased spending for special schools by 40 percent from 2015 to 2020 and has pledged to continue this increase. The National Council of Social Services also contributes funding to special schools, specifically for additional social supports.</p>
                        <p><strong>Teacher Recruitment.</strong><br>Only one institution-the National Institute of Education (NIE)-is authorized to prepare teachers, and it offers both a master's degree and a bachelor's degree route into teaching. In this way, Singapore limits its teacher recruitment only to those students qualified for the country's rigorous research universities. Each year, Singapore calculates the number of teachers it will need, and opens only that many spots in the training programs. The selection process is competitive: teaching is a highly-regarded profession in Singapore and students in teachereducation programs receive a stipend during their training. On average, only one out of eight applicants is accepted.</p>
                        <p>Teaching salaries in Singapore are largely commensurate with those of other professions. Indeed, the Ministry of Education monitors teacher salaries in relation to other professional salaries and adjusts them to ensure they remain competitive.</p>
                        <p><strong>Teacher Development.</strong><br>Teachers have access to several types of professional development opportunities. They can improve their practice through courses at NIE or at AST, where offerings range from in-service training to online classes on a variety of subjects related to teaching. Teachers can participate in as many as 100 hours of government-funded professional development per year. The Ministry and NIE also offer scholarship opportunities for teachers seeking master's and doctoral degrees in Singapore or abroad, either full- or part-time.</p>
                        <p>In addition, the career ladders are a key component of Singapore's teacher development strategy. Career ladders ensure that teachers can stay in the profession while taking on new roles and responsibilities and provide the structure for their peer-to-peer mentoring, collaboration, coaching, and development systems. Further, the career ladder guarantees that curriculum development is led by those who know teaching and learning best.</p>
                        <p><strong>Principals Recruitment, Preparation and Development</strong><br>Singapore prioritizes developing skilled principals who can ensure that their schools offer high-quality and equitable learning opportunities. In their third year on the job, in consultation with their principal, teachers can choose the leadership track of Singapore's three-track career ladder. If they continue to demonstrate the right combination of skills and if the role is available to them, they can advance to department head and vice principal.</p>
                        <p>In this way, all principals start out as teachers and then serve in two administrative roles before advancing to school leadership. Department heads and vice principals usually participate in the Management and Leadership in Schools Program run by the NIE, which aims to proactively prepare them for the next stage of the leadership track. Vice principals on the verge of being promoted to principal must participate in a two-day simulation test and interview process during which they respond to real-world scenarios.</p>
                        <p>Singapore also supports its principals through an international school leader exchange program, Building Educational Bridges, which focuses on building leaders' capacity to innovate by learning more about international education systems' leadership practices. .</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">United Kingdom & Switzerland</h4>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">CURRICULUM FRAMEWORK OF UNITED KINGDOM</h4>
                        <p><strong>The National Curriculum for England and P levels</strong><br><strong>Introduction</strong><br>The National Curriculum for England and Wales is the framework used by all state schools in both countries. Children work at different levels according to age and ability. There are 4 key stages with national testing at the end of each (the fourth being GCSE at which point the national curriculum no longer applies). By the end of key stage 1 (age 7), the average child is expected to achieve national curriculum level 2; this rises to level 4 at the end of key stage 2 and level 5 or 6 by the end of key stage 3. Only the most able pupils will achieve a level 8 with an additional exceptional performance category for those who achieve beyond this. Such performance is rare. In exceptional cases, schools can choose to disapply weaker students from some elements of the national curriculum.</p>
                        <p>Some children with special needs will be working below level one of the national curriculum. They are assessed according to P scales. Pupils aged 5-16 who are working at or towards P levels are likely to need significant help and prompting with tasks and activities. P scales exist for all national curriculum subjects There are 8 levels of performance with each describing some of the important knowledge, skills and understanding that pupils may gain from the programmes of study of the national curriculum.</p>
                        <p>Levels P1 to P3 show the earliest levels of general attainment with subject-focused examples. Levels P4 to P8 show subject-related attainment designed with transition to the national curriculum in mind. There is no expectation that a child will achieve a particular P scale by a given age, or that they will work through the P scales at a predetermined rate. However, attainment of a level by a particular age may help identify the likely rate of progress through the P scales.</p>
                        <p>Children do not undergo any formal assessment or testing and unlike the national curriculum, the awarding of a P level is left to the professional judgment of staff. It is expected that teachers will use their knowledge of the child, consider the contexts in which learning takes place and gather evidence from a variety of sources, to support their decisions and to make a 'best-fit judgment' based on everyday activity and continual monitoring and assessment.</p>
                        <p><strong>Key Stages and Tests</strong><br>Children in English state (maintained) schools must follow the national curriculum. This is intended to ensure a broad and balanced education split into 8 levels, with the most able children expected to attain level 8 by the end of KS3. P levels exist for those children unlikely to achieve a level one. The National curriculum subjects are: art and design, citizenship, design technology, English, Geography, history, ICT, mathematics, modern foreign languages, music, PE, science, RE, careers education, work-related learning, PSHE. Not all subjects are studied throughout. There are four key stages and the children are tested at the end of each key stage but only in the core subjects.</p>
                        <p><strong>Standard Attainment Tests (SATs)</strong><br>Children take Standard Attainment Tests (SAT's) when they are 7, 11 and 14 and national examinations, often though not exclusively, GCSE`s at the age of 16 (end of key stage 4). SATs are statutory. State schools must report their results however it is possible for a child to be disapplied from the tests. Many independent schools take SATS but are not obliged to report the results.</p>
                        <p><strong>Key Stage One (Y1-Y2)</strong><br>Covers the 5-7 age group. Schools have flexibility over when and how the tests in reading, writing (including spelling and handwriting) and maths are administered. The average 7 year old is expected to achieve a level 2. This is not a pass/fail situation; the tests are designed to indicate whether a child is working at, above or below the target level. The tests can be taken at a time to suit the school and are not reported separately but are used to inform teacher assessment of the child. Teacher assessment looks at speaking, listening and science skills as well as the areas covered by the tests.</p>
                        <p><strong>Key Stage Two (Y3-Y6)</strong><br>This covers children aged 7 to 11. Children are tested in English, maths and science, at age 11 (Y6), prior to the move to senior school,. The results are reported to the DfES and to parents. The average 11 year old is expected to achieve a level 4 .</p>
                        <p><strong>Key Stage Three (Y7-Y9)</strong><br>Tests are taken in Y9 at senior school, when a child is typically aged 14. Children are tested in English, maths and science and the results are reported to the DfES and to parents. Teachers assess pupils in these areas plus art, citizenship, design technology, geography, history, ICT, MFL, music, PE. The target level at KS3 is level 5, with the most able achieving a level 8. There are wide variations reported in the levels achieved at this stage. Very few independent schools take key stage 3 tests, most will have assessed the child at 11+ or 13+ via The Common Entrance examination</p>
                        <p><strong>Key Stage Four/GCSE (Y10-Y11)</strong><br>Most children embark on a two-year GCSE course (in some schools pupils sit some GCSEs at the end of Y10). Children are usually encouraged to take a broad base of subjects including: English (usually language and literature); maths; science (biology, chemistry, physics - a combination of one, two or all three in a guise of awards: single, dual etc); a modern foreign language (no longer compulsory) - most schools offer French and often a choice of German, or Spanish but always check with a school first; a design technology subject; humanities (history Geography, RE), and the Arts (visual and performing). Often business/vocationally orientated subjects such as business studies, economics, media studies and ICT are offered. Social sciences: psychology, sociology are popular in some schools as are Latin, Greek and Classical studies. Virtually all GCSE's have a compulsory coursework element worth between 20% and 100% of the marks (some independent schools have opted to follow the IGCSE courses in some subjects as there isn't a coursework element). Non-GCSE courses such as PE (which is offered at GCSE), games and Personal Social Health Education (PSHE) or similar, plus citizenship continue to be followed.</p>
                        <p>Children usually make their GCSE - option choices in Y9 following extensive consultation with the school, their parents and teachers. At this stage the proposed level of study will be discussed. Most subjects offer two tiers of entry, foundation and higher. Foundation level study is aimed at grades C-G and Higher Grades A*-D. Most schools and colleges will expect a student to have achieved at least a grade B in any subject to be studied at A level.</p>
                        <p><strong>IGCSE</strong><br>The International GCSE (IGCSE) is becoming an increasingly popular option in independent schools. The IGCSE offers more rigour and depth, than GCSE enabling the more able to be stretched while still meeting the needs of others. IGCSE can be awarded without coursework ie by 100% examination although coursework options exist. Exams are graded in the same way as GCSEs: Foundation targets grades C-G and Higher grades A*-D. Many people consider the IGCSE to be more akin to the old style O level than GCSE. For example maths IGCSE has a strong emphasis on algebra and introduces calculus, in preparation for A level maths.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">CURRICULUM FRAMEWORK OF SWITZERLAND.</h4>
                        <p>Switzerland's education system is one of the most advanced in the world. Switzerland is the go-to choice for many students looking to study internationally. The system is well established and functional with delegated accountability and administration.</p>
                        <p>The administration and regulation of the school system in Switzerland is made by the cantons while having a set framework by the central government. Each canton sets its school calendar, curriculumand criteria. This system is overseen by the State Secretariat for Education, Research and Innovation (SERI). The decentralization has it's perks which makes it hard for people to move their children from one canton to another.</p>
                        <p>A distinctive characteristic of the Swiss education system is taking into account the wishes and the abilities of students. This attribute is done by diversifying the different directions a student can take once they're done with their primary education. This is common to all cantons.</p>
                        <p><strong>Compulsory Swiss Education.</strong><br>Education is compulsory for all children and young people from 9 to 11 years. Children start compulsory education when they are about four to six years old until about when they turn 15 years old. The cantons also regulate this.</p>
                        <p>Even though there are private schools in Switzerland, most students attend public schools in the local area. This brings diversity so children can experience many different backgrounds, including, sometimes, linguistic backgrounds. Public schools are free of charge and kids are not required to wear uniforms.</p>
                        <p><strong>Primary education</strong><br>Primary education in most of Switzerland is considered kindergarten and the first learning cycle. Kindergarten is not compulsory in all of the cantons, but primary school is. In kindergarten, children are taught about basic manners and knowledge. That's when they are introduced to other languages and Swiss culture. Kindergarten aims to teach children social skills and basic mannerisms through play-based learning. Through music, games, art, and lots of crafts, they are introduced to basic reading and math. After they have finished kindergarten, around the age of 6, they go to primary school.</p>
                        <p>In the German-speaking cantons, kindergarten and two years of primary education are combined into the first learning cycle and students aged four to eight years are in the same class. They call this Grundstufe or Basisstufe. In the French-speaking cantons, two years of kindergarten are combined with two other years and make the first cycle of primary education. The Italian-speaking cantons children attend kindergarten from the age of four.</p>
                        <p><strong>Secondary education.</strong><br>Secondary education in Switzerland is divided into two stages. The lower secondary education and upper secondary education. Kids start their lower secondary education around the ages of 11 to 12 and it lasts 3 to 4 years. The upper secondary education is equivalent to the high schools in American education systems regarding the age of the students. Still, it is very much different from an American high school.</p>
                        <p><strong>Lower secondary education</strong><br>Lower secondary schools in Switzerland are called Gymnasiums or Kantonsschule. This is where kids learn their mother language, a second language spoken in Switzerland and English. Languages are given quite the emphasis in the Swiss education system and therefore most of the people there speak at least a second language. Natural sciences are also given a lot of importance where math, biology, chemistry, physics and geography are taught as some of the main subjects. Other subjects like history, civic education, music, art and design, physical education and health, home economics, career guidance, and vocational preparation are also taught.</p>
                        <p>Students are graded with numbers from 6 (being the highest) to 1 (the lowest). They also take tests at the end of the school year, where they get to test their gathered knowledge. At the end of the year, depending on performance, students either continue to the next year or repeat the previous one.</p>
                        <p><strong>Upper secondary education</strong><br>High school in Switzerland is not compulsory and its structure is unique. After the students finish their lower secondary education, they can choose what kind of career they want to pursue. They get to choose from a Vocational education and training (VET), Baccalaureate or Upper secondary specialized school.</p>
                        <p>A vocational school is a preferred choice for most young Swiss students. That is where they get to learn skills in school and see how it is done through the first-hand experience in companies that provide apprenticeships and cross-company courses. They last from 2 to 4 years and allow the students to gain technical and practical knowledge. Through VET school, students get a federal VET diploma or a federal VET certificate that will enable them to work and continue further education.</p>
                        <p>A Baccalaureate school is the choice of 1/3 Swiss students. It can be considered a continuation of the lower secondary education, where the subjects are similar to the previous ones in lower secondary education, plus law and economics. The enrollment is based on the student's previous performance, and the grading system is the same as in lower secondary education. These schools usually last from 3 to 6 years depending on the canton.</p>
                        <p>At the end of the program, students must take a test and present a baccalaureate essay. Depending on their performance, they are granted a certificate called Matura and are then eligible to start cantonal universities, institutes of technologies, and teacher-training universities.</p>
                        <p>Upper secondary specialized schools provide specialized preparation for a career in healthcare, social work, and education. Students are graded with the same grading system as previously and study the core subjects related to the specific occupation. The grades determine whether the students progress to the next year or not. The program lasts three years and in the end, the students must take a final exam in six of their subjects. If they finish that successfully, they get the upper-secondary specialized school certificate and continue their education in PET colleges.</p>
                        <p><strong>Tertiary</strong><br>Tertiary education is a continuation of the higher secondary education a student chooses. Switzerland's education ranking has regularly been among the top 100 worldwide when it comes to higher education. University is the logical choice for the students with a Matura, while Fachhochschule or Höhere Fachschule is the choice of students with a VET certificate. Students with an upper-secondary specialized school certificate will continue their education in PET colleges.</p>
                        <p><strong>University</strong><br>Switzerland has 12 universities in total, 10 of which are run and regulated by the cantons and offer theoryoriented mayors. There's a wide range of subjects offered to study at Swiss universities. Furthermore, universities in Switzerland are known for their BBAs and MBAs and they tend to be some of the best in the world. This has resulted in a considerable number of international students in the country. Many of these students attend top universities in Switzerland for their advanced degrees. Some of the best-known universities in Switzerland are the federal institutes of tertiary technology and the universities of teacher education.</p>
                        <p><strong>Fachhochschule or Höhere Fachschule.</strong><br>There is one private and eight public Universities of Applied Sciences. These higher education institutions offer students degrees in topical areas such as engineering, technology, or business, and they prepare students for the Swiss and global labor markets. The difference between a University and a Fachhochschule is that the latter generally doesn't award a doctoral degree. Fachhochschule also differs from the traditional university in Switzerland because of its practical-based teaching as opposed to a theory-based orientation.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">CURRICULUM FRAMEWORK OF UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (USA).</h3>
                        <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong><br>The United States of America entered the 21st century as the world's sole superpower after the fall of the Soviet Union in late 1991. It is the third most populous country in the world with 327.7 million people; the largest economy; has the most powerful military, among others. The U.S. also has the second largest higher education system (China overtook the U.S. in this regard roughly around 2001) and it is the top destination for globally mobile students. Fewer U.S. students go abroad for their education - either for a degree or short-term credit though the number of such students has increased steadily over time. The reputation and diversity of its higher education system, along with opportunities to work in the country are among the top reasons that students are drawn to the U.S.</p>
                        <p><strong>Administration of the U.S. Education System.</strong><br>The federal governmental system of the U.S.A, along with a historical distrust of a strong central government has resulted in the nation's highly decentralized education system. The country's long-standing belief in free market capitalism and unfettered private competition, as well as limited government intervention has also shaped the education system. The United States Constitution makes no explicit mention of education, but the 10th Amendment to the Constitution states that all powers not specifically delegated to the federal government are delegated to state governments. As a result, the 50 states, as well as the District of Columbia and the territories are directly in charge of their own education systems resulting in tremendous diversity of education nationwide.</p>
                        <p><strong>Role of the Federal Government</strong><br>While the federal government is not directly in charge of education at any level nationwide, it does play a role in a variety of ways. The person most directly responsible for education policy at the federal level is the Secretary of Education who is in charge of the Department of Education.</p>
                        <p><strong>The Role of the States.</strong><br>Because states are ultimately responsible for education within their jurisdictions, most state constitutions include provisions for how education is to be administered. According to the U.S. Department of Education, state governments are generally responsible for the following:</p>
                        <ol type="i">
                            <li>Developing curriculum guidelines and performance standards.</li>
                            <li>Providing technical assistance to school districts and schools.</li>
                            <li>Licensing private elementary and secondary schools to operate within their jurisdictions.</li>
                            <li>Licensing or certifying school teachers and administrators.</li>
                            <li>Administering statewide student achievement tests.</li>
                            <li>Developing accountability plans and reporting on student performance to the U.S. Department of Education</li>
                            <li>Defining minimum requirements for high school graduation.</li>
                            <li>Distributing state and federal funding to school districts.</li>
                            <li>Establishing the minimum number of school days per year.</li>
                            <li>In most states, a state board of education is in charge of educational policy making.</li>
                            <li>The state department of education typically implements all education-related policies within the state. The leader of the department may be called "superintendent, commissioner, director or secretary of education," according to the Education Department. Education is one of the largest budget items among all states and territories.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Elementary and secondary (K-12) education at the local level is provided by school districts, which run all public schools within their jurisdictions. Local school districts are generally responsible for carrying out state education policy at a local level. They are often granted a good deal of autonomy in terms of budgeting and teaching of the curriculum and they are responsible for hiring and supervising teachers and for raising funding, usually through local property taxes. The head of each individual school at the K-12 level is known as a principal, though the name of this position may vary some among private schools.</p>
                        <p><strong>The Academic Calendar.</strong><br>The school year usually runs from mid-August to mid-September to anywhere from mid-May to mid-June at schools and higher education institutions alike. There is typically a one- to three-week break that encompasses the Christmas (December 25) and New Year holidays, usually called winter break. There is usually also a one-week break sometime during the spring, often (but not always) the week before the Easter holiday in March or April, called spring break.</p>
                        <p>Higher education institutions use different models to sequence their programs. The semester system divides the academic year into two halves known as semesters, which are usually 15 or 16 weeks long. There is a fall semester that runs from the start of the school year to winter break and the spring semester begins after winter break and runs until the end of the school year. Most institutions offer an optional summer semester, which may be shorter and more intensive than the fall or spring semester.</p>
                        <p><strong>OVERVIEW OF K-12 EDUCATION.</strong><br>Elementary and secondary education in the U.S. are often collectively referred to as K-12 education, a kind of shorthand that refers to the grades through which students progress. The "K" refers to kindergarten, typically housed in the elementary school system. Thus, K-12 education is 12 years long for most students, plus kindergarten. As part of K-12 education, an elementary school typically enrolls students from kindergarten or sometimes first grade through the fifth or sixth grades. Students then move on to a lower secondary school known usually either as a middle school or a junior high school. The last four or sometimes three years of school are usually known as high school, or sometimes senior high school.</p>
                        <p>Since education in the U.S. is so highly decentralized, various models of K-12 education exist. K-12 education is virtually universal. All students are guaranteed a free public education through the 12th grade. Most students in the K-12 system study at public schools; others study at sectarian or parochial institutions (schools affiliated with a faith tradition, such as Catholic schools, Baptist schools, Lutheran schools etc.). The minimum compulsory school age varies by state and ranges from age 5 to age 7, though children generally enter kindergarten at age 5. The maximum mandatory age of education also varies per state, usually from 16 to 18 years of age, or in some cases, students can drop out earlier if a certain grade level is completed. Most states mandate the offering of free public education to students until they reach a certain age (if not complete), with most ranging from ages 19 to 22.</p>
                        <p>Admission into public schools is usually automatic based on residency. While private schools and some so-called magnet schools for gifted students may require additional admission requirements, there are generally no admissions tests at public secondary schools. High-demand schools may assign seats by lottery. English is the main language of instruction in virtually all schools, with the exception of some territories, notably Puerto Rico, where Spanish predominates. State policies also vary regarding instruction in other languages.</p>
                        <p><strong>ELEMENTARY EDUCATION.</strong><br>Elementary schools typically teach students from kindergarten through either grade five or six. Kindergarten is traditionally structured as an early childhood education program, a "pre-primary" program, but it is often housed in elementary schools. Public kindergarten is free. Some kindergartens, however, are stand-alone programs and there are a number of other institutions that provide different forms of preschool education including day care centers and nursery schools. Pupils can enroll in some preschool programs at the age of 3, but typically they start kindergarten at age 5. Programs can be either a full day or a half day.</p>
                        <p>Beginning with the first grade, all students receive full-time academic instruction. Usually, elementary school students receive instruction in their core subjects from the same teacher for the entire year, but may be instructed by specialist teachers in subjects such as art, music, physical education (PE), and computer science. States determine the curriculum and districts schools and individual teachers decide how to implement it.</p>
                        <p>Typical core subjects are language arts (reading, writing, grammar and spelling in English), mathematics, science, and social studies (geography, state history, U.S. history, world history). Students may also receive instruction from their regular teacher or specialist teachers in art, music, drama, PE, computer science and other subjects. They often also visit the library on a weekly basis.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>SECONDARY EDUCATION; MIDDLE SCHOOL AND HIGH SCHOOL.</strong><br>Typically, middle school or junior high school (lower secondary education) encompasses sixth through eighth grades, seventh and eighth grades, or occasionally seventh through ninth grades. Sixth grade usually starts around age 11. High schools mostly run from 9th grade to 12th grade. Some such schools run 10th grade to 12th grade. Ninth grade usually starts around age 14 and students usually graduate around age 18. In some cases, middle school and high school are combined into one school running from sixth or seventh grade until 12th grade. In most middle schools and high schools, students have five or six periods of instruction each day and a different teacher for each subject. Teachers usually stay in their own classrooms and students change rooms for each class subject, moving during short "passing periods." Student schedules are not uniform in most cases. The typical curriculum at both the middle school and high school include; PE. Mathematic. High school (9th through 12th grade) curriculum includes the following year-long courses:</p>
                        <ol type="i">
                            <li>Four years of English.</li>
                            <li>Four years of history or social studies.</li>
                            <li>Three years of mathematics.</li>
                            <li>Three years of science.</li>
                            <li>Two years of foreign language.</li>
                            <li>Two years of the arts.</li>
                            <li>Four years of technical, vocational or business education.</li>
                            <li>One year of computer science.</li>
                            <li>Two to three years of others subjects.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Just as with elementary education, states determine the general core curriculum and high school graduation requirements. School districts, schools and teachers then decide on implementation. Either the state or the school districts selects the textbooks.</p>
                        <p>In many parts of the country, foreign language learning including American Sign Language (ASL) does not start until high school. By far, the most common foreign language to study is Spanish, with almost 70 percent of K12 students learning this . French, German, Chinese and Latin are the next most commoners. Chinese language in particular is rising in popularity.</p>
                        <p>During middle school and high school, students can often select one or several electives per year. Some electives may be specialized offerings subjects related to core subjects, particularly at the high school level. For example, in lieu of or in addition to a standard English class, students may be able to take a course in American literature, British literature, or women's literature. Other electives may focus on student interests and abilities, such as visual art, music, drama, debate or the school newspaper. Some are also meant to teach practical life skills. For example, a once common elective class, home economics teaches students how to cook, sew and perform other household tasks, but has become less common.</p>
                        <p>In many middle schools and high schools, there is a short class usually known as homeroom, typically at the very beginning of the school day. The purposes of homeroom can also vary, but they are usually designed to record daily school attendance, give daily announcements to students and generally provide a place for students to receive guidance from a specific teacher. Usually, a teacher of any subject can serve as a homeroom teacher. Students may or may not be given a grade for homeroom and it may or may not appear on transcripts or other student academic records.</p>
                        <p><strong>Extracurricular and co-curricular activities.</strong><br>Extracurricular and co-curricular activities are usually offered at most middle and high schools and are often make up a large part of students' school experiences. Extracurricular activities mostly take place outside of regular class time and do not provide credit toward graduation. Sports and theatrical productions (such as plays or musicals) are among the most common. Other extracurricular activities such as chess, science projects or foreign language study, may be organized by student clubs. During the college admissions process many universities and colleges look favorably at student involvement in out-of-class activities.</p>
                        <p><strong>Credits.</strong><br>Most high schools nationwide use a credit system to measure students' progress toward graduation. The main credit system in use is the Carnegie credit system. A Carnegie credit, sometimes also called a unit, represents 120 hours of instruction per year. It generally also represents one hour of class time five days a week for one school year.</p>
                        <p><strong>High School Graduation Requirements and Specialization Tracks.</strong><br>The states set minimum graduation requirements for all high schoolers in their jurisdictions. Typically, states require a minimum number of credits or units, usually in the Carnegie system. In most cases, a minimum of six or seven credits earned per year is the standard during high school. Most states specify the number of credits that must be earned in certain areas of study.</p>
                        <p>The following four core areas of study are used in almost all the states:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>English/language arts</li>
                            <li>Social studies</li>
                            <li>Science</li>
                            <li>Mathematics</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Most states have requirements in other areas as well such as arts, PE, or foreign language. In addition to completing stipulated course requirements and earning a certain number of credits, some states require students to pass a high school exit examination.</p>
                        <p>In most states, high school students are placed into specialization tracks (tracking), usually based on a combination of aptitude (usually determined by statewide standardized exams) and students' post-graduation plans. The three tracks below are the most common;</p>
                        <ol type="i">
                            <li><strong>General track:</strong> Curriculum is designed for students to meet the minimum state graduation requirements.</li>
                            <li><strong>Vocational track:</strong> Curriculum meets the state graduation requirements and includes courses in specific vocations.</li>
                            <li><strong>Academic or college-preparatory track:</strong> Curriculum exceeds the state graduation requirements and prepares students to meet university admissions requirements, typically those of the state's public universities, through additional coursework in certain areas such as English, mathematics, or foreign language. Advanced Placement (AP) courses, may be part of this track.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Some high schools also offer an honors program, which typically includes more rigorous coursework that follows the academic or college-preparatory track, for "high-achieving students." In some high schools, honors courses are given more weight in the calculation of the overall grade point average (GPA). For example, an institution may equate an A in an honors course to a grade of 5.0, instead of 4.0, thus allowing honors students to achieve higher than a 4.0 GPA . This distinction can benefit them in the university admissions process.</p>
                        <p><strong>Advanced Placement.</strong><br>Advanced Placement (AP) is a formal program offered by the College Board in the U.S. at high schools nationwide (and in U.S. high schools around the world). Students take rigorous, college-level courses usually at their own high schools that count both towards high school graduation and potentially for university or college credit. At the end of the school year, students take the AP examination in the subject they studied. Students must pay for the exams. In most examinations, students are scored on a 5-point scale. A score of 5 is generally considered equivalent to a grade of A, a score of 4 is equivalent to a B, and so forth. A score of 3 is usually considered the minimum passing score.</p>
                        <p>U.S. universities and colleges vary in their policies on accepting AP coursework, but many do, usually with a score of 3 or higher. Most AP courses satisfy general education requirements or sometimes foundational courses in certain fields of study. There are 40 courses and examinations available, in areas such as the arts, English, history and social studies, math and computer science, the sciences, and world languages and cultures. All of them are listed on the College Board's website.</p>

                        <p><strong>SPECIAL EDUCATION AT ALL LEVELS.</strong><br>Education provided to children with disabilities-including physical, mental, emotional and developmental disabilities-is known in the U.S. as special education and is guaranteed by federal law to children in the K-12 public school system. Students can receive special education in both school and non-school settings, such as medical institutions. The primary federal law guaranteeing special education is the "Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA)".</p>
                        <p>IDEA denotes 14 categories of disabilities for which students may receive special education.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Autism</li>
                            <li>Deaf-Blindness</li>
                            <li>Deafness</li>
                            <li>Developmental Delay</li>
                            <li>Emotional Disturbance</li>
                            <li>Hearing Impairment</li>
                            <li>Mental Retardation</li>
                            <li>Multiple Disabilities</li>
                            <li>Orthopedic Impairment</li>
                            <li>Other Health Impairment</li>
                            <li>Specific Learning Disability</li>
                            <li>Speech or Language Impairment</li>
                            <li>Traumatic Brain Injury</li>
                            <li>Visual Impairment Including Blindness</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Most special education students are schooled in regular public schools, as opposed to special institutions, and most learn in mainstream classrooms, often with classroom aids. Some see special education teachers during at least part of their day. In some cases, at the secondary level, special education for some students may be its own track.</p>

                        <p><strong>HOMESCHOOLING.</strong><br>Homeschooling is legally recognized nationwide and regulated by the states. In the majority of cases, parents do the teaching, but sometimes a teacher or tutor is hired. There are a variety of reasons why parents choose to homeschool. Among the most common reasons are concerns about the quality, safety, or social environment of local public schools; as well as the desire to provide instruction at a pace appropriate for the student and often the desire to provide a religious-based instruction.</p>
                        <p>Many states allow homeschooled students to attend some public school classes or to participate in co-curricular or extracurricular activities, such as sports. An increasing number are participating in online education. Few states, if any, award accredited high school diplomas to homeschool graduates. However, a parent's certifying that the student has completed the program is usually recognized as being formally equivalent to high school graduation. It might, however, be more difficult for home-schooled children without an official high school diploma to pass muster with employers, enlist in the U.S. military or gain admission to higher education programs.</p>
                        <p><strong>Secondary Grading Scales.</strong><br>There are no mandatory national grading scales in the U.S. As a result, there is considerable variation between grading scales used by high schools throughout the country, even though most use a 100-point scale. However, it should be noted that many institutions also use pluses and minuses or different numerical ranges, including varying minimum passing grades. Most schools also calculate a student's GPA, which allows the school to measure overall achievement for each student. GPAs are frequently reviewed in the higher education admissions process.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">HIGHER EDUCATION</h4>
                        <p><strong>Types of Institutions</strong><br>With more than 4,500 accredited degree-granting higher education institutions nationwide, the U.S. higher education system is extremely diverse. There are many different types of higher education institutions (HEIs) in the country. There are no nationally standardized definitions of "university" or "college," and the name of an institution alone may not indicate exactly what type of institution it is. A university, at minimum offers bachelor's programs and at least some master's programs.</p>
                        <p>Colleges, on the other hand, can vary quite a bit. Community and junior colleges mostly focus on associate degrees, while baccalaureate colleges award bachelor's degrees. However, institutions with the title "college" may also be university-level institutions that offer graduate programs. For example, Boston College is a fullfledged research university awarding doctoral degrees. It has retained its name most likely because of its prominent neighboring institution, Boston University.</p>
                        <p>In addition, there are various big, multi-disciplinary state universities and a large number of private universities that offer master's and doctoral programs. There are also mono-disciplinary, special focus institutions that offer programs in professional, vocational, and arts fields at different levels of education.</p>
                        <p>The following describe some of the many types of institutions in the U.S;</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Community colleges (also called junior colleges)</li>
                            <li>Liberal arts colleges</li>
                            <li>Historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs)</li>
                            <li>Tribal colleges</li>
                            <li>Hispanic-serving institutions</li>
                            <li>Master's colleges and universities</li>
                            <li>Doctoral-granting universities</li>
                            <li>Special-focus HEIs</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>By international standards, the number of private institutions in the U.S. is high.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>The Role of Community Colleges.</strong><br>Community Colleges (or junior colleges) play an important role in the U.S. education system and have greatly expanded access to education since their inception at the beginning of the 20th century. Hailed as "people's colleges," community colleges were initially designed to provide a low-cost, publicly-funded higher education alternative for broader segments of society while simultaneously freeing up traditional universities from providing general education, allowing them to concentrate more on advanced study and research. While this clear-cut distinction never fully materialized, two-year community colleges certainly have proven to be a highly successful model and today enroll a large portion of U.S. students.</p>
                        <p>Community colleges are usually open admission or open access-applicants need only have a high school diploma or its equivalent to be admitted-and charge, on average, much less tuition than universities. This makes them an important vehicle for educational and social mobility for lower-income groups, minorities, and immigrant populations. Community colleges are also a popular option for older adults who want to upgrade their education and skills.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>University and College Governance.</strong><br>As with K-12 education, states are in charge of overseeing all post-secondary education within their jurisdictions. States usually set the general framework for higher education within the state, particularly in regard to public institutions, and license or charter institutions to operate. However, universities and colleges have, in general, a high degree of autonomy and self-governance.</p>
                        <p>Various models of governance in higher education have emerged over time. In some states, major public universities such as the University of Michigan function with almost full autonomy. Others are more subject to supervision from the state government. Virtually all post-secondary institutions, public and private, have a board of trustees or board of regents who govern the institution. For public institutions, this board is usually appointed by the governor or state legislature, though in some states, they are popularly elected. At private institutions, board members are appointed by the governing board. Community colleges are more likely to be locally run, featuring a board of local members that is either appointed or elected.</p>
                        <p>Most institutions have a chief executive typically called the president or sometimes chancellor who is in charge of running the institution. This individual is usually hired by the board. The board usually assigns the day-to-day operations of the institution to the president, who usually hires other senior administrators. In some states, particularly those that are larger, public universities may be part of a university system. This usually produces another layer of governance between the state government and the individual institution. The university system typically has a board appointed by the state authorities and a chancellor in charge of running the system. As the American Council on Education (ACE) notes, system officials "oversee campus budgets, set policies such as admissions standards, coordinate degree programs, and facilitate credit transfer and articulation between the state's public colleges and universities." They also represent their interests to the state and sometimes federal government. Still, even within a university system, universities still have a considerable degree of autonomy.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Funding.</strong><br>Funding of U.S. higher education institutions is highly complex and many institutions make use of a variety of sources of revenue. However, there are some key differences between public and private institutions. Additionally, there is one major trend that has emerged over the last several decades among all types of institutions, but particularly public universities: the growing dependence on student tuition dollars as a source of revenue.</p>
                        <p>Public institutions, which are under the authority of the states, have traditionally received most of their funding from state governments. Private institutions, which receive little or no direct government funding, have long relied on student tuition and fees for revenue. Nonprofit private institutions, relative to public institutions, have tended to enroll students from higher income households. For-profit institutions often enroll lower income students who rely heavily on federal student aid. However, many institutions, particularly private nonprofits, increasingly offer "tuition discounting," a common term for institutional financial aid, to students who cannot or who are unwilling to pay the full price of tuition.</p>
                        <p>Both public and private (particularly nonprofit) institutions have developed various other forms of revenue aside from student fees (and, by extension, federal and state student aid) and state appropriations (for public institutions). Other common sources of revenue are private gifts (often from alumni), investments and holdings, and research grants from government, nonprofit, and industry sources.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Accreditation and Quality Assurance.</strong><br>States are responsible for authorizing universities and colleges to operate within their jurisdictions. Accreditation, however, is a voluntary process for institutions. Unlike in other countries, where accreditation is often provided by governments or state-authorized organizations, accreditation bodies in the U.S. are private nonprofit organizations.</p>

                        <p><strong>TEACHER EDUCATION AND TRAINING.</strong><br>Like most professions, the teaching profession is regulated at the state rather than the national level, but there are some common practices. There are two types of teacher certification; traditional and alternative. Most teachers are certified using the traditional method, within which are two main routes:</p>
                        <ol type="i">
                            <li>Earn a bachelor's degree in education (particularly for elementary education) or in a subject content area (for example, English, mathematics) with a focus on education, depending on the state's requirements. This tends to be a faster method and usually works best when students know fairly early on in their postsecondary education that they want to become teachers.</li>
                            <li>Earn a bachelor's degree in another subject and then complete a post-bachelor's program, either a certification program or a full master's degree. This is the typical method for individuals who discover late in their undergraduate program or later that they wish to teach.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Both routes are sometimes known as Teacher Preparation Programs (TPPs). Most states require that students pass an entrance examination in reading, writing, and math in order to enter a post-bachelor's TPP, regardless of the intended subject or level of teaching. The most common of the examinations required is Praxis, developed by the Educational Testing Service (ETS).</p>
                        <p>Many states impose other, specific additional requirements-either in the form of coursework (typically included in TPPs) or examinations-that future teachers must complete in order to be eligible for a teaching certificate. Once they meet all the requirements are met, future teachers can apply to the state agency for their certification in the state where they wish to teach.</p>
                        <p>Student teaching is a common part of TPPs. Regulations vary by state regarding the length and type of student teaching required of prospective teachers. According to a study by the National Council on Teacher Quality (NCTQ), about half of all states require at least 10 weeks of student teaching with a "cooperating teacher," an ill-defined term for a current teacher, either explicitly required or assumed to be experienced, under whom the student teacher works. Individual TPPs then set their own requirements and parameters for student teaching in compliance with state regulations. There are alternative routes by which individuals can be educated, trained and certified to be teachers. One method, depending on state regulations, is to immediately start teaching and earn certification in the process. This uncommon method is usually used in schools and subjects that urgently need teachers, where teachers who have been certified via the traditional methods are in short supply.</p>
                        <p>Once certified and teaching, teachers are generally required or expected to continue professional development, and many go on to eventually earn master's degrees. After three years of teaching experience, teachers may work toward the completely optional National Board Certification (from the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards), which can help teachers advance in their careers, earn higher salaries, and more easily transfer to work in another state.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>TECHNICAL AND VOCATIONAL EDUCATION AND TRAINING (TVET).</strong><br>TVET in the U.S. is usually referred to as Career and Technical Education (CTE). It is not standardized compared with vocational training systems in other countries. CTE is delivered in various different forms and by various different institutions. For example, there are thousands of small proprietary career colleges, most of them offering sub-degree, certificate-level programs in specific vocations. In addition, CTE is delivered by community colleges or through work-based apprenticeship programs. Private institutions constitute the majority of providers in the CTE sector. At the secondary level, CTE can be offered in specialized high school courses, or in programs at secondary-level career academies that combine career training with college preparatory curricula.</p>
                        <p>At the post-secondary level, community colleges offer a multitude of applied, career-oriented two-year programs leading to degrees like the Associate of Applied Science, Associate of Applied Arts or Associate of Applied Technology, as well as sub-degree certificate programs. Four-year institutions offer some of these programs as well. Though most programs include some general education coursework, they are primarily focused on applied technical training in specific vocations and may include an internship component.</p>
                        <p>In addition, there are programs that straddle secondary and post-secondary education. So-called Tech-Prep programs, for instance, combine two or more years of secondary education with two years of post-secondary education, concluding with the award of an applied associate degree as well as a high school diploma.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, apprenticeship programs provide CTE through part-time classroom instruction that augments practical training at a workplace. More than 500,000 trainees were enrolled in formal apprenticeship programs registered with the federal government in 2017. Formal apprenticeship programs last between one and six years. CTE in the U.S. is highly decentralized. Licensing and training requirements vary widely between states. Different states have different education and licensing requirements for different occupations, so that training and certification obtained in one state may be difficult to transfer to another.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">CURRICULUM FRAMEWORK OF BRAZIL.</h3>
                        <p><strong>The School System</strong><br>Certain levels of education are compulsory for all children living in Brazil while others such as pre-school and upper secondary school remain optional.</p>
                        <p><strong>Pre-school education.</strong><br>Pre-school education is entirely optional and for pre-school children there is a choice between:<br>- Maternal or state- for children aged two to five<br>- Jardim, for children from three to six years of age</p>
                        <p>The Maternal is basically a playgroup whereas Jardim has a more academic focus for small children. The school meets with the parents and child before enrollment and depending on the academic and social skills of the child the school will advise parents on where it feels the child will best fit in. All state pre-schools and nurseries are free of charge.</p>
                        <p><strong>Primary and lower secondary education.</strong><br>In Brazil it is mandatory for children to go to school from age 6 to 14. Children under the age of six may be enrolled as long as they turn six in the first semester. These compulsory nine years of education are known as Fundamental Education (Ensino Fundamental) and are divided into two levels:</p>
                        <ol type="i">
                            <li>Ensino Fundamental I.</li>
                            <li>Ensino Fundamental II.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>A core curriculum is set by the Education Council. During the Ensino Fundamental I, children study mathematics, Portuguese, science, arts, history, geography and physical education. During Ensino Fundamental II, pupils also study at least one other compulsory language.</p>
                        <p>The normal practice in Brazilian schools, both public and private is to mix all academic levels together in the same class.</p>
                        <p>Under the state system, an exam is given to all pupils at the end of each academic year to determine whether the child will move on to the next year or whether they will be held back to repeat a year. It's not unusual to hold a child back, which means that the age mixture of classes is often quite varied. Depending upon the pedagogic philosophy of the private school, children may be required to return and repeat a year, although this is not a very common practice these days. If it becomes obvious that a child is not managing to keep up with the advance in learning levels of their classmates, the school will speak to the parents about options involving other academic systems. There are some privately-run schools, which divide a year into levels of academic ability for classes, in line with the British state model, for instance. This is however becoming less common as the private schools adopt more tightly controlled pedagogic models.</p>
                        <p><strong>Upper secondary education.</strong><br>Upper secondary education (Ensino Médio) is for young people aged 15 to 18. On top of the core curriculum subjects studied during Ensino Fundamental, students will also study philosophy and sociology. The courses provided during this period are essentially designed to allow a young person to enter into a (usually public) university. The courses can be conducted either at the private school the child has been attending up until this point or at specific colleges which train youngsters to take the specific entrance exam set by a specific university. Students can also choose to take professional training at the same time.</p>
                        <p>Once a student has successfully completed secondary education, they may continue their studies at a public or private university. To enter a public university, students must sit an entrance exam known as vestibular. Entrance exams to a private university are often little more than a formality and as a consequence, public university degrees are valued much more highly than those from private institutions.</p>
                        <p><strong>Home schooling early years</strong><br>Brazilian law demands that a child start their compulsory education at six years old. Should the parents feel that the schooling options available where they live are insufficient for their child's needs, they may apply to the government for the right to provide their own education at home. This is a lengthy process, involving the Ministry of Justice and Ministry of Education.</p>
                        <p><strong>Private Schools.</strong><br>Within the private school system, numerous pedagogies can be found from which to choose a child's educational direction. These systems are largely based on existing European models and essentially focus on the degree of attention placed on the arts and humanities versus the scientific and technical subjects, while attitudes towards disciplinary measures and the rigidity of teaching methods also varies.</p>

                        <p><strong>School education.</strong><br>Primary and Secondary education in Australia is delivered through both government and non-government providers. State and Territory governments have major responsibility for government school education and contribute substantially to funds for non-government schools. Most students are enrolled in government schools which operate under the direct responsibility of the State or Territory Education Minister, while the rest choose non-government schooling. The Federal Government's role with respect to schooling includes the provision of significant supplementary financial support to government and non-government school authorities to support agreed priorities and strategies.</p>
                        <p><strong>Primary education</strong><br>Schooling is compulsory from age 6 to 15 in all States except Tasmania, where it extends to 16. However, in most States, children start primary school at the age of 5 when they enrol in preparatory or kindergarten year, after which primary education continues for either six or seven years depending on the State.</p>
                        <p><strong>Secondary education</strong><br>Secondary education is available for either five or six years, depending on the State and the length of primary education. Students usually commence their secondary schooling when aged 12 or 13, reaching year 12 at 17 or 18. Links between the education and training sectors have been strengthened, partially through the introduction of the Australian Qualifications Framework which is a unified system of twelve national qualifications in schools, vocational education and training (Technical And Further Education Colleges and private providers) and the higher education sector (universities). The Framework links together all these qualifications and is a highly visible, quality-assured national system of educational recognition, which promotes lifelong learning and a seamless and diverse education and training system.</p>
                        <p><strong>Higher education.</strong><br>The main purposes of Australian higher education are to enable individuals to develop their capabilities for effective participation in the workforce, for constructive contributions to society and for personal growth and fulfilment; to advance knowledge and understanding; aid the application of knowledge and understanding to the benefit of the economy and the society; enable individuals to adapt and learn, consistent with the needs of an adaptable knowledge-based economy at local, regional and national levels; and contribute to a democratic, civilised society. Australian universities are autonomous self-accredited institutions established by Federal, State or Territory legislation.</p>
                        <p><strong>Non-university level post-secondary studies (technical/vocational type).</strong><br>Vocational education and training (VET) is the term used in Australia to describe the sector which prepares Australians of all ages for employment and to improve the knowledge and skills of those already in the workforce. Since the late 1990s VET has been available in all three sectors of the education system-school, postsecondary and higher education-but the most important of these is at the postsecondary level.</p>
                        <p>The postsecondary vocational education and training sector is diverse and includes government-funded Technical and Further Education (TAFE) colleges and other Government providers (public registered training organisations), private registered training organisations, and community-based registered training organisations. These training organisations provide a wide range of vocational training for trade, technical, professional and para-professional occupations as well as a range of adult education, leisure and general enrichment programmes.</p>
                        <p><strong>University level studies:</strong><br><strong>University level first stage: Undergraduate Studies.</strong><br>Access to undergraduate education is through the Senior Secondary Certificate of Education. The main stage of university education leads to the Bachelor's Degree. Undergraduate studies last between three years (Arts, Science, Commerce), four years (Education, Engineering), five years (Veterinary Science, Dentistry, Architecture) and six years (Medicine and Surgery) full-time.</p>
                        <p><strong>University level second stage: Postgraduate Studies.</strong><br>A graduate with a Bachelor's Degree can proceed to a one- to two-year postgraduate course leading to a Postgraduate Diploma in a particular subject. A student who has qualified for a Bachelor's Degree (Honours) at a sufficiently high level may proceed to study for the Master's Degree which constitutes the second stage of higher education.</p>
                        <p><strong>University level third stage: Higher Doctorate.</strong><br>Many faculties award a Higher Doctorate in Science (DSsc) or Humanities (DLitt) upon submission of published work representing a substantial contribution to knowledge in a particular field.</p>
                        <p><strong>Teacher education:</strong><br><strong>Training of pre-primary and primary/basic school teachers</strong><br>There are no national requirements for the teaching profession in Australia. States and Territories have responsibility for those universities within their jurisdictions that offer teacher education, although the Federal Government is the main source of funding for those institutions. The responsibility for school systems and the employment of teachers lies with both government and non-government education authorities in each State and Territory. Programmes for preparatory or pre-primary teachers are often referred to as early childhood education/teaching programmes. They provide education in the care and teaching of children from birth to 8 years of age, or from age 3 to 8 years. Programmes may be at the undergraduate or postgraduate level. The most common awards are a Bachelor of Education (Early Childhood Education) or a Bachelor of Early Childhood Education, both of which require 4 years of full-time study. Alternatively, students who have already completed a 3-year Bachelor degree in a discipline other than education may complete a 1- or 2-year Graduate Diploma of Education (Early Childhood Education). Primary teacher education programmes provide education to teach children from ages 5 to 12 in years 1 to 6 or 7 or primary school. The programmes generally offer a balance of professional and curriculum studies to foster the intellectual, physical and social development of children. Students follow a four-year course leading to a Bachelor of Education (Primary). Alternatively, students who have already completed a Bachelor degree in a field other than education may complete a one- or two-year Graduate Diploma in Education (Primary) or a two-year postgraduate Bachelor of Education (Primary). These programmes provide a combination of professional studies in education and methodology and supervised teaching practice in primary curriculum subjects. There are also a number of four-year combined degrees such as the Bachelor of Arts/Bachelor of Education (Primary) and Bachelor of Applied Science/Bachelor of Education (Primary) which combine primary education studies with studies in a discipline related to teaching. There are also some programmes which prepare teachers to teach at both primary and secondary school - for example, the Bachelor of Education (Upper Primary/Lower Secondary) and Bachelor of Education (Primary and Secondary).</p>
                        <p><strong>Training of secondary school teachers.</strong><br>Secondary teacher education programmes provide education to teach pupils of around 12 to 18 in Years 6 or 7 to Year 12 of secondary school. Students follow programmes that provide a balance of integrated professional studies and curriculum studies in one or two disciplines in key learning areas appropriate for both the lower and upper years of secondary schooling. Programmes may be at the undergraduate or graduate levels. The most common undergraduate award is the Bachelor of Education (Secondary) which requires four years of full-time study. Students who have already completed a Bachelor degree in a relevant curriculum area may complete a two-year full-time Graduate Diploma of Education (Secondary) or a two-year full-time Bachelor of Education (Secondary). These programmes provide a combination of professional studies in education and methodology and supervised teaching practice in subjects appropriate to the first degree. There are also a number of combined degrees such as the Bachelor of Arts/Bachelor of Education which combine secondary teaching education studies with study in a discipline relevant to secondary school. Teachers of Vocational Education and Training (VET) courses in schools are expected to be competent to conduct education and training programmes and to assess skills based on the industry-endorsed competency standards in the Training Packages developed by Australian industry bodies and endorsed under the National Training Framework (NTF). Teachers usually have qualifications and substantial employment experience in a specialised field covered by the NTF and hold the minimum of an Australian Quality Framework Certificate IV in Assessment and Workplace Training. Educational authorities also require teaching qualifications up to Bachelor degree level.</p>
                        <p><strong>Distance higher education</strong><br>Distance education has been a feature of higher education in Australia for at least 80 years. The geographic size of Australia and the relatively few large population centres in early years meant that for many distance education provided the only opportunity they had to gain a university degree. Traditionally, distance education was textbased, but Australia has been an early adopter of new education technologies and while text is still important, universities use a range of delivery modes, including on-line courses, email, telephone, video-conferencing, web TV, radio and television.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">CURRICULUM FRAMEWORK OF NEW ZEALAND.</h4>
                        <p><strong>Early learning. (0-6 years old)</strong><br>Early learning helps children to be confident and curious about the world. It also helps them do better when they go to school or kura. Education system reflects our unique and diverse society, which welcomes different abilities, religious beliefs, ethnic groups, income levels and ideas about teaching and learning. Education in New Zealand is a student-centred pathway providing continuous learning progression and choice so that students progress every year and their learning at one level sets the foundation for the next steps along a chosen pathway. New Zealand's education system has three levels:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Early childhood education: from birth to school entry age</li>
                            <li>Primary and secondary education: from 5-19 years of age</li>
                            <li>Further education: higher and vocational education.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Early childhood education</strong><br>Early learning helps children to be confident and curious about the world. It helps them to do better when they go to school or kura, and it helps them develop important skills to become strong, happy and successful in later life. Early Childhood Education (ECE) isn't compulsory but around 96.8% of children attend ECE.</p>
                        <p>There are different types of ECE services and all learning that children experience at an ECE service or Kōhanga Reo is guided by the Te Whāriki curriculum framework. The government subsidises all children who attend ECE for up to six hours a day (a total of 30 hours per week). The 20 Hours ECE is a higher funding subsidy available for all children aged 3-5 years who attend ECE.</p>
                        <p><strong>Primary and secondary education.</strong><br>Primary and secondary schools are the second level of education. Education is free between the ages of 5 and 19 at state schools (schools that are government owned and funded) if they're a New Zealand citizen or a permanent resident.</p>
                        <p>Schooling is compulsory from age 6-16. In the majority of schools, children can start school on the day they turn five years old (they don't have to wait until the start of a new school year). However, some schools have a policy of starting children at school together as a group at the start of each term (cohort entry). Most children stay at school until they're around 17 years old.</p>
                        <p>The education system for schools is made up of 13 Year levels. Primary education starts at Year 1 and goes to Year 8 (around 5-12 years of age). Secondary education starts from Year 9 to Year 13 (around 13-17 years of age).</p>
                        <p><strong>Types of schools.</strong></p>
                        <p><strong>Local schools</strong><br>Many children go to a school close to where they live. Many schools have an enrolment scheme called zoning. If you live in an area close to a school (the school's zone), your child is guaranteed to get a place at that school. If you want your child to go to a school outside the area where you live, you may have to apply and a place isn't guaranteed. Depending on the schools in your area, you may have the choice to send your child to a single-sex or coeducational school.</p>
                        <p><strong>State integrated and private schools</strong><br>Most schools in New Zealand are owned and funded by the state (state schools). They teach the national curriculum and are secular (non-religious). State-integrated schools are schools with a special character. They are funded by the government and teach the national curriculum. They'll have their own sets of aims and objectives to reflect their own particular values and are set within a specific philosophy or religion. Private schools get some government funding but are mostly funded through charging parents school fees. They develop their own learning programmes and don't have to follow the national curriculum.</p>
                        <p><strong>Māori-medium education (Kura Kaupapa Māori)</strong><br>Māori-medium education is where students are taught all or some curriculum subjects in the Māori language for at least 51% of the time (Māori Language Immersion Levels 1-2). Māori language in English-medium is where students are learning te reo Māori as a language subject, or are taught curriculum subjects in the Māori language for up to 50% of the time (Māori Language Immersion levels 3-5).</p>
                        <p><strong>National curriculum</strong><br>The national curriculum covers subjects that are taught at primary and secondary schools and the standards students should reach in each subject. Primary education focus on foundation learning across a range of subjects and competencies but especially in literacy and numeracy. At secondary school learners learn a broad and balanced curriculum, with some specialisation possible in Years 11-13.</p>
                        <p>English-medium schools use the New Zealand Curriculum. Māori-medium schools (Kura Kaupapa Māori) use Te Marautanga o Aotearoa (a curriculum based on Māori philosophies).</p>
                        <p><strong>National Certificate of Educational Achievement (NCEA).</strong><br>The National Certificate of Educational Achievement (NCEA) is the national senior secondary school qualification. Assessment is during their last three years at school (Years 11-13). They can achieve NCEA at three levels in a wide range of courses and subjects.</p>
                        <p><strong>Learning support.</strong><br>Additional learning support is available in every local early childhood centre or school. It's planned to support students, educators, families and whānau in a range of different ways depending on individual needs. They include;</p>
                        <p><strong>i) Home and distance learning</strong><br>If attending a school isn't the best option your child can learn with New Zealand's correspondence school, Te Aho o Te Kura Pounamu (Te Kura). Te Kura teaches early childhood, primary, secondary and special needs students using multimedia and online learning. Your child can also study one or two courses if a subject they want to study isn't available at their school.</p>
                        <p><strong>Further education.</strong></p>
                        <p><strong>i) Technical and vocational education</strong><br>At a senior secondary school level, students may begin to specialise in vocational learning. They can get help into work or further education from a number of programmes and institutions.</p>
                        <p><strong>ii) Youth Guarantee</strong><br>Youth Guarantee courses provide students aged 16-19 with an opportunity to study towards NCEA Level 1-3 or Level 1-3 certificates at tertiary providers free of charge. These courses are usually vocationally focused.</p>
                        <p><strong>iii)Trades academies</strong><br>Trades academies teach trades and technology programmes to students in Years 11-13 (ages 15-18). They are run through schools and other providers.</p>
                        <p><strong>iv) Institutes of technology</strong><br>Institutes of technology and polytechnics teach professional and vocational education and training from introductory studies to degrees.</p>
                        <p><strong>Industry training organisations</strong> represent particular industries (for example, agriculture, building and construction, motor trade). They offer training and qualifications for those sectors. They funded by the government and industry.</p>
                        <p><strong>v) Private training</strong><br>Private training establishments offer specific vocational courses at certificate and diploma level (for example, travel and tourism).</p>
                        <p><strong>vi) State-owned Māori teaching and research institutions (Wānanga)</strong><br>New Zealand has three wānanga (state-owned Māori teaching and research institutions). They teach according to āhuatanga Māori (Māori tradition) and tikanga Māori (Māori custom). They offer certificates, diplomas and degrees. Some teach in specialised areas up to doctorate level.</p>
                        <p><strong>vii) Universities</strong><br>New Zealand has eight state-funded universities. Each university offers degrees in a large choice of subjects and has strengths in specialised professional degrees. All of the universities are well recognised internationally. They work with universities in other countries on research and teaching programmes and with the business community in New Zealand and overseas on research and development.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">GUIDING PRINCIPLE OF BECF</h4>
                        <p>The Framework is based on the following guiding principles:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Opportunity</strong><br>In order to achieve the reforms' vision and mission, the curriculum provides learners with a variety of opportunities to enable them to identify their needs, talents and potential.</li>
                            <li><strong>Excellence</strong><br>Every learner will be nurtured to excel in their areas of greatest interest and ability. The Framework values excellence and competitiveness rather than raw competition for examination grades.</li>
                            <li><strong>Diversity and Inclusion</strong><br>There are two dimensions in the guiding principle of diversity and inclusion. First, the Framework will guide learners to appreciate Kenya"s diversity in terms of race, ethnicity, gender, language, culture, and religion. The second dimension relates to the fact that learners are different in terms of their learning needs and abilities and these differences need to be respected and valued within an inclusive learning environment.</li>
                            <li><strong>Differentiated Curriculum and Learning</strong><br>Differentiated curriculum and learning builds on the principle of diversity and inclusion. It ensures that the curriculum content and instructional approaches are appropriate for each learner. It provides space for teachers to adapt the curriculum to suit the learner. It does not demand that every learner learn the same content in the same way, in the same number of hours and at the same time.</li>
                            <li><strong>Parental Empowerment and Engagement</strong><br>Parents play a very important role in determining the success of a child's education. They have a shared responsibility with schools to provide an enabling environment that is conducive to learning and which motivates the child to achieve their full potential. The Framework will provide opportunities for schools to empower parents to contribute to the learning outcomes for their children and to be engaged at all tiers and levels of basic education.</li>
                            <li><strong>Community Service Learning</strong><br>Involving students in community service is a form of experiential education that enables students to apply their knowledge and skills in a different setting. Teachers then support students to analyse what they have learned by taking part in this activity and how it might be applied to their academic and personal development. Community service learning entails a balanced emphasis on both students" learning and addressing real needs in the community.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Core Competencies For Basic Education</h4>
                        <p>Sessional Paper No. 2 of 2015 on „Reforming Education and Training in Kenya" recommends a reformed curriculum that adopts a competency based approach A competency based approach enables meaningful connections within and between subject areas through a focus on competencies. Subjects and Subjects will continue to be taught and will be the vehicles through which the core competencies are developed over time.</p>
                        <p>Based on the Needs Assessment Study carried out by KICD, and the vision and mission of the BECF, the seven core competencies to be achieved by every learner in basic education are:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Communication and Collaboration</li>
                            <li>Self-efficacy</li>
                            <li>Critical Thinking and Problem Solving</li>
                            <li>Creativity and Imagination</li>
                            <li>Citizenship</li>
                            <li>Digital Literacy</li>
                            <li>Learning to Learn</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>The Framework seeks to develop these competencies so that all Kenyans can thrive in the 21st century.</p>
                        <p><strong>Communication and Collaboration</strong><br>Communication is the act of transferring information from one place to another, whether vocally, visually, or non-verbally. The discipline of communication focuses on how people use messages to generate meanings within and across various contexts, cultures, channels, and media. The discipline promotes the effective and ethical practice of human communication. Collaboration is the process of two or more people or organizations working together to realize shared goals. Collaboration may require leadership, although this can be social within decentralized or egalitarian groups or teams that work collaboratively in relation to gaining greater resources, recognition and motivation. Strategies for effective communication enhance the attainment of greater collaboration among groups that ultimately increase the success of teams as they engage in collaborative problem solving.</p>
                        <p><strong>Self-efficacy</strong><br>Self-efficacy is a person's belief about his or her capabilities to perform tasks or assignments that can change and transform his or her life. It determines how the person feels, thinks, behaves and motivates themselves. Self-efficacy has the potential to determine four major processes namely cognitive, motivational, affective and selection processes.</p>
                        <p><strong>Critical Thinking and Problem Solving</strong><br>An important outcome of quality education is teaching learners how to think critically. The British Council (2015) identifies three types of thinking: reasoning, making judgements, and problem solving. It is possible for learners to reason in an uncritical way. When learners are empowered with critical thinking, they avoid being subjective, and use logic and evidence to arrive at conclusions.</p>
                        <p><strong>Creativity and Imagination</strong><br>Creativity and imagination refers to the ability to form new images and sensations in the mind, and to turn them into reality. It is the ability to imagine things that are not real, to form pictures in the mind of things that one has not seen or experienced, and turn those pictures into real things. It also refers to the act or power of forming mental images of things that are not present to the senses, or that are never wholly perceived in reality, and creating physical representations of those images.</p>
                        <p><strong>Digital Literacy</strong><br>Digital literacy can be described as having the knowledge, skills and behaviours which are necessary to effectively and safely use a wide range of digital content and devices. Such devices include mobile phones, smart phones, tablets, laptops and desktops among others. All these fall within the category of network enabled devices</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">THEORITICAL APPROACHES</h4>
                        <p>A theory is an abstract general explanation of observations or a subject under study that can be relied upon to provide guidance for practice. It attempts to predict behaviour or reach a reasonable and general set of explanations for an underlying issue. The Basic Education Curriculum Framework is underpinned by several theories.</p>
                        <p><strong>Instructional Design Theory</strong><br>This theory offers explicit guidance towards a new curriculum that explains how to help students learn and develop in the wake of emerging globalization It offers guidance for fostering cognitive learning as "Clear information, in terms of goals, knowledge needed and performance expected; Thoughtful practice, in terms of opportunities for learners to engage in learning actively and reflectively; Informative feedback, in terms of clear and thorough counsel to learners, and; Strong intrinsic or extrinsic motivation."</p>
                        <p><strong>Vygotsky's Social-Cultural Development Theory</strong><br>Vygotsky"s social-cultural theory emphasized that teaching and learning are highly social activities and that interactions with teachers, peers and instructional materials influence the cognitive and affective developments of learners (Kim and Baylor, 2006). The theory argues that learning takes place when learners interact with each other, or have other social contact. Learners negotiate meanings with people in the environment, and they achieve goals through interacting, both explicitly and implicitly, with the teacher, peers, materials, and atmosphere embedded in the context. This theory underpins the basic education curriculum framework in terms of conceptualising and designing the necessary paradigm shifts that will facilitate creating rich learning environments which will stimulate all learners and help them to fulfil their potential.</p>
                        <p><strong>Gardner's Multiple Intelligence Theory</strong><br>Gardner "s theory grew out of constructivism. It states that learners possess different kinds of minds and therefore learn, remember, perform, and understand in different ways. He argues that we are all able to know the world through language, logical-mathematical analysis, spatial representation, musical thinking, use of the body to solve problems or to make things, an understanding of other individuals, and an understanding of ourselves.</p>
                        <p><strong>Piaget's Cognitive Development Theory</strong><br>Piaget"s theory deals with how humans gradually come to acquire, construct, and use knowledge. He looked at the impact a person's childhood had on their development, and the ways in which maturation affect a child's increasing capacity to understand their world. Piaget asserted that children cannot undertake certain tasks until they are psychologically mature enough to do so.</p>
                        <p>According to this theory, there is progressive reorganization of mental processes resulting from biological maturation and environmental experience. It is important to note that children's thinking does not develop entirely smoothly, instead, there are certain points at which it "takes off" and moves into completely new areas and capabilities. These points are in four stages of cognitive development: Sensory motor (0-2 years), Pre-operational (2-7 years), Concrete operations (7-11 years) and Formal operations (11 years and above). This has been taken to mean that before these ages children are not capable (no matter how bright) of understanding things in certain ways, and has been used as the basis for scheduling the school curriculum. Parents are encouraged to provide a rich, supportive environment for their child's natural propensity to grow and learn.</p>
                        <p>competency based curriculum has the following strengths:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Learner-focused</strong><br>The focus should be less on the school and the system and more on the education and the learner. The curriculum should be responsive and relevant to learners and enable flexibility for teachers - who are designers of learning opportunities - to enable them to meet the diverse needs of the students.</li>
                            <li><strong>Focus on Competencies</strong><br>More focus should be directed to competencies and less on content. The goal should be the appropriate application of knowledge, and not necessarily just its acquisition. This kind of curriculum enables the creation of meaningful connections within and among subject areas by focusing on competencies. Subjects/subjects/disciplines will continue to be taught and will be the vehicle through which literacy, numeracy and other competencies are developed over time.</li>
                            <li><strong>Opportunities for Local Decision Making and Greater Depth of Study</strong><br>Prescriptive curricula with limited flexibility should be avoided, as should programs that have fewer learning outcomes. The goal is to enable greater flexibility at the local level. Teachers will have autonomy in implementing the curriculum while teaching.</li>
                            <li><strong>Balance Between Formative and Summative Assessment</strong><br>Too much focus on summative assessment should be avoided. A range of assessment that focuses on the development of student learning outcomes, cross-curricular competencies, and literacy and numeracy should be adopted. Basic Education Curriculum Framework Nurturing Every Learner's Potential Engaged, Empowered & Ethical Citizens</li>
                            <li><strong>Digitally Based</strong><br>The design of the curriculum within a collaborative digital application enables it to be improved continuously and supports learning with flexible timing and pacing through a range of learning environments.</li>
                            <li><strong>Collaborative and Co-development Models</strong><br>Collaboration by all stakeholders in the curriculum design should be the norm. Co-creation of the curriculum with partners and stakeholders taps into local expertise to enhance its design and development. Content delivery will be flexible and exploratory.</li>
                            <li><strong>Synchronous Development</strong><br>Sequential development needs to be replaced with synchronous development. An integrated approach to develop programmes of study, assessments, and learning and teaching resources supports a common approach that encourages interdisciplinary learning.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p><strong>Subjects</strong><br>These are the subjects taught at various levels of the education. For example, English, Mathematics, Science and Technology. Subjects are the means through which the key competencies, values and knowledge will be taught across all levels of learning. However, they are not static and may change to address the ever changing needs of society.</p>
                        <p><strong>Organization Structure of Basic Education</strong><br>Basic Education will be organized into three (3) levels: Early Years Education, Middle School Education and Senior School.
