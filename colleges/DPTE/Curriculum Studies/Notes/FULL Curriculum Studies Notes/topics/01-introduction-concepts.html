                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">1.1.1 Curriculum</h4>
                        <p>The word "curriculum" comes from the Latin word "currere", which means: "to run or to run a course". It has its origin in the running/chariot tracks of Greece. It was, literally, a course. In Latin curriculum was a racing chariot; curere was to run. Curriculum is a systematic and intended packaging of competencies (i.e. knowledge, skills and attitudes that are underpinned by values) that learners should acquire through organised learning experiences both in formal and non-formal settings. By curriculum Bishop (1985) is the sum total of all the experiences a pupil undergoes. A document or plan that exists in a school or school system that defines the work of teachers, at least to the extent of identifying the content to be taught to students and the method to be used in the process. (English, 2000).</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Experiences children have under the guidance of teachers.</li>
                            <li>Curriculum encompasses all learning opportunities provided by school.</li>
                            <li>Curriculum is a plan for all experiences which the learner encounters in school.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>The word Curriculum is taken from the Latin word which mean race or race-course. Oxford Dictionary defined it as a course of study "Curriculum is a disciplining technology that directs how the individual is to act, feel, talk, and 'see' the world and the 'self.' As such, curriculum is a form of social regulation."</p>
                        <p><strong>(a) The Traditional concept;</strong></p>
                        <p>"It is a body of subjects or subject matter prepared by the teachers for the students to learn"</p>
                        <p><strong>(b) Static view point</strong></p>
                        <p>Initially the curriculum was consider the course of study which gives importance only to text book teaching in educational institutions, the objective was to help students to memorize the content of the subject.</p>
                        <p><strong>(c) Dynamic view point</strong></p>
                        <p>After 19th century the old concept of the curriculum was replaced, it include now all the activities which are practiced inside or outside school for the well being of the students. It is the totality of learning; classroom Experiences, lab work, play ground and interaction with the community A curriculum refers to a defined and prescribed course of studies, which students must fulfill in order to pass a certain level of education.</p>
                        <p>Some influential definitions combining various elements to describe curriculum are as follows</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>John Kerr:-</strong> According to John Kerr, a curriculum is planned and guided by the school, whether it is carried on in groups, individually inside or outside the school.</li>
                            <li>The curriculum is a total learning experience provided by the school. It includes the content of courses (the syllabus), the method employed (strategies) and other aspects like norms and values, which relate to the way schools are organized.</li>
                            <li>Thus a curriculum is neither development nor a sequence of experiences. It is a plan for facilitating learning for students.</li>
                            <li>This plan starts with where the child is. It enumerates all the aspects and dimensions of learning that are considered necessary. It gives a reason why such learning is considered necessary and what educational aims it would serve.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>In a nutshell,</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>the curriculum is a means followed by the teachers and students for achieving the set goals and the aims or objectives of education being provided in the school.</li>
                            <li>Curriculum, in every sense, is supposed to be used for all experiences. These may be curricular or co-curricular, imparted by the school for the realization of the stipulated aims and objectives of the school education.</li>
                        </ul>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The modern curriculum consists of all experiences for learning which are planned and organized by the school. It is composed of the actual experiences and activities of learners inside or outside the classroom under the guidance of the teacher and for which the school accepts responsibility.</p>
                        <p>Some authors define curriculum as "The total effort of the school to bring about desired out-comes in school and out-of-school situations"</p>
                        <p><strong>Concepts of Curriculum</strong></p>
                        <p>The concept of Curriculum is dynamic as the changes that occur in society. In its narrow sense, curriculum is viewed merely as a listing of subject to be taught in school. In a broader sense, it refers to the total learning experiences of individuals not only in schools but in society as well. (Purita P. Bilbo, Ed.D)</p>
                        <p>A general overall plan of the content or specific materials of instruction that the college should offer the student by way of qualifying him for graduation or certification or for entrance into a professional or vocational field.</p>
                        <p>A body of prescribed educative experiences under the supervision of an educational institute, designed to provide an individual with the best possible training and experience to fit him for the society of which he is a part or to qualify him for a trade or profession.</p>
                        <p><strong>(a) Common Concepts of Curriculum</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Syllabus Content Outline</li>
                            <li>Standards Textbooks</li>
                            <li>Course of study</li>
                            <li>Planned Experiences</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>(b) Scope and importance of Curriculum</strong></p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>the coverage of the area or subject matter that something deals with or to which it is relevant.</li>
                            <li>The range of one's perceptions, thoughts, or actions "He hasn't the scope to understand this concept."?</li>
                            <li>The area covered by a given activity or subject</li>
                        </ol>

                            <li>Social</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>The important aspect of the substantive is related to goals, aims and objectives and the technical aspect refers to the skill development, methods and subject matter. The social side is the need and involvement of the society in the process.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">1.2.1 Curriculum Development</h3>
                        <p>Curriculum development is the process of creating curriculum materials for use by educators and children that are product of curriculum planning.Curriculum development describes all the ways in which a training or teaching organization plans and guides learning. This learning, can take place in groups or with individual learners. It can take place inside a classroom or outside a classroom. It can take place in an institutional setting like a school, college or training centre, or in a village or a field. It is central to the teaching and learning process. (Rogers and Taylor) 1988).</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">1.2.2 Types of Curriculum</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Overt</strong><br>Thus, the overt curriculum is usually confined to those written understandings and directions formally designated and reviewed by administrators, curriculum directors and teachers, often collectively.</li>
                            <li><strong>Explicit</strong></li>
                            <li><strong>written</strong><br>Is simply that which is written as part of formal instruction of schooling experiences. It may refer to a curriculum document, texts, films, and supportive teaching materials that are overtly chosen to support the intentional instructional agenda of a school.</li>
                            <li><strong>Hidden/covert</strong><br>That which is implied by the very structure and nature of schools, much of what revolves around daily or established routines.Refers to the unwritten, unofficial, and often unintended lessons, values, and perspectives that students learn in school. Longstreet and Shane (1993) offer a commonly accepted definition for this term - the "hidden curriculum," which refers to the kinds of learnings children derive from the very nature and organizational design of the public school, as well as from the behaviors and attitudes of teachers and administrators. It consists of all that is learned during school activities, out of the designated official curriculum. These includes:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>How learners should sit</li>
                                    <li>How to greet the teacher</li>
                                    <li>Role of the teacher and prefect</li>
                                    <li>How to relate with the teachers, fellow students and other people at school.</li>
                                    <li>Values such as hard work, respect, obedience, co-operation, value for others, empathy etc.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Null curriculum</strong><br>That which we do not teach, thus giving students the message that these elements are not important in their educational experiences or in our society. Eisner offers some major points as he concludes his discussion of the null curriculum. The major point I have been trying to make thus far is that schools have consequences not only by virtue of what they do teach, but also by virtue of what they neglect to teach. For example, in social studies, the teacher may give a general overview of the history of science while covering the scientific revolution. However, this information is excluded from the formal curriculum. From Eisner's perspective the null curriculum is simply that which is not taught in schools. Somehow, somewhere, some people are empowered to make conscious decisions as to what is to be included and what is to be excluded from the overt (written) curriculum. We teach about wars but not peace, we teach about certain select cultures and histories but not about others. Both our choices and our omissions send messages to students.</li>
                            <li><strong>Societal curriculum/social</strong><br>As defined by Cortes (1981). Cortes defines this curriculum as:...[the] massive, ongoing, informal curriculum of family, peer groups, neighborhoods, churches, organizations, occupations, mass media, and other socializing forces that "educate" all of us throughout our lives. This type of curricula can now be expanded to include the powerful effects of social media (YouTube; Facebook; Twitter; Pinterest, etc) and how it actively helps create new perspectives, and can help shape both individual and public opinion.</li>
                            <li><strong>Phantom curriculum</strong><br>The messages prevalent in and through exposure to any type of media. These components and messages play a major part in the enculturation of students into the predominant meta-culture, or in acculturating students into narrower or generational subcultures.</li>
                            <li><strong>Concomitant curriculum</strong><br>What is taught, or emphasized at home, or those experiences that are part of a family's experiences, or related experiences sanctioned by the family. (This type of curriculum may be received at church, in the context of religious expression, lessons on values, ethics or morals, molded behaviors, or social experiences based on the family's preferences.)</li>
                            <li><strong>Rhetorical curriculum</strong><br>Elements from the rhetorical curriculum are comprised from ideas offered by policymakers, school officials, administrators, or politicians. This curriculum may also come from those professionals involved in concept formation and content changes; or from those educational initiatives resulting from decisions based on national and state reports, public speeches, or from texts critiquing outdated educational practices.</li>
                            <li><strong>Electronic curriculum</strong><br>Those lessons learned through searching the Internet for information, or through using e-forms of communication. (Wilson, 2004) These types of curriculum may be either formal or informal, and inherent lessons may be overt or covert, good or bad, correct or incorrect depending on ones' views. Students who use the Internet and electronic media on a regular basis, both for recreational and informational purposes, are bombarded with all types of media and messages.</li>
                            <li><strong>Curriculum in Use</strong><br>The formal curriculum (written or overt) comprises those things in textbooks, and content and concepts in the district curriculum guides. However, those "formal" elements are frequently not taught. The curriculum-in-use is the actual curriculum that is delivered and presented by each teacher.</li>
                            <li><strong>Received curriculum</strong><br>Those things that students actually take out of classrooms; those concepts and content that are truly learned and remembered.</li>
                            <li><strong>The internal Curriculum</strong><br>Processes, content, knowledge combined with the experiences and realities of the learner to create new knowledge. While educators should be aware of this curriculum, they have little control over the internal curriculum since it is unique to each student.</li>

                        <p>CBC Curriculum offers so many benefits not only to a learner but also the parents and the teachers. There is maximal engagement of all the stake holders involved. These article provides top 15 benefits of embracing CBC Curriculum. Get facts, and be of sound knowledge as we embrace the curriculum for our own good.</p>
                        <p>CBC Curriculum Kenya was drafted by Kenya Institute of Curriculum Development (KICD). The curriculum was initiated in 2017 after being approved by the education ministry. The education system replaced the 8-4-4 system. CBC Curriculum meaning Competency-Base Curriculum.</p>
                        <p>The curriculum focuses on the importance of a learner's ability to develop skills and acknowledge and apply those competency skills to solve daily life challenges.</p>
                        <p>Competency-Based Curriculum applies a 2-6-6-3 system with classes being named as Grades and has the major divisions that include:</p>
                        <ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">1.3.2 15 Benefits of CBC Curriculum</h3>
                        <p>The CBC curriculum is preferred over the 8-4-4 system because the CBC Curriculum's benefits come within shaping the learners' future. Some of the Importance of the CBC Curriculum includes;</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Better Decision Making Abilities</strong><br>CBC aims at letting the learn to have flexibility in exploring content at all angles while teachers have been granted the freedom to carry through the curriculum when classes are on.</li>
                            <li><strong>Learner-Focused System</strong><br>CBC education system majors focus on the learner as an individual rather than the school performance. As a result, the teachers can familiarize themselves with the student's demands regarding strength and weakness. Leaners hence create a good relationship with teachers who help them shape their talents and careers.</li>
                            <li><strong>Balance Education System</strong><br>The education system provides a distinctive assessment with many areas of the learner's development in classwork and co-curricular activities. According to CBC, the learner's ability is tested all-round.</li>
                            <li><strong>Focus on Competencies</strong><br>CBC's central focus is around learners discovering their potentials in life. It creates a platform where the learner can positively relate to acquiring knowledge and skills to connect with various disciplines as they advance to their heights.</li>
                            <li><strong>Digitally Based</strong><br>The teacher-learner alliance creates an opportunity for progressive learner support in the flexible teamwork environment.</li>
                            <li><strong>Synchronous Development</strong><br>The CBC system encourages corporative learning with learners to assimilate, enhancing positive growth among learners compared to meaningful learning where little positive change is realized.</li>
                            <li><strong>Collaborative Model</strong><br>The CBC system is a collective responsibility for both stakeholders and curriculum partners to produce local experts who can enhance developments.</li>
                            <li><strong>Community Service Learning</strong><br>Involving learners in community services exposes them to apply the knowledge acquired during their learning period. Practicing their community development skills creates a ground for the teachers to spot learners' creativity and potential in discovering specific talents.</li>
                            <li><strong>Distinction of Theory and Practical</strong><br>The learners are tested on the ability to distinguish what they have learned in class and how practically they can follow instructional approaches in applying the skills outside style. In this manner, the teachers can identify every learner's potential and know what works for them. As a result, it becomes easier to help the learner improve their strength and overcome their weaknesses.</li>
                            <li><strong>Parental Empowerment and Engagement</strong><br>The CBC form of education requires parents to participate in their children's positive outcomes during their primary education levels. The parents provide a conducive learning environment by being the learners, which motivates the learners to progress in their learning institutions. Parents need to collaborate with the teachers in providing basic requirements as per the school curriculum demands to enhance the smooth progress of uninterrupted studies.</li>
                            <li><strong>Fosters Excellence</strong><br>According to the learners' CBC system, excellence is based on pre-eminence and interest areas rather than just completions for excellence in internal and external examinations and ranking.</li>
                            <li><strong>Expands Learner's Opportunities</strong><br>CBC provides learners with a diver's opportunities to learn from to help them narrow to talent identification and potential exploration according to their needs and capabilities. The system encourages learners to develop a positive attitude towards education by allowing them to access equal education opportunities. The focus is on discouraging school dropouts as many learners can enjoy exploring their fields of interest.</li>
                            <li><strong>Diversity and Inclusion</strong><br>CBC system is programmed to help the learners appreciate that everyone is different and unique in terms of brain capacity. They are brought to an understanding that it is ok to be gifted differently and that no gifting is independent. As a result, all the institutions are compelled to accommodate all the learners regardless of their classwork performance regarding intellectual, physical, emotional challenges. The learners are brought to an understanding in terms of appreciating diversity in the country, such as
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Race</li>
                                    <li>Language</li>
                                    <li>Ethnicity</li>
                                    <li>Culture</li>
                                    <li>Religion</li>
                                    <li>Gender</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Problem-Solving and Critical Thinking</strong><br>CBC exposes the learners to a learning system that demands them to reason, make a reasonable judgement and use creativity in arriving at solutions. As opposed to the former education system where learners were required to remember what they were taught, CBC enables the understanding. Every challenge has an explanation attached. They have to find out how to arrive at the solution without simply cramming an answer.</li>
                            <li><strong>Fosters Imagination and Creativity</strong><br>CBC does not bind the learner to what is entailed to the syllabus but allows the learners to expand their minds to discover new ideas and images and bring them into accomplishment. The learners can analyze and find discrete patterns to generate solutions that can positively affect the phenomenon. Focusing on learners' ability, the CBC curriculum can be said to be the best education system for learners. Maximum learners potential can be realized for the good of all.</li>

                        </ul>
                        <p>These skills are intended to help students keep up with the lightning-pace of today's modern markets. Each skill is unique in how it helps students, but they all have one quality in common. They're essential in the age of the Internet. To start, let's dive into the three categories that 21st Century skills fall into.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">1.4.3 The Three 21st Century Skill Categories</h3>
                        <p>Each 21st Century skill is broken into one of three categories:</p>
                        <p><strong>(a) Learning skills (the four C's)</strong> teaches students about the mental processes required to adapt and improve upon a modern work environment. Altogether, these categories cover all 12 21st Century skills that contribute to a student's future career. The four C's are by far the most popular 21st Century skills. These skills are also called learning skills. More educators know about these skills because they're universal needs for any career. They also vary in terms of importance, depending on an individual's career aspirations.</p>
                        <p>The 4 C's of 21st Century Skills are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Critical thinking:</strong> Finding solutions to problems</li>
                            <li><strong>Creativity:</strong> Thinking outside the box</li>
                            <li><strong>Collaboration:</strong> Working with others</li>
                            <li><strong>Communication:</strong> Talking to others</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>(i) Critical thinking</strong> is the most important quality for someone to have in health sciences. In business settings, critical thinking is essential to improvement. It's the mechanism that weeds out problems and replaces them with fruitful endeavors. It's what helps students figure stuff out for themselves when they don't have a teacher at their disposal.</p>
                        <p><strong>(ii) Creativity</strong> is equally important as a means of adaptation. This skill empowers students to see concepts in a different light, which leads to innovation. In any field, innovation is key to the adaptability and overall success of a company. Learning creativity as a skill requires someone to understand that "the way things have always been done" may have been best 10 years ago - but someday, that has to change.</p>
                        <p><strong>(iii) Collaboration</strong> means getting students to work together, achieve compromises, and get the best possible results from solving a problem. Collaboration may be the most difficult concept in the four C's. But once it's mastered, it can bring companies back from the brink of bankruptcy. The key element of collaboration is willingness. All participants have to be willing to sacrifice parts of their own ideas and adopt others to get results for the company. That means understanding the idea of a "greater good," which in this case tends to be company-wide success.</p>
                        <p><strong>(iv) Communication</strong> is the glue that brings all of these educational qualities together. Communication is a requirement for any company to maintain profitability. It's crucial for students to learn how to effectively convey ideas among different personality types. That has the potential to eliminate confusion in a workplace, which makes your students valuable parts of their teams, departments, and companies. But when employees communicate poorly, whole projects fall apart. No one can clearly see the objectives they want to achieve. No one can take responsibility because nobody's claimed it. Without understanding proper communication, students in the 21st Century will lack a pivotal skill to progress their careers.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>(b) Literacy skills (IMT)</strong> focuses on how students can discern facts, publishing outlets, and the technology behind them. There's a strong focus on determining trustworthy sources and factual information to separate it from the misinformation that floods the Internet. They're sometimes called IMT skills, and they're each concerned with a different element in digital comprehension. The three 21st Century literacy skills are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Information literacy:</strong> Understanding facts, figures, statistics, and data</li>
                            <li><strong>Media literacy:</strong> Understanding the methods and outlets in which information is published</li>
                            <li><strong>Technology literacy:</strong> Understanding the machines that make the Information Age possible</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>(i) Information literacy</strong> is the foundational skill. It helps students understand facts, especially data points, that they'll encounter online. More importantly, it teaches them how to separate fact from fiction. In an age of chronic misinformation, finding truth online has become a job all on its own. It's crucial that students can identify honesty on their own. Otherwise, they can fall prey to myths, misconceptions, and outright lies.</p>
                        <p><strong>(ii) Media literacy</strong> is the practice of identifying publishing methods, outlets, and sources while distinguishing between the ones that are credible and the ones that aren't. Just like the previous skill, media literacy is helpful for finding truth in a world that's saturated with information. This is how students find trustworthy sources of information in their lives. Without it, anything that looks credible becomes credible. But with it, they can learn which media outlets or formats to ignore. They also learn which ones to embrace, which is equally important.</p>
                        <p><strong>(iii) Technology literacy</strong> goes another step further to teach students about the machines involved in the Information Age. As computers, cloud programming, and mobile devices become more important to the world, the world needs more people to understand those concepts. Technology literacy gives students the basic information they need to understand what gadgets perform what tasks and why. This understanding removes the intimidating feeling that technology tends to have. After all, if you don't understand how technology works, it might as well be magic. But technology literacy unmasks the high-powered tools that run today's world. As a result, students can adapt to the world more effectively. They can play an important role in its evolution.</p>

                        <p><strong>(c) Life skills (FLIPS)</strong> take a look at intangible elements of a student's everyday life. These intangibles focus on both personal and professional qualities. Also called FLIPS, these skills all pertain to someone's personal life, but they also bleed into professional settings. The five 21st Century life skills are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>(i) Flexibility:</strong> Deviating from plans as needed. Flexibility is the expression of someone's ability to adapt to changing circumstances. This is one of the most challenging qualities to learn for students because it's based on two uncomfortable ideas:
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Your way isn't always the best way</li>
                                    <li>You have to know and admit when you're wrong</li>
                                </ol>
                                <p>That's a struggle for a lot of students, especially in an age when you can know any bit of information at the drop of a hat. Flexibility requires them to show humility and accept that they'll always have a lot to learn - even when they're experienced. Still, flexibility is crucial to a student's long-term success in a career. Knowing when to change, how to change, and how to react to change is a skill that'll pay dividends for someone's entire life.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>(ii) Leadership:</strong> Motivating a team to accomplish a goal</li>
                            <li><strong>(iii) Initiative:</strong> Starting projects, strategies, and plans on one's own</li>
                            <li><strong>(iv) Productivity:</strong> Maintaining efficiency in an age of distractions</li>
                            <li><strong>(v) Social skills:</strong> Meeting and networking with others for mutual benefit.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">1.4.4 Need and importance of curriculum development (or construction)</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Curriculum development is a purposeful activity.</li>
                            <li>It is undertaken to design or redesign for the realization of certain specific educational objectives.</li>
                            <li>The curriculum is the heart of the student's college/school experience.</li>
                            <li>The curriculum should be reviewed and revised on a regular basis so that it is able to serve the changing needs of both students and society.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The following points iterate the needs and importance of curriculum development.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Clear purpose and goals:-</strong> Curriculum construction provide written curricular goals which are nothing but intended student development outcomes. These goals and objectives are specified in considerable detail and in behavioral language.</li>
                            <li><strong>Continuous assessment and improvement of quality:-</strong> Valid and reliable assessment of the curriculum is necessary. The curriculum followed by an institution should be reviewed regularly in order to maintain it's effectiveness in regards to the changing needs of the society as a whole.</li>
                            <li><strong>A rational sequence:-</strong> In a curriculum educational activities are carefully ordered in a developmental sequence. This developmental sequence helps to form a well planned (or coherent)curriculum based on intended goals and outcomes of the curriculum and its constituent courses.</li>
                            <li><strong>Making strategy in teaching and learning:-</strong> Curriculum development helps in suggesting suitable teachinglearning strategies, teaching methods, instructional materials, etc. It helps in providing for the proper implementation of the curriculum on the part of teachers and learners.</li>
                            <li><strong>Helps in the selection of learning experiences:-</strong> Curriculum development is needed for appropriate selection and organization of learning experiences. It helps in the selection of study matter and other activities so that learners are able to acquire goals and objectives of teaching.</li>
                            <li>The process of curriculum development is needed for conceptualizing a curriculum in terms of the determination of educational objectives for teaching-learning at a particular grade of school education.</li>
                            <li><strong>Helps in continuous and comprehensive education:-</strong><br>Curriculum development considers the need of providing a scheme of education for CCE of the teaching-learning outcomes. With proper feedback, it helps to bring necessary improvement in the teaching-learning process and environment.</li>
