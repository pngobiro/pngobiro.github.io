                        <p>Values are defined as standards that guide an individual on how to respond or behave in a given circumstance. Our values influence how we feel, act and make choices in life. Internationally, there has been a rise in the challenges and issues related with cultural integration, as well as ethnic and religious diversity. Social values form an important part of the culture of the society. Values account for the stability of social order. They provide the general guidelines for social conduct. Values such as fundamental rights, patriotism, respect for human dignity, rationality, sacrifice, individuality, equality, democracy etc. guide our behaviour in many ways.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Value Education</h3>
                        <p>Means teaching and learning of ideals. The aim is for students to understand moral values and show their good behaviour and attitude towards society.</p>
                        <p><strong>N/B</strong> The teaching of values will facilitate the achievement of the curriculum reforms' vision, particularly with respect to developing ethical citizens.</p>
                        <p>According to the Constitution of Kenya, 2010 The values stated in the Constitution include responsibility, respect, excellence, care and compassion, understanding and tolerance, honesty and trustworthiness, trust, and being ethical.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Functions of Values:</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Values provide goals or ends for the members to aim for.</li>
                            <li>Values provide for stabilities and uniformities in group interaction. They hold the society together because they are shared in common. Some sociologists argue that shared values form the basis for social unity. They will therefore, have a sense of belonging to a social group. They will feel a part of the wider society.</li>
                            <li>Values bring legitimacy to the rules that govern specific activities. The rule are accepted as rules and followed mainly because they embody the values that most people accept.</li>
                            <li>Values help to bring about some kind of adjustment between different sets of rules. The people seek the same kinds of ends or goals in different field of their life. Hence, it is possible for them to modify the rules to help the pursuit of this end.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">What is Values-based Education?</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Value based education (VBE) is an outcome anchored on culture, religion, morals, values and character formation for holistic development.</li>
                            <li>Values and attitudes are components for cognitive knowledge and are useful in attaining and maintaining peace across cultures.</li>
                            <li>Values-based Education is an approach to teaching that works with values. It creates a strong learning environment that enhances academic achievement and develops students' social and relationship skills that last throughout their lives.</li>

                        <p>There is an inherent need and importance of value education in the present world:</p>

                            <li>It helps in taking the right decisions in difficult situations thus improving decision-making abilities.</li>

                            <li>It awakens curiosity in children developing their values and interests. This further helps in skill development in students.</li>
                            <li>It also fosters a sense of brotherhood and patriotism thus helping students become more open-minded and welcoming towards all cultures as well as religions.</li>
                            <li>It provides a positive direction to a student's life as they are taught about the right values and ethics.</li>

Value education aims to somewhat fill the void in people's lives.</li>
                            <li>Helps people to be more convinced and committed to their goals and passions. This leads to the development of awareness which results in thoughtful and fulfilling decisions.</li>

                        <p>Based on the Needs Assessment Study carried out by KICD, and the vision and mission of the BECF, the seven core competencies to be achieved by every learner in basic education are:</p>

                            <li>Communication and Collaboration</li>

                        <p>The Framework seeks to develop these competencies so that all Kenyans can thrive in the 21st century.</p>
                        <p><strong>Communication and Collaboration</strong><br>Communication is the act of transferring information from one place to another, whether vocally, visually, or non-verbally. The discipline of communication focuses on how people use messages to generate meanings within and across various contexts, cultures, channels, and media. The discipline promotes the effective and ethical practice of human communication. Collaboration is the process of two or more people or organizations working together to realize shared goals. Collaboration may require leadership, although this can be social within decentralized or teams that work collaboratively in relation to gaining greater resources.</p>
                        <p><strong>Self-efficacy</strong><br>Self-efficacy is a person"s belief about his or her capabilities to perform tasks or assignments that can change and transform his or her life. It determines how the person feels, thinks, behaves and motivates themselves. Self-efficacy has the potential to determine four major processes namely cognitive, motivational, affective and selection processes.</p>
                        <p><strong>Critical Thinking and Problem Solving</strong><br>An important outcome of quality education is teaching learners how to think critically. The British Council (2015) identifies three types of thinking: reasoning, making judgements, and problem solving. It is possible for learners to reason in an uncritical way</p>
                        <p><strong>Creativity and Imagination</strong><br>Creativity and imagination refers to the ability to form new images and sensations in the mind, and to turn them into reality. It is the ability to imagine things that are not real, to form pictures in the mind of things that one has not seen or experienced, and turn those pictures into real things.</p>
                        <p><strong>Learning to Learn</strong><br>Learning is a continuous process that begins at birth and continues until death; it is the process through which we use our experience to deal with new situations and to develop relationships.</p>
                        <p><strong>Digital Literacy</strong> can be described as having the knowledge, skills and behaviours which are necessary to effectively and safely use a wide range of digital content and devices. Such devices include mobile phones, smart phones, tablets, laptops and desktops among others. .</p>
                        <p><strong>Citizenship</strong><br>Is the state of being vested with the rights, privileges, and duties of a citizen. It creates a sense of belonging and attachment to one"s nation. A sense of citizenship helps to equip young people to deal with situations of conflict and controversy knowledgeably and tolerantly.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">WHAT ARE MORAL VALUES?</h4>
                        <p>Moral values are the key components of a person's character. They are personality traits guiding people to make decisions and judgements according to their own sense of what is right and wrong, based on collective and individual experiences.</p>
                        <p>Moral values are essential in whatever stage of life we are in, the values that most adults have are the ones that were instilled in us during our childhood. They form the fundamentals in any student's life.</p>
                        <p>It is said that students are the future nation, and this future of our country depends greatly upon the values imparted to them during their student life. Moral values pave the path for all their decisions in life, as without these values, children do not have any guidance and their life may seem directionless. In order to be accepted and respected by society, parents and caregivers should make sure of imbibing these strong moral values in children as a lifestyle itself.</p>
                        <p><strong>N/B</strong> We believe that moral values such as <em>kindness, courage, humility, honesty, truthfulness, integrity, respect, hard-work, tolerance, compassion, empathy, and inclusivity</em> are extremely important to be instilled from an early age, to build a child's character, as it forms the very core of their being and becomes the foundation of their moral beliefs throughout their lives..</p>
                        <p>Therefore, we will look at the importance of moral values, which are the basic values that reflect integrity and humanity in a student's life, in this blog.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">IMPORTANCE OF MORAL VALUES IN A LEARNING PROCESS</h4>
                        <p>A student's life is full of challenges, changes, growth, and evolution. A growing child imbibes a lot of lessons throughout their student years, most of which stick with them for the rest of their lives. Students with high ethical values become accountable, responsible, and honest people, while those without moral values to abide by becoming a threat to themselves and society.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Importance to teaching moral values to students from a young age</h5>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>It Helps In Strong Character Building:</strong><br>Being aware of values from an early age helps in developing the child's character and forming the very core of their being. A strong character development happens because of the virtues and values that children learn during their childhood, which remains as a sound foundation for their moral beliefs in the future.</li>
                            <li><strong>It Helps In Distinguishing Right From Wrong:</strong><br>Moral values serve as a guide in differentiating between right and wrong, right from the beginning. While we see almost every day that students at times can contribute to undesirable behaviour like bullying or cheating in exams etc</li>
                            <li><strong>Boost Self-Confidence And Positivity:</strong><br>When children do something good, they tend to feel good about themselves, which further motivates them, while also giving them an ample amount of self-confidence. This self-affirmation of being able to give back or help others, in turn, helps in boosting their self-confidence along with helping them develop positive feelings and positive relationships in their lives.</li>
                            <li><strong>Shapes Attitudes, Beliefs And Determines Their Adult Behaviour:</strong><br>Today's students are the ones that will become tomorrow's doctors, business people, engineers, scientists, politicians, police, etc., and hold the most important positions that will either uplift or let down societies, communities, countries, and the world at large. Moral values should be properly implemented right from a young age because the virtues you teach your children today will determine how they behave as adults.</li>
