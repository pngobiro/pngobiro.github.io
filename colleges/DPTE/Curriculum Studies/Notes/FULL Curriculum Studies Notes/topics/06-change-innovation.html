                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p><strong>African Systems of Education before Colonial Period.</strong> Education in Kenya has not been new and that African education system played an important role in society development before colonialism period. Kenya inherited a British based colonial system of education that focused on making Kenyans productive labourers and obedient subjects rather than skilled and independent minded workers. The African traditional education system before the colonial period was skilled based (apprenticeship) unlike the 'westernised' model which is mainly theory based.</p>
                        <p><strong>Education System in Kenya from Independence (1963) to Date (2020).</strong> After Kenya attained independence in 1963, a new system of 7-4-2-3 of education was adopted. This means that learners spent seven years in primary, four years in junior secondary education (Ordinary Level), 2 years in high school (Advanced level) and three years in colleges or universities. This system of education was inherited from colonial administration but policy changes happened through various education commissions to ensure that the system education offered was demand driven. The country reformed its education in three pillars over the years.</p>
                        <ol type="i">
                            <li>Manpower requirements.</li>
                            <li>Social demand and,</li>
                            <li>Cost benefit analysis strategies.</li>
                        </ol>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">The social demand pillar</h4>
                        <p>It came as a result of the societal pressure to ensure that majority of African children got access to education after independence. The notion was that access to education was a prerequisite of better living standards for majority of Africans who had been denied education by the colonialists. Wanyama and Changach (2013) alluded that the model adopted at independence period was focused on consumption role of education rather than investment aspect. One of the effects of this model was production of many school leavers who were not adequately prepared to meet the demands of the job market. Through the consumption education model, the government introduced free education to primary and secondary schools and this resulted to enrolment increase in schools which was recorded across the country but the quality and effectiveness of education was significantly affected since the available facilities in schools could not sufficiently address the educational need of learners enrolled. With this in mind, the government was faced with a dilemma of having too many graduates who would not fit into the employment sector. This lead to rethinking of education system by formation of various education commissions.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Education Reforms since Independent.</h4>
                        <ol type="i">
                            <li>Through the Gachathi Report of the year 1976, Mackay Report of the year 1981 reformed Kenya's education system of 7-4-2-3 to 844 education system in the year 1985 with the need to address the problem of educated unemployment by the introduction of vocational and technical subjects in primary education and also to improve the quality of education at all levels. From the time it was enacted in the year 1985 to 2009, the 8-4-4 system had been blamed for focusing much more on children passing in examinations rather than acquiring competent knowledge and skills to enable social and economic development of the country.</li>
                            <li><strong>Vision 2030 and Education System in Kenya</strong><br>The Kenya government adopted Vision 2030 in the year 2007 to act as a blue print towards country's attaining an industrialized middle income economy by 2030. During the development of the vision, it was discovered that production of quality human resources to attain the whole vision was pegged on the education sector that prides itself in innovation and discoveries. In the last 20-30 years, the country has relied much on expatriate input to push various developmental agenda. This situation created the debate for the need to reform the education system to ensure the goals and objectives of the Vision 2030.</li>
                            <li><strong>The Reforms of Education System from 8-4-4 to 2-6-3-3-3</strong> With calls for reforms in the education sector, the government of Kenya created a commission of inquiry led by Davy Koech in the year 1999/2000 with recommendations made including the replacement of 8-4-4 system of education with Totally Integrated Quality Education and Training (TIQET), removal of examination between primary and secondary schools and reduction of subjects at secondary schools to ease curriculum. One of the recommendations led to removal of technical subjects (Arts, Craft, Music, Agriculture, Home Science and Business) from primary school curriculum has been hailed to contribute to the current human resource gaps in the country leading to production of low quality graduates in tertiary education who lack requisite skills to drive the country forward .</li>
                            <li>In the year 2009 the government conducted a summative evaluation of the 8-4-4 and it was found out that it would be impractical to implement the 8-4-4 system as it did not align with the country's development vision.</li>
                            <li>The promulgation of new constitution in the year 2010, called for the need of review of education system.</li>
                            <li>Formation of Douglas Odhiambo education commission in the year 2011. In the year 2012, the commission came out with the report that proposed a replacement of 8-4-4 system of education with 2-6-3-3-3 one. This report heralded the introduction of competency based curriculum in the Kenyan system of education that was set to be implemented gradually from pre-primary school up to primary level until the year 2028 when it will be fully functional at all levels of education.</li>
                            <li><strong>The New Competency Based Curriculum.</strong><br>The competency based curriculum is aimed at cultivating students' capacities to learn and perform activities to expected standards. In the previous system of education that was largely theoretical, the expectations by the instructors in classroom were for the learners to learn and pass examinations. With the introduction of competency based curriculum in Kenya, the shift is to learn and apply the knowledge through activities required by the curriculum. While the previous 8-4-4 system of education focused more on the summative evaluation, the new 2-6-3-3-3 curriculum mainly reliThe mastery of competencies is what will drive the nation forward other than the certificates that are issued after completion of a certain level of education. Further, the use of summative evaluation has denied many students opportunities to acquire higher education skills as it is the determinant on which courses they are likely to pursue in the future. With this in mind, the government rolled out the programme in the year 2019 after conducting the pilot for two years.</li>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Benefits of Educational Change from Theory to Competency Based Education.</h4>
                        <p>Competency based curriculum education involves many activities that helps to promote student learning in classroom. For instance, the use of formative assessment helps students to correct their mistakes hence provide more learning opportunities to students.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, the methods and content of assessment applied using competency based learning approach are more oriented towards application and less on theory.</p>
                        <p>Unlike the current system (8-4-4), CBC allows learners to progress through classes upon demonstrating mastery of prescribed competencies.</p>
                        <p>CBC purposes to engage learners in applying knowledge through demonstration as opposed to content overload which has been the case for many years.</p>
                        <p>The recommended teaching approaches through CBC ensure retention of knowledge and application of it in future by the learners.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Strategies of curriculum change in relation to the 21st Century</h4>
                        <p>"21st century skills are tools that can be universally applied to enhance ways of thinking, learning, working and living in the world. The skills include critical thinking/reasoning, creativity/creative thinking, problem solving, metacognition, collaboration, communication and global citizenship.</p>
                        <p>Communication, Creativity, Critical Thinking and Collaboration skills can be developed in the following ways;</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Letting students lead the Learning. Learning takes place best in environments where students feel empowered to learn.</li>
                            <li>Create an Inquiry-Based Classroom Environment.</li>
                            <li>Encourage Collaboration.</li>
                            <li>Develop Critical Thinking Skills.</li>
                            <li>Encourage Creativity</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Based on the Needs Assessment Study carried out by KICD, and the vision and mission of the BECF, there are seven core competencies to be achieved by every learner in basic education. The Framework seeks to develop these competencies so that all Kenyans can thrive in the 21st century. They are;</p>

                            <li>Communication and Collaboration</li>
                            <li>Self-efficacy</li>

                        </ol>
                        <p><strong>Communication and Collaboration.</strong><br>Communication is the act of transferring information from one place to another, whether vocally, visually, or non-verbally. The discipline of communication focuses on how people use messages to generate meanings within and across various contexts, cultures, channels, and media. Being able to communicate effectively as intended is the most important of all life skills. How well information can be transmitted and received is a measure of how good our communication skills are. Developing communication skills helps in all aspects of an individual's life. Parks (1985) maintains that communicative competency can effectively be measured by determining if and to what degree, the goals of interaction are achieved.</p>
                        <p><strong>Collaboration.</strong><br>Collaboration is the process of two or more people or organizations working together to realise shared goals.Strategies for effective communication enhance the attainment of greater collaboration among groups and ultimately increases the success of teams as they engage in collaborative problem solving. Collaborative learning is a system in which two or more people co-operate in a learning experience to share and contribute to each member's understanding of a topic and to complete a given task. Collaborative learning is designed to help learners learn from each other and can be an important aspect of the school curriculum. There are many team building games and activities that can be done in a classroom that force learners to work together to complete a task.</p>
                        <p><strong>Self-efficacy.</strong><br>Self-efficacy is a person's belief about his or her capabilities to perform tasks or assignments that can change and transform his or her life. It determines how the person feels, thinks, behaves and motivates themselves. Self-efficacy has the potential to determine four major processes namely cognitive, motivational, affective and selection processes. A strong sense of self-efficacy enhances a learner's accomplishment and personal wellbeing in many ways. Learners with high assurance in their capabilities approach difficult tasks as challenges to be mastered, rather than as threats to be avoided. Learners set themselves challenging goals and maintain a strong commitment to them. Self-efficacy as a competency enables learners to develop and nurture intra-personal skills and values such as self-awareness, self-esteem, confidence and personal integrity. These competencies enhance the learner's ability to heighten and sustain efforts in the face of failure and effectively manage stressful situations. . An efficacious learner is aware of the resources at their disposal and takes personal responsibility for the use, care, management, protection and preservation of these resources. A learner with strong self-efficacy is internally motivated to establish and maintain healthy interpersonal relationships. They demonstrate interpersonal relationship skills such as assertiveness, empathy, effective communication, negotiation skills, nonviolent conflict resolution skills and peer pressure resistance skills. Creative and critical thinking that leads to effective decision making and problem solving is based on a strong sense of self-efficacy (British Council, 2016). Capacity building of teachers and parental engagement are two crucial factors in the acquisition of self-efficacy. The school provides opportunities for parents to be empowered and engaged in the affairs and welfare of their children's education.</p>
                        <p><strong>Critical Thinking and Problem Solving.</strong><br>An important outcome of quality education is teaching learners how to think critically. The British Council (2015) identifies three types of thinking: reasoning, making judgements, and problem solving. When learners are empowered with critical thinking, they avoid being subjective and use logic and evidence to arrive at conclusions. Critical Critical thinking also facilitates exploring new ways of doing things and learner autonomy. Learners learn that for every issue there are multiple perspectives that they can explore, rather than a rigid recall and regurgitation of information. Critical thinking is important for lifelong learning. It helps learners to exercise flexibility and open-mindedness to opinions that may sometimes conflict with their own beliefs and positions. Critical thinking and problem solving are useful for learners of all ages and in all the learning areas and disciplines offered in the basic education curriculum. For example, in the sciences learners need to think critically about observations and patterns to develop ideas on how to solve problems. One way of developing critical thinking and problem solving is through provision of age appropriate activities and implementation of suitable programmes in the school curriculum. For example, at pre-primary school level learners can be asked to come up with the best ways of using and keeping their books, stationery and other personal items safe. At the other end of the basic education spectrum, learners can be asked to come up with the best ways of addressing the challenge of scarce resources such as water in the school and community.</p>
                        <p><strong>Creativity and Imagination.</strong><br>Creativity and imagination refers to the ability to form new images and sensations in the mind and to turn them into reality. It is the ability to imagine things that are not real, to form pictures in the mind of things that one has not seen or experienced, and turn those pictures into real things. It also refers to the act or power of forming mental images of things that are not present to the senses, or that are never wholly perceived in reality and creating physical representations of those images. Imagination only exists or happens in the mind, and it remains in the mind. Creativity and imagination is characterized by the ability to perceive the world in new ways, to find hidden patterns, to make connections between seemingly unrelated phenomena and to generate solutions. It is a phenomenon whereby something new and valuable is formed. In educational terms, creativity and imagination refers to the ability of learners and their teachers to form images and ideas in their minds and turn them into real visible creations. Learners who are imaginative and creative are able to make life interesting for themselves and others around them. They are able to use the knowledge, skills and values acquired in the learning process to create new ideas that result in products that add value to their lives and to the lives of others around them. The competence based curriculum endeavours to inspire learners' imagination by presenting knowledge in ways that encourage learners to think as individuals. It creates scenarios that help learners to engage in imagination and encourage them to develop creations steered by the imagination. Their ability to imagine is stretched through exposure to challenging situations that help to expand their thinking and creativity skills. The curriculum also creates room for innovative ways of teaching as well as creating an environment conducive to learning that offers all learners opportunities to explore their full potential in and through creativity and imagination.</p>
                        <p><strong>Citizenship.</strong><br>Historically, human beings have always formed communities based on a shared identity. Such identities are forged in response to a variety of human needs which might be economic, political, religious or social. As group identities grow stronger, those who hold them in commonality with others organize themselves into communities, articulate their shared values and build governance structures to support their beliefs. The individuals in these communities identify themselves as citizens. Citizenship is the state of being vested with the rights, privileges and duties of a citizen. It creates a sense of belonging and attachment to one's nation. A sense of citizenship helps to equip young people to deal with situations of conflict and controversy knowledgeably and tolerantly. They are able to understand the consequences of their actions and those of the adults around them. Global citizenship is a way of living which recognizes that our world is an increasingly complex web of connections and interdependencies. It nurtures personal respect and respect for others wherever they live. It encourages individuals to think deeply and critically about what is equitable and just and what minimizes harm to our planet.</p>
                        <p><strong>Digital Literacy.</strong><br>Digital literacy can be described as having the knowledge, skills and behaviours which are necessary to effectively and safely use a wide range of digital content and devices. Such devices include mobile phones, smart phones, tablets, laptops and desktops among others. All these fall within the category of network enabled devices. Digital literacy focuses mainly on network enabled devices and should not be confused with computer literacy skills. However, traditional forms of literacy and computer literacy are enhancers in the acquisition of digital literacy skills. Individuals are presumed to be digitally literate if they possess a broad range of digital skills and knowledge and have a basic understanding of the potential uses of computing devices. Digital literacy skills also include being able to use computer communication networks, being able to engage in online communication and social networks, being aware of and adhering to ethical behaviour protocols, being aware of societal issues raised through digital media, and being able to search, evaluate and use information channelled through digital platforms. Digital literacy as a competence therefore encompasses knowledge and skills concerning the appropriate application of a variety of hardware platforms such as computers, tablets and mobile devices, and their software including but not limited to web search or internet application software. Digital literacy is a dynamic competence due to the fast-changing world of information communication technology and the ongoing development of technological devices as well as their related software. This is an area in which there is constant innovation and development as the industry attempts to keep up with a globally increasing demand for efficient and effective communication technologies. Currently, digital literacy is considered as one of the main core competencies for learning and life in the 21st century. It challenges existing thinking and practice while leading to a more innovative, creative and often transformational learning.</p>
                        <p><strong>Learning to Learn.</strong><br>Learning is a continuous process that begins at birth and continues until death; it is the process through which we use our experience to deal with new situations and to develop relationships. As a concept, it involves far more than thinking as it incorporates the whole personality - senses, feelings, intuition, beliefs, values and will. If we do not have the will to learn, we will not learn and if we have learned, we are actually changed in some way. If the learning makes no difference it can have very little significance beyond being random ideas that float through our consciousness.</p>
                        <p>Learning to learn is the ability to pursue and persist in learning, to organise one's own learning by the effective management of time and information, both individually and in groups. This competence includes awareness of one's learning process and needs, identifying available opportunities and the ability to overcome obstacles in order to learn successfully. This competence means gaining, processing and assimilating new knowledge and skills as well as seeking and making use of guidance. Learning to learn helps learners to build on prior learning and life experiences in order to use and apply knowledge and skills in a variety of contexts.</p>
                        <p>There are four pillars of learning:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Learning to know,</li>
                            <li>learning to do,</li>
                            <li>learning to be and</li>
                            <li>learning to live together.</li>
                        </ul>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Learner-focused curriculum</strong><br>There is less focus on the school and the system and more focus on education and the learner. The curriculum is responsive and relevant to learner's needs. It enables teachers - who are designers of learning opportunities- to meet the diverse needs of learners.</li>
                            <li><strong>Focus on Competencies</strong><br>There is less focus on content since the goal is appropriate application of knowledge and not just acquisition. A curriculum that focuses on competencies enables the creation of meaningful connections within and among learning areas and disciplines.</li>
                            <li><strong>Opportunities for Local Decision Making and Greater Depth of Study.</strong><br>Prescriptive curricular offer limited flexibility. The goal of CBC is to enable greater flexibility at the local level. Content delivery is flexible and exploratory. Teachers have the autonomy to implement the curriculum while teaching.</li>
                            <li><strong>Balance Between Formative and Summative Assessment</strong><br>CBC offers a range of assessments that focuses on varied assessment of student learning outcomes and cross curricular experiences.</li>
                            <li><strong>Digitally Based</strong><br>The design of the curriculum within a collaborative digital application enables continuous improvement and supports learning with flexible timing and pacing through a range of learning environments.</li>
                            <li><strong>Specific objectives have been changed to specific learning outcomes for each sub-strand in the learning areas and subjects.</strong></li>
                            <li><strong>Developing key inquiry questions that promote inquiry based learning.</strong> This is expected to not only help in contextualising learning but to also enhance differentiated instruction. For example, the teacher can vary the inquiry questions for learners of different abilities while teaching the same concept.</li>
                            <li><strong>Developing an assessment rubric for each of the sub-strands.</strong> A competency-based curriculum requires competency-oriented learning assessment in which formative assessment (for and as learning) is a key feature to complement summative assessment (of learning).</li>
                            <li><strong>Competency-Based Curriculum applies a 2-6-6-3 system</strong> with classes being named as Grades and has the major divisions that include; Early years Educations, Middle school Education and Senior school Education.</li>
                            <li><strong>Learners will have a choice of joining one of three pathways:</strong> Arts and Sports; Social Sciences; or STEM after junior secondary education.Each pathway will have specific tracks .</li>
                            <li><strong>Physical Education and Community Service Learning will be compulsory for all learners.</strong> Community Service Learning will be compulsory as it integrates classroom learning and community service that enables learners to reflect upon their experience and learn from the community, while at the same time enhancing their citizenship through service. Learners will have opportunities to:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Apply their knowledge and skills in the community,</li>
                                    <li>Providing age-appropriate and relevant services.</li>
                                    <li>Interact with experiencea and learn from the community.</li>
                                    <li>Develop employability skills including responsibility, flexibilit and continuous learning through reflection.</li>
                                    <li>Promote their personal growth by forging strong and productive relationships.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Mainstreaming of Pertinent and Contemporary Issues (PCIs).</strong> A major paradigm shift in the curriculum reforms is the recognition that simply teaching subjects or learning areas is not adequate for the achievement of the intended basic education learning outcomes. PCIs are grouped in six broad areas: Global citizenship; Health education; Life skills and values education; Education for sustainable development; Learnersupport programmes; Community Service Learning and parental engagement.</li>
                            <li><strong>Special needs education.</strong> The Framework provides for nurturing the potential of learners with special needs. Education of learners with special needs will start with assessment to determine whether the learner should be placed in a special school, special unit, regular school,or home based programme</li>

                        <ol>
                            <li>The curriculum focuses on the importance of a learner's ability to develop skills and acknowledge and apply those competency skills to solve daily life challenges.</li>
                            <li>Learners have flexibility in exploring content at all angles.</li>
                            <li>CBC education system focus on the learner as an individual rather than the school performance. As a result, the teachers can familiarize themselves with the student's demands regarding strength and weakness. Leaners hence create a good relationship with teachers who help them shape their talents and careers.</li>
                            <li><strong>Balance Education System</strong><br>The education system provides a distinctive assessment with many areas of the learner's development in classwork and co-curricular activities. According to CBC, the learner's ability is tested all-round.</li>
                            <li><strong>Focus on Competencies</strong><br>CBC's central focus is around learners discovering their potentials in life. It creates a platform where the learner can positively relate to acquiring knowledge and skills to connect with various disciplines as they advance to their heights.</li>
                            <li><strong>Community Service Learning</strong><br>Involving learners in community services exposes them to apply the knowledge acquired during their learning period. Practicing their community development skills creates a ground for the teachers to spot learners' creativity and potential in discovering specific talents.</li>
                            <li>The learners are tested on the ability to distinguish what they have learned in class and how practically they can follow instructional approaches in applying the skills. In this manner, the teachers can identify every learner's potential and know what works for them. As a result, it becomes easier to help the learner improve their strength and overcome their weaknesses.</li>
                            <li><strong>Parental Empowerment And Engagement</strong><br>The CBC form of education requires parents to participate in their children's positive outcomes during their primary education levels. The parents provide a conducive learning environment for the learners which motivates them to progress in their learning institutions. Parents need to collaborate with the teachers in providing basic requirements as per the school curriculum demands to enhance the smooth progress of uninterrupted studies.</li>
                            <li>CBC provides learners with a diver's opportunities to learn from to help them narrow to talent identification and potential exploration according to their needs and capabilities. The system encourages learners to develop a positive attitude towards education by allowing them to access equal education opportunities.</li>
                            <li>CBC system is programmed to help the learners appreciate that everyone is different and unique in terms of brain capacity. They are brought to an understanding that it is ok to be gifted differently and that no gifting is independent.</li>
                            <li>CBC exposes the learners to a learning system that demands them to reason, make a reasonable judgement and use creativity in arriving at solutions. As opposed to the former education system where learners were required to remember what they were taught, CBC enables the understanding.</li>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>It is certain that technology will drive the future of education. The new teaching tools that have come up in the wake of the pandemic have proven to be effective for the new generation of learners and educators. Interesting trends have risen in the months that followed the sudden shift to digital education. These include;</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Personalized and paced learning</strong><br>Even though most subjects taught at school aim to increase a student's ability, the road to achieving success can vary from student to student. With the modern learning tools, all students will be able to personalize their learning journey with challenges based on their skill levels, without causing disruption to their peers or educators. This personalization and pace of learning styles can be adopted with ease and help students gain confidence with additional practice and learning methods.</li>
                            <li><strong>Unified learning experiences</strong><br>With the power of technology, it is now possible to chart a learning path right from school to college. The availability of such details to potential college recruiters also help them make an informed decision on student intakes and the admissions process. This trend of easily available information in the form of a single platform to access any student information across their academic paths is revolutionary and unimaginable pre-pandemic.</li>
                            <li><strong>Vocational learning</strong><br>Another emerging trend in education is the emphasis to deliver a vocation-based education and techniques. The job opportunities in today's world are adapting to the massive digital audience and remote-work setups, therefore students will have to inculcate a project-based learning mindset to dovetail into the new stream of jobs. The practical solutions that they can apply to different challenges need to be taught to build their skillsets. Since the mandate of the education policy, institutions are working towards bringing in industry leaders and subject matter experts to coach learners on these aspects and give them a rounded education. Soft skills such as team collaboration, time management, and organizational skills can further help students excel in their academic career.</li>
                            <li><strong>Usage of deep technology</strong><br>A lot of new learning strategies have been introduced to cater to the evolved needs of digital learners. Technologies like gamification through augmented and virtual reality is one of the emerging trends of 2021. Courses designed around these technologies as a base tap into the intrinsic motivation to learn and develop concrete skills outside the setting of a classroom. With appropriate use, lesson concepts are retained better through engagement with the student, and turns them into an active learner over a period of time.</li>
                            <li><strong>Social and emotional learning</strong><br>Social-emotional learning (SEL) is the process of developing the self-awareness, self-control and interpersonal skills that are vital for school, work and life success. There is increasing focus on this aspect of learning in today's school curriculum due to the pandemic's effects on children's social and emotional lives. Aligning learning outcomes keeping the social and emotional learning benefits in mind is paramount to educators and the presentation of such learning offerings presents the educational institution favorably amongst parents and higher education students.</li>
                            <li><strong>Remote assessments</strong><br>Experience-based assessments will be used to test acquired knowledge and skill sets. The current trends and issues in education revolve around maximising lesson retention and minimizing assessment bias by incorporating advanced testing methodologies to give examiners a near-accurate picture of progress. Application-based testing methods to gauge critical thinking are what educators will turn to.</li>
                            <li><strong>Digital literacy curriculum</strong><br>Having a digital literacy curriculum weaved into the mainstream school curriculum will be imperative for students as well as teachers, going forward. Based on the students' developmental stages, appropriately designed lessons which cover the range of learning tools along with potential risks of overuse or misuse are to be covered by the educator.</li>
                            <li>The online platform may also force teachers to change how they teach. They might find it challenging to change how they approach lesson plans to ensure that the students remain engaged even while they cannot see the instructor in person. Platforms may offer opportunities for students to watch lectures live or recorded versions later. The online nature of these courses may also enhance the ability of teachers to offer accommodations for different styles of learning.</li>
                            <li><strong>Soft skills training: a major trend in higher education</strong><br>According to the Future of Jobs report, some of the most important skills in the workplace include critical thinking, problem-solving, people management, and creativity. Employers want to see emerging professionals who understand how to make hard decisions and showcase their leadership abilities. In an effort to prepare students for their future careers, schools must have the training in place to help students nurture and grow in these skill areas.</li>
                            <li><strong>Facilitating learning versus teaching</strong><br>As technology has grown, it has also changed how teachers relate to their students and their classrooms. With a wealth of information at their fingertips, students today have the tools they need to uncover a tremendous amount of facts and knowledge independently. In this environment, many students value less of a top-down delivery method. Instead, a teacher's now function more in a facilitative role. Their job has slowly evolved into a position where they help students understand how to learn, to love learning, and how to uncover and understand the information they find. The best teachers will be those who can help students take ownership of their learning.</li>
                            <li><strong>Life-long learning trend</strong><br>Professionals who want to remain competitive in their environment will need to constantly re-skill themselves. They cannot assume that an education they earned in the first half of their professional career will be all they need for the rest of their working lives. Classrooms must leave opportunities for teaching self-learning skills so that students can continue to learn and engage in their chosen fields.</li>
