                        <p>Soil composition refers to the mixture of various materials that make up soil. It is a crucial factor in determining the soil's fertility, drainage, and overall suitability for supporting plant growth. Soil is composed of several key components, including minerals, organic matter, water, and air. The proportions of these components vary from one soil to another and influence its properties.</p>

                            <li>These are small fragments of rocks and minerals that come from the weathering of parent material (such as bedrock). The size of mineral particles in soil can vary and is categorized into three types:</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Sand:</strong> Large particles that are gritty and allow for good drainage but do not hold nutrients well.</li>
                                <li><strong>Silt:</strong> Smaller particles that feel smooth and soft, helping retain moisture and nutrients.</li>
                                <li><strong>Clay:</strong> Tiny particles that are sticky when wet and retain water and nutrients well but can drain poorly if compacted.</li>

                            <li>The relative amounts of sand, silt, and clay determine the soil texture, which affects water retention, air circulation, and nutrient availability.</li>

                            <li>Organic matter also promotes healthy soil organisms, such as earthworms, which further aid in the breakdown of organic materials and improve soil aeration and structure.</li>

                            <li>Water in the soil exists in pores between soil particles and is essential for plant growth. It dissolves nutrients and minerals that plants can absorb through their roots. Soil water content varies depending on the type of soil, weather, and the presence of plants.</li>
                            <li>The soil's ability to retain water depends on its texture. Clay soils, for example, hold more water, while sandy soils drain quickly.</li>

                            <li>Well-aerated soils allow oxygen to reach plant roots and other organisms, while poorly drained soils may become waterlogged and restrict the flow of air to the roots, leading to reduced plant health.</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>O Horizon (Organic Layer):</strong> The topmost layer, composed of organic material like leaves, dead plants, and animals, as well as decomposed organic matter (humus).</li>
                            <li><strong>A Horizon (Topsoil):</strong> A mix of organic material and mineral particles. This layer is rich in nutrients and supports plant growth.</li>
                            <li><strong>B Horizon (Subsoil):</strong> Contains mineral particles and may accumulate nutrients leached from the upper layers. It has less organic matter and is typically more compact.</li>
                            <li><strong>C Horizon (Parent Material):</strong> Made up of weathered rock and larger soil particles that have not yet fully broken down into smaller components.</li>
                            <li><strong>R Horizon (Bedrock):</strong> The deepest layer, consisting of unweathered rock.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Soil Types Based on Composition:</h3>
                        <p>The proportions of sand, silt, and clay determine the soil type:</p>

                           <span class="heading-text">1. Sandy Soil:</span>
                        </h2>
                        <p>High in sand, it drains quickly but doesn't retain many nutrients. It's loose and airy but may require frequent watering and fertilizing.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">
                            <span class="heading-icon"> </span>
                           <span class="heading-text">2. Clay Soil:</span>
                        </h2>
                        <p>High in clay, it retains moisture well and holds nutrients but may become compacted and poorly drained, leading to root problems.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">

                        </h2>
                        <p>A balanced mix of sand, silt, and clay, considered ideal for most plants. Loam is fertile, drains well, and holds moisture effectively.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Importance of Soil Composition:</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Plant Growth:</strong> Soil composition affects how well plants grow, as it influences nutrient availability, water retention, and root growth. Different plants thrive in different soil types.</li>
                            <li><strong>Soil Fertility:</strong> The organic matter (humus) and minerals in the soil provide essential nutrients to plants. Soil with a good balance of nutrients and proper texture supports healthy plant growth.</li>
                            <li><strong>Water Retention and Drainage:</strong> Soil composition determines how well water is held and drained, influencing plant health. Soils with good drainage prevent root rot, while those with good moisture retention help plants survive dry periods.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Understanding soil composition helps farmers, gardeners, and scientists manage soil for optimal plant growth and sustainable agricultural practices.</p>
