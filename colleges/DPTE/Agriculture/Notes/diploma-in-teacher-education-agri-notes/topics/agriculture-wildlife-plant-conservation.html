                        <p>Wild animals pose a range of threats to farming enterprises, from direct damage to crops and livestock to the destruction of infrastructure and the spread of pests and diseases. To minimize the economic and environmental impacts of wildlife damage, farmers can adopt a variety of prevention and management techniques. Sustainable wildlife management, combined with protective measures, can help mitigate losses while balancing the need for agricultural production and conservation of wildlife.</p>

                        <p>Plant diversity plays a critical role in agriculture by providing numerous benefits that contribute to the sustainability, productivity, and resilience of farming systems. The importance of plant diversity extends beyond simply growing different crops; it involves enhancing ecological balance, improving soil health, and ensuring long-term food security. Below are some of the key reasons why plant diversity is crucial in agriculture:</p>
