                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">a) Describe routine practices in rearing domestic animals</h3>
                        <p>Rearing domestic animals involves a series of routine practices aimed at ensuring the animals' health, well-being, and productivity. These practices can vary depending on the type of animal and the specific farming system, but generally, they follow common principles related to feeding, shelter, health management, and breeding. Below are the key routine practices involved in rearing domestic animals:</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">1. Feeding and Nutrition</h4>
                        <p>Proper feeding is essential for the growth, health, and productivity of domestic animals. Feeding practices differ based on the species of animal, but the basic principles remain consistent.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Providing Adequate Food:</strong> Animals must be given food that meets their nutritional requirements, such as proteins, carbohydrates, vitamins, and minerals. For example:
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Cattle, goats, and sheep:</strong> Typically fed on grass, hay, silage, and sometimes supplementary grains or concentrates.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Pigs:</strong> Given a balanced diet of grains, vegetables, and protein supplements.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Poultry:</strong> Fed a mix of grains, vitamins, and protein-rich feed.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Watering:</strong> Clean and fresh water should be available at all times. Water is crucial for digestion, milk production (in dairy animals), and overall health.</li>
                            <li><strong>Adjusting Feed Based on Life Stage:</strong> Animals may need different diets at various stages of life, such as:
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Young animals (calves, piglets, lambs):</strong> Require milk or milk replacers, followed by starter feeds.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Lactating females:</strong> Require increased feed for milk production.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Mature adults:</strong> Need regular feed for maintenance, growth, and reproduction.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">2. Shelter and Housing</h4>
                        <p>Providing a safe, comfortable, and clean living environment is crucial for the well-being of domestic animals. Shelter practices depend on the species, climate, and farming system.</p>
