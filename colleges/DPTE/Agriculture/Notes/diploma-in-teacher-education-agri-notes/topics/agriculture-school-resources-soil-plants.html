                        <p>Plants growing in the school environment typically have certain characteristics that enable them to thrive in the specific conditions provided by the school grounds. These characteristics depend on the local climate, soil type, maintenance practices, and the purpose of planting (e.g., aesthetic, functional, or educational). Below are some common characteristics of plants found in school environments:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Description:</strong> Plants in the school environment are often chosen for their ability to adapt to the local climate. They may be drought-tolerant (xerophytes) in dry areas or resistant to cold temperatures (hardy plants) in colder regions.</li>
                            <li><strong>Example:</strong> In tropical regions, plants like hibiscus or bougainvillea may be common, while in temperate regions, plants like lavender or pansies are more likely to thrive.</li>

                            <li><strong>Description:</strong> Many plants in school environments are selected for their low maintenance needs. These plants are easy to care for and don't require frequent watering, pruning, or specialized care.</li>
                            <li><strong>Example:</strong> Succulents, marigolds, or grasses are often used in school gardens because they require less attention and can withstand minor neglect.</li>

                            <li><strong>Description:</strong> Plants that grow well in the school environment tend to be tolerant of a range of soil types, including clay, sandy, or loamy soils. Some are also capable of improving soil health through the addition of organic matter or nitrogen fixation.</li>
                            <li><strong>Example:</strong> Leguminous plants like peas or beans, which can fix nitrogen in the soil, or ground covers like clover, are good at enriching soil.</li>
