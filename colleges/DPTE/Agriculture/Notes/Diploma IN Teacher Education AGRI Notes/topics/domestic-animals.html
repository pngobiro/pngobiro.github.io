                        <p>Domestic animals in Kenya refer to animals that have been tamed and bred by humans for specific purposes such as food, labor, companionship, or other uses within a human-controlled environment. These animals are commonly kept in homes, farms, and rural areas, playing a vital role in the livelihoods of Kenyan communities, particularly in agriculture and pastoralism.</p>
