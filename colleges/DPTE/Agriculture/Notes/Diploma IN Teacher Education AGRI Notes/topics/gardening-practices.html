                                            <li><p><strong>Photosynthesis:</strong> Fruit trees, like other plants, absorb carbon dioxide ($\text{CO}_{2}$) and release oxygen during photosynthesis.

Pollinators like bees, butterflies, and birds are attracted to fruit blossoms, promoting biodiversity.</p></li>
                                            <li><p><strong>Soil Enrichment:</strong> Fruit trees help maintain soil structure and fertility. Their root systems prevent soil erosion and improve water infiltration, which helps prevent the degradation of soil. Additionally, fruit tree litter (leaves, fallen fruit) adds organic matter, enriching the soil.</p></li>
