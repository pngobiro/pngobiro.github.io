                                    <li>-Clay soil has small air spaces. It allows water to drain very slowly. It has low drainage capacity. That is why it s easy to get waterlogged</li>
                                    <li>-Sandy soil has large particles and large air spaces between them. It allows water to pass through it very fast. It has high drainage capacity. It dries easily</li>
                                    <li>-Loam soil has its size of particles in between clay and sand. It retains a good amount of water and doesn't become waterlogged easily. For this reason it is good for farming.</li>

                                    <li>-Sandy soil has coarse texture meaning that there will be low water retention, high level of drainage, low capillarity and high aeration which will affect crop performance negatively.</li>
                                    <li>-Clay soil has fine / smooth texture meaning that it has low aeration, has high water retention, has low drainage capacity and high capillarity which affects crop performance negatively.</li>
                                    <li>-Loam soil has moderate texture, meaning that it has moderate water retention, moderate aeration, moderate drainage and moderate capillarity which will give the best crop performance.</li>
