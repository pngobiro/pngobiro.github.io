\section*{NATIONAL GOALS OF EDUCATION}

\section*{Education in Kenya should:}

\section*{1. Foster nationalism and patriotism and promote national unity.}

Kenya is a country with a lot of people who belong to different communities, races, and religions, but these differences need not to divide them.
Education should help young people acquire this sense of national hood by removing conflicts and promoting positive attitudes of mutual respect which enables them to live together in harmony and foster patriotism.
2. Promote the social, economic, technological and industrial needs for national development.
Education in Kenya should prepare the youth of the country to play an effective and productive role in life of the nation.

\section*{a) Social Needs}

Education must prepare children for changes in attitudes and relationships which are necessary for smooth progress of a rapid developing modern economy. Thus education should assist our youth to adapt to this change.

\section*{b) Economic Needs}

Education in Kenya should produce citizens with skills, knowledge, expertise and personal qualities that are required to support a growing economy.

\section*{c) Technological and Industrial Needs}

Education in Kenya should provide learners with necessary skills and attitudes for industrial development.

\section*{3. Promote individual development and self-fulfilment.}

Education should provide opportunities for the fullest development of individual talents and personality. It should help children to develop their potential interest and abilities. A vital aspect of individual development is the building of character.

\section*{4. Promote sound moral and religious values.}

Education should provide for the development of knowledge, skill and attitudes that will enhance the acquisition of sound moral values and help children to grow up into self-disciplined, self reliant and integrated citizens.

\section*{5. Promote social equality and responsibility.}

Education should promote social equality and foster a sense of social responsibility within an education system which provides equal educational opportunities for all.

\section*{6. Promote respect for and development of Kenya's rich and varied cultures.}

Education should instill in the youth of Kenya an understanding of past and present cultures and their valid place in contemporary society.

\section*{7. Promote International consciousness and foster positive attitudes towards other nations.}

Kenya is part of the international community. Education should lead the youths of the country to accept membership of this international community with all the obligations and responsibilities, rights and benefits that this membership entails.
8. Promote positive attitudes towards good health and environmental protection.

Education should inculcate in young people the value of good health in order for them
to avoid indulging in activities that will lead to physical or mental ill health. Thus education should foster positive attitudes towards environmental development and conservation.

\section*{LEVEL LEARNING OUTCOMES}

By the end of the course the teacher trainee should be able to:
1. Model appropriate behavior and values for primary school learners to emulate for development of good citizenship.
2. Communicate and collaborate effectively with learners, peers, parents and the community to create a conducive learning environment.
3. Use appropriate pedagogical approaches to facilitate learning for primary school learners in and out of the classroom.
4. Apply inclusive practices to support all primary school learners including those with disabilities and special educational needs.
5. Employ ICT skills in the learning process to enhance digital literacy.
6. Employ appropriate assessment approaches to promote effective learning.
7. Identify and nurture learner's potential and talents for appropriate placement and transition into lower secondary school.
8. Develop environment conservation skills in primary school learners to promote education for suitable development.
9. Create innovative and effective solutions to challenges in the learning process.
10. Integrate pertinent and contemporary issues in learning to enable learners to cope with daily challenges.

\section*{RESEARCH ON:}
A). Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).....How many are they and which are they?
B). Piaget's Theory of Constructivism (as quoted in Essence Statement)

\section*{HISTORY OF AGRICULTURE.}
- Early man was a fruit gatherer and hunter.
- He trapped and killed animals, birds and fish for food.
- He ate fruits and seeds of certain plants.
- Man had lived many years on Earth before he began practicing agriculture.
-About 9000 BC man planted his own crops which included barley millet, sorghum and wheat.
- The first animal to be kept by man were goats and wild oxen.
-Gradually, man farmed these animals and hunted them near his settlement.
- Over many years both animals and crops became dependent on human beings for their existence. Therefore this process is called domestication.

\section*{ROLES OF AGRICULTURE IN KENYA'S ECONOMY.}
1. Source of food.
- food crop like maize, cassava, rice, bananas, avocados, cabbages, cowpeas, millet etc are grown to feed the nation.
-Agriculture supply food to both rural and urban population.
- when there is enough food for the nation the population uses the energy to build the economy this making a national wealthy.
2. Source of employment.
- Employment means getting an opportunity to work for wages or salaries / to earn money.
-Direct employment-farmers and other people work directly to the farm to plant seeds,weed, spray crops and animals against pests, diseases and parasites,to harvest crops, do mulching, staking,milking animals, cutting animal feeds etc.
-Indirect employment-people working in agro-processing industries e.g Delmonte company in Thika,(pineapples), avocado processing plant ,mango juice plant, ginnery, macadamia factory, coffee factory, posho mills and agro-based Sacco's.
- $70 \%$ of Kenyan population earns from agriculture.

\section*{3. Provision of foreign exchange.}
- is the currency earned after selling agricultural products outside the country.(export)
-we sell coffee, tea, pyrethrum, meat and horticultural products.
$-70 \%$ of Kenya's export are from agriculture.
-Money earned from the sale of export is used to buy(import) materials, commodities like tractors, cars, oil, medicine, fertilizers etc.
4. Source of raw materials for industries.
- Industries concerned with processing of agricultural products depend on agriculture.
E.g
- leather producing industries.- hide and skins from livestock.
- tea factories - tea leaves
- coffee factories.- coffee berries.
- meat processing factories. -livestock
- pyrethrum factories.-pyrethrum flowers.
- posho/ maize mills.- maize.
- breweries industries - barley.
- Textile industries - cotton.
- fruit and vegetable canning industries - fruits and vegetables.
5. Market for industrial goods

Some industries produce goods in agriculture e.g
(a) farm tools and equipment like jembe, spade, panga, wheelbarrow etc
(b) machinery like tractors, plough e.t.c
(c) agrochemicals like herbicides, pesticides, fungicides, rodencides, fertilizers etc -without agricultural sector, such products would have no market.
6. Source of capital/ money.
- when a farmer sells agricultural products ,he/she earns money and uses it to buy farm requirements like pesticides, plough, jembes, spade, wheelbarrow, milking machine and also improve his/her standards of living.
- on the other hand the government applies taxes and tarrifs on sale of agricultural products to finance development projects as infrastructure,hospitals,bridges e.t.c such facilities improve quality of life.
7. Contribute to national and international trade.
- agricultural products make a market , products in our locals markets e.g vegetables,cereals,fruits e.t.c.
- over $70 \%$ of products in open air markets in Kenya are agricultural products.
-Kenya exports agricultural products like coffee, tea,meat e.t.c and this enhances relationship with other nations.

DISCUSS:
HOW AGRICULTURE IN PRIMARY CURRICULUM RELATES TO ROLES OF AGRICULTURE IN KENYAN ECONOMY

\section*{BRANCHES OF AGRICULTURE.}
1. Crop production.
- Field crops- crops grown on relatively extensive area eg.tea, beans, coffee,maize, sugarcane.
- Horticulture- flowers (floriculture) ,fruits(pomology), vegetables (olericulture) also mushrooms.
2.Livestock farming
-Pastoralism.- rearing livestock by nomads in limited places.
-Settled livestock rearing- rearing livestock in permanent settled farms and is done in
high potential areas.
- Fish farming - rearing fish in ponds in the farm.
-Bee keeping -rearing of bees for production of honey and was.
- Poultry farming- rearing birds for eggs and meat production.e.g turkeys, geese, ducks, ostrich, hens.
3. Agricultural economics.-it entails prudent use of scarce resources for maximum production at minimum cost.
4. Agricultural engineering.- This is use and maintenance of farm tools, machinery and structures.
5. Soil science.
6. Entomology
7. Pathology.

\section*{PROBLEMS HINDERING DEVELOPMENT OF AGRICULTURE IN KENYA.}

\section*{1. Labour supply.}
- low labour because of rural- urban migration.
-the aged people are left in rural areas and they do not have energy to do quality farming

\section*{2. Lack of adequate skills and knowledge.}
-some farmers plant their crops late,
- they also plant poor/ uncertified seeds
- do not know how to control pests, parasites and diseases
-fail to carry field practices on crops like thinning, gapping
-fail to carry out livestock management practices like vaccination,
- leads to poor crop and animal husbandry.

\section*{3. Use of poor tools for farming.}
- due to lack of capital and inadequate knowledge.

\section*{4. Pests, parasites and diseases.}
-pests attack crops and destroy roots, stems, leaves and the produce like cereals -parasites attack farm animals either on the skin (ectoparasites) or live inside their bodies (endoparasites)
-Reduce yields and increases cost of production.

\section*{5. Poor means of transport and communication.}
- during rainy seasons, most roads are impassable and this causes delay of the produce reaching the market
- this makes the perishable goods rot and farmers get big loses
6. Cultural and Religious beliefs.
-e.g. muslims don't rear and eat pigs,
-Some nilotic communities keep large herds of cattle and the available pasture cannot sustain them throughout the year
-large number of cattle gives low production due to lack of enough feeds and poor management practices

\section*{7. Poor land tenure system.}
-Most owners may not be planning to use it for agricultural activities but to let it be idle
-other landlords exploit tenants by having unrealistic agreements

\section*{8. Government policy.}

Taxation of agricultural inputs and machines makes it difficult for farmers to afford.

\section*{9. HIV/AIDs and related issues.}
-infected labour mostly is the youth and this leads to low agricultural production
- the affected labour (care-givers) can do very little in agricultural production.

\section*{10. Poor storage of agricultural produce.}
-leads to spoilage due to damage by storage pests or weather conditions hence loss.

\section*{11. Fluctuation of agricultural commodity prices.}
- Due to seasonal nature of some products and perishability, their prices keep on changing and farmers fear producing in large quantities
-brokers in most cases exploit farmers and deny the farmers their actual profits

\section*{12. Lack of capital.}
-most farmers are in need of capital to buy fertilizers, seeds, farm tools and equipment -available loans are charged high interest rates or the loans need security like a title deed and most farmers may not have
- this makes some farmers unable to accomplish some of the tasks needed in agricultural production.

\section*{13. Gender bias and inequality.}
- women and children are taken as labourers in families in some communities while men just sit and command work to be done

\section*{14. Corruption / lack of integrity}
-corrupt activities like land grabbing may lead to landlessness
-may also lead to unequal distribution of resources which discourage and hinder farmers from engaging in agricultural activities
-sometimes the government gives free farm inputs like certified seeds and fertilizers but instead of farmers benefiting, the inputs are diverted to some shops for sale.

\section*{TASK :}

Suggest some possible solutions to the above problems affecting agricultural production

\section*{KEY NATURAL RESOURCES THAT INFLUENCE AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION}

\section*{-They include:}
1. Soil
2. Living organisms
3. Temperature
4. Rainfall and water
5. Light
6. Wind

\section*{SOIL.}
-Is the natural loose material on earth's crust which supports plant growth .
Importance of soil to plant growth.
1. Provides water.
2. Provides anchorage.
3. Provides air.
4. Provides nutrients needed for growth.

\section*{SOIL FORMATION.}
-Formed through weathering process.
-In weathering, rocks are broken into smaller fragments and eventually into individual constituent minerals like gravel, sand, silt etc.

\section*{How weathering takes place (Agents of weathering)}
a). Physical weathering
- rocks collide against each other due to force of running water and wind. -The rocks break into smaller particles.
-Temperature change also cause expansion and contraction and this effect cause rocks to break.
-Freezing of water between cracks of rocks can cause them to break.
b). Chemical weathering
-occurs when some acids react with certain types of rocks e.g carbonic acid dissolve rocks made up of carbonate.
c). Biological weathering
-when big animals like elephants, cattle, buffaloes are in motion they impact pressure on rocks causing them to disintegrate.
-human activities - road construction and tiling lead to breaking of rocks.
-plants roots also grow through rocks and break them.
-animals that burrow on the ground like moles, squirrels break some rocks in the process

\section*{FACTORS AFFECTING SOIL FORMATION.}
1. Climate
- rainfall - water is a medium necessary in weathering.
- temperature- high temperature increase rate of chemical reactions and rocks break.
-wind- causes transport of weathered material.
-sunshine- promotes plant growth whereby roots cause rocks to break.
2. Living organisms.
- small animals like moles, squirrels, earthworm etc burrow the land.
-human activities lead to weathering of rocks.

\section*{3. Topography}
- slope and degree of exposure affect the extend of soil formation hence depth of soil. -soils in gentle slopes and low lying areas tend to be more fertile than those on steep slopes.
-steep slopes have shallow soils (erosion is prone)
-low lying areas and gentle slopes have deep soils because of deposited soil.
4. Parent rock materials.
-The inorganic part of the soil originates from the parent materials.
-This inorganic part influences physical and chemical properties of soil.
-This in turn influences the kind of natural vegetation or crops that grow in that area.
5.Time.
-some rocks take longer time to weather than others.
-deepness or shallowness of soil depends on the duration over which the soil formation process has been active.

\section*{TYPES OF SOIL}
- three major types ; clay, loam, and sand.
-soil types differ on the basis of their physical and chemical characteristics.
- physical characteristics include : colour, texture and structure.
- chemical characteristics include :soil pH and mineral composition.

\section*{CLAY SOIL}

\section*{Characteristics}
-Few air spaces
-Smooth and elastic.
-Form ribbons on rolling.
-Sticks together.
-Has high water holding capacity (WHC)
-High capillarity.
-Expands when wet.
-Cracks when dry.
-Heavy and difficult to work on when growing crops.
-Good for flood irrigation .e.g. in rice growing.

\section*{SAND SOIL}

\section*{Characteristics}
-Does not stick together.
-Low capillarity.
-Rough to touch.
-Coarse textured with large spaces.
-Well aerated.
-Low water retention.
-Easy to cultivate.
-Prone to soil erosion.
-Loosely packed particles.
-No ribbon if rolled.
-Good for vegetable and root crops if a lot of manure is added
-Low plant nutrients.

\section*{LOAM SOIL}

\section*{Characteristics}
-Smooth and coarse particles (moderated texture.)
-Good water retention.
-Moderate aeration.
-Loose ribbon on rolling.
-Stick together fairly.
-Moderately well drained.
-Easy to cultivate.
-Rich in plant nutrients and most crops do well in it.

\section*{SOIL PROFILE}
- is the vertical arrangement of soil into horizons/ layers
-they are (i). Top soil - horizon A
(ii). Sub-soil- horizon B
(iii). Weathered rock- horizon C
(iv). Parent rock- horizon D
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_06_8424b0498731c9ccb70dg-11.jpg?height=864&width=803&top_left_y=282&top_left_x=515)
-a thin layer above the top layer that contains plant and animal remains that are not decomposed is known as organic horizon or superficial layer.

\section*{Characteristics of the horizons}

\section*{1. Top soil (horizon A)}
-small animals, micro-organisms and plant roots are found in this layer
-it has humus therefore it is dark in colour
- since a lot of nutrients are leached from this layer, it is also known as zone of eluviation
-top soil is ploughed for farming activities

\section*{2. Sub-soil (Horizon B)}
-has inorganic materials
-when compared with top soil, it is lighter in colour
-clay deposits are found in this zone
-roots of big trees are found in this layer
-this layer is called zone of illuviation because leached nutrients
accumulate here
-sub-soil has a hardpan, which is an impermeable which is combact and has less soil air
-sub-soil has less nutrients compared to top soil

\section*{3. Weathered rock (Horizon C)}
-no small and micro-organisms and organic matter found in this zone -has loosely and partly weathered rock
-few roots of some trees can be found in this layer
-this layer is thick as compared with other layers

\section*{4. Parent rock (Horizon D)}
-this rock has not been weathered
-it is hard in nature
-it is the original rock that weathering agents act on to break it

\section*{INFLUENCE OF SOIL PROFILE ON CROP PRODUCTION}
1. Determines the type of crop to be grown for example well formed profile is suitable for fruit trees
2. Influences method of tilling and farm tools to be used eg. soils with hard pans may need tractor drawn implement like sub-soilers to break it and make the soil loose and allow water infiltration
3. Influences water infiltration - well formed and deep soil profile allows water on the ground to enter the soil without having runoff
4. Influences the amount of water in the soil- well developed soil profile with deep soil holds more water compared to poor profiles which have shallow soil
5. Influences availability of nutrients- well developed soil profile is well aerated and has living organisms which help in breaking down humus to release nutrients
6. Influences soil mineral content- the mineral content of the soil is determined by the nature of the parent rock

\section*{SOIL TEXTURE}
- This is the smoothness or roughness of soil mineral particles
- It is also known as relative proportion of various mineral particles in the soil
- Soils that are smooth and sticky when wet have fine texture like clay
- Soils that are rough when touched have coarse texture like sand

\section*{Influence of soil texture on crop production}
-soil texture influences:
(i). water holding capacity / water retention capacity
(ii). capillarity hence water distribution
(iii). drainage
(iv). aeration of soil (porosity)
(v). cation exchange capacity hence soil pH
(vi). stickiness of soil

\section*{SOIL FERTILITY}
-is the ability of soil to supply to plants the required nutrients for their growth and development.
-also defined as the ability of soil to produce high crop yields
Characteristics of fertile soil
i). Enough crop nutrients in the right proportions
ii). Well drained and not water-logged
iii). Has the right soil pH for a given crop which help in uptake of mineral salts
iv). Should be well aerated (soil structure affects aeration)
v). Has good water holding capacity for good crop growth
vi). Deep enough for good root growth and development
vii). Should be free crop pests and disease pathogens.

\section*{ESSENTIAL NUTRIENTS}

\section*{Categories:}
a). macro-nutrients
- are needed in large quantities
- include nitrogen, phosphorous, potassium, carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, calcium, sulphur and magnesium.
b). micro-nutrients
- are minor nutrients
- needed in small amounts
- include copper, iron, chlorine, manganese, boron, molybdenum, and zinc.

The role played by nutrients in a plant:
- forms chlorophyll
- protein and enzyme formation
- form and strengthen plant cells
-help in nitrogen fixation
- encourage vegetative growth
- quicken seed formation and fruit ripening
- help in regular opening and closing of stomata
- promote root development and growth

SOIL pH
-this is the alkalinity or acidity of soil
- soil pH scale ranges from 1 to 14
neutral
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_06_8424b0498731c9ccb70dg-13.jpg?height=218&width=1391&top_left_y=2438&top_left_x=364)

Influence of soil pH on plant growth
(i).Determines availability of plant nutrients
(ii).Determines which crop to grow
(iii).Acidic soils favour survival of fungi hence fungal diseases while alkaline soils favour bacteria hence bacterial diseases

\section*{LIVING ORGANISMS}
-They include:
(a).Pollinators- transfer pollen grains from anthers of a flower to the stigma of same flower or another flower eg. birds, insects
(b).Nitrogen fixing bacteria- convert atmospheric nitrogen to nitrates required by plants.
(c).Decomposers- micro-organisms which breakdown organic plant and animal remains recycling nutrients
(d).Pests-attack crops in the field and produce in the store.
(e).Pathogens- cause diseases in crops and animals. (virus, bacteria, fungi \& protozoa)
(f).Parasites- live inside (endoparasites) or on the skin (ectoparasites)
(g).predators- animals that kill others for food. Some are beneficial like predators of pests and parasites except those that attack fish.

\section*{RAIN AND WATER}
-rain is the source of water
-water supports all life processes
-rainfall should be enough to meet crop requirements
-lack of water in plants leads to wilting and dries up
- in animals they get dehydrated and die
-aspects of rainfall that influence agricultural production include: amount of rainfall, rainfall reliability, rainfall distribution and intensity.

\section*{WIND}
-strong winds increase rate of evapotranspiration
-strong winds cause damage to crops
-wind may drive away or bring rain bearing clouds
-wind is an agent of soil erosion and seed dispersal
-wind enhances spread of crop pests and diseases pathogens
-helps in pollination of most cereal plants

\section*{LIGHT}
-required during photosynthesis
-without it plants cannot produce food
-plants grown in dark have yellow leaves, are long and weak
-aspects of light include: light intensity, light duration and light wavelength

\section*{TEMPERATURE}
-refers to the degree of coldness or hotness of a place and measured in degrees Celcius
-crops need their optimum range of temperature in order to produce maximumly -high temp increases maturity of crops, pests (aphids)and disease incidences(leaf rust) -low temp increase quality of tea \& pyrethrum, fungal disease incidences, lowers quality of cotton \& pineapple and retards growth of crops

\section*{AGRICULTURAL RESOURCES IN SCHOOL ENVIRONMENT}

\section*{SOURCES OF WATER}

\section*{1. Rain}
+is collected from rooftops and stored in jerry cans or tanks
-is the purest water when compared with underground and surface water sources

\section*{2. Surface water}

\section*{a). streams, rivers, lakes, dams \& weirs}
-rivers and streams originate from water catchment like hills, mountains \& forests
-rivers and streams can either be permanent or temporary
-most farmers depend on rivers for their water supply
-water from streams \& rivers has to be collected \& distributed to farms
-to make this water distribution easy, dams and weirs should be constructed to raise water level
-when water level is raised it is easy to pump the water or channel it through canals or pipes
- a Weir is a barrier constructed across a river to raise the water level \& still allow the water to flow over it
-a weir can be constructed using stones, concrete or loose stones held by wire mesh
-a dam is a barrier constructed across a river or a dry valley to hold water and raise its level to form a reservoir or lake
-a dam differs from a weir in that it is constructed in such a way it hinders the flow of water and store as much as possible
-a dam should have a spill way for the excess water to flow away
-the accumulated water can be pumped into farms

\section*{b). lakes \& oceans}
-are large water collection bodies
-are fed with water from rain, springs, streams and rivers
-Lake Naivasha and Victoria have fresh water and is supplied by means of pumps \& pipes
-Lake Elementaita and Nakuru have salty water which is not suitable farming

\section*{3. Underground water sources- well, spring, borehole}

\section*{a). A Spring}
- occurs when a soft rock under the ground is filled with water until it overflows onto the land surface
-water may come out in small or large amounts to form a stream
-a small wall can be constructed around the spring to increase the volume of water for easy pumping
-fencing around the spring may keep away animals that may contaminate the water
-if the spring is on a hilly pace, water can be taken to lower ground by use of force of gravity
-water from a spring less contaminated compared to lake or river water

\section*{b). A well}
-is a hole that is dug in the ground until one reaches the water table -the best time to dig a well is during summer season when water table is very low
-this is to ensure that water level does not go below the bottom of the well during the dry season
-fencing around the well is highly recommended to prevent accidents -a concrete slab can be constructed and a lockable lid fixed to avoid accidents, contamination of water and wearing of the top sides of the well -water can be lifted using buckets or simple lift hand pumps

\section*{c). A Borehole}
-very deep hole drilled by use of drilling machine -the holes are sunk into parent rock thus ensuring that water is not lacking -the hole has a small diameter
-the hole is lined with a special metal casing perforated at the bottom end to allow the water to rise up
-special pumps operated using electricity or solar are used to lift water out of the hole
-boreholes are common in areas where rivers and streams are scarce
-borehole water is a bit clean and safe for domestic consumption if properly stored

\section*{ACTIVITIES THAT CAN BE CARRIED OUT BY LEARNERS TO CONSERVE WATER IN THE ENVIRONMENT}
*(Conservation is the practice of using water efficiently to reduce unnecessary water usage)
1. Drip irrigation- deliver water directly to a plant's roots, using a bottle turned upside down
2. Harvesting and storing water
-through house roofs and storing them in tanks or jerry-cans
3.Application of mulch or compost
-dry plant materials around the root zone of plants prevent heat of the sun from reaching the ground thus moisture is retained in the soil
4.Re-use water after washing clothes to clean floors and flush toilets
5.Use water sparingly
-close taps when they don't need the water

\section*{HOW TO DEVELOP A SIMPLE BUSINESS PLAN}

A business plan is a laid down structure of a particular income generating project which should show /have:
1. Project title - activity to be implemented
2. Market-consumers or potential clients
3. Competitors - identify producers of similar products and analyze them
4. Competitive advantage - describe how the product will have advantage over those of competitors eg. through value addition
5. Marketing and distribution - reach out to clients, have advertisement strategy and analysis of customer satisfaction in relation to suppliers
6. Investment required - capital...draw a budget for the requirements and sources of funding
7. Teachers and learners involvement - their roles in project implementation
8. Project income - estimates of daily / periodic production levels, also work out projected annual income

\section*{SOIL COMPOSITION}
-Components or constituents of soil include:
(i). Soil air
(ii). Soil water
(iii). Soil living organisms
(iv). Organic matter/ humus
(v). soil mineral particles

\section*{1. SOIL AIR}
-is found between the soil particles
-soil with a lot of air spaces allows water to move easily
-air in the soil is used by soil living organisms

Activity
-add water to dry soil in a container,
-bubbles will be seen
-bubbles indicate that air is being pushed out

Importance of soil air
-is vital for respiration of plants and animals in the soil

\section*{2. SOIL LIVING ORGANISMS}
-are useful because their activities allow the roots to penetrate well
-living organisms include bacteria which decompose organic matter and also fix atmospheric nitrogen into the soil for plant use
-nitrogen fixing bacteria is called rhizobia
-some micro-organisms in the soil damage crops by causing bacterial and fungal diseases in plants
-nematodes live as parasites in plant roots

\section*{Activity}
-put a sample of fresh moist soil in a muslin bag
-put or hung in a container which has lime water
-cork the container
-observe what happens after 10 minutes

\section*{3. ORGANIC MATTER (OM)}
-this is decaying plant and animal remains
-can be stems, roots, leaves, flowers and dead animals
-when these materials have decomposed completely they form humus which is dark
brown in colour

Activity
-put a sample of dry soil in a container and heat it

Results
-smoke comes out from burning organic matter
-it produces a smell
-it shows that decayed plants and animals are present
Importance of organic matter
-improves water retention in soils (water holding capacity)
-OM is food for living organisms / encourages beneficial soil living organisms
-increases nutrients in the soil / soil fertility
-improves soil structure and aeration
-dark colour helps to absorb heat from the sun

\section*{4.MINERAL PARTICLES}
-they are available in the soil after weathering process
-mineral matter of soil is made up of inorganic compounds
-plant need mineral salts which dissolve in water for their growth and development
-mineral particles include: gravel, coarse sand, fine sand, clay and silt

\section*{Activity}
-put garden soil sample in a transparent bottle and add water three quarter the measure
-shake the container and leave it for two hours and observe

Importance of soil mineral particles
-to provide main natural source for mineral nutrients which is made available to plants through weathering process
-clay fraction is made up of special colloidal properties. Clay colloids and humus act as store house for availability of plant nutrients

\section*{5.SOIL WATER}
-water in the soil dissolves nutrients so that the roots can absorb
-water is transported to the leaves where it is used during photosynthesis

Activity
-put garden soil sample in a sufuria with a lid and heat it
-observe after five minutes by lifting the lid Observation
-droplets of water are observed on the lid meaning that soil has water

Importance of water in the soil
-is the source of water that is used in photosynthesis
-it is a coolant
-is a solvent for nutrients in the soil
-it forms part of a plant cell

\section*{SOIL PHYSICAL PROPERTIES}
1. Capillarity

A task: Investigating Capillarity
-materials needed -water, trough, cotton wool or small pieces of cloth, three glass tubes and plasticine. Empty transparent tubes can be used as glass tubes.
- place an equal amount of cotton wool or cloth at one end of each tube
-use plasticine or any suitable material to support them upright in a trough
-measure equal amount of each type of soil (sand, loam and clay) and put in the tubes
-add some water in the trough
-leave the tubes for sometime, around 30 miutes
-the set up can be placed where it can be viewed after the lesson
- this is because water may still be rising by the time the lesson ends

Observation
-during the first few minutes, water rises very fast in sandy soil
-when the set up is left for one and half hours, the water level in the clay is highest, followed by loam and then sand.
-water in soil rises by capillarity to the point where roots absorb it
2. Drainage / water retention

Activity: To investigate drainage in soil
-materials needed: water, measuring cylinder, dry soil samples, watch, cotton wool or small pieces of cloth, three funnels
-graduate a transparent bottle to make an improvised measuring cylinder if you don't have one
-to improvise a funnel, cut a plastic bottle and use the upper part as a funnel

Design an experiment to find out which soil drains water well
-fix equal pieces of cotton wool or cloth in the funnels
-place the funnels on the measuring cylinders
-measure an equal amount of each type of soil (loam, sandy and clay)
-measure an equal amount of water and slowly add to each soil sample at the same time
-leave the three types of soil for 15 minutes
-observe the amount of water collected from each type of soil.

Questions
(i). Which soil drains water very fast?
(ii). Which soil drains water slowly?
(iii). Which type of soil in the set up would be suitable for farming?
-Clay soil has small air spaces. It allows water to drain very slowly. It has low drainage capacity. That is why it s easy to get waterlogged
-Sandy soil has large particles and large air spaces between them. It allows water to pass through it very fast. It has high drainage capacity. It dries easily -Loam soil has its size of particles in between clay and sand. It retains a good amount of water and doesn't become waterlogged easily. For this reason it is good for farming.
3. Soil textural feel
-Sandy soil has coarse texture meaning that there will be low water retention, high level of drainage, low capillarity and high aeration which will affect crop performance negatively.
-Clay soil has fine / smooth texture meaning that it has low aeration, has high water retention, has low drainage capacity and high capillarity which affects crop performance negatively.
-Loam soil has moderate texture, meaning that it has moderate water retention, moderate aeration, moderate drainage and moderate capillarity which will give the best crop performance.

\section*{SOIL USES IN AGRICULTURE}
1. Soil provides structural support to plants.
2. Soil provides nutrients for the growing crops
3. Soil is a home for crop-benefitting organisms
4. Soil provides water needed by the crops
5. Soil provides air which vital in respiration of soil animals.

TASK:
Search the internet and watch video clips on agricultural activities carried out in different types of soils (sand, clay and loam)

\section*{SOIL EROSION}

Definition: - is the removal and carrying away of top fertile soil by wind, water and animals.

Agents of soil erosion
1. Wind - blows bare soil particles and carries them to other places
2. Water-carries soil particles when it rains
3. Animals - animals feet \& human activities increase soil erosion eg. road construction, cultivation

\section*{EFFECTS OF SOIL EROSION ON AGRICULTURE}
> -Soil erosion removes valuable top soil which is the most productive part of the soil profile for agricultural purposes.
> -the loss of this top soil results in lower yields and higher production costs
> -when top soil is gone, erosion can cause rills and gullies that make the cultivation of the land impossible

\section*{TYPES OF SOIL EROSION}
1. Raindrop / splash erosion
-when a raindrop falls on the ground, it hits some soil particles
- a small hole may be formed
2. Sheet erosion
-takes place on a flat ground
-soil is carried at that level ground uniformly
3. Rill erosion
-small channels are formed in which soil is carried by water
4. Gulley erosion
-big channels are formed in which soil is carried by water

\section*{SOIL EROSION CONTROL MEASURES}
1. Mulching
2. Construct terraces on hilly farms
3. Building gabions / porous dams
4. Planting trees
5. Planting cover crops eg sweet potato vines
6. Erection of trash lines or stone lines along the contours
7. Ploughing along the contours
8. Use cut off drains and grassed water ways
9. Educate people on the importance of soil erosion control measures and mobilize the community in preventing soil erosion.

\section*{SOIL RECOVERY}
-This involves collecting and making use of soil from erosion deposition sites for farming purposes.
-Sites of soil deposition by water runoff should be identified -deposited soil can be collected by use of :
a). a spade and a wheelbarrow then taken to be used in a demonstration plot or on a vertical gardening structure like a sack
b). a cut out small jerry can that can be used to scoop the soil deposits and put in cartons and be taken to school to be used in a demonstration plots, vertical gardening or on tins/ containers.
-the collected soil deposits can be used to grow vegetables like spinach, kales, cabbages etc
TASK:
1. Collect soil from deposition sites to recover and use it in crop demonstration plots.
2. Identify the community service learning (CSL) activity in a selected substrand of Agriculture curriculum design for upper primary and suggest other possible CSL activities.
