                        <p>Adulthood has no signpost to announce its onset (as adolescence is announced by puberty). In technologically advanced nations, the life span is more than 70 years. Developmental psychologists usually consider early adulthood to cover approximately age 20 to age 40 and middle adulthood approximately 40 to 65.</p>
                        <p><strong>Early adulthood.</strong> In early adulthood, an individual is concerned with developing the ability to share intimacy, seeking to form relationships and find intimate love. Long-term relationships are formed, and often marriage and children result. The young adult is also faced with career decisions.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Choices concerning marriage and family are often made during this period. Research shows that divorce is more likely among people who marry during adolescence, those whose parents were divorced, and those who are dissimilar in age, intelligence, personality, or attractiveness. Separation is also more frequent among those who do not have children. Most people who have divorced remarry; consequently, children may experience more than one set of parents.</li>
                            <li>Such alternatives to marriage as "living together" ( cohabitation) have become more common. In 1997, the Census Bureau estimated that 4.13 million unwed couples lived in the United States.</li>
                            <li>Work/career choice affects not only socioeconomic status but also friends, political values, residence location, child care, job stress, and many other aspects of life. And while income is important in both career selection and career longevity, so are achievement, recognition, satisfaction, security, and challenge. In the modern cultures of many nations, the careers of both spouses or partners frequently must be considered in making job choices.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Middle adulthood.</strong> In middle adulthood, an important challenge is to develop a genuine concern for the welfare of future generations and to contribute to the world through family and work. Erik Erikson refers to the problem posed at this stage as generativity vs. self-absorption. Robert Havighurst lists seven major tasks in the middle years.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>accepting and adjusting to physiological changes, such as menopause</li>
                            <li>reaching and maintaining satisfaction in one's occupation</li>
                            <li>adjusting to and possibly caring for aging parents</li>
                            <li>helping teenage children to become responsible adults</li>
                            <li>achieving adult social and civic responsibility</li>
                            <li>relating to one's spouse as a person</li>
                            <li>developing leisure-time activities</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>While a midlife crisis is not regarded as a universal phenomenon, during one's 40s and 50s comes the recognition that more than half of one's life is gone. That recognition may prompt some to feel that the clock is ticking and that they must make sudden, drastic changes in order to achieve their goals, while others focus on finding satisfaction with the present course of their lives.</p>
                        
                        <h2 id="late_adulthood" class="section-heading"><span class="heading-text">Development in Late Adulthood</span></h2>
                        <p>Late adulthood (old age) is generally considered to begin at about age 65. Erik Erikson suggests that at this time it is important to find meaning and satisfaction in life rather than to become bitter and disillusioned, that is, to resolve the conflict of integrity vs. despair. It has been estimated that by the year 2030, Americans over 65 will make up 20% of the population. Despite the problems associated with longevity, studies of people in their 70s have shown that growing old is not necessarily synonymous with substantial mental or physical deterioration. Many older people are happy and engaged in a variety of activities. Gerontology, an interdisciplinary field that studies the process of aging and the aging population, involves psychology, biology, sociology, and other fields.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Theories of successful ageing.</h3>
                        <p>Theories of successful aging include the following:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The <strong>disengagement theory</strong> states that as people age, their withdrawal from society is normal and desirable as it relieves them of responsibilities and roles that have become difficult. This process also opens up opportunities for younger people; society benefits as more-energetic young people fill the vacated positions.</li>
                            <li>The <strong>activity theory</strong> contends that activity is necessary to maintain a "life of quality," that is, that one must "use it or lose it" no matter what one's age and that people who remain active in all respects-physically, mentally, and sociallyadjust better to the aging process. Proponents of this theory believe that activities of earlier years should be maintained as long as possible.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Ageism.</h3>
                        <p>Ageism may be defined as the prejudice or discrimination that occurs on the basis of age. Although it can be used against people of all ages, older people are most frequently its target and it may often result in forced retirement. Stereotyping of the elderly is also an aspect of ageism, as seen in such a statement as "He drives like a little old lady."</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Physical changes.</h3>
                        <p>People typically reach the peak of their physical strength and endurance during their twenties and then gradually decline. In later adulthood, a variety of physiological changes may occur, including some degree of atrophy of the brain and a decrease in the rate of neural processes. The respiratory and circulatory systems are less efficient, and changes in the gastrointestinal tract may lead to increased constipation. Bone mass diminishes, especially among women, leading to bone density disorders such as osteoporosis. Muscles become weaker unless exercise programs are followed. The skin dries and becomes less flexible. Hair loss occurs in both sexes. There is also decreased sensitivity in all of the sensory modalities, including olfaction, taste, touch, hearing, and vision.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Cognitive changes.</h3>
                        <p>The study of cognitive changes in the older population is complex. Response speeds (neural and motor) have been reported to decline; some researchers believe that age-related decrease in working memory is the crucial factor underlying poorer performance by the elderly on cognitive tasks.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Intellectual changes in late adulthood do not always result in reduction of ability. While fluid intelligence (the ability to see and to use patterns and relationships to solve problems) does decline in later years, crystallized intelligence (the ability to use accumulated information to solve problems and make decisions) has been shown to rise slightly over the entire life span. K. Warner Schaie and Sherry Willis reported that a decline in cognitive performance could be reversed in 40% to 60% of elderly people who were given remedial training.</li>
                            <li>Dementias are usually responsible for cognitive defects seen in older people. These disorders, however, occur only in about 15% of people over 65. The leading cause of dementia in the United States is Alzheimer's disease, a progressive, eventually fatal disease that begins with confusion and memory lapses and ends with the loss of ability to care for oneself.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Retirement.</h3>
                        <p>Retirement at age 65 is the conventional choice for many people, although some work until much later. People have been found to be happier in retirement if they are not forced to retire before they are ready and if they have enough income to maintain an adequate living standard. Chronic health problems such as arthritis, rheumatism, and hypertension increasingly interfere with the quality of life of most individuals as they age.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Widowhood.</h3>
                        <p>Women tend to marry men older than they are and, on average, live 5 to 7 years longer than men. One study found ten times as many widows as widowers. Widowhood is particularly stressful if the death of the spouse occurs early in life; close support of friends, particularly other widows, can be very helpful.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Death and dying.</h3>
                        <p>Death and dying has been studied extensively by Elisabeth Kübler-Ross, who suggested that terminally ill patients display the following five basic reactions.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Denial</strong>, an attempt to deny the reality and to isolate oneself from the event, is frequently the first reaction.</li>
                            <li><strong>Anger</strong> frequently follows, as the person envies the living and asks, "Why should I be the one to die?"</li>
                            <li><strong>Bargaining</strong> may occur; the person pleads to God or others for more time.</li>
                            <li>As the end nears, recognition that death is inevitable and that separation from family will occur leads to feelings of exhaustion, futility, and deep <strong>depression</strong>.</li>
                            <li><strong>Acceptance</strong> often follows if death is not sudden, and the person finds peace with the inevitable.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>People who are dying are sometimes placed in a hospice, a hospital for the terminally ill that attempts to maintain a good quality of life for the patient and the family during the final days. In a predictable pattern after a loved one's death, initial shock is followed by grief, followed by apathy and depression, which may continue for weeks. Support groups and counselling can help in successfully working through this process.</p>
                        
                        <h2 id="darling_paradigm" class="section-heading"><span class="heading-text">Darling's Spiritual Growth Paradigm</span></h2>
                        <p>Harold Darling (1969) has suggested a four-stage model of spiritual development based Upon the stages of physical and emotional development. Just as individuals develop through Birth, childhood, adolescence, and adulthood, likewise these terms may be used to describe Spiritual development.</p>
                        <p>Darling's first spiritual stage is "birth." The initial crisis in physical and social Development is when the newborn first sees the light of the outside World. Darling writes:</p>
                        <blockquote>
                            Life in Christ begins with a birth experience. This "new birth" is Attended by pain and suffering; it comes about by confession of our Sins, commitment of our total being to God, and faith that God Honors that commitment (pp. 142-143).
                        </blockquote>
                        <p>The Bible repeatedly describes conversion as birth. Christ's conversation with Nicodemus is perhaps the most vivid comparison of physical and spiritual birth (John 3). This analogy for conversion is also mentioned in John 1:13; Galatians 4:29; 1 Peter 1:23; and I John 2-5. The "born again" experience is a thoroughly biblical concept.</p>
                        <p>Human birth is preceded by a period of preparation in which the embryo and later the fetus develops through stages. Engel and Norton (1975) have suggested a process of development prior to spiritual birth in which God brings an individual to salvation. This development process includes:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>awareness of a supreme being through general revelation;</li>
                            <li>initial awareness of the Gospel;</li>
                            <li>grasping the implications of the Gospel;</li>
                            <li>a positive attitude toward the Gospel;</li>
                            <li>personal problem recognition;</li>
                            <li>a decision to act;</li>
                            <li>repentance and faith in Christ,</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Engel and Norton state that successful evangelism will stimulate movement through these stages until spiritual birth occur.</p>
                        <p>Subsequent to birth, one enters the stage of childhood. Says Darling:</p>
                        <blockquote>
                            The childhood stage of Christian living is characterized by growth, security, spontaneity, and conformity. We accept the teachings of authority (specifically parents and church) without questions. We are living in the "awe" stage of our relationship to God, and our obedience follows a rather easy, natural course (pp. 143-144).
                        </blockquote>
                        <p>Biblical analogies to such a spiritual stage are abundant. Jesus stated that one must become like a child to enter the kingdom of God (Matthew 18:4). He also stated that the kingdom of God belongs to those who are like children (Mark 10:14). Christ compares His disciples to youngsters (Matthew 11:25). Likewise, Peter compared young Christians to children: "Like newborn babies, crave pure spiritual milk, so that by it you may grow up in your salvation" (1 Peter 2:2, NIV)</p>
                        <p>Eventually most Christians begin to outgrow spiritual childhood. Doubts and questioning begin to characterize a new stage of spiritual development-adolescence. Darling states:</p>
                        <blockquote>
                            We become vaguely discontented with the spiritual status quo... our Christian living is too ordinary; our God is too small...such an awareness produces a crisis: something must be done (p. 145).
                        </blockquote>
                        <p>Spiritual adolescence has been further explored as a necessary transition by Berry (1980). Citing a number of case histories from his counseling practice, he emphasizes the commonness of such an experience. Often persons going through this turbulent period of spiritual growth will seek out a counselor or pastor to assist them. Berry suggests that these individuals should be instructed to see the present situation as a "Jordan-crossing" experience and to direct the counselee's attention to Canaan on the other side (spiritual adulthood). In the process of this change the "narcissism of childhood" becomes less prominent.</p>
                        <p>Such a period of spiritual turbulence has often preceded vibrant ministries, both among those espousing Wesleyan theology and those who hold to Reformed doctrines. Edman (no date) describes such experiences in the lives of J. Hudson Taylor, Walter Wilson, D.L. Moody, Richard Halverson and others prior to being greatly used by God.</p>
                        <p>Borrowing heavily from psychodynamic theory, Darling suggests seven possible means of resolving the conflicts of spiritual adolescence. Six of the seven are spiritually dysfunctional, with the seventh being the key to spiritual adulthood. Spiritual "neurosis" is one means used to reduce the conflicts of this third stage; the individual becomes a "spiritual hypochondriac" in which there is abnormal concern about the spiritual condition? A second alternative is spiritual "psychosis" in which minor issues and doctrines are elevated, and a fanaticism develops which lacks depth and power.</p>
                        <p>A third possibility is re-enslavement in which the person is overcome with defeat and life becomes much like that which existed prior to salvation. A fourth path, is regression; returning to the narrow conformity of childish immaturity in which others are allowed to do the thinking. Fixation can be a fifth way of attempting to resolve the crisis. This involves a perpetual adolescence with turmoil, and faultfinding a permanent way of life. Darling writes:</p>
                        <blockquote>
                            There is however, another alternative, and that is surrender. We embrace the way of faith, commitment, and abandonment; the Holy Spirit takes control. We appropriate the power that has motivated the great souls of all the ages, enabling them to overcome their self-centeredness and unholy fear. . . . This is the life, we confidently assent, that Christ promised us in John 10:10, "I came that they may have life, and have it more abundantly" (p. 146).
                        </blockquote>
                        <p>This surrender introduces a fourth stage, that of adult maturity. Again, a number of Scriptures describe maturity in contrast to earlier spiritual immaturity, using the human growth analogy. Elementary truths are considered to be milk for infants, while mature Christians are to eat "solid foods" (i.e., advanced teaching) as an adult would (Hebrews 5:13-14). Rather than students, as children would be, individuals become teachers as spiritual adults (Hebrews 5:12). Paul says, "Then we will no longer be infants . . . blown here and there by every wind of teaching. [but) instead, speaking the truth in love, we will in all things grow up into him..," (Ephesians 4:14-15, NIV).</p>
                        <p>Spiritual adulthood possesses at least some of the characteristics of selfactualization. Oakland (1974) suggests that the Wesleyan view of sanctification may be equated with self actualization, including Maslow's peak experiences. Elsewhere in his book, Darling describes the abundant Christian life in terms not uncommon in actualization psychology: confident surrender, transparent spontaneity, adjusting tension, purposeful integration, and wholehearted affirmation.</p>
                        <p>During both childhood and adulthood, Darling suggests that there are "loops" in spiritual growth. These are periods of struggle, which include confrontation with "sins, glaring imperfections, moods, destructive tensions, and ever-present proneness to wander from the path of faith and obedience" (pp. 146-147). Rather than succumbing to these, however, the adult practices confession, affirmation, and appropriation through prayer and acting upon the insight received. Such experiences are integral to the growth process, regardless of the spiritual stage. These spiritual loops are not unlike Bright's (1966) concept of spiritual breathing.</p>
                        <p>Bright suggests that when a problem is found in one's life which is displeasing to God, one should first confess and repent (exhaling) and then surrender and appropriate (inhaling). Darling's spiritual "loops" also remind one of Wesley's account of growth prior to, and subsequent to, a second crisis experience.</p>
