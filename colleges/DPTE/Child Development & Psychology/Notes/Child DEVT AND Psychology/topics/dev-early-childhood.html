                        <p>We have termed this stage in the developmental process of humans, the "Play Years", because this aspect, as much as any other, seems to characterize the most important context in which development occurs. While we examine the physical development during this stage that moves from an emphasis on the Gross and McIlveen to the fine motor skills, we consider in greater detail the cognitive aspect of development as the child begins to think about its world. We examine three perspectives on the cognitive development of children including representation of experiences, learning and language development. In addition, we also consider the emotional and personality development of children particularly in play situations, in contexts ranging from the home to daycare and pre-school.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">The roles nature and nurture play in the development of a young child</h3>
                        <p>The template Nature/Nurture and Human Development depicts the interactions between heredity, the environment and the organism. Note how heredity and experience combine to influence the organism. The next level of interaction happens between the current organism and the current situation that results in the current behaviour. This behaviour, in turn, influences the genetic dispositions and preferences of the organism and the cycle or process is repeated.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">How the various domains influence development during early childhood</h3>
                        <h4>Physical development</h4>
                        <p>The average child grows six centimeters in height and gains two to three kilograms a year during early childhood. Growth patterns vary individually though. By age five, the brain has reached ninetenths of its adult size. Some of its size increase is due to the number and size of nerve endings. Gross motor skills increase dramatically during early childhood. Young children are more active than at any other period in the lifespan. Fine motor skills also increase substantially during early childhood (Santrock, 1999, p. 261).</p>
                        
                        <h4>Cognitive development</h4>
                        <p>Piaget's stage of pre-operational thought is the beginning of the ability to reconstruct at the level of thought what has been established in behaviour and a transition from primitive to more sophisticated use of symbols. The child does yet think in an operational way. Pre-operational thought consists of two sub stages: symbolic function (two to four years) and intuitive thought (four to seven years). The child's attention improves dramatically during the early childhood years, as doe's short-term memory. Young children develop a curiosity about the nature of the human mind. Advances in language development also occur during early childhood. Vygotsky's theory emphasizes the zone of proximal development, the merging of language and thought from three to seven years of age and the socio-cultural contexts of cognitive development. Child-centered kindergarten and developmentally appropriate education are important dimensions of early childhood development, as are quality Head Start programs. A current concern is that too many preschool and early childhood education programs place too much emphasis on academic achievement (Santrock, 1999, p. 261).</p>

                        <h4>Socio-emotional development</h4>
                        <p>Authoritative parenting is associated with children's social competence. Parents need to adapt their strategies as the child grows older using less physical manipulation and more reasoning.</p>
                        <p>Crosscultural and ethnic variations occur. In some cases, siblings are stronger socialization agents than parents. Children live in changing families; more children today grow up in working mother and divorced families. Depression in parents is associated with adjustment problems in children. Peers are powerful socializing agents who provide a source of information and social comparison outside the family. Play also is an important aspect of the young child's development. Parten year developed a number of categories of social play. Among the most important types of children's play is sensor motor practice play, pretence/symbolic play, social play, constructive play, and games. Television is another socializing influence in children's development. Children watch a huge amount of television; preschool children watch an average of four hours a day. A special concern is the television violence children see. Erikson believes that early childhood is a period when the self involves resolving the conflict between initiatives versus guilt. In early childhood, the physical and active self becomes a part of self-understanding. Gender identity is the sense of being male or female which most children acquire by three years of age. Identification, social learning, cognitive development and gender-schema theories have been proposed to explain children's gender development. Peers are especially adept at rewarding gender-appropriate behaviour. Piaget distinguished between the heteronymous morality of younger children and the autonomous morality of older children. In addition to moral thought, moral behaviour and moral feelings are important dimensions of children's moral development (Santrock, 1999, p. 261).</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">The socio-cultural influences on child development</h3>
                        <p>Vygotsky's portrait of children's development suggests that children actively construct their knowledge, and that it is inseparable from social and cultural activities. In Vygotsky's theory, knowledge is situated and distributed among people and environments which include objects, artifacts, tools, books, and the communities in which people live, and collaborate, advanced through interaction with others in cooperative activities (Gross and McIlveen, 1998, p. 365).</p>

                        <h2 id="teacher_information_2" class="section-heading"><span class="heading-text">Teacher Information</span></h2>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">How the brain develops during early childhood</h3>
                        <p>One of the most important physical developments during early childhood is the continuing development of the brain and nervous system. While the brain continues to grow in early childhood, it does not grow as rapidly as in infancy. By the time children have reached three years of age, the brain is three-quarters of its adult size. By age five the brain has reached about nine-tenths of its adult size. Part of the increase in brain weight is due to continued proliferation of communication pathways (via the growth of dendrites and axons) among the brain's various specialized areas in response to the child's specific experiences. Another part of brain growth is due to ongoing myelination - the insulating process that speeds up the transmission of neural impulses. Finally, several areas of the brain undergo notable expansion, in particular those areas dedicated to control and coordination of the body, the emotions, and thinking processes.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">How important nutrition is to healthy and proper childhood development</h3>
                        <p>With their growth slowed, children need fewer calories per pound of body weight during the preschool years than they did from birth through toddler hood - especially if they are modern, sedentary children who spend most of their time indoors. As a result, their appetites become markedly smaller, a fact that causes many parents to fret, threaten, and cajole to get their children to eat more. A related problem is that many children like most adults, eat too few fruits and vegetables and consume too much fat. No more than 30 percent of daily calories should come from fat, but six out of seven preschoolers in the United States exceed that limit. Interestingly, one North American study found that both children whose family income is below the poverty level and children whose family income is three times above it are more likely to exceed the 30 percent fat limit, compared to those whose income lies somewhere in between.</p>

                        <h2 id="cognitive_domain" class="section-heading"><span class="heading-text">Early Childhood Development: Cognitive domain</span></h2>
                        <p>Perhaps more so than at any other stage of development, early childhood is a time of phenomenal cognitive growth and development, highlighted in particular by language development. It may take several class periods to cover all the information presented on this LESSON.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">The process of language development in early childhood</h3>
                        <p>The social learning view suggests that speech is acquired through a combination of conditioning and imitation. Presumably, children are praised or otherwise rewarded by their parents for making sounds approximating those of their native language. In addition, parents often model sounds, words or sentences for them.</p>
                        <p>A sharply different view has been proposed by linguist Noam Chomsky (1968): the innate mechanism view. According to Chomsky, language acquisition is at least partly innate. Human beings, he contends, have a language acquisition device - a built-in neural system that provides them with an intuitive grasp of grammar.</p>
                        <p>Cognitive theory recognizes the importance of both innate mechanisms and learning. This theory suggests that children possess certain information-processing abilities or strategies that they use in acquiring language.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">The method of discipline that works</h3>
                        <p>There are several forms of discipline for helping children as they grow into socially capable people:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Spanking.</strong> While most parents have experienced the urge to spank children, and many have resorted to spanking their kids, there are problems with this form of discipline. Spanking may give children a clear message about the unacceptability of their behaviour and sometimes stops the behaviour in the short run. However, in the long run, it teaches children that it is all right to hit, and that it is all right to be hit. Even children are confused by the irony of the statement, "This spanking will teach you not to hit your brother."</li>
                            <li><strong>Time-outs.</strong> Giving children a short time-out can give them the chance to reflect on their behaviour, and also a clear message that a certain behaviour would not be allowed. This can be an effective method of teaching. Time-outs can also give an angry, frustrated parent a chance to calm down and respond more rationally. It is suggested that a child be given a time-out equal in minutes to her age (a four-minute time out for a four-year-old child). It is not recommended to use time-outs with children under the age of three. The problem with time-outs is that they take a child away from a valuable learning experience. A child who hits another child can begin to learn empathy from watching the other's child's response to being hurt, and if he stays around, he may also be able to participate in helping the other child feel better.</li>
                            <li><strong>Talking with children.</strong> Talking with children offers rich opportunities for learning alternatives to hitting. It is often necessary to give children some specific suggestions about what they can say when they have strong feelings. Sometimes the suggestion, "Use your words," doesn't give children enough of an idea of what they could say.</li>
                            <li><strong>Help children come up with alternative solutions.</strong> What children usually want when they take toys from each other is a chance to play together. If you can offer them suggestions for other ways to play together, they may be able to let their conflict go. "It looks like Jeffy wants to play trucks with you. Can you find him a truck he could use?" Or, "Jeffy looks really interested in what you are doing with your truck. Could he help you make a road for the truck?"</li>
                            <li><strong>Set limits and follow through.</strong> It is important that children know that hitting is unacceptable. If your child is unable to stop himself from hitting his brothers after you have offered alternative ways for him to express his feelings and communicate his ideas, you can offer him a final choice. "Can you be safe with Jeffy or shall I help you move to the other room to play away from Jeffy until you can be safe with him?"</li>
                            <li><strong>Remember that it takes time, repetition and modeling.</strong> Children do not learn communication and problem-solving skills quickly. It takes time and repetition in many different circumstances before they really get it. If you stay focused on teaching your children these skills and gently model the ways you want them to interact, slowly they will begin to acquire the skills (Davis and Keyser, 1997, pp. 218-239).</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h2 id="self_personality" class="section-heading"><span class="heading-text">The Self and Personality</span></h2>
                        <p>This lesson addresses how young children develop from a basic temperament, to an increasing selfawareness and self-concept, to the beginnings of personality.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">How, and when, young children develop a sense of self</h3>
                        <p>Toward the end of the second year of life children develop a sense of self. During early childhood, some important developments in the self take place. Among these developments are facing the issue of initiative versus guilt and enhanced self-understanding (Alcock et al., 1998, p. 69).</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">How personalities develop</h3>
                        <p>The psychodynamic approach as advanced by Sigmund Freud, proposed that personality and behaviour are determined more by psychological factors than by biological conditions or current events. He suggested that people may not know why they think, feel or act the way they do because they are partly controlled by the unconscious portion of the personality - the part of which people are normally unaware (Bernstein and Nash, 1999, p. 408).</p>
                        <p>The trait approach to personality makes three main assumptions:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Personality traits remain relatively stable and therefore predictable over time.</li>
                            <li>Personality traits remain relatively stable across diverse situations, and they can explain why people act in predictable ways in many different settings.</li>
                            <li>People differ with regard to how much of a particular personality trait they possess; no two people are exactly alike on all traits. The result is an endless variety of unique personalities (Bernstein and Nash, 1999, p. 413).</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>A cognitive-behavioural approach views personality as a set of behaviours that people acquire through learning and then display in particular situations. It defines personality as the sum total of the behaviours and cognitive habits that develop as people learn through experience in the social world (Bernstein and Nash, 1999, p. 421).</p>
                        <p>The phenomenological (humanistic) approach maintains that the primary human motivator is an innate drive toward personal growth that prompts people to fulfill their unique and natural potential. Like the planted seed that naturally becomes a flower, people are inclined towards goodness, creativity, love and joy. Proponents of this theory emphasise that each individual perceives reality somewhat differently and that these differences, rather than traits, instincts or learning experiences, are central to creating personality differences (Bernstein and Nash, 1999, p. 424).</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">What aspects of a child's world influence personality development?</h3>
                        
                        <h4>Biology</h4>
                        <p>Every individual is born with a distinct, genetically-based set of psychological tendencies, or dispositions. These tendencies, which together are called temperament, affect and shape virtually every aspect of the individual's developing personality. Temperament, and therefore personality, is not merely genetic. It begins in the multitude of genetic instructions that guide the development of the brain and then is affected by the prenatal environment (Berger, 2000, p. 219).</p>

                        <h4>Birth order</h4>
                        <p>Refer to birth order chart, Lesson Objectives and Teacher Information, Lesson 3.5 Infancy Development: socio-emotional domain.</p>

                        <h4>Temperament</h4>
                        <p>Researchers who study personality have found what are called the "big five" dimensions of temperament:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Extroversion:</strong> the tendency to be outgoing, assertive, and active</li>
                            <li><strong>Agreeableness:</strong> the tendency to be kind, helpful, and easygoing</li>
                            <li><strong>Conscientiousness:</strong> the tendency to be organized, deliberate, and conforming</li>
                            <li><strong>Neuroticism:</strong> the tendency to be anxious, moody, and self-punishing</li>
                            <li><strong>Openness:</strong> the tendency to be imaginative, curious, artistic and welcoming of new experiences (Baron et al., 1998, p. 336).</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4>Culture</h4>
                        <p>In every culture, preschool education not only includes but goes beyond cognitive preparation for later schooling. As an example, Japanese culture places great emphasis on social consensus and conformity. Therefore, Japan's preschools provide training in the behaviour and attitudes appropriate for group activity; children are encouraged to show concern for others and to contribute cooperatively in group activities. These social attitudes and habits prepare young children for both the formal school system and later work settings. In China, similarly, learning how to be part of the group is combined with creativity in self-expression, both drawn from the culture's Confucian ethic of disciplined study. In the United Sates, by contrast, preschools are often designed to foster selfconfidence and self-reliance and to give children a good academic start through emphasis on language skills. Since most North American preschools are private, they vary a great deal in rules, curriculum and values (Berger, 2000, p. 296).</p>

                        <h4>Parenting</h4>
                        <p>Refer to Curriculum Support Materials, Memorandum from your child.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Family</h4>
                        <p>Children's emotional health is closely related to the emotional relationship between their parents. When these relationships are warm and constructive, such that the husband and wife feel loved, admired, and encouraged to act in ways that they themselves admired, the children are happy and healthy. Couples who are emotionally close, meeting each other's needs and encouraging positive self-images in each other, become good parents. Since they meet each other's needs, they do not use their children to live out their needs; since they are happy and satisfied, they can support and meet their children's needs; and since their own identities are clarified, they see their children as distinct from themselves. All this helps the children become emotionally healthy people (Schlesinger, 1998, p.8).</p>
                        
                        <h4>Economics</h4>
                        <p>No matter how maltreatment is defined or counted, it occurs more frequently as family income falls. This particularly true for neglect and physical abuse, which fall most heavily on children under age six who live in families with an income below the poverty line, an unemployed father, and four or more children. In such families, children obviously add to the financial pressures and are likely to become victims because of it (Berger, 2000, p. 302).</p>
                        
                        <h4>Maltreatment</h4>
                        <p>The more we learn about child maltreatment, the more we see that its causes are many and its consequences extend far beyond any immediate injury or deprivation. Compared to well-caredfor children, chronically abused and neglected children tend to be underweight, slower to talk, less able to concentrate, and delayed in academic growth. Deficits are even more apparent in social skills; maltreated children tend to regard other children and adults as hostile and exploitative, and hence they are less friendly, more aggressive, and more isolated than other children. The longer their abuse continues, and the earlier it started, the worse their relationships with peers are. As adolescents and adults, those who were severely maltreated in childhood (physically or emotionally) often use drugs or alcohol to numb their emotions, choose unsupportive relationships, sabotage their own careers, eat too much or too little, and generally engage in self-destructive behaviour (Berger, 2000, p. 258).</p>
                        
                        <h4>Self-concept</h4>
                        <p>Infants are not "given" a self by their parents or the culture. Rather, they find and construct selves. It is generally believed that awareness of "the self" develops from early experience. Indeed, one of the first stages in the development of thinking in the child is the capacity to distinguish what is "me" and what is "not me" (Alcock et al., 1998, p. 69).</p>

                        <h4>Emotional regulation</h4>
                        <p>The most important emotional development during early childhood is not the emergence of new emotions such as pride or guilt, but the growing ability to inhibit, enhance, maintain and modulate emotional arousal to accomplish one's goals. This ability, called emotional regulation, is developed in response to society's expectations that preschoolers manage frustration and modulate emotional expression (Berger, 2000, p. 308).</p>

                        <h4>Attachment and care-giving</h4>
                        <p>The results of past care-giving are clearly exhibited by children's reactions when another child cries in pain. Children who have been well nurtured and have formed secure attachments are able to regulate their own emotions and can express empathy, comforting the hurting child, reassuring the frightened child, or getting help if need be. Longitudinal research finds that those with insecure attachments respond abnormally to other children's distress (Berger, 2000, p. 309).</p>

                        <h4>Social behaviour</h4>
                        <p>One of the most important functions of the peer group is to provide a source of information and comparison about the world outside. Children receive feedback about their abilities from their peer group. Good peer relations may be necessary for normal socio-emotional development.</p>
                        <p>Social isolation, or the inability to "plug in" to a social network, is linked with many problems and disorders ranging from delinquency and problem drinking to depression.</p>

                        <h4>Media</h4>
                        <p>According to Neilson Media Research, in 1996 children between the ages of two to five in the United States watched 23 hours and 21 minutes of television each week. This is more than three hours a day, and it is at least three hours more a week than the viewing time of any other age group. Among the criticisms of television are the time it takes away from active, interactive and imaginative play; the faulty nutritional messages it sends; and the sexist, racist, and ageist stereotypes it provides that are particularly harmful for inexperienced, vulnerable viewers. Prosocial behaviour depends on emotional regulation, which is best learned through active social relationships. Television, passive observation, undercuts the very attributes, skills and values that lead to pro-social activity. However, the most compelling and convincing criticism of television concerns the antisocial behaviour it encourages, especially in children. The effect is interactive and cumulative; children who watch a lot of television are likely to be more aggressive than children who do not, and children who are already inclined to be aggressive are likely to watch a lot of violence. Television desensitizes children to violence in real life, making physical aggression seem normal. For all these reasons, children who watch substantial quantities of violent television are more likely than others to be bullies, more likely to retaliate physically for any perceived attack, more likely to be passive victims, and more likely to be passive onlookers rather than mediators when other children fight (Berger, 2000, p. 313).</p>

                        <p>Early childhood is often referred to as the "play years". This stage of development establishes the foundation for all social behaviours and social interactions. It is, literally, the first step in determining, Who I Am.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Why children play</h3>
                        <p>Play is pleasurable activity that is engaged in for its own sake. Play is essential to the young child's health. Play increases affiliation with peers, releases tension, advances cognitive development, increases exploration and provides a safe haven in which to engage in potentially dangerous behaviour.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>For Freud and Erikson, play is an essential, useful form of human adjustment, helping the child master anxieties and conflicts. Because tensions are relieved in play, the child can cope with life's problems.</li>
                            <li>Piaget believes that play advances children's cognitive development. Play permits children to practise their competencies and acquired skills in a relaxed, pleasurable way.</li>
                            <li>Vygotsky also believes that play is an excellent setting for cognitive development, especially the symbolic and make-believe aspects of play, as when a child substitutes a stick for a horse and rides the stick as if it were a horse.</li>
                            <li>Play encourages exploratory behaviour by offering children the possibilities of novelty, complexity, uncertainty, surprise and incongruity (Santrock, 1999, p. 240).</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">The different kinds of play behaviours</h3>
                        <p>Mildred Parten (1932) developed the following classification of children's play:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Unoccupied play</strong> occurs when the child is not engaging in play as it is commonly understood. The child may stand in one spot, look around the room, or perform random movements that do not seem to have a goal.</li>
                            <li><strong>Solitary play</strong> occurs when the child plays alone and independently of others. Two- and three- yearolds engage more frequently in solitary play than older preschoolers do.</li>
                            <li><strong>Onlooker play</strong> occurs when the child watches other children play. The child's active interest in other children's play distinguishes onlooker play from unoccupied play.</li>
                            <li><strong>Parallel play</strong> occurs when the child plays separately from others, but with toys like those the others are using or in a manner that mimics their play.</li>
                            <li><strong>Associative play</strong> occurs when play involves social interaction with little or no organization. In this type of play children seem to be more interested in each other than in the tasks they are performing.</li>
                            <li><strong>Cooperative play</strong> involves social interaction in a group with a sense of group identity and organized activity. Little cooperative play is seen in the preschool years (Santrock, 1999, p. 241).</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Parten's categories represent one way of thinking about the different types of play. However, other types of play are important in children's development. Whereas Parten's categories emphasize the role of play in the child's social world, the contemporary perspective on play emphasizes both the cognitive and social aspects of play.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Sensorimotor play</strong> is behaviour engaged in by infants to derive pleasure from exercising their existing sensor motor schemas. Infants initially engage in exploratory and playful visual and motor transactions in the second quarter of the first year of life. By nine months of age, infants begin to select novel objects for exploration and play, especially objects that are responsive such as toys that make noise or bounce. By 12 months of age, infants enjoy making things work and exploring cause and effect. At this point in development, children like toys that perform when they act on them.</li>
                            <li><strong>Pretense/Symbolic play.</strong> Between nine- and 30 months of age, children increase their use of objects in symbolic play. They learn to transform objects - substituting them for other objects and acting toward them as if they were these other objects. Dramatic play or "make-believe" often appears at about 18 months of age and reaches a peak at about four- or five- years of age, then gradually declines. In the second year, infants begin to understand the social meaning of objects. For example, two-year-olds may distinguish between exploratory play that is interesting but not humorous, and "playful" play which has incongruous and humorous dimensions.</li>
                            <li><strong>Social play</strong> is play that involves social interactions with peers. Parten's categories are oriented towards social play.</li>
                            <li><strong>Constructive play</strong> combines sensorimotor/practice repetitive play with symbolic representation of ideas. Constructive play occurs when children engage in self-regulated creation or construction of a product or a problem solution.</li>
                            <li><strong>Games</strong> are activities engaged in for pleasure. They include rules and often competition with one or more individuals (Santrock, 1999, p. 241).</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">How parents can encourage non-violent play</h3>
                        <p>Four-year-olds are busy trying to master their fears, understand mortality, and gain a sense of power in a big, often frightening world. These factors, which naturally converge in four- and five-year-olds, lead to a fascination with guns. The fact that your son is fascinated with guns right now does not mean that he will grow up to be a violent person. Rather, it means he is developmentally on target, trying to understand the power of guns, what makes people get hurt, and what makes them die, why everyone on TV is so obsessed with guns and killing, and why his parents get so upset when he points his finger at someone and pretends to shoot them.</p>
                        <p>Families have a wide range of responses to gun play. At one end of the spectrum, kids are equipped with realistic Uzi imitations, and at the other, gun play is banned altogether. Yet even in households where toy guns are not allowed, children still find ways to explore their interest in weapons; they build guns out of Legos, pick up sticks and say, "bang! Bang!" or eat their peanut butter sandwiches in the shape of a gun. Here are some guidelines for responding to your son's fascination with guns while encouraging nonviolence:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Set parameters for the play.</strong> When we forbid a form of play, that play often goes underground and we lose an opportunity to help our children figure out answers to their questions. Make it clear to children that any play which intimidates hurts or frightens another child is unacceptable. Then clarify the rules about guns at your house: "In our family, you are not allowed to point guns at any people or pets without their permission." Or, "I want you to keep your gun play outside."</li>
                            <li><strong>Provide props for play that have multiple uses.</strong> Giving children open-ended props encourages flexibility and creativity. When a child makes a gun out of plastic blocks, ten minutes later, those plastic blocks can be transformed into a container ship. However, when children play with highly realistic guns, those guns can only shoot and kill.</li>
                            <li><strong>Make your values clear.</strong> Children care deeply about how we see the world. Share your perspective with your son, "When I see you playing with guns, it really upsets me because people can be hurt by real guns."</li>
                            <li><strong>Help children deal with their fears.</strong> Often gun play increases when children are feeling fearful. Children look for symbols of power (such as guns and swords) to help them feel more secure. Helping children deal with their fears can take some of the intensity out of their gun play.</li>
                            <li><strong>Let your kids know that people are working to stop violence in the real world.</strong> Kids sometimes use gun play to cope with fears about violence in the real world. If your child seems scared of real violence, talk about people who are working to stop fighting and end war. This can help kids feel safer and therefore, less driven to engage in gun play.</li>
                            <li><strong>Provide kids with alternatives to gun play that help them feel powerful.</strong> Four- and five-Year-olds love to be competent. Providing them with real work experiences such as carpentry, cooking and gardening can channel some of the energy being directed into gun play in a new, more creative direction (Davis and Keyser, 1997, p. 339).</li>

                        <h4>Theories of moral development:</h4>
                        <p>Social learning theorists argue that moral behaviors are acquired through classical and operant conditioning. We resist temptation because we have been reinforced for so doing and punished for transgressions. Social learning theorists also recognize the importance of modeling or observational learning. The development of self-control is strongly influenced by models and by patterns of direct reinforcement children encounter, that is, adults' disciplinary measures.</p>

                        <h4>Cognitive developmental</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Kohlberg's theory</strong> states that the child is in the first level of moral development (preconventional morality) characterized by:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Stage 1: Punishment and obedience orientation, what is right or wrong is determined by what is punishable and what is not.</li>
                                    <li>Stage 2: What is right and wrong is determined by what brings rewards and what people want.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Piaget's Theory</strong>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Heteronomous morality is the first stage of moral development in Piaget's theory, occurring from approximately four to seven years of age. Justice and rules are conceived of as unchangeable properties of the world, removed from the control of people. The heteronomous thinker judges the rightness or goodness of behaviour by considering the consequences of behaviour, not the intentions of the actor. For example, the heteronomous thinker says that breaking twelve cups accidentally is worse than breaking one cup intentionally while trying to steal a cookie (Gross and McIlveen, 1998, p. 382).</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">How children learn values</h3>
                        <p>Every interaction with children provides an opportunity to teach values. While no parent tries to make every kiss goodnight a lesson, it is useful to think about the opportune times for teaching in families.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Children learn about our values through daily interactions with us. When we think about teaching values to kids, we often think about taking them to church or having a talk with them about lying, teaching them about sharing or encouraging them to give during the holiday season. Yet we teach values every day in our ordinary daily encounters.</li>
                            <li>Children learn through our example.</li>
                            <li>Children learn through the values we strive towards. While it is true that children learn through what we model, it is not true that you need to have mastered a value before you teach it to your children. All of us have some values that are woven into the very fabric of who we are. At the same time, most of us have values we are newly adopting, that we haven't practiced or integrated. Even if we move toward our values in tiny increments, children will pick up on our intention and commitment, and learn that they, too, can strive toward a vision they haven't yet attained.</li>
                            <li>Children learn values through the way we do things as a family.</li>
                            <li>Children learn values and beliefs through their exposure to the larger world. Through friends, extended family, books, TV and the experiences they have in their community, children absorb values and societal norms.</li>
                            <li>Children learn values through our explanations of the world (Davis and Keyser, 1997, p. 6).</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>Gender, by definition, refers to the state of "femaleness" or "maleness". This lesson addresses how young children develop a sense of gender identity and gender roles.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">How a gender identity develops</h3>
                        <p>Even at age two, gender related preferences and play patterns are apparent. Children already know whether they are boys or girls, can identify adult strangers as mommies or daddies, and apply gender labels (Mrs., Mr., lady, man) consistently. That simple cognitive awareness becomes, by age three, a rudimentary understanding that male and female distinctions are life-long. By age four, children are convinced that certain toys are appropriate for one gender but not the other. Four year-olds criticize peers who choose toys that are not appropriate for their gender and are proud of themselves when they act in gender-typical ways. When given a choice, children play with other children of their own sex, a tendency apparent at age two and clear-cut by age five. By age six, children have well formed ideas (and prejudices) about sex differences and also know which sex is better (their own) and which sex is stupid (the other). Stereotypes and taboos are also evident in fantasy play, where most of the other restrictions of daily life disappear (Berger, 2000, p. 326).</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">The differences between the genders</h3>
                        <p>Genuine behavioural differences do exist between the sexes and people's stereotypes are not entirely inaccurate. But the differences are fewer in number, smaller in size and far more complex than stereotypes suggest.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Social behaviour and personality:</strong> Studies indicate that males tend to be more aggressive than females, both verbally and physically. This disparity shows up in early childhood.</li>
                            <li><strong>Aggression:</strong> One of the most consistent gender differences is that boys are more aggressive than girls. Another is that boys are more active than girls. The aggression difference is especially pronounced when children are provoked. These differences occur across cultures and appear very early in children's development. Biological factors include heredity and hormones. Environmental factors include cultural expectations, adult and peer models, and social agents who reward aggression in males and punish aggression in females</li>
                            <li><strong>Emotional control:</strong> An important skill is to be able to regulate and control your emotions and behaviour. Males usually show less self-regulation than females, and this low self-control can translate into behavioural problems. In one study, children's low self-regulation was linked with greater aggression, teasing others, overreaction to frustration, low cooperation and inability to delay gratification (Santrock, 1999, p. 318).</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">The socio-cultural influences on gender development</h3>
                        <p>Although parents do encourage "sex-appropriate" play, there is evidence that biological factors may play an initial role in children's preferences. Although fathers are less likely to give dolls to one-yearold boys than to one-year-old girls, the boys who do receive the dolls are less likely to play with them (Snow, Jacklin and Maccoby, 1983). Perhaps adult expectations and encouragement build upon children's preferences, producing an amplifying effect.</p>
                        <p>Then, because boys' toys provide more opportunity for developing motor skills, visuo-spatial skills, and inventiveness, and girls' toys provide more opportunity for nurturance and social exchange, some important differences in sex roles may become established. Once children begin to play with other children outside the home, peers have a significant influence on the development of their gender roles. In fact, Stern and Karraker (1989) found that the behaviour of twoto six-year-old children was even more influenced by the knowledge of a baby's gender than was the behaviour of adults. By the time children are three years old, they reinforce gender-typed play by praising, imitating or joining in the behaviour. In contrast, they criticize gender-inappropriate behaviour (Langlois and Downs, 1980). Parents indirectly encourage gender-stereotyped play by seeking out children of the same sex as playmates for their own children (Buskist at al., 1997, p. 399).</p>

If students come from a different culture, inviting them or their parents to share their experiences of parenting and child rearing would be most valuable.</p>

                        <h4>The influence does the media have on early childhood development</h4>
                        <p>According to Neilson Media Research, in 1996 children between the ages of two and five in the United States watched 23 hours and 21 minutes of television each week. This is more than three hours a day, and it is at least three hours more a week than the viewing time of any other age group. Among the criticisms of television are the time it takes away from active, interactive and imaginative play; the faulty nutritional messages it sends; and the sexist, racist, and ageist stereotypes it provides that are particularly harmful for inexperienced, vulnerable viewers. Pro-social behaviour depends on emotional regulation, which is best learned through active social relationships. Television, passive observation, undercuts the very attributes, skills and values that lead to pro-social activity. However, the most compelling and convincing criticism of television concerns the antisocial behaviour it encourages, especially in children. The effect is interactive and cumulative; children who watch a lot of television are likely to be more aggressive than children who do not, and children who are already inclined to be aggressive are likely to watch a lot of violence. Television desensitizes children to violence in real life, making physical aggression seem normal. For all these reasons, children who watch substantial quantities of violent television are more likely than others to be bullies, more likely to retaliate physically for any perceived attack, more likely to be passive victims, and more likely to be passive onlookers rather than mediators when other children fight (Berger, 2000, p. 313).</p>
                        
                        <h4>The influence does economic status and conditions have on early childhood development</h4>
                        <p>No matter how maltreatment is defined or counted, it occurs more frequently as family income falls. This particularly true for neglect and physical abuse, which fall most heavily on children under age six who live in families with an income below the poverty line, an unemployed father, and four or more children. In such families, children obviously add to the financial pressures and are likely to become victims because of it (Berger, 2000, p. 256).</p>
                        
                        <h4>The effects doe's social class has on parenting and child rearing</h4>
                        <p>In most Western countries, social class differences in child rearing have been found. Working class and low-income parents often place a high value on external characteristics such as obedience and neatness. By contrast, middle-class families often place a high value on internal characteristics such as self-control and delay of gratification. There are social class differences not only in child rearing values but also in parenting behaviours. Middle-class parents are more likely to explain something, use verbal praise, use reasoning to accompany their discipline and ask their children questions. By contrast, parents in lowincome and working class households are more likely to discipline their children with physical punishment and criticize their children more (Santrock, 1999, p. 232).</p>

                        <h2 id="spiritual_growth" class="section-heading"><span class="heading-text">Spiritual Growth</span></h2>
                        <p>Children are more likely to become adults who identify with their cultural and spiritual heritage if they grow up feeling included in cultural and spiritual communities. Parents can take an active role in shaping children's cultural and spiritual life by providing them with frequent opportunities to interact with peers and adults of all ages (e.g., extended family members, friends, neighbors, and school staff) who share children's heritage or belief system, or who can otherwise function as cultural role models. Young children who see others practicing the same customs and rituals as they do themselves will feel a sense of belonging and pride.</p>
                        <p>Young children are very concrete. They learn through their direct experience and through observation of other's behavior, and not by way of abstract discussion. It is of little use to explain the philosophical, historical or religious basis for a given cultural or spiritual practice to young children. Instead, children will best learn particular practices by participating in them. Religious or traditional cultural festivals, holidays, and rituals are perfect teaching opportunities, as are opportunities to teach children about traditional foods and dress. Children's participation in holidays and rituals and cultural activities teaches them that they are valued members of a particular community. Such memories form the ongoing basis of children's cultural and religious identity, and become the building blocks of tradition.</p>
                        <p>Besides immersing children in the ongoing practice of cultural and religious traditions, parents can also foster children's appreciation of their heritage through celebratory games and crafts. For instance, children may enjoy making books about historical family members or filling out a family tree so as to learn about grandma's mother and father. Children can also be encouraged to make scrapbooks documenting their participation in family occasions, and special cultural or religious celebrations. Filling the pages of homemade books with special photographs, drawings, labels, and short stories will help children create cherished keepsakes that reinforce their familial, cultural and religious identity. Making family movies or videos can achieve a similar effect.</p>
                        <p>Though learning about one's own culture is paramount, it is also important to teach children about other people's cultures. Neighbors, family friends, and school peers can be recruited to help teach small children about other cultural practices including music, language, food and dress (if applicable). Exposing children to other cultures at an early age helps develop their tolerance and appreciation of cultural differences and diversity; skills they will need to navigate the complex and culturally interdependent modern world.</p>
                        <p>According to Froebel, the end of education should not be reason, per se, but rather the unfolding of the divine essence within the child. He thus urged educators to respect the spontaneous and essentially creative nature of this unfolding (Miller, 1997). In his view, the role of education "is to build on the 'living core' of the child's intrinsic spiritual capacities" (Dillon, 2000, p. 11). Pestalozzi also advocated respect for the unique nature of each child and felt that the end or purpose of education was to foster the holistic development of the students. Education, he said, was not intended to make children into people "such as we are" (Miller, 1997). Rather the role of the teacher was to guide children to become the humans their natures required them to be - including what was divine and sacred in their nature (Miller, 1997). Pestalozzi also believed in the innate goodness and wisdom of the human being and felt that the focus of education should not be so much to learn something as to be something. As expressed by Miller (1997), Pestalozzi "was more concerned with the needs and characteristics of the learner than with the requirements of the subject matter" (p. 94).</p>
                        <p>Montessori also believed in a spiritual force that guides human development (Miller, 1997). She referred to this force as "an individual spiritual embryo" (Montessori, 1972, p. 109). According to Montessori, children will seek growth and development because that is consistent with their nature. She urged educators to respect this spiritual force and to follow the inclinations or nature of the child.</p>
                        <p>According to Montessori, the direction of a child's life is contained within his own soul (Miller, 1997). In her writings for educators, Montessori once said, "Our care of the child should be governed, not by the desire 'to make him learn things,' but by the endeavor always to keep burning within him that light which is called the intelligence" (Montessori, 1965, p. 240). Montessori believed that the first six years are especially crucial to the holistic and spiritual development of the child. During this time, she said, "The young child literally 'incarnates' the world around him. The things he sees are not just remembered; they form part of his soul" (Montessori, 1973, p. 63). The poet, Walt Whitman, expressed something similar when he said, "There was a child went forth every day; and the first object he looked upon, that object he became" (2001).</p>
                        <p>Rudolph Steiner also saw human development as an unfolding from within and believed that human nature is comprised of body (our physical being), soul (our personal inner life), and spirit (ultimate being). Steiner believed that while the role of education is to foster growth in all areas of human development, its primary focus should be on the unfolding of the individual's spirit (Miller, 1997, p. 171). Steiner's views are exemplified in Waldorf Schools where education "is not a pedagogical system but an Art - the Art of awakening what is actually there within the human being. Fundamentally, the Waldorf School does not want to educate, but to awaken" (Steiner, 1967, p. 23).</p>

                        <p>The lifespan perspective on human development has seven basic characteristics. Development is:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Life-long</strong> - No age period dominates development.</li>
                            <li><strong>Multi-dimensional</strong> - Development consists of biological, cognitive, socio-emotional and spiritual dimensions.</li>
                            <li><strong>Multi-directional</strong> - Some aspects of development increase, while others decrease.</li>
                            <li><strong>Plastic</strong> - Depending on the individual's life conditions, development may take many paths.</li>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">How do the key issues and questions in developmental psychology relate to child development?</h3>
                        <p>From the time of its establishment, several key issues and questions have dominated the field of developmental psychology. Among these issues are the nature of developmental change, the importance of critical periods, lifespan approaches versus the more focused approaches, and the nature-nurture issue.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Continuous change versus discontinuous change:</strong> In continuous change, developmental change is gradual, with achievements at one level building on those of previous levels. In contrast, discontinuous change occurs in distinct stages or steps. Each stage brings about behaviour that is assumed to be qualitatively different from behaviour at earlier stages.</li>
                            <li><strong>A critical period</strong> is a specific time during development when a particular event has its greatest consequences. Critical periods occur when the presence of certain kinds of environmental stimuli are necessary for development to proceed normally.</li>
                            <li><strong>Lifespan approaches versus a focus on a particular period:</strong> Developmentalists now believe the entire lifespan is important, for several reasons. One is the discovery that developmental growth and change continue during every part of life. Furthermore, to understand fully the social influences on people of a given age, we need to understand the people who are, in large measure, providing those influences. For instance, to understand development in infants, we need to unravel the effects of their parents' ages on the social environment.</li>
                            <li><strong>Nature versus nurture:</strong> One of the enduring questions of development involves how much of people's behaviour is due to their genetically-determined nature and how much is due to nurture, the physical and social environment in which a child is raised. In this context, nature refers to traits, abilities and capacities that are inherited from one's parents. Nature encompasses any factor that is produced by the predetermined unfolding of genetic information - a process known as maturation. These genetic, inherited influences are at work as we move from the one-celled organism that is created at the moment of conception to the billions of cells that make up a fully-formed human being. In contrast nurture refers to the environmental influences that shape behaviour. Some of these influences may be biological, such as the impact of a pregnant mother's substance abuse on the fetus, or the amount and kind of food available to children. Other environmental influences are more social, such as the ways parents discipline their children and the effects of peer pressure on adolescents (Feldman, 2000, p. 10).</li>
