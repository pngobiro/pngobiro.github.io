                        <h2 id="freud" class="section-heading"><span class="heading-text">Sigmund Freud</span></h2>
                        <p>The theories proposed by Sigmund Freud stressed the importance of childhood events and experiences, but almost exclusively focused on mental disorders rather that normal functioning.</p>
                        <p>According to Freud, child development is described as a series of 'psychosexual stages.' In "Three Essays on Sexuality" (1915), Freud outlined these stages as oral, anal, phallic, latency and genital. Each stage involves the satisfaction of a libidinal desire and can later play a role in adult personality. If a child does not successfully complete a stage, Freud suggested that he or she would develop a fixation that would later influence adult personality and behavior. Learn more in this article on Freud's stages of psychosexual development.</p>
                        
                        <h2 id="erikson" class="section-heading"><span class="heading-text">Erik Erikson</span></h2>
                        <p>Theorist Erik Erikson also proposed a stage theory of development, but his theory encompassed development throughout the entire human lifespan. Erikson believed that each stage of development was focused on overcoming a conflict. For example, the primary conflict during the adolescent period involves establishing a sense of personal identity. Success or failure in dealing with the conflicts at each stage can impact overall functioning. During the adolescent stage, for example, failure to develop an identity results in role confusion. Learn more about this theory in this article on Erikson's stages of psychosocial development.</p>
                        
                        <h2 id="cognitive_theories" class="section-heading"><span class="heading-text">Cognitive Child Development Theories</span></h2>
                        <p>Theorist Jean Piaget suggested that children think differently than adults and proposed a stage theory of cognitive development. He was the first to note that children play an active role in gaining knowledge of the world. According to his theory, children can be thought of as "little scientists" who actively construct their knowledge and understanding of the world. Learn more in this article on Piaget's stages of cognitive development.</p>
                        
                        <h2 id="behavioral_theories" class="section-heading"><span class="heading-text">Behavioral Child Development Theories</span></h2>
                        <p>Behavioral theories of child development focus on how environmental interaction influences behavior and are based upon the theories of theorists such as John B. Watson, Ivan Pavlov and B. F. Skinner. These theories deal only with observable behaviors. Development is considered a reaction to rewards, punishments, stimuli and reinforcement. This theory differs considerably from other child development theories because it gives no consideration to internal thoughts or feelings. Instead, it focuses purely on how experience shapes who we are. Learn more about these behavioral theories in these articles on classical conditioning and operant conditioning.</p>
                        
                        <h2 id="social_theories" class="section-heading"><span class="heading-text">Social Child Development Theories</span></h2>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">John Bowlby</h3>
                        <p>There is a great deal of research on the social development of children. John Bowbly proposed one of the earliest theories of social development. Bowlby believed that early relationships with caregivers play a major role in child development and continue to influence social relationships throughout life. Learn more in this overview of attachment theory.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Albert Bandura</h3>
                        <p>Psychologist Albert Bandura proposed what is known as social learning theory. According to this theory of child development, children learn new behaviors from observing other people. Unlike behavioral theories, Bandura believed that external reinforcement was not the only way that people learned new things. Instead, intrinsic reinforcements such as a sense of pride, satisfaction and accomplishment could also lead to learning. By observing the actions of others, including parents and peers, children develop new skills and acquire new information.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Lev Vygotsky</h3>
                        <p>Another psychologist named Lev Vygotsky proposed a seminal learning theory that has gone on to become very influential, especially in the field of education. Like Piaget, Vygotsky believed that children learn actively and through hands-on experiences. His sociocultural theory also suggested that parents, caregivers, peers and the culture at large were responsible for the development of higher order functions.</p>
