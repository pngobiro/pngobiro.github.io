                        <p>In middle and late childhood, children are on a different plane, belonging to a generation and feeling all their own. It is the wisdom of the human lifespan that at no time are children more ready to learn than during the period of expansive imagination at the end of early childhood. Children develop a sense of wanting to make things, and not just to make them, but make them well and even perfectly. Their thirst is to know and to understand. They are remarkable for their intelligence and for their curiosity. Their parents continue to be important influences in their lives, but their growth is also shaped by successive choirs of friends. They do not think much about the future or the past, but they enjoy the present moment.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">The roles do nature and nurture play in the development of a child</h3>
                        <p>Nature refers to the changes in development as a result of the influence of the genetic code humans inherit from their parents. Nurture refers to the influences of nutrition, culture, the mass media, peers, stressors, families and parenting, in effect, the socio-cultural context that surrounds the developing person.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">The socio-cultural influences on child development</h3>
                        <p>At the Microsystems level, discuss with the students the relative influences of parents, peers and the classroom setting. In what ways do these aspects of the system of support influence our physical, emotional, cognitive and spiritual development? Do parents, peers or the classroom, dominate during childhood?</p>
                        <p>At the ecosystem level, discuss the relative influences of the school, the mass media (refer to LESSON 6.5.7 for more information) and the community. What school policies are in place that promotes healthy development? How has changing technology influenced child development? What community resources are available to promote healthy child development?</p>
                        <p>At the macro system level, discuss the influence that economic status and culture, in particular, have on child development. Are children as sensitive to the pressures of status as adolescents? How do different cultures (individualistic, collectivist and Aboriginal) view childhood?</p>

                        <h2 id="eyes_of_a_child" class="section-heading"><span class="heading-text">Looking through the eyes of a child.</span></h2>
                        <p>This overview lesson addresses the physical, mental, emotional and spiritual aspects of development during childhood.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">The physical changes during childhood</h3>
                        <p>During the elementary school years, children grow an average of five or eight centimetres a year. Muscle mass and strength gradually increase. Legs lengthen and trunks slim down. Growth is slow and consistent. Motor development becomes smoother and more coordinated. Boys are usually better at gross motor skills, girls at fine motor skills. Our nation's children are not getting enough exercise. Sociocultural factors, such as poverty, can place considerable stress on children. One of children's important buffers against stress is the long-term presence of a basic trusting relationship with at least one adult. A readily available support network is also important. A special concern involves children with disabilities, including children with a learning disability or attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">The cognitive changes during childhood</h3>
                        <p>According to Piaget, the seven- to 11-year-old child's cognitive development is characterized by concrete operational thought, which involves operations. Concrete operations are mental actions that are reversible. Children's long-term memory, metacognitive knowledge, and cognitive monitoring improve during childhood. It is important for children to engage in critical thinking. Children's creativity should be encouraged. During middle and late childhood, children become more analytical and logical in their approach to words and grammar. Reading is a more central aspect of language in the childhood years</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">The socio-emotional changes during childhood</h3>
                        <p>Parents spend less time with their children in childhood, but parents are still very important socializing agents in this period. New parent-child issues emerge, and discipline changes. In childhood, two major changes in many children's lives are movement into a stepfamily and becoming a latchkey child. Children spend considerably more time with peers in this period. In peer relations, children can be popular, average, rejected, neglected, or controversial. Friendships become more important. The internal self, the social self and the socially comparative self become more prominent in selfunderstanding during this period. Perspective-taking increases during this period. Self-concept and self-esteem are important dimensions of the child's socio-emotional development during this period. Gender is an important aspect of elementary school children's development, especially gender stereotypes, similarities and differences, gender-role classification, and ethnicity and gender.</p>

                        <p>The lifespan period from ages six-12 is a time of slow, consistent physical growth before the onset of puberty.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">The physical developmental changes during middle childhood</h3>
                        <p>During the elementary school years, children grow an average of five or eight centimetres a year. Muscle mass and strength gradually increase. Legs lengthen and trunks slim down. Growth is slow and consistent. Motor development becomes smoother and more coordinated. Boys are usually better at gross motor skills, girls at fine motor skills. Our nation's children are not getting enough exercise. Sociocultural factors, such as poverty, can place considerable stress on children.

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">What is the process of cognitive development during childhood?</h3>
                        <p>A nine- or 10-year-old child is a very different kind of thinker than say, a four- or five-year-old preschooler. Not only do older children know more, they also use their minds much better when they must solve a problem or remember a piece of information. By middle childhood, most children have acquired a sense of "the game of thinking" and they begin to enjoy an intellectual challenge as much as an athletic one. They begin to realize that good thinking involves considerable evidence, planning ahead, thinking logically, formulating alternative hypotheses, and being consistent. This is the Piagetian stage of concrete operational thought. They try to incorporate these qualities into their own reasoning and use them to evaluate the thinking of others. A marked improvement in memory occurs between ages seven and 11, particularly apparent in older children's ability to remember essential facts over a period of days or longer, with no forgetting. Selective attention, increases in processing speed and the development of thinking patterns are all factors behind the improvement.</p>

                        <p>As children grow and mature, the nature of their social relationships, their concept of self, and their gender identity and awareness all increase profoundly. This lesson addresses all aspects of the socioemotional domain.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">The process of socio-emotional development in childhood</h3>
                        <p>Erikson's fourth stage of the human lifespan, industry versus inferiority, appears during childhood. The term industry expresses a dominant theme of this period: Children become interested in how things are made and how they work. Children's social worlds beyond their families also contribute to a sense of industry. School becomes especially important in this regard.</p>
                        <p>Erikson agrees with Freud that childhood is a quiet period emotionally, a period in which 'the child becomes ready to apply himself to given skills and tasks." During Erikson's crisis of industry versus inferiority, children busily try to master whatever their culture values. On the basis of their degree of success, they judge themselves as either industrious or inferior or, in other words, competent or incompetent, productive or failing, winners or losers.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">How children develop a sense of self</h3>
                        <p>In childhood, self-understanding increasingly shifts from defining oneself through external characteristics to defining oneself through internal characteristics such as preferences, personality traits and qualities. In addition to the increase of psychological characteristics in self-definition, the social aspects of the self also increase at this point in development. Children's self-understanding also includes increasing reference to social comparisons. Many develop mentalists believe that perspectivetaking plays an important role in self-understanding. Perspective-taking is the ability to assume another person's perspective and understand his or her thoughts and feelings.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">How children develop a sense of moral and ethical behaviour</h3>
                        <p>According to developmental psychologist Lawrence Kohlberg, people pass through a series of stages in the evolution of their sense of justice and in the kind of moral reasoning they use to make moral judgments. Kohlberg suggests that moral development can best be understood within the context of a three-level sequence, which is further subdivided into six stages. At the lowest level, preconventional morality, people follow unvarying rules based on rewards and punishments. In the next level, that of conventional morality, people approach moral problems in terms of their own position as good, responsible members of society. Finally, individuals use postconventional morality to invoke universal moral principles that are considered broader than the rules of the particular society in which they live. Kohlberg's theory proposes that people move through the stages in a fixed order and that they are unable to reach the highest stage until adolescence. Psychologist Carol Gilligan has suggested an alternative account of the development of moral behaviour in girls. She suggests that differences in the way boys and girls are raised in our society lead to basic distinctions in how men and women view moral behaviour. According to Gilligan, boys view morality primarily in terms of broad principles such as fairness and justice, whereas girls see it in terms of the responsibility towards individuals and willingness to sacrifice themselves to help specific individuals within the context of particular relationships. Compassion for individuals, then, is a more prominent factor in moral behaviour for women than it is for men.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">The influence do friendships have on healthy socio-emotional development in childhood</h3>
                        <p>Children's friendships are vitally important. They serve six functions: companionship, stimulation, physical support, ego support, social comparison and intimacy/affection. Two of friendships most common characteristics are intimacy and similarity. Intimacy in friendships refers to self-disclosure and the sharing of private thoughts. True intimate friendships may not appear until early adolescence. Also, through childhood, friends are more similar than dissimilar in terms of age, sex, race, and many other factors. Friends also play important roles in shaping children's and adolescents' well-being and development. In terms of well-being, all people have a number of basic social needs. These include the need for tenderness (secure attachment), playful companionship, social acceptance, intimacy, and sexual relations. If the need for social acceptance is not met, we suffer a lower sense of self-worth.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">How gender influences development during childhood</h3>
                        <p>Gender is a pervasive aspect of an individual's identity. Three areas of socio-emotional development where gender similarities and differences have been studied extensively are communication styles, social relationships, and aggression.</p>
                        <p>Sociolinguist Deborah Tannen (1990) distinguishes between rapport talk and report talk. Rapport talk is the language of conversation and a way of establishing connections and negotiating relationships. Report talk is talk that gives information. Males hold centre stage through report talk with such verbal performances as storytelling, joking and lecturing with information. By contrast, females prefer private, rapport talk and conversation that is relationship-oriented. Tannen says that boys and girls grow up in different worlds of talk - parents, siblings, peers, teachers and others talk to boys and girls differently. The play of boys and girls is also different. Boys tend to play in large groups that are hierarchically structured, and their groups usually have a leader who tells the others what to do and how to do it. Boys' games have winners and losers and often are the subject of arguments. Boys often boast of their skill and argue about who is best at what. By contrast, girls are more likely to play in small groups or pairs, and the centre of a girl's world is often a best friend. In girls' friendships and peer groups, intimacy is pervasive.</p>
                        <p>Turn-taking is more characteristic of girls' games than of boys' games. And much of the time, girls simply like to sit and talk with each other, concerned more about being liked by others than jockeying for status in some obvious way.</p>
                        <p>One of the most consistent gender differences is that boys are more aggressive than girls. Another is that boys are more active than girls. The aggression difference is especially pronounced when children are provoked. These differences occur across cultures and appear very early in children's development. Both biological and environmental factors have been proposed to account for gender differences in aggression. Biological factors include hormones and heredity. Environmental factors include cultural expectations, adult and peer models, and social agents who reward aggression in boys and punish aggression in girls.</p>

                        <p>Participation in sports can have both positive and negative consequences for children. Children's participation in sports can provide exercise, opportunities to learn how to compete, increased selfesteem, and a setting for developing peer relations and friendships. However, sports can also have negative outcomes for children: too much pressure to achieve and win physical injuries, a distraction from academic work, and unrealistic expectations for success as an athlete.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">The influence does exercise has on childhood development</h3>
                        <p>Many of our patterns of health and illness are long-standing. Our experiences as children contribute to our health practices as adults. In summary, not only do children's school weeks not include adequate physical education classes, but the majority of children do not exercise vigorously even when they are in such classes. Furthermore, most children's parents are poor role models for vigorous physical exercise.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">How learning disabilities influence childhood</h3>
                        <p>Characteristics of children with mild, moderate and severe learning disabilities include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Mild learning difficulties:</strong> These children have some difficulties with normal school work, but can cope with the normal curriculum. If work is differentiated and support is available, their needs can be met.</li>
                            <li><strong>Moderate learning difficulties:</strong> These children make very limited progress in basic academic skills such as literacy and numeracy, despite support being given. As a result, they need additional help, achieved by a statement of their special educational needs.</li>
                            <li><strong>Severe learning difficulties:</strong> These children function at a low level in terms of basic skills. Communication skills and academic attainment are normally very limited.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">The effect Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) has on children</h3>
                        <p>It is estimated that from three to five percent of all school-age children in Canada - and elsewhere - suffer from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Found in most cultures and in most countries, ADHD is four or five times more common among boys, and it is first noticed, usually, between three and four years of age.</p>
                        <p>Regardless of gender, ADHD produces the same effects: children are unable to concentrate on any task for more than a few minutes. Moreover, they charge through each day with excessive energy. They talk during quiet periods, ignore social rules, leave their seats, and create disturbances in the classroom.</p>
                        <p>Basic to all these behaviours, they are moody, and very impulsive. ADHD children have normal intelligence, but they show deficits in their ability to focus their attention. They literally cannot seem to sit still, and are readily distracted by irrelevant information.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">The role and nature of aggression in children</h3>
                        <p>The specifics regarding when aggression is appropriate, in what forms, and to what degree depend on the particular society in which children grow up. Variation in the norms for aggression occurs by age, by ethnic and socioeconomic group, by neighbourhood, by gender, and by the specific social situation. Customs vary about which kind of contact (being bumped up against, being shoved, having one's shoe stepped on) require retaliation, which types of insult (directed at one's relatives, one's physical appearance, one's intellect) should be ignored, and which children (friends, enemies, bystanders, the other sex, the physically impaired, smaller or younger ones) are fair targets and which are exempt. Generally, physical aggression declines with age - except for those children who are headed towards more serious violence and criminal activity. Relational aggression - verbal insults and social aggression - does not decline. In girls as well as boys, relational aggression becomes more hurtful, more isolating, and more important to deflect - with humour, a shrug, or a counter-attack when possible.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">How children become obese</h3>
                        <p>Obesity usually results from the interaction of a number of factors. Here are the most important of them:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Heredity.</strong> Body type, including height, bone structure, and the amount and distribution of fat on the body, is inherited. So are individual differences in metabolic rate and activity level. Certain combinations of body type and metabolism result in excessive storage of fat on the body.</li>
                            <li><strong>Exercise.</strong> Inactive people burn fewer calories and are more likely to be overweight than active people, especially in infancy and childhood, when many children seem to be on the move all day. A child's activity level is influenced not only by heredity but also by a willingness to engage in strenuous play, the availability of safe play areas, the parents' example, and weight itself, which slows down precisely those children who need more exercise.</li>
                            <li><strong>Television.</strong> While watching television, children eat more and burn fewer calories than they would if they were actively playing. In fact, they burn fewer calories than they would if they were doing nothing. One study found that when children are "glued to the tube" they fall into a deeply relaxed state, akin to semi consciousness, that lowers their metabolism below their normal at-rest rate - on average, 12 percent lower in children of normal weight and 16 percent lower in obese children. Further, 60 percent of the commercials shown during Saturday morning cartoons on U.S. Television is for food products - almost all of them with high fat and sugar content.</li>
                            <li><strong>Cultural attitudes towards food.</strong> In some cultures, overeating is a sign of wealth and happiness, so parents urge their offspring to have a second helping. The implied message seems to be that a father's love is measured by how much food he can provide; a mother's love, by how well she can cook; and a child's love by how much she or he can eat.</li>
                            <li><strong>Precipitating event.</strong> For many children, the onset of obesity is associated with a crucial event or traumatic experience - a hospitalization, a parental divorce or death, or a move to a new neighbourhood. Generally such an event or experience creates a sense of loss or diminished selfesteem, along with a corresponding need for an alternative source of gratification.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Who bullies are, and effects they have on other people</h3>
                        <p>Researchers define bullying as repeated, systematic efforts to inflict harm through physical attack, verbal attack or social attack. Implicit in this definition is an imbalance of power. Boys who are bullies are often above average in size, whereas girls who are bullies are often above average in verbal assertiveness. Bullies' victims tend to be less assertive and physically weaker (boys) and more shy (girls). Bullying during middle childhood seems to be pervasive. It occurs in every nation, is present in small rural schools and in large urban ones, and is as prevalent among well-to-do majority children as among poor immigrant children. Contrary to public belief, victims are no more likely to be fat or homely or to speak with an accent than non-victims are. But they usually are rejected, withdrawn children, anxious and insecure, unable or unwilling to defend themselves, without friends who will take their side.</p>
                        <p>Bullied children are anxious, depressed and underachieving during the months and years of their torment. Even years later, they still have damaged self-esteem as well as painful memories.</p>
                        <p>The picture is even more ominous for bullies. Contrary to the public perception that bullies are actually insecure and lonely, at the peak of their bullying they usually have friends who abet, fear and admire them. They seem brashly unapologetic about the pain they have inflicted. Bullies become more hostile, challenging everyone who tries to stop them, getting into trouble not only with peers but also with the police. International research confirms that children who regularly victimize other children often become violent criminals later on.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">The effect divorce has on children</h3>
                        <p>The disruption and discord of divorce almost always adversely affect the children for at least a year or two. Immediately before and after a divorce, the children show signs of emotional pain, such as depression or rebellion, and symptoms of stress, such as having lower school achievement, poorer health and fewer friends. Whether this distress is relatively mild and short-lived, or serious and longlasting, depends primarily on the stability of the child's life and the adequacy of care giving. Divorce may not harm the children if the family income remains stable, if the conflict between the parents decreases, and if care giving by both parents is as good as or better than it was before the divorce.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">The importance is the family in child development</h3>
                        <p>As children move into the middle and late childhood years, parents spend considerably less time with them. In one study, parents spent less than half as much time with their children aged five to 12 in caregiving, instruction, reading, talking, and playing as when their children were younger. Parentchild interactions during childhood include whether children should be made to perform chores, and if so, whether they should be paid for them; how to help children learn to entertain themselves rather than relying on parents for everything; and how to monitor children's lives outside the family in school and peer settings.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">The roles and influence do peers have on child development</h3>
                        <p>During middle and late childhood, children spend an increasing amount of time in peer interaction. In one study, children interacted with peers 10 percent of their day at the age of two, 20 percent at age four, and more than 40 percent between the ages of seven and 11. Episodes with peers totalled 299 per typical school day. Researchers have devised five peer status categories to describe peer interactions:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Popular children</strong> are frequently liked by their peers and are frequently nominated as a best friend. They show high rates of positive behaviours and low rates of negative behaviours.</li>
                            <li><strong>Average children</strong> are moderately liked by their peers and moderately often nominated as a best friend. They show moderate levels of positive behaviours and negative behaviours.</li>
                            <li><strong>Rejected children</strong> are actively disliked by their peers and infrequently nominated as a best friend. They show high rates of negative behaviours and low rates of positive behaviours.</li>
                            <li><strong>Neglected children</strong> are not disliked by their peers and are infrequently nominated as a best friend. They show low levels of positive and negative behaviours.</li>
                            <li><strong>Controversial children</strong> are frequently disliked by their peers but are often nominated as a best friend. They show high rates of both positive and negative behaviours.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Why are children's friendships important?</h3>
                        <p>According to Hartup and Stevens (1997) there are some important developmental consequences to having friends. Those children and adolescents who have friends tend to be more socially competent than those who do not. Having friends provides someone to confide in, to be afraid with, and to grow with. Having friends sets the stage for intimacy with adults.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">How to resist peer pressure</h3>
                        <p>Realize that you are being manipulated. Others are deliberately trying to get you to change your mind.</p>
                        <p>If you are the only holdout, you are more likely to give in. Try to get just one other person on your side, and you will feel much stronger about your position.</p>
                        <p>People want their behaviour and attitudes to be in harmony. Consequently, even if they know of some negative effects of what they are doing, they probably would not own up to them, because to do so would cause cognitive dissonance. Thus, you should be aware that you are probably not getting the whole story from the group.</p>
                        <p>For all age groups, peers are more persuasive than other people. The more prestige particular peers have, the greater their influence. Use this tendency to your advantage by finding peers who have had a bad experience with whatever you are being urged to do and listen to what they have to say.</p>
                        <p>Minority opinions can have an effect on the majority. One way to increase this effect is to give consistent and repeated statements of your position. Often, this technique has a private effect on others - one that is not publicly expressed.</p>
                        <p>If all the members of a group are on one side, doesn't that mean that they are more likely to be right than a single, lone individual? Actually, a group's decision making is usually not as accurate as an individual's, particularly if the individual is well informed and highly rational.</p>
                        <p>When attempting to persuade someone, group members often try to make that person feel embarrassed for not going along. Embarrassing people is an age-old tool for making them conform. If you know that ahead of time, perhaps it will have less impact on you.</p>
                        <p>One of the best ways to resist conformity is to be exposed to all the arguments in favour of some risky behaviour and then learn to refute these arguments, one by one.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">How parents influence moral development</h3>
                        <p>Parental discipline does contribute to children's moral development, but there are other aspects of parenting that also play an important role as well. These include providing opportunities for perspective-taking and modeling appropriate moral behaviour and thinking. Eisenberg and Murphy (1995) summarized the research on ways that parenting can influence children's moral development.</p>
                        <p>They concluded that in general, moral children tend to have parents who:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>are warm and supportive rather than punitive</li>
                            <li>use inductive reasoning</li>
                            <li>provide opportunities for children to learn about others' perspectives and feelings</li>
                            <li>involve children in family decision making and in the process of thinking about moral decisions</li>
                            <li>Model moral behaviours and thinking themselves and provide opportunities for their children to model such moral behaviours and thinking.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">How parents influence pro-social behaviours</h3>
                        <p>What can parents and teachers do to promote children's altruism and prosocial behaviour? Honig and Wittmer (1996) provided the following recommendations that focus on promoting children's prosocial behaviours:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Value and emphasize consideration of others' needs. This results in children engaging in more helping activities. The morality of caring is one of teaching children to feel for others, which leads to empathy and concern.</li>
                            <li>Model prosocial behaviours. Children imitate what adults do.</li>
                            <li>Label and identify prosocial and antisocial behaviours. Be specific in identifying prosocial behaviours.</li>
                            <li>Attribute positive social behaviours to each child.</li>
                            <li>Notice and positively encourage pro social behaviours but do not overuse external rewards.</li>
                            <li>Facilitate perspective-taking and understanding others' feelings.</li>
                            <li>Use positive discipline strategies. Reason with children when they do something wrong. Redirect antisocial actions to more acceptable actions.</li>
                            <li>Actively lead discussions on pro-social interactions.</li>
                            <li>Develop school and class projects that foster altruism.</li>
                            <li>Use technology to promote pro-social behaviours.</li>
                            <li>Invite moral mentors to visit the class.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">The role the school plays in the healthy development of children</h3>
                        <p>Schooling of some sort during childhood is available in every nation. But the specifics - who receives instruction, in what subjects, and how - vary enormously. In the past boys and wealthier children were much more likely to receive formal education than girls and poorer children, and some of that inequality is still evident today. In developing countries, more boys than girls attend elementary school. Indeed, girls are more likely to drop out of school before sixth grade, with the percent of boys and girls ages six - 11 in school ranging from 99 percent to 90 percent in Algeria to 42 percent to 14 percent in Afghanistan. In developed countries, less is generally demanded of girls and poor children, particularly in science and mathematics. Teaching techniques also vary widely, from the strict lecture method in which students are forbidden to talk, whisper or even move during class, to open education, in which students are encouraged to interact and make use of classroom resources - with the teacher serving as an adviser, guide, and friend more than as a subject-matter authority and disciplinarian.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">The role that economics play in the healthy development of children</h3>
                        <p>One of the major advantages of two married parents is financial. Married couples are generally better able to provide for their children, for reasons that predate the child's arrival:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Individuals who are financially secure are more desirable marriage partners. Couples who have good economic prospects are more likely to decide to marry and to have children.</li>
                            <li>Couples who are financially secure are more likely to avoid divorce.</li>
                            <li>Most contemporary two-parent families have two wage earners, so they tend to be more financially secure than other families.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Once a child is born, two-parent households in which only one parent works save money on childcare and household services for which a single parent might have to pay, and so two-parent households - even those with only one wage earner - have more money for housing, food, health care and education. Thus the general stability of their home and work situations tends to enhance the financial security of nuclear families.</p>
                        
                        <h2 id="middle_action_research" class="section-heading"><span class="heading-text">Action research in middle childhood development</span></h2>
                        <p>This summary lesson will integrate all of the concepts covered in this unit, by actively engaging students in the design and conduct of research in developmental psychology.</p>
                        
                        <h2 id="middle_spiritual_growth" class="section-heading"><span class="heading-text">Spiritual Growth</span></h2>
                        <p>Part of the child's development as an individual includes an emerging understanding of the lifecycle-of birth, growth, aging, and death. There is an increasing awareness that life fits into a larger scheme of relationships among individuals, groups of people, other living creatures, and the earth itself. School-age children become keenly interested in these topics, especially when confronted with personal experiences such as the birth of a sibling or the death of a grandparent. As children experience these events and learn to view their personal encounters as part of a larger whole, families and communities provide important structure. They define value systems that provide children with basic principles and encourage them to examine their personal actions in light of their impact on those around them. Children's ability to understand their place in the larger world leads to greater self-esteem and competence. The close link between competence and self-esteem is strengthened when a child is recognized for working hard in school; successfully completing chores and special projects; and participating in school, church, or community activities.</p>
                        <p>The relationship between values, competence, self-esteem, and personal responsibility needs to be modeled and affirmed by the child's parents, teachers, and community. Parents also need to support maintaining a balance between responsibilities at school and home, time spent with family and friends, extracurricular and community activities, and personal leisure.</p>
                        <p>Achieving this balance is essential for healthy development.</p>
                        <p>Middle childhood is also a time of moral development and spiritual growth. Feldman states that children are now beginning to understand the moral principles behind behavior. Moral decisions are no longer based simply on rewards or punishments. An internal code of ethics begins to emerge, based in large part upon parental guidance. According to a 2009 article titled "The Role of Parents in the Spiritual Development of Children" by Leon Blanchette, parents have a unique opportunity to be spiritual mentors to their children. Parents help to develop a worldview in their children (either healthy or unhealthy), which will guide them in moral and spiritual decisions.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">How child development described from the perspective of the lifespan approach</h3>
                        <p>The lifespan perspective on human development has seven basic characteristics. Development is:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Life-long</strong> - No age period dominates development.</li>
                            <li><strong>Multi-dimensional</strong> - Development consists of biological, cognitive, socio-emotional and spiritual dimensions.</li>
                            <li><strong>Multidirectional</strong> - Some aspects of development increase, while others decrease.</li>
                            <li><strong>Plastic</strong> - Depending on the individual's life conditions, development may take many paths.</li>
                            <li><strong>Historically-embedded</strong> - Development is influenced by historical conditions.</li>
                            <li><strong>Multidisciplinary</strong> - Psychologists, sociologists, anthropologists, neuroscientists and medical researchers all study human development and share a concern for unlocking the mysteries of development throughout the lifespan</li>
                            <li><strong>Contextual</strong> - The individual continually responds to and acts on contexts, which include a person's biological makeup, physical environment, and social, historical, and cultural contexts.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">How the key issues and questions in developmental psychology relate to child development</h3>
                        <p>From the time of its establishment, several key issues and questions have dominated the field of developmental psychology. Among these issues are the nature of developmental change, the importance of critical periods, lifespan approaches versus the more focused approaches, and the naturenurture issue.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Continuous change versus discontinuous change:</strong> In continuous change, developmental change is gradual, with achievements at one level building on those of previous levels. In contrast, discontinuous change occurs in distinct stages or steps. Each stage brings about behaviour that is assumed to be qualitatively different from behaviour at earlier stages.</li>
                            <li><strong>A critical period</strong> is a specific time during development when a particular event has its greatest consequences. Critical periods occur when the presence of certain kinds of environmental stimuli are necessary for development to proceed normally.</li>
                            <li><strong>Lifespan approaches versus a focus on a particular period:</strong> Developmentalists now believe the entire lifespan is important, for several reasons. One is the discovery that developmental growth and change continue during every part of life. Furthermore, to understand fully the social influences on people of a given age, we need to understand the people who are in large measure providing those influences. For instance, to understand development in infants, we need to unravel the effects of their parents' ages on the social environment.</li>
                            <li><strong>Nature versus nurture:</strong> One of the enduring questions of development involves how much of people's behaviour is due to their genetically-determined nature and how much is due to nurture, the physical and social environment in which a child is raised. In this context, nature refers to traits, abilities and capacities that are inherited from one's parents. Nature encompasses any factor that is produced by the predetermined unfolding of genetic information - a process known as maturation. These genetic, inherited influences are at work as we move from the one-celled organism that is created at the moment of conception to the billions of cells that make up a fully-formed human being. In contrast nurture refers to the environmental influences that shape behaviour. Some of these influences may be biological, such as the impact of a pregnant mother's substance abuse on the fetus, or the amount and kind of food available to children. Other environmental influences are more social, such as the ways parents discipline their children and the effects of peer pressure on adolescents.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">How each of the six theoretical perspectives on human development explains child development</h3>
                        <p>Lifespan development has produced a number of broad conceptual perspectives representing different approaches to development. Each broad perspective encompasses a number of theories, explanations and predictions concerning phenomena of interest. A theory provides a framework for understanding the relationships among an organized set of principles or facts. The six major theoretical perspectives include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Psychodynamic Perspective: Focusing on the inner person.</strong> Rooted in Freud's theory, the psychodynamic approach maintains that all behaviour and mental processes reflect the constant and mostly unconscious psychological struggles that rage silently within each person. Usually, these struggles involve conflict between the impulse to satisfy instincts or wishes and the need to play by the rules in society. Anxiety, depression and other disorders are outward signs of this inner turmoil.</li>
                            <li><strong>The Behavioural Perspective: Considering the outer person.</strong> As founded by John Watson, the behavioural approach views behaviour and mental processes as primarily the result of learning. Psychologists who take this approach see rewards and punishment acting on the raw materials provided by genes, evolution and biology to shape each individual. So, whether considering a person's aggression or drug abuse, behaviourists would look at that person's learning history. Since people learn problem behaviours, they can also learn to change or even prevent them by unlearning old habits and developing new ones.</li>
                            <li><strong>The Cognitive Perspective: Examining the roots of understanding.</strong> The cognitive perspective focuses on how people take in, mentally represent and store information. Cognitive psychologists then relate perception and information processing to patterns of behaviour. They study such areas as decision-making, problem-solving, interpersonal attraction and intelligence. Aggression, for instance, might be viewed as a result of poor problem solving.</li>
                            <li><strong>The Humanistic Perspective: Concentrating on the unique qualities of human beings.</strong> According to the humanistic approach, our capacity to choose how to think and act determines our behaviour. Each person's unique perceptions - not instincts, cognitive processes, or rewards and punishments dictate the choices made. Humanistic psychologists believe that people are essentially good, that they are in control of themselves, and that they seek to grow toward their highest potential.</li>
                            <li><strong>The Evolutionary Perspective: Focusing on biology as the determinant of development.</strong> Darwin's ideas on evolution and adaptation of species laid the foundation for the evolutionary approach. The evolutionary approach to 1psychology holds that the behaviour of animals and humans today is the result of evolution through natural selection. Psychologists who follow this approach are concerned with the adaptive value of behaviour, the anatomy and biology that make it possible and the environmental conditions that encourage or discourage it.</li>
                            <li><strong>The socio-cultural Perspective: Emphasizing the systems of support.</strong> Calling attention to the external influences on human behaviour such as the physical surroundings and social interactions that provide incentives, opportunities and pathways for growth, Urie Bronfenbrenner (1979) began to emphasize the ecological approach to the study of human development. In Bronfenbrenner's application of this concept, human ecosystems include both the physical environment (the climate, the space per person, that arrangement of the dwelling) and the social environment (the people, the culture, and the economy).</li>
