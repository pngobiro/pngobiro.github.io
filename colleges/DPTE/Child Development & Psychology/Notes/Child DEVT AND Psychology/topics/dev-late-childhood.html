                        <p>The word "adolescence" comes from the Latin adolescere meaning "to grow into maturity". As well as being a time of enormous physiological change, adolescence is also marked by changes in behaviour and expectations. Traditionally, adolescence has been regarded as a prelude to and preparation for adulthood, a transitional period of life between immaturity and maturity. As well as having to deal with the question 'Who Am I?', the adolescent must also deal with the question, 'Who will I be?'</p>
                        <p>This unit considers the physical, emotional, cognitive and social changes during adolescence from the perspectives of the developing young person, and the micro-, exoand macrosystems of support as described by Urie Bronfenbrenner.</p>

                        <p>This introductory lesson examines the biological, cognitive and socio-emotional aspects of adolescence.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">The roles nature and nurture play in the development of an adolescent</h3>
                        <p>Brainstorm with the students examples of both genetic inheritance and environmental influences on adolescent development. Some examples for nature might include height, weight, temperament and personality traits, intelligence, multiple intelligences and so on. Some examples for the nurture side of the equation might include parenting, family, peers, socioeconomic status, schooling, nutrition, and self-concept and so on.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">The socio-cultural influences on adolescent development</h3>
                        <p>At the microsystem level, discuss with the students the relative influences of parents, peers and the classroom setting. In what ways do these aspects of the system of support influence our physical, emotional, cognitive and spiritual development? Do parents, peers or the classroom dominate during adolescence?</p>
                        <p>At the exosystem level, discuss the relative influences of the school, the mass media (refer to LESSON 6.5.7 for more information) and the community. What school policies are in place that promote healthy development? How has changing technology influenced adolescent development? What community resources are available to promote healthy adolescent development?</p>
                        <p>At the macrosystem level, discuss the influence that culture has on adolescent development. Is there such a thing as an "adolescent culture"? If so, how would you describe an adolescent culture? Has that culture changed? Why or why not? In terms of the influence that economics has on adolescent development, discuss LESSONs such as the cost of clothing, transportation and entertainment. How many students have a part-time job? How many hours a week does that job involve? Why do you need to work? What skills are you learning?</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">What are the developmental changes during adolescence?</h3>
                        <p>Adolescence is the period of transition from childhood to adulthood. It is probably the most challenging and complicated period of life to describe, to study, or to experience. The biological changes of puberty, which is considered to begin adolescence, are universal, but their expression, timing and extent show enormous variety, depending on gender, genes, and nutrition. Cognitive development varies as well; many adolescents are egocentric, while others think logically, hypothetically and theoretically. Psychosocial changes during this second decade of life show even greater diversity, as adolescents develop their own identities - choosing from a vast number of sexual, moral, political and educational paths. Most of this diversity simply reflects differences in social and cultural contexts. But for about one adolescent in four, fateful choices are made that handicap, and sometimes destroy the future.</p>
                        <p>Yet there is also a commonality to the adolescent experience. All adolescents are confronted with the same developmental tasks: they must adjust to their changing body sizes and shapes, to their awakening sexuality, and to new ways of thinking. They all strive for the emotional maturity and economic independence that characterize adulthood.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">How adolescents deal with change in their lives</h3>
                        <p>Researchers have looked at how and why people change either on their own or with help. Prochaska, Norcross and Diclemente (1992) have proposed a wheel concept that illustrates the six stages of change:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Precontemplation:</strong> At this point a person is not even thinking that there is a problem or that there is a need to make a change. A person requires information and feedback to raise their awareness that they can make changes. This is the entry point into change.</li>
                            <li><strong>Contemplation:</strong> At this point the person swings between considering a change and rejecting it repeatedly.</li>
                            <li><strong>Determination or preparation:</strong> The person determines that they have to do something about the problem and questions what they can do and explores options.</li>
                            <li><strong>Action:</strong> A person engages in actions in order to bring a change.</li>
                            <li><strong>Maintenance:</strong> A person continues previous action and perhaps tries new skills.</li>
                            <li><strong>Relapse:</strong> There is a return to old behaviour and the task is to get on the wheel again.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">The physical changes during adolescence</h3>
                        <p>During adolescence, the body is moving upward and outward rapidly in what is called the growth spurt. When growth spurts occur, development is not orderly. Arms and hands may grow at different rates from legs, for instance, while other parts of the body develop at yet another rate. Although they may look gangly, teenagers have exceptionally good coordination.</p>
                        <p>Growth spurts occur earlier for girls than boys, but for both sexes, early adolescence is the time of maximum physical development. Between the ages of nine and 12, girls may grow as much as eight centimetres taller in one year. For boys, this growth occurs between 11 and 15, when they may gain as much as 10 centimetres in height in a year.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">How important body image to adolescents</h3>
                        <p>Concern about weight is a common problem for adolescents. Weight and body image are more often problems for females than for males. Society places more importance on physical appearance for women than for men.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">The general theories about eating disorders</h3>
                        <p>Why would individuals torture themselves with such a destructive means of relieving emotional distress? Each theory offers an explanation:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>One psychoanalytic hypothesis is that women develop eating disorders because of a conflict with their mothers who provided their first nourishment and from whom the daughters cannot psychically separate.</li>
                            <li>Learning theory notes that both anorexia and bulimia are typically associated with psychological problems, including low self-esteem and depression. These psychological disorders precipitate extreme dieting and then perpetuate the destructive pattern, thus becoming part of a stimulus-response chain. Fasting, bingeing and purging have "powerful effects as immediate reinforcers - that is, as a means of relieving states of emotional distress and tension."</li>
                            <li>One cognitive explanation is that as women compete with men in business and industry, they want to project a strong, self-controlled, masculine image antithetical to the buxom, fleshy body of the ideal woman of the past.</li>
                            <li>socio-cultural explanations include the contemporary cultural pressure to be slim and trim and model-like - a pressure that seems to be particularly felt by unmarried young women seeking autonomy from their parents. This would help explain why these eating disorders were once rare; society expected women to be dependent, first on parents and then on a husband, with no need to prove one's selfhood.</li>
                            <li>An ethological explanation notes that girls who are overwhelmed with the stresses of puberty may discover that self-starvation makes their menstrual periods cease, their sexual hormones decrease, and their curves disappear - all of which remove the sexual pressures that normal maturation compels adolescent girls to experience.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">How self-appraisal can influence adolescent development</h3>
                        <p>Negative self-appraisal can have a major impact on self-esteem. Although self-esteem is obviously influenced by success in athletics, academics, friendship or other areas that the adolescent considers significant, a teenager's assessment of his or her appearance is the most important determinant. At one time or another, almost every American girl under eats, sometimes drastically, to be thinner. In one study, girls age 14 to 18 typically wanted to be about 12 pounds (five kilograms) lighter than they were. Boys are also vulnerable. Roughly five percent of high school seniors use steroids to build up their muscles. Boys who do not take drugs are nonetheless concerned, lifting weights, doing push-ups, and so on, in an attempt to change their physiques. The concern with physique dominates the peer culture, particularly during adolescence. Unattractive teenagers tend to have fewer friends - of either sex. And attractiveness is a sexual lure, especially during adolescence. Adolescents also receive powerful messages from the broader social environment. Media images of handsome faces and beautiful bodies are used to sell almost everything, from clothes and cosmetics to luncheon meats and auto parts. These images reinforce the cultural stereotype that men should be tall and muscular, and that women should be thin and shapely.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">The process of cognitive development during adolescence</h3>
                        <p>Since adolescents must deal with a staggering number of issues, it is fortunate that their thought processes and moral reasoning have reached their highest level. In Piaget's theory of cognitive development, the formal operations stage includes the ability to reason in abstract ways - to consider the possibilities instead of thinking only in terms of concrete realities. The ability to think abstractly helps the future become more real. This high level of reasoning ability helps adolescents consider how the world could be a better place and why personal principles are sometimes more important than external rules and laws (McMahon and Romano, 2000, p. 335).</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">"Adolescent egocentrism", and the role it plays n cognitive and social development</h3>
                        <p>Adolescents frequently practise their new thinking skills on themselves, a process that makes them lose some of their detachment. They worry about how they are regarded by others; they try to sort out their own conflicting feelings about parents, school and close friends; they think deeply but not always realistically about their future possibilities; they reflect, at length, on each day's experiences. Analyzing their private thoughts and feelings, forecasting their future, and reflecting on their experiences underlie the greater reflection and self-awareness - and enhanced capacity for selfcenteredness - that distinguishes adolescence. However, these new ventures in introspection are often distorted by adolescent egocentrism, a self-view in which adolescents regard themselves as much more socially significant as they actually are. Adolescent egocentrism can lead to false conclusions:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>One is the <strong>invincibility fable</strong>, by which young people feel that they will never fall victim, as others do, to dangerous behaviour.</li>
                            <li>Another false conclusion resulting from adolescent egocentrism is the <strong>personal fable</strong>, through which adolescents imagine their own lives as unique, heroic, or even mythical. They perceive themselves as different from others, distinguished by unusual experiences, perspectives, and values.</li>
                            <li>A third false conclusion stemming from egocentrism is called the <strong>imaginary audience</strong>. This arises from many adolescents' assumption that other people are as intensely interested in them as they themselves are. This results in acute selfconsciousness.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">How we make sense of the behaviour of other people</h3>
                        <p>Social cognition is the thought process of making sense of events, people, oneself, and the world in general through analyzing and interpreting them. Social cognition focuses on social information in memory, which affects judgments, choices, evaluations, and ultimately, behaviour .</p>
                        <p>Social cognition focuses on the way in which our thoughts are affected by the immediate social context, and in turn, how our thoughts affect social behaviour. The approach can be summarized as follows:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>People have a limited capacity to process information about the social world and will take cognitive shortcuts (such as stereotyping) in order to minimize the load.</li>
                            <li>We develop schemata that represent our knowledge about ourselves, others, and our roles within the social world. These schemata, once formed, bias our judgements about ourselves and others.</li>
                            <li>Schemata become more complex and organized over time, and also harder to change.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Often, to save time, people use mental shortcuts to make sense of the world, developing rules of thumb. Some of these rules of thumb include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Representativeness</strong>, (individuals or events that appear to be representative of other members of a group are quickly classified as such)</li>
                            <li><strong>Availability</strong> (ease of association with existing knowledge)</li>
                            <li><strong>False consensus effect</strong> ( people tend to believe that others agree with them)</li>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">How we form impressions of people</h3>
                        <p>The evidence indicates that we follow a weighted averaging model in combining information about people. That is, we keep a rough "running average" of our trait ratings in our heads, as we discover more characteristics about people.</p>
                        <p>Of course, we know that every person is unique, and that no two classes, no two hockey matches are exactly alike. Yet there are similarities among certain types of people or events. Thus, we tend to organize our view of the world in terms of categories. People are generally categorized in terms of easily observable characteristics, such as gender, ethnic group, occupation or age. Similarly, we construct categories of events, activities, objects and even ideas.</p>
                        <p>Cantor and Mischel (1979) suggest that we often use prototypes - mental images of a typical example of that category - for example a dog as a prototype of the category, mammal. The extent to which a particular object resembles the prototype, and the extent to which you allow for variations, will determine how readily you identify the object with the category.</p>
                        <p>Each of us uses a particular organizing schema to make sense of the information about others. We do this by using constructs:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Physical constructs</strong> classify people according to their appearance: male or female, beautiful or ugly, fat or thin, young or old, and so on.</li>
                            <li><strong>Role constructs</strong> use social position: student, lawyer, wife, and so on.</li>
                            <li><strong>Interaction constructs</strong> focus on social behaviour: Friendly, helpful, aloof, and sarcastic.</li>
                            <li><strong>Psychological constructs:</strong> curious, nervous, insecure and so on.</li>
                            <li><strong>Membership constructs</strong> help us to identify others according to the group in which they belong: teacher, Liberal, Environmentalist, and so on (Adler, Towne and Rolls, 2001, p. 91).</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Some errors in forming impressions</h3>
                        <p>Researchers have noticed two interesting biases in how first impressions of people are formed. First, people tend to form impressions of others which are positive rather than negative, a positivity bias. But while we have this bias towards being positive in our impressions of others, those impressions will be influenced more by negative than by positive information. This is called the negativity effect.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">How we make judgments and decisions about other people</h3>
                        <p>In addition to schemas, people use judgmental heuristics to help us deal with the large amount of social information with which we are faced. Heuristics are rules of thumb people follow in order to make judgments quickly and efficiently. The availability heuristic refers to the ease with which we can think of something, which has a strong effect on how we view the world. The representative heuristic helps us decide how similar one thing is to another; we use it to classify people or situations on the basis of their similarity to a typical case. When using this heuristic we have a tendency to ignore base rate information - that is, the prior probability that someone or something belongs in that classification. People also rely on the anchoring/adjustment heuristic, wherein an initial piece of information acts as an anchor, or starting point, for subsequent thoughts on the subject.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Social perception</h3>
                        <p>Social perception is the process by which someone infers other people's motives and intentions from observing their behaviour and deciding whether the causes of the behaviour are internal or situational. Social perception helps people make sense of the world, organize their thoughts quickly, and maintain a sense of control over the environment. It helps people feel competent and masterful, maintain a sense of balance, because it helps them predict similar events in the future.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">How social perceptions are formed and changed</h3>
                        <p>Research has shown that people form impressions of each other in two ways. Sometimes people make quick and effortless judgments based on others' physical appearance, facial expressions, or body language. Studies have shown, for example, that people who are physically attractive are perceived to be happy, warm, friendly, successful, confident, and well-adjusted. At other times, however, people form impressions based on a careful observation of a person's behaviour. According to this latter view, people act like amateur scientists, gathering and analyzing behavioural evidence before evaluating others. The explanations for behaviour that people come up with are called attributions, and the theory that describes the process is called attribution theory.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">How we select information about others</h3>
                        <p>Because we are exposed to more input than we could possibly manage, the first step in perception is the selection of which data we will attend to. There are several factors that cause us to notice some messages and ignore others.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Stimuli that are intense often attract our attention.</li>
                            <li>Repetitious stimuli also attract our attention. Just as a quiet but steadily dripping faucet can come to dominate our awareness, people to whom we are frequently exposed become noticeable.</li>
                            <li>Attention is also frequently related to contrast or change in stimulation. Put differently, unchanging people or things become less noticeable.</li>
                            <li>Motives determine not only what information we select from our environment but also how we perceive people. For example, someone looking for a romantic adventure will be especially aware of attractive potential partners.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">What some problems and issues in forming impressions of people and situations are</h3>
                        <p>Over the years, research into attribution has shown that when we explain the behaviour of others, we tend to overestimate the role of personal factors and underestimate the influence of situations. This bias is so universal that it has been called the fundamental attribution error. In one demonstration of the fundamental attribution error, experimenters randomly assigned subjects to participate in a quiz show in the role of either questioner or contestant. Then in front of the contestant and an observer, the experimenters told the questioner to devise a set of difficult questions to ask the contestant. Not surprisingly, many of the questions-created from the questioner's own store of esoteric knowledge- stumped the contestant. Yet when asked to rate the general knowledge of both participants, observers consistently saw the questioners as more knowledgeable than the contestants. The observers failed to take the situational roles into account and attributed the behaviour they witnessed to each person's level of knowledge. In forming impressions of others, people are subject to other biases as well. For example, a great deal of research shows that people are often slow to revise their first impressions of others even when those views are not supported by the evidence. Part of the problem is that once we form an impression of someone, we tend to interpret that person's later behaviour in ways that seem to fit our impression. Another problem is that our first impression of someone may shape the way we treat that person-which, in turn, may influence his or her actual behaviour. This process is known as a self-fulfilling prophecy.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">What the relationship between attribution, stereotypes, prejudice and discrimination is</h3>
                        <p>The various components that make up an attitude may not always be in agreement. Prejudice is no exception. A crucial factor in prejudice appears to be the affective component. Thus, an individual may intellectually accept that native people are not inherently less capable or lazier than whites, but may nevertheless avoid them. However, attitude components are more likely to be highly correlated in extreme bigots. This type of person will not only have strong negative feelings, but will usually have an extensive set of negative stereotypes, some of which may be quite bizarre.</p>

                        <p>This lesson addresses the multitude of social roles, gender roles, relationships and social behaviours that characterize adolescence as a unique stage of development.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">What the process of socio-emotional development in adolescence is</h3>
                        <p>Adolescence is often painted as a time of great difficulty and confusion. While the trials of this period vary from one culture to another, there is little indication that it is actually that bad for most adolescents. One of the hardest issues to deal with is trying to find an identity. Until adolescence, there is no pressure to find out about yourself. Now it becomes necessary to try out different roles to see which ones fit. Other societies, especially in non-industrialized nations, handle the transition from childhood to adulthood more simply. This transition is made through some kind of initiation, or rite of passage, meaning that a change of status is recognized by a formal ritual. We have no such ceremonies, so adolescents need to form their own subculture in order to avoid complete isolation. Forming groups and achieving a sense of identity are two crucial psychological issues during adolescence.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">How we explain our social behaviour</h3>
                        <p>Problem behaviour theory (Jessor, 1993) represents a comprehensive approach to understanding adolescent behaviour. In it, adolescent behaviour is viewed as being consistent with what the adolescent is like as a person (a "personality system"), how the adolescent is reacting to his or her home life and peer group (a "perceived environment system"), and what the adolescent tends to be doing (a "behaviour system"). Personality variables relevant to problem behaviour include low expectancies for success in school, high values for independence, and an absence of constraints against such behaviour, such as religious beliefs or concern about deviance. Predisposing characteristics of the social environment include opportunities to engage in problem behaviour and the influence of peer groups. Problem drinking also tends to be part of a more general pattern of behaviour, including the use of marijuana and other drug use, deviant/delinquent acts such as lying and stealing, and precocious sexual involvement, along with less participation in school and church activities</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">What self-concept is</h3>
                        <p>The self-concept has four components: self-image, self-esteem (or self-regard), idealself and selfefficacy.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Self-image</strong> is the sort of person we think we are. One way of assessing selfimage is to ask people to answer the question 'Who Am I?' 20 times. This typically produces two main categories of answers relating to social roles and personality traits. Self-image also includes body image.</li>
                            <li>While self-image is essentially descriptive, <strong>self-esteem</strong> is essentially evaluative. Self-esteem is the extent to which we like or approve of ourselves, and how worthwhile we think we are.</li>
                            <li>The <strong>ideal-self</strong> is the kind of person we would like to be. In general, the greater the gap between self-image and ideal-self, the lower the self-esteem.</li>
                            <li>According to Bandura (1977), <strong>self-efficacy</strong>, or one's expectations of success in a given situation, is an important determinant of whether one will attempt to make changes in one's environment. Each day, we make many decisions based on our perceptions of the extent to which our actions will produce reinforcement. Our actions are based on our evaluations of our competency. Moreover, self-efficacy not only determines whether we will engage in a particular behaviour, it also determines the extent to which we will maintain that behaviour in the face of adversity.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">How we develop a self-concept</h3>
                        <p>According to Carl Rogers (1980), self-concept or identity is shaped partly by selfactualizing tendencies and partly by others' evaluations. In this way, people come to like what they are "supposed" to like and to behave as they are "supposed" to behave. Although this socialization process is adaptive, allowing people to get along in society, it often requires that they stifle the self-actualizing tendency and distort experience.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">How we change a self-concept</h3>
                        <p>Four ways self-esteem can be improved are through:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Identifying the causes of low self-esteem and the domains of competence important to the self. People have the highest self-esteem when they perform competently in domains important to the self.</li>
                            <li>Emotional support and social approval, including both adult and peer approval.</li>
                            <li>Achievement, which has much in common with Bandura's cognitive social learning concept of self-efficacy, which refers to individuals' beliefs that he or she can master a situation and produce positive outcomes.</li>
                            <li>Coping with a problem rather than avoiding it. If coping rather than avoidance prevails, people often face problems realistically, honestly and nondefensively. This produces favourable selfevaluative thoughts, which lead to the selfgenerated approval that raises self-esteem.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">How gender influences self-concept</h3>
                        <p>In the 1970s, as both males and females became dissatisfied with the burdens imposed by their stereotypical roles, alternatives to masculinity and femininity were proposed. Instead of describing masculinity and femininity as a continuum in which more of one means less of the other, it was proposed that individuals could have both masculine and feminine traits. This thinking led to the development of androgyny, which refers to the presence of desirable masculine and feminine characteristics in the same person. The androgynous male might be assertive (masculine) and nurturant (feminine). The androgynous female might be powerful (masculine) and sensitive to the feelings of others (feminine).</p>

According to Carl Rogers (1980), the self is the part of experience that a person identifies with "I" or "me". Those who accurately experience the self - with all the preferences, abilities, fantasies, shortcomings and desires - are on the road to self-actualization.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">How the self-concept develops</h3>
                        <p>Identity formation is the central task of adolescents according to Erikson's theory of psychosocial development. According to Erikson (1968) issues in late adolescence graduating from high school, going to college and forging relationships - challenge the adolescent's self-concept, precipitating an identity crisis. In this crisis, the adolescent must develop an integrated self-image as a unique person by pulling together selfknowledge acquired during childhood. If infancy and childhood brought trust, autonomy and initiative, according to Erikson, the adolescent will resolve the identity crisis positively, feeling self-confident and competent. If, however, infancy and childhood resulted in feelings of mistrust, shame, guilt and inferiority, the adolescent will be confused about his or her identity and goals.</p>
                        <p>Cooley (1902) argued that we construct our self-concepts from how we appear to others, which is then reflected back to us - what he called the looking-glass self. There are several processes by which "reflection" enables us to construct our ideas and impressions of ourselves:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Social Identity</strong> refers to those aspects of a person's self-image that depend upon the social categories and groups to which he or she belongs. Turner (1982) describes social identification as a three-part process. First, there is social categorization: individuals perceive themselves and others in terms of membership in distinct categories or groups. Second, the typical norms, attitudes and behaviours that distinguish the groups determine behaviour to a large degree. Third, individuals conform to the stereotypes associated with the group.</li>
                            <li>Perhaps most central to your social identity is your gender - male or female. What does "masculinity" and "femininity" mean? What is called masculinity has been described as instrumentality or agency, a concern with achieving goals and being active in the world, while femininity is described as expressiveness or communion, being other-centered and concerned with interpersonal relationships.</li>
                            <li><strong>Self-perception theory</strong> suggests that people become aware of their own attitudes, feelings, values, dispositions and other internal characteristics in the same way that they form impressions of the characteristics of others - through observation of their own behaviour. The notion of self-knowledge through self-perception implies that, rather than thinking about what we really believe in, and then acting on those beliefs, we first act and then discover our beliefs and values from our own actions.</li>
                            <li><strong>Social comparison</strong> is based on three premises:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Humans have a drive to evaluate their own opinions, feelings and abilities, and want to feel confident that they are accurate.</li>
                                    <li>In the absence of objective or nonsocial bases of assessment, individuals will evaluate themselves in comparison with others.</li>
                                    <li>People tend to compare themselves with someone similar to themselves in opinion, background or ability. In general, people compare themselves to someone equal when the goal is self-assessment, to someone better when the goal is selfimprovement, and to someone inferior when the goal is selfenhancement.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">What influences the development of a self-concept</h3>
                        <p>The society in which we live, or the ethnic group to which we belong, shapes many of our beliefs, values and behaviours - and these play important roles in shaping the character of the personality. Dion and Dion (1993) argue that members of collectivist and individualistic cultures think differently about love and marriage. Their thesis is that romantic conceptualizations of love flourish only in individualistic cultures. Why? Because romantic notions of love and marriage focus narrowly on the specific needs of the individual. Romantic love is "selfish" in the dictionary sense of "seeking or concentrating on one's own welfare or advantage." Each individual has an idealized notion of a relationship with another that will bring him or her great gratification. Members of individualistic societies assume they have the right to enter into such selfsatisfying relationships and tend to display only marginal concern about the possible reactions of others.</p>
                        <p>In a collectivist society, on the other hand, the individual has a deep interactive dependency with his or her family and reference group, and a more extended selfconcept. In such societies, the individual must carefully consider the degree to which a prospective partner will fit into this relationship. In short, the self-concept that characterizes collectivist societies does not allow love and marriage to be considered exclusively in terms of the narrow interests of the individual.</p>
                        <p>The Ashanti people of West Africa name children according to the day of the week on which they are born because they believe they have different personalities. Police records indicated that a very high proportion of juvenile delinquents were born on a Wednesday (the day of the "naturally aggressive" personality), whilst a very low proportion were born on a Monday (the day of the "quiet and calm" personality). If Ashanti boys were treated in a way consistent with their names, they may consequently become what their names indicate they are really like (a self-fulfilling prophecy). In Maori culture, a person is invested with a certain kind of power (manna), given by the gods in accordance with family status and birth circumstances. This enables a person to be effective, whether in battle or everyday dealings with others. However, this power is not a stable resource but can be increased or decreased by the person's day-to-day conduct. A person who forgot a ritual observance or committed some misdemeanor would have his or her power decreased. A person's social standing, successes and failures, and so on are seen as dependent on external sources rather than internal states (such as personality or motivation). Indeed, manna is only one of the external forces which inhabit a person. Instead of representing themselves as the centre and origin of their actions (which is crucial to the Western concept of the self), the individual Maori do not own experiences such as fear, anger, love and grief. Rather, these experiences are visitations governed by the unseen world of powers and forces.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">What we do when our self-concept is threatened</h3>
                        <p>When threatened, we all do our best to keep some kind of balance. We protect our inner selves from too much attack by using defense mechanisms:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>When we use <strong>repression</strong> we do not allow ourselves to remain aware of painful material; we push it out of consciousness. Repression is usually unhealthy.</li>
                            <li>When we engage in <strong>denial</strong>, we refuse to admit that anything bad has happened. In some ways, denial is similar to repression. With repression, though, we are at least partly aware of the problem, and then we push it out of consciousness. With denial, we do not let the problem into consciousness in the first place.</li>
                            <li>Sometimes we have trouble directly expressing what we feel because of the threat (real or imagined) that something terrible will happen as a result. So we vent our feelings elsewhere or on someone else, engaging in <strong>displacement</strong>.</li>
                            <li>In <strong>reaction formation</strong>, what we express is the opposite of what we really feel. Reaction formation is sometimes a little hard to see in operation, since we can not read people's minds.</li>
                            <li>When the emotions we feel are too overwhelming, we may try to eliminate them altogether. Talking coolly and rationally about a tragedy as if it were simply an event that we had observed is called <strong>intellectualization</strong>. We have taken all of the feelings out of our description.</li>
                            <li><strong>Identification with the aggressor</strong> occurs when we are mistreated for a long time by someone much more powerful than we are, and begin to take on that person's characteristics. We begin to identify with him or her, or try to gain favour.</li>
                            <li>With <strong>regression</strong> we defend ourselves by "moving backward" and behaving like children. This defense is an extreme reaction to the frustration of having to be an adult and take responsibility. We regress to a time when we were helpless children and someone had to take care of us.</li>
                            <li>With <strong>rationalization</strong> we explain what we do in such a way that we avoid any responsibility for a bad outcome.</li>
                            <li><strong>Projection</strong> refers to the process of mentally giving to someone else our own thoughts or feelings. A continued pattern of such behaviour is self-destructive, since it does not help us face up to how we might be causing the problem.</li>
                            <li><strong>Sublimation</strong> occurs when we channel our emotional energy into a constructive or creative activity. It is the only defense mechanism that is truly healthy and adaptive.</li>

                        <p>Culture has been defined as the accumulation of values, rules of behaviour, forms of expression, religious beliefs, occupational choices, and the like for a group of people who share a common language and environment. As such, culture is an organizing and stabilizing influence. It encourages or discourages particular behaviours and mental processes. It also allows people to understand others and anticipate their behaviour. It is a kind of group adaptation passed by tradition and example rather than by genes, from one generation to the next. Culture determines, for example, whether children's education is concerned with hunting or reading, how close people stand when they talk to each other, and whether or not they form lines in public places.</p>

                        <p>Cultures differ in their degree of fatalism and in their beliefs about whether it is possible to take control over their health. For example, in Germany, which has a highly structured social welfare system, people feel they have more psychological control over their health and work than Americans do. Might these cultural attitudes be related to mortality rates? The answer, remarkably, seems to be yes. In traditional Chinese astrology, certain birth years are considered unlucky, and people born in those years often fatalistically expect bad fortune. This expectation can become a self-fulfilling prophecy. In a study of many thousands of people matched by age and cause of death, Chinese-Americans who had been born in a year traditionally considered to be ill-fated died significantly earlier - one to five years earlier! - than whites who had been born in the same year and who had the same disease. The more strongly traditional the Chinese were, the more years of life they lost. These results held for nearly all causes of death studied, even when the researchers controlled for how well the patients took care of themselves and which treatments they were given.</p>

                        <p>Gender identity is our classification of ourselves (and others) as male or female, boy or girl, and so on. Gender role refers to the behaviours, attitudes, beliefs and so on which a particular society either expects from, or considers appropriate to, males and females on the basis of their biological sex. To be masculine or feminine, therefore, requires males and females to conform to their respective gender roles.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">How a gender identity develops</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Biological:</strong> Supporters of a biological approach to gender development argue that males and females are biologically programmed for certain kinds of activities compatible with male and female roles.</li>
                            <li><strong>Humanistic theory (Rogers):</strong> Rogers assumes that each person responds as an organized whole to reality as he or she perceives it. Rogers emphasized selfactualization, which he described as an innate tendency towards growth that motivates all human behaviour. To Rogers, personality is the expression of each individual's self-actualizing tendency as it unfolds in that individual's unique, perceived reality. Central to Rogers' theory is the self, the part of experience that a person identifies as "I" or "Me".</li>
                            <li><strong>Socio-biological theory:</strong> Socio-biologists (evolutionary theorists) argue that gender has gradually evolved over the course of human development as part of our broader adaptation to the environment. The relatively greater physical strength and lung capacity of males make them better suited to hunting and defending territory and family. The child-bearing and milkproducing capacities of females, however, make them ideally suited to child care and other nurturant roles.</li>
                            <li><strong>Psychoanalytic theory:</strong> Freud's theory is related to his explanation of moral development. Up until the resolution of the Oedipus complex, gender identity is assumed to be flexible. Resolution of the Oedipus complex occurs through identification with the same-sex parent, and results in the acquisition of both a superego and gender identity. As well as a weaker conscience, Freud also saw the development of gender identity as being weaker in girls than boys.</li>
                            <li><strong>Social learning theory:</strong> According to social learning theory, one reason girls and boys learn to behave differently is that they are treated differently by their parents. Social learning theory emphasizes the roles of observational learning and reinforcement. By observing others behaving in particular ways and then imitating that behaviour, children receive reinforcement from significant others for behaviours considered to be sex-appropriate.</li>
                            <li><strong>Cognitive-developmental:</strong> The cognitive-developmental approach emphasizes the child's participation in developing both an understanding of gender and gender-appropriate behaviour. Children's discovery of the fact that they are male or female causes them to identify with members of the same sex (not the other way around as psychoanalytic and social learning theories suggest). According to cognitive-developmental psychologists, young children acquire an understanding of the concepts male and female in three stages:
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Gender labeling or basic gender identity:</strong> This occurs somewhere around age three and refers to the child's recognition that it is male or female.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Gender stability:</strong> By age four or five, most children recognize that people retain their gender for a lifetime. However, there are limitations, in that children rely on superficial signs such as the hair length to determine the gender.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Gender constancy:</strong> At around age six or seven, children realize that gender is immutable. Gender constancy represents a kind of conservation and, significantly, appears shortly after the child has mastered conservation of quantity.</li>
                                </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">What the differences between the genders are</h3>
                        <p>Santrock (1999) states that genuine behavioural differences do exist between the sexes and people's stereotypes are not entirely inaccurate. But the differences are fewer in number, smaller in size and far more complex than stereotypes suggest.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Physical/Biological:</strong> From conception on, females are less likely to die than males. Females also are less likely than males to develop physical or mental disorders. Estrogen strengthens the immune system, making females more resistant to infection. Males have twice the risk of coronary disease as females. On average, males grow to be about 10 percent taller than females.</li>
                            <li><strong>Cognitive abilities:</strong> In the cognitive domain, it appears that there are three genuine gender differences. First, on the average, females tend to exhibit slightly better verbal skills than males. Second, starting in high school, males show a slight advantage on tests of mathematical ability. Third, starting in the grade school years, males tend to score higher than females on various measures of visual-spatial ability.</li>
                            <li><strong>Social behaviour and personality:</strong> First, studies indicate that males tend to be more aggressive than females, both verbally and physically. This disparity shows up in early childhood. Second, there are gender differences in nonverbal communication. The evidence indicates that females are more sensitive than males to subtle nonverbal cues. Females also smile and gaze at others more than males. Third, females appear to be slightly more susceptible to persuasion and conforming to group pressure than males are. Fourth, males are more sexually active than females are, and they have more permissive attitudes about causal, premarital and extramarital sex. Finally, males score higher on assertiveness scales, whereas females score higher on measures of anxiety, trust, empathy and nurturance. Sixth, females are more relationshiporiented than males, and that this relationship-orientation should be prized as a more important skill in our culture than it is currently held to be.</li>
                            <li><strong>Communication:</strong> Sociologist Deborah Tannen (1990) distinguishes between rapport talk and report talk. Rapport talk is the language of conversation and a way of establishing connections and negotiating relationships. Report talk is talk that gives information. Males hold centre stage through report talk, while females prefer private, rapport talk and conversation that is relationshiporiented.</li>
                            <li><strong>Aggression:</strong> One of the most consistent gender differences is that boys are more aggressive than girls. Another is that boys are more active than girls. The aggression difference is especially pronounced when children are provoked. These differences occur across cultures and appear very early in children's development. Biological factors include heredity and hormones. Environmental factors include cultural expectations, adult and peer models, and social agents who reward aggression in males and punish aggression in females.</li>
                            <li><strong>Emotional control:</strong> An important skill is to be able to regulate and control your emotions and behaviour. Males usually show less self-regulation than females, and this low self-control can translate into behavioural problems. In one study, children's low self-regulation was linked with greater aggression, teasing others, overreaction to frustration, low cooperation and inability to delay gratification.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Males value power, competency, efficiency and achievement. They are always doing things to prove themselves and develop their power and skills. Their sense of self is defined through their ability to achieve results. Males are solution-oriented. They experience fulfillment primarily through success and accomplishment. Males are more concerned with outdoor activities, like hunting, fishing and racing cars. They are interested in the news, weather and sports and couldn't care less about romance novels and self-help books. Males are more interested in "objects" and "things" rather than people and feelings. While women fantasize about romance, men fantasize about powerful cars, faster computers, gadgets, gizmos, and new more powerful technology.</p>
                        <p>Men are preoccupied with the "things" that can help them express power by creating results and achieving their goals. Achieving their goals is very important to a male because it is a way for him to prove his competence and thus feel good about himself. For males to feel good about themselves, they must achieve these goals by themselves. Autonomy is a symbol of efficiency, power and competence.</p>
                        <p>Females value love, communication, beauty and relationships. They spend a lot of time supporting, helping and nurturing one another. Their sense of self is defined through their feelings and the quality of their relationships. They experience fulfillment through sharing and relating. Rather than building highways and tall buildings, females are more concerned with living together in harmony, community and loving cooperation. Relationships are more important than work and technology. Personal expression, especially of feelings, is very important. Communication is of primary importance. To share their personal feelings is much more important than achieving goals and success. Talking and relating to one another is a source of tremendous fulfillment.</p>
                        <p>Instead of being goal oriented, women are relationship oriented; they are more concerned with expressing their goodness, love and caring. Females are very involved in personal growth, spirituality, and everything that can nurture life, healing and growth. Females are very intuitive. They have developed this ability through centuries of anticipating the needs of others. They pride themselves on being considerate of the needs and feelings of others (Gray, 1992, pp. 16-20).</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">What the socio-cultural influences on gender development are</h3>
                        <p>Although parents do encourage sex-appropriate play, there is evidence that biological factors may play an initial role in children's preferences. Although fathers are less likely to give dolls to one-year-old boys than to one-year-old girls, the boys who do receive the dolls are less likely to play with them (Snow et al., 1983). Perhaps adult expectations and encouragement build upon children's preferences, producing an amplifying effect. Then, because boys' toys provide more opportunity for developing motor skills, visuospatial skills, and inventiveness, and girls' toys provide more opportunity for nurturance and social exchange, some important differences in sex roles may become established.</p>
                        <p>Once children begin to play with other children outside the home, peers have a significant influence on the development of their gender roles. In fact, Stern and Karraker (1989) found that the behaviour of two- to six-year-old children was even more influenced by the knowledge of a baby's gender than was the behaviour of adults. By the time children are three years old, they reinforce gender-typed play by praising, imitating or joining in the behaviour. In contrast, they criticize gender-inappropriate behaviour (Langlois and Downs, 1980). Parents indirectly encourage gender-stereotyped play by seeking out children of the same sex as playmates for their own children.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">How we represent knowledge about ourselves</h3>
                        <p>We not only represent and store information about other people, but also about ourselves, although in a more complex and varied way. Most people have a complex self-concept with many self-schemata. These include an array of "possible selves", or future-oriented schemata of what we would like to be (our ideal-self). Visions of future possible selves may influence some of the decisions we make, such as career choices</p>
                        <p>We learn about ourselves through introspection and observations of our behaviour, and then organize this information into self-schemas. We also interpret our past using schemas and theories about how our attitudes and behaviours are likely to change. As important as these sources of self-knowledge are, though, there is still something missing. These views portray people as solitary seekers of selfknowledge, with no consultation with or comparison to other people. The two ways in which we gain selfknowledge that are entirely social, in that we rely on other people to learn about who we are, are the "looking glass self" and social comparison theory.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">How self-identity develops</h3>
                        <p>Contemporary views of identity development suggest several important considerations.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>First, identity development is a lengthy process. Identity formation begins with the appearance of attachment, the development of a sense of self, and the emergence of independence in infancy, and reaches its final phase with a life review and integration in old age.</li>
                            <li>Second, identity development is extraordinarily complex. At the bare minimum, it involves commitment to a vocational direction, an ideological stance, and a sexual orientation. Canadian psychologist James Marcia (1980) analyzed Erikson's theory of identity development and concluded that four identity statuses, or modes of resolution, appear in the theory: identity diffusion, identity foreclosure, and identity moratorium and identity achievement.
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Identity diffusion</strong> is Marcia's term for the status of adolescents who have not yet experienced a crisis (that is, they have not yet explored meaningful alternatives) or made any commitments.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Identity foreclosure</strong> is Marcia's term for adolescents who have made a commitment but have not experienced a crisis.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Identity moratorium</strong> is Marcia's term for the status of adolescents who are in the midst of a crisis, but their commitments are either absent or only vaguely defined.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Identity achievement</strong> is Marcia's term for the status of adolescents who have undergone a crisis and have made a commitment.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">The process of identity development</h3>
                        <p>As they try to sort through their possible (and multiple) selves, adolescents frequently take on a false self, acting in ways that they know are contrary to the core of their being - even if they are not sure what that core being is. According to one group of researchers (Harter, Marold, Whitesell and Cobbs, 1996), adolescents display three distinct types of false selves:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>The acceptable false self.</strong> This false self arises from the adolescent's perception that the real self is rejected by parents and peers - a perception often coloured by the adolescent's own self-hate. Adolescents who adopt a false self in order to be accepted tend to feel worthless, depressed, and hopeless; they engage in selfbetrayal to hide their true nature. They also report low levels of real selfunderstanding.</li>
                            <li><strong>The pleasing false self.</strong> This second type of false self arises from a wish to impress or please others. It is quite common among adolescents. Those who adopt it appear to be less debilitated psychologically, and to have a greater selfunderstanding, than those whose false selves arise from a sense of rejection.</li>
                            <li><strong>The experimental false self.</strong> This type of false self is one that adolescents try out "just to see how it feels". Compared with adolescents who engage in the first two types of false behaviour, these adolescents report the highest levels of selfesteem and self-knowledge, partly because although they acknowledge that their experimentation is not their usual, expected behaviour, they do not feel it is false.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">What influences the family have on identity</h3>
                        <p>Parents are important figures in the adolescent's development of identity. In studies that relate identity development to parenting styles, democratic parents, who encourage adolescents to participate in family decision making, foster identity achievement. Authoritarian parents, who control the adolescent's behaviour without giving the adolescent an opportunity to express opinions, encourage identity foreclosure. Permissive parents, who provide little guidance to adolescents and allow them to make their own decisions, promote identity diffusion.</p>
                        <p>In addition to studies on parenting styles, researchers have also examined the role of individuality and connectedness in the development of identity. The presence of a family atmosphere that promotes both individuality and connectedness is important in the adolescent's identity development. Individuality consists of two dimensions: selfassertion, the ability to have and communicate a point of view; and separateness, the use of communication patterns to express how one is different from others.</p>
                        <p>Connectedness also consists of two dimensions: mutuality, sensitivity to and respect for others' views; and permeability, openness to others' views.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">What the socio-cultural influences on identity development are</h3>
                        <p>The surrounding culture can aid identity formation in two major ways: by providing values that have stood the test of time and continue to serve their function, and by providing social structures and customs that ease the transition from childhood to adulthood. Whether a given culture actually provides these values and social structures depends primarily on how much the members of the culture agree regarding basic principles and on how stable life circumstances are from one generation to the next. In a culture where virtually everyone holds the same moral, political, religious and sexual values, and where social change is slow, identity is easy to achieve. Most young people is such traditional cultures simply accept the roles and values they grew up with. In modern industrial and post-industrial societies, by contrast, cultural consensus is rare and continuity is rarer still. Everything is open to question by almost everyone. When anything is possible, nothing is easy.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">How gender influences identity development</h3>
                        <p>Erikson described two primary developmental crises in early and middle adulthood. The first is the establishment of intimacy, which is a criterion of having attained the psychosocial state of adulthood.</p>
                        <p>By intimacy, Erikson means the ability to form close, meaningful relationships with others without 'the fear of losing oneself in the process' (Elkind, 1970). Erikson believed that a prerequisite for intimacy was the attainment of identity, or the reconciliation of all our various roles into one enduring and stable personality. Identity is necessary because we cannot know what it means to love someone and seek to share our life with them until we know who we are and what we want to do with our lives. Thus, genuine intimacy requires us to give up some of our sense of separateness, and we must each have a firm identity to do this. Intimacy does not involve sexuality. Since intimacy refers to the essential ability to relate our deepest hopes and fears to another person, and in turn accept another's need for intimacy, it describes the relationship between friends just as much as that between sexual partners .</p>
                        <p>Some researchers believe that the order of stages proposed by Erikson are different for females and males. One view is that for males identity formation precedes the stage of intimacy, while for females intimacy precedes identity. These ideas are consistent with the belief that relationships and emotional attachments are more important concerns of females, while autonomy and achievement are more important concerns of males</p>

                        <h2 id="identity_management" class="section-heading"><span class="heading-text">Identity Management</span></h2>
                        <p>How does our behaviour change according to the situation? What techniques or process do we employ in order to maintain, or possibly change, our identity? We do, indeed, have two sides to our identities, public and private. This lesson addresses the management of our uniqueness.</p>

                             <ul>
                                <li>How our behaviour change in social situations</li>
                                <li>How, and why, we disclose private and personal information about ourselves to others</li>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">How our behaviour change in social situations</h3>
                        <p>Impression management can take one of three forms: manner, appearance and setting. Manner consists of a person's words and nonverbal actions. The second dimension of identity management is appearance - the personal items people use to shape an image. Along with clothing, other aspects of appearance such as jewelry, tanned or light skin, hairstyle and colour, all play a major role in identity management. A final way to manage identities is through the choice of setting - physical items we use to influence how others view us. In modern Western society the automobile is a major part of identity management.</p>
                        <p>People high in self-monitoring are social chameleons - they can skillfully alter their behaviour to match the current situation. They adjust what they say and what they do to the current situation in order to make a positive impression on others. In contrast, low self-monitors, tend to show a higher degree of consistency. They act much the same across a wide range of situations on the basis of their particular beliefs and attitudes. Self-monitoring involves more than differences in consistency, however. Persons high in self-monitoring are generally better than low self-monitors at both reading others' emotional reactions and managing their own nonverbal cues. Thus they are generally more successful at making a good first impression. As a result, high self-monitors tend to be more successful in their careers than low selfmonitors. High self-monitors approach new situations by asking themselves: "How can I best please the people I have to deal with?" In contrast, low self-monitors ask themselves: "How can I best be me in this situation?"</p>
                        <p>Jones and Pittman (1982) have described several strategic self-presentational techniques that people use in everyday life:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>First is <strong>ingratiation</strong>, where you flatter, praise and generally make yourself likeable to another, often higher-status person.</li>
                            <li>Second is <strong>self-promotion</strong> - actively "blowing your own horn" by describing your talents, exhibiting your knowledge and generally setting out to impress people.</li>
                            <li>The flip side of self-promotion is <strong>basking in reflected glory</strong>. You cannot be good at everything, and so you cannot self-promote successfully in all areas - but you can become close to talented or successful people and bask in their glory and fame. In other words, you can appear impressive to others because you know or associate with impressive people.</li>
                            <li>A final self-presentational strategy, and the one that has attracted the most research attention, is <strong>selfhandicapping</strong>. Using this strategy, you set up reasons, before the fact, for your failure. That is, before you even engage in a task, you can make sure that you have a ready-made excuse to explain your (potentially) poor performance. There are two major ways people selfhandicap:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>In its most extreme form, people create obstacles that reduce the likelihood they will succeed on a task, so that if they do fail, they can blame it on those obstacles rather than on their lack of ability. The obstacles people have been found to use include drugs, alcohol, reduced effort on the task and failure to practise.</li>
                                    <li>The second kind of self-handicapping is less extreme. People do not create obstacles to success, but do devise ready-made excuses in case they fail.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>

                        <p>There are several characteristics of self-disclosure:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Usually happens in dyads.</li>

                        <p>The mass media includes television, movies, radio, music, newspapers, magazines, journals, video games, and the Internet.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">How viewing violence on television or in movies - and now in video games - affect the way we behave</h3>
                        <p>In many Canadian cities and in more remote communities as well, television is a common bond. In Igloolik, Nunavut, for example, of 139 households, 134 have television sets. Studies show that one in five Canadian teens watches more than five hours a day, two out of five watch three or four hours, and two out of five watch one or two hours. By the time they enter junior high, these teens have already seen 100000 violent acts and 8,000 murders on television or in the movies. Many of the most popular video games involve players in gruesome acts of violence, such as decapitation ("Mortal Kombat") and hanging from a meat hook by a hole drilled in the neck by a vampire ("Night Moves").</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Aggression may be learned through observation. Moreover, when adults and children are exposed to new ways of aggressing against others - techniques they have not previously seen - they may add these new behaviours to their repertoire. Later, when angry, irritated or frustrated, they may put these behaviours to actual use in assaults against others.</li>
                            <li>Media violence conveys the message that violence is an acceptable means of handling interpersonal difficulties. It may elicit additional aggressive ideas and thoughts - convincing viewers that violence is even more common in real life than it is. It may also lessen emotional reactions to aggression and the harm it produces, so that such outcomes seem less upsetting or objectionable. This process is known as desensitization.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The fact that television portrays so much aggressive behaviour concerns parents and educators, as well as social psychologists. Half of all prime time TV characters are involved in violent activity of some kind; about one-tenth kill or are killed; the perpetrators of these crimes go unpunished in nearly threequarters of violent scenes. Sixty-one percent of television programs contain violence - and that violence is often glamorized. Moreover, about 20 percent of males appearing on TV shows are engaged in law enforcement, whereas less than one percent are in law enforcement in the real world. Although the overall amount of violence on television is staggering, some programs account for a disproportionate number of violent acts overall.</p>
                        <p>Research generally supports the contention that viewers who regularly watch violent programs on television are more likely to be aggressive than are viewers who see less television violence. Further, one study found that children exposed to large doses of TV violence are less likely to help a real-life victim of violence; another found that viewers of violence were less sympathetic to real-life victims than were non-viewers Children who play violent video games also seem to act more aggressively at later ages. Some of the key effects of viewing violence on television are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>It weakens viewers' inhibitions.</li>
                            <li>It may suggest new ideas and techniques to the uninitiated.</li>
                            <li>It may activate or stimulate existing aggressive ideas and behaviours.</li>
                            <li>It reduces a person's overall emotional sensitivity to violence - it desensitizes people.</li>
                            <li>It introduces a fear of becoming a victim of violence.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Influence the media has on developing aggression and violence, especially in children</h3>
                        <p>Surveys indicate that news coverage of violence against women and children was not used to educate the public but rather to fascinate and entertain. Television violence, in particular, has a significant effect on the frequency and type of aggressive behaviour expressed by adults and children. Aggressive children watch more media violence, identify more with violent characters, and believe more that the violence they observe reflects real life than non-aggressive children</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Role nutrition play in healthy adolescent development</h3>
                        <p>A sizable minority of adolescents have one of four serious problems that interfere with normal, healthy eating. Any of these can make a teenager become a shorter and less wellproportioned adult:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Childhood habits of overeating and under-exercising often worsen in adolescence, especially if the overweight young person experiences increased social rejection. For this reason, many chubby children become obese adolescents.</li>
                            <li>Drug use (including cigarettes and alcohol) often begins in adolescence, affecting eating patterns, altering appetites and digestive processes, and depriving young people of energy and growth.</li>
                            <li>Food fads and strange diets are particularly attractive, and particularly harmful, during the rapid growth of adolescence.</li>
                            <li>Severe undernourishment slows or even halts the all the changes of puberty, including growth and sexual maturation, and it is sometimes undertaken for precisely that reason.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">The two main types of eating disorders</h3>
                        <p>Although there are several types of eating disorders, two broad categories are anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Anorexia nervosa</strong> occurs primarily in females, and female anorectics outnumber males by a factor of 15:1. The disorder usually has its onset in adolescence, the period between 14 and 16 being the most common. For a diagnosis of anorexia to be considered, the individual must weigh less than 85 percent of normal or expected weight for height, age and sex. One important characteristic of anorectics is a distorted body image in which the individual does not recognize the body's thinness. Estimates of anorexia incidence vary. American data suggest that one in 250 females may experience the disorder. In Britain, the figure is somewhat higher, ranging from one in 100 to four in 100.</li>
                            <li><strong>Bulimia nervosa</strong> is characterized by periodic episodes of "compulsive" or "binge" eating, the rapid and seemingly uncontrolled consumption of food, especially food rich in carbohydrates. The binge is terminated either by abdominal pain or, in the case of the purging type, by the expulsion of food using diuretics, laxatives or self-induced vomiting. In bulimia nervosa, the frequency of binge eating typically averages at least two or three times a week, and sometimes as often as 30 times a week. Most bulimics are women, with fewer than five percent of the cases presenting for treatment being men. Bulimics recognize that their eating behaviour is abnormal and feel frustrated by it, but they are unable to control the urge voluntarily. Like anorectics, bulimics are unduly concerned with their body weight/shape. Although able to maintain a normal body weight, they tend to fluctuate between weight gain and loss.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Roles genetics and the environment play in eating disorders</h3>
                        <p>Anorexia may have a genetic basis. There is a tendency for the disorder to run in families, with first- and second-degree relatives of anorectic individuals being significantly more likely to develop the disorder compared with first- and second-degree relatives of a control group on non-anorectics The behavioural interpretation sees anorexia as a phobia concerning the possibility of gaining weight. sociocultural explanations focus on societal norms and the cultural idealization of the slender female as possible causes for fears of being fat.</p>
                        <p>Noradrenaline, serotonin, hormones and endorphins may all play mediating roles in bulimia nervosa. Anorectics and bulimics share many psychological traits, along with the goal of maintaining a suboptimal body weight. The same person may also alternate between the same disorder.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">The issues and challenges involved with teen suicide</h3>
                        <p>Adolescents under the age of 20 are much less likely to kill themselves than adults are. However, adolescents think about suicide often - one of the many signs that depression is prevalent during these years. A review of studies from many nations finds that suicidal ideation, that is, thinking about committing suicide, is so common among high school students that it might be considered normal.</p>
                        <p>Suicide is commonly thought of as a response to a specific and immediate psychological blow. However, it usually is the final result of diffuse and long-standing problems within the individual, as well as within the family and social environment. Some of these problems are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Being temperamentally inclined toward fits of rage or bouts of depression</li>
                            <li>Having depressed, suicidal or alcoholic parents</li>
                            <li>Experiencing the early loss of an important care-giving parent, grandparent or older sibling through divorce, abandonment, imprisonment or death</li>
                            <li>Growing up with few steady friends, either because of one's personal traits or because of external circumstances, such as moving frequently Experiencing educational pressures.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Predictors of juvenile delinquency include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>negative identity</li>
                            <li>a low degree of self-control</li>
                            <li>early initiation into violence and antisocial behaviour</li>
                            <li>low expectations for education and little commitment towards education</li>
                            <li>low school achievement in the early grades</li>
                            <li>heavy peer influence and low resistance to peer pressure</li>
                            <li>low socioeconomic status</li>
                            <li>a lack of parental monitoring, low parental support and ineffective discipline Living in an urban, high crime and high mobility neighborhood.</li>
                        </ul>

                            <p>How does the socio-cultural environment influence adolescent development?</p>
                        </aside>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">What importance the family is in adolescent development</h3>
                        <p>In adolescence, when the winds of change blow particularly strong, parents and peers become especially powerful influences, for good or ill. Indeed, virtually every aspect of adolescent behaviour is directly affected by the family.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">What roles and influence do peers have on adolescent development?</h3>
                        <p>Adolescents help each other negotiate the tasks and trials of growing up in many ways. Among the special functions performed by peer relationships and close friendships, Brown (1990) finds the following four most noteworthy:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Self-help.</strong> Physical changes confront the young person with new feelings, experiences and challenges to self-esteem. Peers provide both information and the companionship of those who are going through the same changes. Peers are able to listen to concerns and provide specific advice as few adults can.</li>
                            <li><strong>Social support.</strong> Friends provide social protection against the turmoil of adolescence, such as the transition to larger, more impersonal high schools.</li>
                            <li><strong>Identity formation.</strong> The peer group aids the search for self-understanding and identity by functioning as a mirror that reflects dispositions, interests and capabilities.</li>
                            <li><strong>Values clarification.</strong> Friends are a sounding board for exploring and defining values and aspirations. By experimenting with viewpoints, philosophies and attitudes towards themselves and the world, with others who are willing to listen, argue and agree, adolescents begin to discover which values are truest to them.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">How to resist peer pressure</h3>
                        <p>Realize that you are being manipulated. Others are deliberately trying to get you to change your mind. If you are the only holdout, you are more likely to give in. Try to get just one other person on your side, and you will feel much stronger about your position.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>People want their behaviour and attitudes to be in harmony. Consequently, even if they know of some negative effects of what they are doing, they probably would not own up to them, because to do so would cause cognitive dissonance. Thus, you should be aware that you are probably not getting the whole story from the group.</li>
                            <li>For all age groups, peers are more persuasive than other people are. The more prestige particular peers have, the greater their influence. Use this tendency to your advantage by finding peers who have had a bad experience with whatever you are being urged to do and listen to what they have to say.</li>
                            <li>Minority opinions can have an effect on the majority. One way to increase this effect is to give consistent and repeated statements of your position. Often, this technique has a private effect on others - one that is not publicly expressed.</li>
                            <li>If all the members of a group are on one side, doesn't that mean that they are more likely to be right than a single, lone individual? Actually, a group's decision making is usually not as accurate as an individual's, particularly if the individual is well informed and highly rational.</li>
                            <li>When attempting to persuade someone, group members often try to make that person feel embarrassed for not going along. Embarrassing people is an age-old tool for making them conform. If you know that ahead of time, perhaps it will have less impact on you.</li>
                            <li>One of the best ways to resist conformity is to be exposed to all the arguments in favour of some risky behaviour and then learn to refute these arguments, one by one.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">The educational issues and challenges to be addressed in adolescence</h3>
                        <p>Instead of an appropriate person-environment fit, a volatile mismatch forms between many adolescents and their schools. Compared to elementary schools, most secondary schools have rigid behavioural demands, intensified competition, and more punitive grading practices, as well as less individualized attention and procedures. The impersonal and bureaucratic nature of many high schools is particularly destructive for proper person-environment fit. Many secondary schools attempt to educate more than a thousand students at a time, each of whom is scheduled to travel from teacher to teacher, room to room, LESSON to LESSON on a regular schedule. Some teachers do not even know the names of the hundred or more students they teach, much less their personality traits, intellectual interests and aspirations.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">The influence culture has on interpersonal relationships</h3>
                        <p>One of the main dimensions on which cultures differ is individualism-collectivism. Individualism places greater emphasis on personal achievement and self-reliance. Collectivism, by contrast, places priority on the welfare and unity of the group. Goodwin (1995) argues that "love, at least in its passionate stomach-churning Hollywood manifestation, is largely a Western and individualistic phenomenon and that in Western cultures, marriage is seen as the culmination of a loving relationship". In cultures where arranged marriages occur, the relationship between love and marriage is the other way around, and marriage is seen as the basis on which to explore a loving relationship. The cultural background in which people have learned about love is important in shaping their concept of it.</p>
                        
                        <h2 id="late_spiritual_growth" class="section-heading"><span class="heading-text">Spiritual Growth</span></h2>
                        <p>In his summary of the literature, Kenneth Hyde (1991) describes many religious aspects of adolescence, such as their behavior, attitudes, influences, and understandings of religion. While most Christian schools and churches have emphasized learning about the Bible, God, and beliefs, the last few years have produced a new emphasis upon the experiential aspects of faith, often termed "spirituality." This is in part because one can know a great deal about God, and even make an initial commitment to the Christian faith, yet not have an active, ongoing relationship with God that includes religious experiences. "Spirituality" emphasizes awe, wonder, and other experiences that are beyond mundane, everyday life, and that connect the individual to something transcendent and/or of ultimate importance. While spirituality includes experiences with God, it can also include awe and wonder from experiences such as viewing a beautiful sunset that overwhelms the person emotionally and even perceptually. Spiritual experience can be either positive and constructive, or negative and counterproductive (Hay & Nye, 1998).</p>
                        <p>A Few Negative Spiritualities [this designation is similar to what Berryman (1991) terms "pseudo-play"]</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Violence</li>
                            <li>Suicide</li>
                            <li>Bullying</li>
                            <li>Illegal Drug Use</li>
                            <li>Risk-Taking</li>
                            <li>Controlling with Detachment and Disguise (by "spirituality sponges" who are parasites, says Berryman)</li>
                            <li>Lack of Moral Impulse/Corruption</li>
                            <li>Lack of Concern for Others</li>
                            <li>Meaninglessness</li>
                            <li>Prejudice</li>

                            <li>Evil Personality (M. Scott Peck)</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>For some people, the progression is not as uniform as Darling's model may suggest. Some mistakenly confuse moods with spirituality, and thus their perception of their walk of faith may be cyclical—hills and valleys which reflect positive and negative emotions that can change from day to day. These are not to be confused with times of struggle and victory which are normal aspects of the Christian life, sometimes described as "mountain top experiences" and "valleys" or "dry times in the wilderness." Others live out a crisisbased faith, marked by occasional moments of spiritual experience during revival services or retreats; sudden shifts from a normally mundane spiritual existence. Perhaps a combination of Darling's loops, and occasional valleys and "mountain top experiences" are the most common components of healthy Christian living, loops and cycles that are part of a long-term incline marking spiritual growth and development. Spiritual adolescence may or may not be part of that progression.</p>
                        <p>In sum, healthy Christian living is marked by growth in understanding and a deepening relationship with God. Spiritual development involves confessing and turning from sin, experiencing difficult times when God seems remote, contrasted with moments of spiritual vitality—times of worship and felt love—when God is experienced as being "closer than a brother." Spiritual formation activities can assist this process, including prayer, retreats, meditation, fasting, and the like.</p>

                        <p>The lifespan perspective on human development has seven basic characteristics. Development is:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Life-long</strong> - No age period dominates development.</li>
                            <li><strong>Multi-dimensional</strong> - Development consists of biological, cognitive, socio-emotional and spiritual dimensions.</li>
                            <li><strong>Multi-directional</strong> - Some aspects of development increase, while others decrease.</li>
                            <li><strong>Plastic</strong> - Depending on the individual's life conditions, development may take many paths.</li>
                            <li><strong>Historically-embedded</strong> - Development is influenced by historical conditions.</li>
                            <li><strong>Multidisciplinary</strong> - Psychologists, sociologists, anthropologists, neuroscientists and medical researchers all study human development and share a concern for unlocking the mysteries of development throughout the lifespan.</li>
                            <li><strong>Contextual</strong> - The individual continually responds to and acts on contexts, which include a person's biological makeup, physical environment, and social, historical, and cultural contexts.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Key issues and questions in developmental psychology related to adolescent development</h3>
                        <p>From the time of its establishment, several key issues and questions have dominated the field of developmental psychology. Among the issues are the nature of developmental change, the importance of critical periods, lifespan approaches versus the more focused approaches, and the nature-nurture issue.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Continuous change versus discontinuous change:</strong> In continuous change, developmental change is gradual, with achievements at one level building on those of previous levels. In contrast, discontinuous change occurs in distinct stages or steps. Each stage brings about behaviour that is assumed to be qualitatively different from behaviour at earlier stages.</li>
                            <li><strong>A critical period</strong> is a specific time during development when a particular event has its greatest consequences. Critical periods occur when the presence of certain kinds of environmental stimuli are necessary for development to proceed normally.</li>
                            <li><strong>Lifespan approaches versus a focus on a particular period:</strong> Developmentalists now believe the entire lifespan is important, for several reasons. One is the discovery that developmental growth and change continue during every part of life. Furthermore, to understand fully the social influences on people of a given age, we need to understand the people who are in large measure providing those influences. For instance, to understand development in infants, we need to unravel the effects of their parents' ages on the social environment.</li>
                            <li><strong>Nature versus Nurture:</strong> One of the enduring questions of development involves how much of people's behaviour is due to their genetically-determined nature and how much is due to nurture, the physical and social environment in which a child is raised. In this context, nature refers to traits, abilities and capacities that are inherited from one's parents. Nature encompasses any factor that is produced by the predetermined unfolding of genetic information - a process known as maturation. These genetic, inherited influences are at work as we move from the onecelled organism that is created at the moment of conception to the billions of cells that make up a fully-formed human being. In contrast nurture refers to the environmental influences that shape behaviour.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Some of these influences may be biological, such as the impact of a pregnant mother's substance abuse on the fetus, or the amount and kind of food available to children. Other environmental influences are more social, such as the ways parents discipline their children and the effects of peer pressure on adolescents.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">How each of the six theoretical perspectives on human development explains adolescent development</h3>
                        <p>Lifespan development has produced a number of broad conceptual perspectives representing different approaches to development. Each broad perspective encompasses a number of theories, explanations and predictions concerning phenomena of interest. A theory provides a framework for understanding the relationships among an organized set of principles or facts. The six major theoretical perspectives include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Psychodynamic Perspective: Focusing on the inner person.</strong> Rooted in Freud's theory, the psychodynamic approach maintains that all behaviour and mental processes reflect the constant and mostly unconscious psychological struggles that rage silently within each person. Usually, these struggles involve conflict between the impulse to satisfy instincts or wishes and the need to play by the rules in society. Anxiety, depression and other disorders are outward signs of this inner turmoil.</li>
                            <li><strong>The Behavioural Perspective: Considering the outer person.</strong> As founded by John Watson, the behavioural approach views behaviour and mental processes as primarily the result of learning. Psychologists who take this approach see rewards and punishment acting on the raw materials provided by genes, evolution and biology to shape each individual. So, whether considering a person's aggression or drug abuse, behaviourists would look at that person's learning history. Since people learn problem behaviours, they can also learn to change or even prevent them by unlearning old habits and developing new ones.</li>
                            <li><strong>The Cognitive Perspective: Examining the roots of understanding.</strong> The cognitive perspective focuses on how people take in, mentally represent and store information. Cognitive psychologists then relate perception and information processing to patterns of behaviour. They study such areas as decision-making, problem-solving, interpersonal attraction and intelligence. Aggression, for instance, might be viewed as a result of poor problem solving.</li>
                            <li><strong>The Humanistic Perspective: Concentrating on the unique qualities of human beings.</strong> According to the humanistic approach, our capacity to choose how to think and act determines our behaviour. Each person's unique perceptions - not instincts, cognitive processes, or rewards and punishments dictate the choices made. Humanistic psychologists believe that people are essentially good, that they are in control of themselves, and that they seek to grow toward their highest potential.</li>
                            <li><strong>The Evolutionary Perspective: Focusing on biology as the determinant of development.</strong> Darwin's ideas on evolution and adaptation of species laid the foundation for the evolutionary approach. The evolutionary approach to psychology holds that the behaviour of animals and humans today is the result of evolution through natural selection. Psychologists who follow this approach are concerned with the adaptive value of behaviour, the anatomy and biology that make it possible and the environmental conditions that encourage or discourage it.</li>
                            <li><strong>The socio-cultural Perspective: Emphasizing the systems of support.</strong> Calling attention to the external influences on human behaviour such as the physical surroundings and social interactions that provide incentives, opportunities and pathways for growth, Urie Bronfenbrenner (1979) began to emphasize the ecological approach to the study of human development. In Bronfenbrenner's application of this concept, human ecosystems include both the physical environment (the climate, the space per person, that arrangement of the dwelling) and the social environment (the people, the culture, the economy).</li>
