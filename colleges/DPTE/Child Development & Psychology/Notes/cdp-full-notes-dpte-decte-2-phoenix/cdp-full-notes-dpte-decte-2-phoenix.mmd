\section*{SUBSTRAND1.1: CONCEPTS IN CHILD GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT}

\section*{a. Terminologies related to child growth and development}
- Growth-This is the increase in size, height, shape and mass depending on age
- Development- This is increase in complexity of functioning in a person
* Personality - This is the scientific study of the human mind, functions and beh avior in a given context
2- Memory - Memory is today defined in psychology as the faculty of encoding, st oring, and retrieving information (Squire, 2009). Psychologists have found that memory includes three important categories: sensory, short-term, and long-term
- Intelligence -The intelligence is the ability to learn, adjust and take a significant role at right time in the overall growth and development of a child. It affects his social behaviour, moral adjustment and emotional growth
2- Attitude- In psychology, an attitude refers to a set of emotions, beliefs, and beha viors toward a particular object, person, thing, or event. Attitudes are of ten the re sult of experience or upbringing. They can have a powerful influence over behav ior and affect how people act in various situations
2- Motivation- Motivation is the process that initiates, guides, and maintains goaloriented behaviors. It is what helps you lose extra weight, for instance, or pushes you to get that promotion at work. In short, motivation causes you to act in a wa y that gets you closer to your goals
*- Emotions- Emotions are distinct feelings or qualities of consciousness, such as joy or sadness, that reflect the personal significance of emotion-arousing event s. The major types of emotions include fear, sadness, anger, surprise, excitemen t, guilt, shame, disgust, interest, and happiness. These emotions develop in an or derly sequence over the course of infancy and childhood
- Learning- Learning can be defined in many ways, but most psychologists woul
d agree that it is a relatively permanent change in behavior that results from experie nce.Learning is the process of acquiring new understanding, knowledge, behavi ors, skills, values, attitudes, and preferences. Human learning starts at birth it mi ght even start beforel in terms of an embryo's need for both interaction with, and freedom within its environment within the womb and continues until death as a consequence of ongoing interactions between people and their environment.

\section*{b. Differences between growth and development}

The term Growth and Development are inseparable but different concepts. The terms gro wth \& Development are used interchangeably to refer to the changes that take place in th e life of an individual from his birth to maturity.

\section*{Growth}

Growth refers to the increase in height, weight, and body size of a person. In biology, g rowth is considered as the increase in the size of an organ or cell.

\section*{Development}

On the other hand, development refers to the growth process where a person can develop in terms of physical, mental, social, emotional, moral, etc. Development depend upon bo th heredity and the environment.

\hline & Growth is limited to a certain age it stop s when maturity has been attained & Development is a continuous process starting from the time of conception and continuing $u$ ntil the end of life (Womb to Tomb) \\
\hline & Changes produced by growth can be ob served and measured directly & Developmental changes that result in improve d behavior or functioning cannot be measured directly \\
\hline & Growth focuses only on one aspect i.e i ncrease in a child's body size & Development focuses on various aspects like interpersonal skills, and intelligence. \\
\hline & Growth is an external process & Development is an internal process. \\
\hline & Growth is structural & Development is considered a functional \\
\hline & Growth is influenced by the developmen t & Development is independent it does not depen d upon growth \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

The growth and Development term is used comprehensively one cannot replace the othe
r. Growth and development are very important and a teacher must have proper knowledg e about child growth and development to achieve maximum growth and development of a child

\section*{c. Aspects of Growth and Development}

These are also called areas/domains of growth and development. They include

\section*{1. Physical/Psychomotor development}

Psychomotor learning is exhibited by the development of physical skills including move ment, coordination and strength. One area of psychomotor development demonstrates fi ne motor skills through hand-eye coordination which can include activities such as threa ding a needle, catching a ball, and writing.

It is exhibited by the development of physical skills as the individual learns about the en vironment around them. Growth and development can be physical, cognitive (mental), co mmunicative (language-based), and socio-emotional, which refers to the acquired ability to understand and manage emotions in order to develop relationships with others

Physical growth refers to the increases in height and weight and other body changes tha t happen as kids mature. Hair grows; teeth come in, come out, and come in again; and ev entually puberty hits. It's all part of the growth process.

\section*{Stages of Psychomotor Development}

There are four stages of psychomotor development: infancy (0-1 years), childhood (1-10 years), adolescence (11-21 years), and adulthood (above 21year). During each of these st ages, individuals will experience many changes, both physical and cognitive, that will all ow them to grow and develop in order to engage the world around them.

N/B. Psychomotor refers to how conscious mental activity creates physical movement. Psychomotor development is the transformation of a person's physical, cognitive (menta 1), emotional, and social capacities from the beginning of their life into adulthood.

\section*{2. Cognitive/mental Development}

Cognitive or intellectual development means the growth of a child's ability to think and re ason. It's about how they organize their minds, ideas and thoughts to make sense of the
world they live in. It involves the ability of the brain or mind to take in and process inform ation. Examples a child recognizing that when they shake a rattle it will make noise
3. Social and emotional development means how children start to understand who they are, what they are feeling and what to expect when interacting with others. It is the devel opment of being able to: Form and sustain positive relationships. Experience, manage a nd express emotions.

Social development is the process through which children learn to build relationships. It involves learning the values, knowledge, and skills necessary to understand how to get al ong with others. Everyday experiences at home support children's developing social skill s. Families give children their first opportunities to communicate and build relationships. As an adult family member, you also model for your child how to effectively and respectf ully interact with the people around you.

Social development in early childhood is an important part of a person's overall health, w ell-being, and happiness throughout his or her life. Social development is very closely lin ked to cognitive and emotional development, and together these developmental markers and milestones build the foundation for developing relationships with other people, copi ng with stressful situations, and many other skills. Healthy social development is especi ally important as a child enters school.

Social development involves children's ability to interact with others and regulate their o wn behavior. Identifying these milestones in young children can be difficult if you are unf amiliar with them, so we've laid out some of these markers, as well as some red flags.

\section*{Milestones of Social Development in Early Childhood}

Between the age of three and four, a child's sense of confidence begins to develop as he or she learns to do more activities without assistance.

At this stage, most children typically begin to:
- Share toys and take turns
- Begin engaging in pretend play
- Follow simple rules in games
- Sometimes become bossy and defiant
- Show more independence
- Might show attachment to one friend

Between the age of four and five, children start to gain a greater awareness of their own individuality. A child's sense of self in these early stages can set a pattern for the rest of his or her life. At this stage, most children typically begin to:
- Develop friendships with other kids
- Compare themselves to other children and adults
- Understand other people's thoughts and feelings
- Initiate or join in play with other children and make up games
- Show an understanding of right and wrong

\section*{Red Flags for Social Development in Early Childhood}

The following are indicators of possible dysfunctional social development.
- Shows no interest in playing with other children
- Is unable to share or take turns with other children
- Wants to be dependent on caregivers for every thing
- Is extremely "rigid" about routines and becomes upset when things change
- Has extreme difficulty separating from parents or caregivers

Here are some great ways for you to promote Social Development at home:

\section*{Preschool age}
- Model and encourage cooperative behavior when you play and interact with your child.
- Model the caring and empathetic behavior that you want your child to learn. For e xample, hug someone if they are sad and talk about why this is a kind thing to do.
- Give your child words they can use when they want to join a group play activity. F or example, "I see you want to play tag with your cousins. You can go ask to join t he game."

\section*{School Age:}
- Encourage your child to be the first to greet a friend when they see them. Provide positive feedback when your child exhibits this behavior.
- Talk to your child about their friends. Ask them questions about their friends' pers onalities and interests. Emphasize that when you are friends with someone, it's im portant to learn about them and take part in their interests.
- When your child has a conflict with a peer or sibling, allow them the opportunity t o resolve it on their own. If the problem persists, ask your child if you can help in a ny way

\section*{4. Emotional Development}

Emotional development is the process in which an individual is able to experience, recog nize, and express varying emotions. Emotions are an individual's subjective responses or reactions to various situations. Often, an individual is referred to as being emotional whe
n expressing their reaction to a situation. Emotional means than an individual is experien cing intense feelings, such as happiness or sadness. The emotional description is of ten associated with a physical response, such as laughing or crying.

Emotional development involves learning what feelings and emotions are, understandin g how and why they occur, recognizing your own feelings and those of others, and devel oping effective ways for managing those feelings. Strong emotional development leads to five key skills: self-awareness, social-awareness, emotional regulation, responsible de cision making and relationship building.

\subsection*{1.2 Human Reproduction and Parental Care}

\subsection*{1.2.1 Male reproductive organs in human being}

The male reproductive system is mostly located outside of the body. These external orga ns include the penis, scrotum and testicles. Internal organs include the vas deferens, pro state and urethra. The male reproductive system is responsible for sexual function, as w ell as urination.

The male reproductive organs do the following jobs within your body:
- They produce, main tain and transport sperm (the male reproductive cells) and se men (the protective fluid around sperm).
- They discharge sperm into the female reproductive tract.
- They produce and secrete male sex hormones.

The male reproductive system is made up of internal (inside your body) and external (out side your body) parts. Together, these organs help you urinate (rid your body of liquid wa ste materials), have sexual intercourse and make children.

How does the male reproductive system function?

The entire male reproductive system is dependent on hormones. These are chemicals th at stimulate or regulate the activity of your cells or organs. The primary hormones involv ed in the functioning of the male reproductive system are follicle-stimulating hormone (F SH), luteinizing hormone (LH) and testosterone.

FSH and LH are produced by the pituitary gland. It's located at the base of your brain and it's responsible for many functions in your body. FSH is necessary for sperm production (spermatogenesis). LH stimulates the production of testosterone, which is necessary to c ontinue the process of spermatogenesis. Testosterone is also important in the developm ent of male characteristics, including muscle mass and strength, fat distribution, bone m ass and sex drive.

\section*{External male reproductive structures}

Most of the male reproductive system is located outside of your abdominal cavity or pel vis. The external parts of the male reproductive system include the penis, the scrotum an $d$ the testicles.

\section*{Penis}

The penis is the male organ for sexual intercourse.

\section*{Scrotum}

The scrotum is the loose pouch-like sac of skin that hangs behind the penis. It holds the testicles (also called testes), as well as many nerves and blood vessels. The scrotum pro tects your testes, as well as providing a sort of climate control system. For normal sperm development, the testes must be at a temperature slightly cooler than the body temperat ure. Special muscles in the wall of the scrotum allow it to contract (tighten) and relax, $m$ oving the testicles closer to the body for warmth and protection or farther away from the body to cool the temperature.

\section*{Testicles (testes)}

The testes are oval organs about the size of very large olives that lie in the scrotum, secu red at either end by a structure called the spermatic cord. Most men have two testes. The testes are responsible for making testosterone, the primary male sex hormone, and for pr oducing sperm. Within the testes are coiled masses of tubes called seminiferous tubule s. These tubules are responsible for producing the sperm cells through a process called s permatogenesis.

\section*{the internal male reproductive organs}

These organs include:
- Vas deferens: The vas deferens is a long, muscular tube that travels from the epi didymis into the pelvic cavity, to just behind the bladder. The vas deferens transpo its mature sperm to the urethra in preparation for ejaculation.
- Ejaculatory ducts: These ducts are formed by the fusion of the vas deferens and t he seminal vesicles. The ejaculatory ducts empty into the urethra.
- Urethra: The urethra is the tube that carries urine from the bladder to outside of $y$ our body. In males, it has the additional function of expelling (ejaculating) semen when you reach orgasm. When the penis is erect during sex, the flow of urine is bl ocked from the urethra, allowing only semen to be ejaculated at orgasm.
- Seminal vesicles: The seminal vesicles are sac-like pouches that attach to the va s deferens near the base of the bladder. The seminal vesicles make a sugar-rich fl uid (fructose) that provides sperm with a source of energy and helps with the sper $\mathrm{ms}^{\prime}$ ability to move (motility). The fluid of the seminal vesicles makes up most of the volume of your ejaculatory fluid, or ejaculate.
- Prostate gland: The prostate gland is a walnut-sized structure that's located belo $w$ the urinary bladder in front of the rectum. The prostate gland contributes additi onal fluid to the ejaculate. Prostate fluids also help to nourish the sperm. The uret hra, which carries the ejaculate to be expelled during orgasm, runs through the ce nter of the prostate gland.
- Bulbourethral glands: The bulbourethral glands, or Cowper's glands, are pea-sized structures located on the sides of the urethra, just below the prostate gland. These glands produce a clear, slippery fluid that empties directly into the urethra. This fl uid serves to lubricate the urethra and to neutralize any acidity that may be presen $t$ due to residual drops of urine in the urethra.

\subsection*{1.2.2 Female reproductive organs}

The female reproductive system is made up of the internal and external sex organs that function in reproduction of new offspring. In humans, the female reproductive system is immature at birth and develops to maturity at puberty to be able to produce gametes, an d to carry a foetus to full term.

The internal sex organs are the vagina, uterus, Fallopian tubes, and ovaries. The vagina allows for sexual intercourse and birth, and is connected to the uterus at the cervix. The uterus or womb accommodates the embryo which develops into the foetus. The uterus a Iso produces secretions which help the transit of sperm to the Fallopian tubes, where spe rm fertilize ova (egg cells) which are produced by the ovaries.

The external sex organs are also known as the genitals and these are the organs of the vulva including the labia, clitoris, and vaginal opening

\section*{The vagina serves three purposes:}
1. It's where the penis is inserted during sexual intercourse.
2. It's the pathway (the birth canal) through which a baby leaves a woman's body du ring childbirth.
3. It's the route through which menstrual blood leaves the body during periods.

\subsection*{1.1.3 Fertilization in human beings}

Fertilisation occurs when a sperm fuses with the female act during intercourse and furth er forms an egg that gets implanted in uterus of the female. The sperm travels through t he fallopian tube and penetrates the zona pellucida layer of the ovum (female egg) and $f$ uses with it which forms zygote (fertilized egg). Thousand of sperms are produced in ma le body to compensate for the ones unfit and non-motile ones. Once the zygote is forme d, it gets implanted in the uterus and further growth takes place when cells start dividing and forming tissues and tissues form organ which results in formation of an organ syste m , ultimately turning into an organism.

\subsection*{1.1.4 Factors that influence prenatal development in a human being}

Prenatal care is the regular health care women should receive from an obstetrician or mi dwife during pregnancy. Prenatal development is the growth of a single-celled zygote for med by the combination of a sperm and an egg into a baby.

\section*{Factors influencing development}
- Poverty.
- Mother's age
- Drug use
- Alcohol
- Tobacco use
- Infections
- Maternal nutrition
- Low birth weight

TASK: Explain how each factor influences child growth and development

\subsection*{1.1.4 Types and effects of teratogens on the foetus}

A teratogen is something that can cause birth defects or abnormalities in a developing e mbryo or fetus upon exposure. Teratogens include some medications, recreational drug s, tobacco products, chemicals, alcohol, certain infections, and in some cases, health pr oblems such as uncontrolled diabetes in pregnant people. Exposure to a teratogen can o ccur through ingestion or environmental exposure during pregnancy. Teratogens can beg in affecting the developing embryo as early as 10 to 14 days after conception. During e mbryonic development, there are periods when the developing organ systems show more sensitivity to teratogens.

A teratogen is any agent that causes an abnormality following fetal exposure during pre gnancy. Teratogens are usually discovered after an increased prevalence of a particular birth defect

Teratogens can also be found at home or the workplace. The effect is related to type of a gent, dose and duration and time of exposure. The first half of pregnancy is the most vul nerable. Teratogenic agents include infectious agents (herpes simplex, syphilis, etc.); ph ysical agents (ionizing agents, hyperthermia); maternal health factors (diabetes); enviro nmental chemicals (organic mercury compounds, herbicides and industrial solvents); an d drugs (prescription, over- the-counter, or recreational).

\subsection*{1.2 Brain development in young children ( 1 hr )}

8- Analyze the process of brain development and brain lateralization in children in th e first 5 years
- Examine factors which contribute to normal brain development in children

2- Identify the responsibilities of care givers in enhancing normal brain lateralization

\section*{1. Process of brain development in children in the first 5 years}

From birth to age 5, a child's brain develops more, and more rapidly, than at any other tim e in life. And while genetics plays a significant role, scientific research has made clear th at the quality of a child's experiences in the first few years of life - positive or negative helps shape how their brain develops. And that these experiences have lasting impact on their health and ability to learn and succeed in school and in life. 90\% of a Child's Brain Develops by Age 5 .

The human brain, the command center of the entire body, is the only organ not fully deve loped at birth. At birth, the average baby's brain is about a quarter of the size of the avera ge adult brain. Incredibly, it doubles in size in the first year and keeps growing to about 8 $0 \%$ of adult size by age 3 and $90 \%$ - nearly full grown - by age 5 .

A newborn baby has all of the brain cells (neurons) they'll have for the rest of their life, b ut what really makes the brain work - and enables us to move, think, communicate and j ust about everything else - are the connections between those cells. And the early years of a child's life are a crucial time for making those connections - at least one million ne w neural connections (synapses) every second, far more than at any other time in life.

Different areas of the brain - which are responsible for different abilities like movement, language and emotion - develop at different rates. Eventually brain connections connec t with each other in more complex ways, enabling the child to move and speak and think in more complex ways.

\section*{Brain Development V/S Child Development}

All children develop differently - some will walk or talk earlier than usual, while others m ay take more time - but it's clear that the early years are the best opportunity for a child's brain to develop the connections they need to be healthy, capable, successful adults.

Recent scientific research has shown that the connections needed for many important, $h$
igher-level abilities - like motivation, self-regulation, problem solving, communication an d self-esteem - are formed in these early years. Or not formed. And it's much harder for t hese essential brain connections to be made later in life.

\section*{How Brain Connections Are Built}

Starting from birth, brain connections are built through a child's every day experiences by positive interactions with their parents and caregivers, and by using their senses to int eract with the world around them. It's a young child's daily experiences - the amount and quality of care, stimulation and interaction they receive in their first days, weeks, months and years - that determines which brain connections develop and will last for a lifetime.

\section*{Caring, Responsive Relationships}

The most important influences on a child's development are their relationships with the a dults in their life. Loving relationships with warm, responsive, dependable adults are esse ntial to a child's healthy development. These relationships begin at home, with parents a nd family, but a lso include child care providers, teachers and other members of the com munity.

From birth, young children serve up invitations to engage with their parents and other ad ult caregivers in their lives. Babies do it by cooing and smiling and crying; toddlers are ab le to communicate their needs and interests more directly. Each of these little invitations is an opportunity for the caregiver to either be responsive or unresponsive to the child's n eeds. This "serve and return" process is fundamental to the wiring of the brain. Parents a nd caregivers who give attention and respond and interact with their child are literally bui Iding the child's brain. That's why it's so important to talk, sing, read and play with young children from the day they're born, to give them opportunities to explore their physical wo rld, and to provide safe, stable and nurturing environments.

\section*{Brain lateralization in children in the first 5 years}

Lateralization of brain function is the view that functions are performed by distinct regio
ns of the brain. For instance, it is believed that there are different areas of the brain that are responsible for controlling language, formulating memories, ano making movement s.

If a certain area of the brain becomes damaged, the function associated with that area $w$ ill also be affected. It contrasts with the holistic theory of the brain, that all parts of the br ain are involved in the processing of thought and action.

The human brain is split into two hemispheres, right and left. They are both joined togeth er by the corpus callosum, a bundle of nerve fibres which is located in the middle of the brain.

Hemispheric lateralization is the idea that each hemisphere is responsible for different fu nctions. Each of these functions are localized to either the right or left side.

The left hemisphere is associated with language functions, such as formulating gramm ar and vocabulary, and containing different language centres

The right hemisphere is associated with more visuospatial functions such as visualizati on, depth perception, and spatial navigation. These left and right functions are the case i n the majority of people, especially those who are right-handed.

Each hemisphere controls the opposite side of the body. Left hemisphere controls the m uscle movements of the right arm and leg. Likewise, damage to the right occipital lobe (r esponsible for vision) can result in loss of sight in the left field of vision.
2. factors which contribute to normal brain development in children

The early years of a child's life are very important for later health and development. On e of the main reasons is how fast the brain grows starting before birth and continuing int o early childhood. Although the brain continues to develop and change into adulthood, th e first 8 years can build a foundation for future learning, health and life success How well a brain develops depends on many factors'
- genetics/ inheritance from parents
- Proper nutrition and exercise
- Exposure to toxins or infections
- The child's experiences with other people and the world/Social Interactions with C aring People.

Children also need this type of constructive, meaningful relationship with adults they ca n trust and rely on for support and comfort. When children don't feel they can rely on the people in their life for those things, whether it be parents, teachers, aunts, uncles, babysit ters, or really anyone who spends a significant amount of time with them, they can feel i solated and alone, which impacts how they think and view the world. Scientific studies h ave found that sometimes a simple hug or understanding conversation can calm brain a ctivity and bridge gaps in synapses.

A child's relationships with the adults in their life are the most important influences on their brain development. Loving relationships with responsive, dependable adults are essential to a child's healthy development.
- Structure and Consistency in Different Environments

Discipline is an important part of children's upbringing in that it offers them structure an d consistency-a dependable model they can rely on for guidance while they're figuring o ut the world and themselves. Through healthy disciplinary techniques, and explaining in your child's language the reasons why we as adults must discipline them can ease your child's anxiety and help them connect logical brain processes with emotional developme nt in a healthy way.

\section*{- Talking Through Tough Emotions}

Perhaps one of the most important aspects of your child's brain development is teaching them how to identify, express, and regulate their own emotions. Most parents don't realiz
e that brain development plays such a critical role in emotions, that it's easy for them to become angry, frustrated, or fed up with children's egocentrism and "bad behavior." Child ren often struggle with making sense of how they're feeling, and it's our job to help them understand themselves better-especially when it relates to others. Talking through toug h emotions and engaging with your child will help them feel safe to explore their emotion $s$ and learn ways of identifying them and coping with them as they grow into healthy ad ults.

\section*{3. Responsibilities of caregivers in enhancing normal brain lateralization}

Positive caregiver-child interaction is crucial to healthy attachment. Even though interac tion is a mutual process, adults in an infant's life are primarily responsible for shaping t he attachment relationship.

Children depend upon the adults in their life to provide a consistent, loving environment $t$ hat promotes healthy attachment. The environment must be predictable and nurturing a nd must support exploration.

In positive caregiver-child interactions, caregivers:
- are emotionally and physically available
- are sensitive and responsive to each individual child's needs
- respond promptly and appropriately
- provide opportunities for exploration
- gently guide children's behavior
- provide a secure base of love and protection

Consistent and positive early interactions - such as holding, gazing, smiling, kissing, sin ging and laughing - cause specific neurochemical activities in the brain. These neuroch
emical activities lead to organization and wiring of brain systems that are responsible fo r attachment.

The brain's earliest wiring for relationships occurs in the limbic system. The amygdala re ceives and integrates the emotional information that comes in from interactions with car egivers. The hippocampus stores those emotional experiences. Emotional memories sta y in the limbic system. Even when infants cannot actively remember or discuss an emoti onal memory, that memory has an ongoing effect on that infant's behavior and develop ment.

\subsection*{1.4 Physical, Cognitive, Social and Emotional Development (1hour)}

2- Discuss the physical, cognitive, social and emotional changes in children from in fancy to adolescence (infants (0-2), toddlers (2-3) Pre-schoolers (3-5/2-6), school age (6-10) and adolescents-10-19)

\section*{1. infancy ( $0-2 \mathrm{yrs}$ )}

This stage is characterized by rapid physical, cognitive psychosocial developmen t.

\section*{-Physical Development}
- The infants exhibit reflexes e.g. feeding, blinking to protect the eye objects or coughing. They later develop motor skills more advance than mere refle xes.
- they start crawling by 6 th month and walking by 13 th month
- the develop ability to manipulate objects and move about and developmen t depends on nutrition
- muscular control and coordination progresses from head to foot proportio nally
- the baby develops milk teeth

\section*{Factors affecting infant physical growth}

\section*{Primary factors}
- hereditary
- condition of the mother during pregnancy
- nutrition
- illness
- physical environment
- social factors in the early stages
- psychological factors in early years

\section*{Secondary factors}
- social economic class
- parental literacy
- child's position in the family
- spacing of children

Psychological or development needs of infants include
- warmth
- sleep
- excretion
- food and water
- need for air
- physical things to encourage muscular and mental development

\section*{-Social Development}

A child is expected to behave according to societal expectations
The way a child interacts and socializes with people around him during the formative ye ars influences his/her future life
- Social interaction of the infant is basically between the mother and child
- As the child grows it develops to include interaction with other people e.g. the peer s
- They rely on imitation than speech to coordinate play
- Children are affected by relationships with friends, siblings, and their parents
- Few children develop friendship before the age of 3 and if it does then is with me mbers of the same sex
- Child birth order also affects social development, firstborns are less socially beca use they interact more with adults than siblings while lastborns are more social b ecause they interact more with siblings and adults

\section*{-Cognitive Developmental infants}

2 months
- Pays attention to faces
- Begins to follow things with eyes and recognize people at a distance
- Begins to act bored (cries, fussy) if activity does not change

6 months
- Looks around at things nearby
- Brings things to mouth
- Shows curiosity about things and tries to get things that are out of reach
- Begins to pass things from one hand to another

12 months
- Explores things in different ways, like shaking, banging, throwing
- Finds hidden things easily
- Looks at the right picture or thing when it is named
- Copies gestures
- Starts to use things correctly (like drinks from a cup, brushes hair)
- Bangs two things together
- Puts things in a container, takes things out of a container
- Lets things go without help
- Pokes with index (pointer) finger
- Follows simple directions like "pick up the toy"

\section*{Piaget's theory of mental development}

Jean Piaget is the most noted theorist when it comes to children's cognitive developmen t. He believed that children's cognition develops in stages. He explained this growth in th e following stages:
- Sensory Motor Stage (Birth through 2 years old)
- Preoperational Stage (2-7 years old)
- Concrete Operational Stage (7-11 years old)
- Formal Operational Stage ( 12 years old- adulthood)
-Sensorimotor Stage (Birth through 2 years old)
In this stage, an infant's knowledge of the world is limited to their sensory perceptions an d motor activities.

\section*{-Preoperational stage (2-6)}

Language develops but the child can't mentally manipulate information
-Concrete operational stage (7-11)
The child gains a better understanding of mental operations
-Formal operational stage ( 12 years and beyond)
The child develops the ability to think about abstract concepts

\section*{-Emotional Development during Infancy}

Infants express the emotions of fear, surprise, and happiness through reflex action. Emot ional development depend on learning which in turn is affected by the objects in the envi ronment. Before the end of the first 2 years children express the emotions of anger, sadn ess, excitement and uneasiness.
ii. Toddlers (2-3)

\section*{-Physical Development of Toddlers}

Toddlers will quickly master walking and move on to running, jumping and climbing. Ar ound age two, most toddlers will be able to navigate stairs, kick or throw a ball and draw simple lines. During this time, children may still stumble frequently and be accident pron e

Some of the physical developments you're likely to see during this action packed yea r include:
- faster running, and changing direction quickly without falling over,
- jumping and hopping,
- walking downstairs one foot at a time, without holding your hand or the banis ter,
- balancing on low walls,
- exploring and swinging from climbing frames

\section*{-Social and Emotional Development of Toddlers}
- are aware of their gender identity
- be quite assertive and say no to adults' demands or instructions
- starts to evaluate their behaviours as bad, good etc
- begins to share and take turns
- may be possessive about their toys
- still need parents or familiar adult nearby for security and support
- are aware of their feelings and of other people's feelings
- enjoys playing games with other children
- watches other children playing and then join in the play for short periods of time
- enjoys group activities such as singing and dancing
- begins to mimic real life scenarios with dress ups or imaginative play
- shows a variety of emotions
- knows how to share and take turns
- becomes interested in playing with other children around their age
- uses imaginative play e.g. pretends to be at a restaurant
- plays with other children
- simple make believe play
- may prefer same sex playmates and toys
- unlikely to share toys without protest
- learn to resolve conflicts with peers and adults
- childhood fears may emerge (monster under the bed)
- begins to understand other people's points of view
- shows empathy
- play simple group games
- interacts acceptably with other's
- separates easily from parents
- expresses a wide range of emotions
- objects to major changes in routine

Toddlers are developing a sense of their identity and increase for independence makes t hem increasingly determined to challenge rules. All it takes is a small disappointment for a toddler's self-confidence to fail, sending them in need for a reassuring cuddle. Toddlers will begin to become more sociable, although contact with other children may begin in fi ghting over toys, before developing the social skills to learn to take turms and share.
2.0 factors influencing child growth and development
2.1 Biological factors ( 1 hr )
a. Analyze how biological factors influence child growth and development
-Biological factors include genetic influences, brain chemistry, hormone levels, nutrition, and gender.

Nature and nurture both contribute to the growth and development of children. Although what's endowed by nature is constant, nurture tends to make a big difference too. Here a re a few factors affecting children's growth and development.

\section*{Heredity}

Heredity is the transmission of physical characteristics from parents to children through their genes. It influences all aspects of physical appearance such as height, weight, body structure, the colour of the eye, the texture of the hair, and even intelligence and aptitude s. Diseases and conditions such as heart disease, diabetes, obesity, etc., can also be pas sed through genes, thereby affecting the growth and development of the child adversely. However, environmental factors and nurturing can bring the best out of the already prese nt qualities in the genes.

Genetics/Hereditary, also known as inheritance or biological inheritance is the transmis sion of physical characteristics from you to your children through your genes (the basic physical and functional unit of inheritance). Genes have an effect on most of the physic al characteristics of your child such as height, weight, body structure, the colour of their e ye, the texture of their hair, and even intelligence and aptitudes. For example, if you are ta II, it is most likely that your child will also inherit this trait and be tall.

The genes that a person have inherited are referred to as a genotype; while a phenotype $r$ efers to how the genes are actually expressed. For instances, phenotypes include physic al traits like height and eyes colour, as well as non-physical traits like personality traits, s uch as extroversion (Ludlow \& Gutierrez, 2014). Genetic Interaction refers to a phenome non where two or more genes affects the expression of each other in various ways in the development of a single character of an organism (Shinde, 2015). In other words, genes can sometimes contain conflicting information, and in most cases, one gene will win the battle for dominance (Cherry, 2020).

Not only this, various disorders and health conditions such as heart disease, diabetes, ob esity, etc., may also be passed on to your child through your genes, thereby affecting the growth and development of your child.

\section*{3. Sex}

The sex of the child is another major factor affecting the physical growth and developm ent of a child. Boys and girls grow in different ways, especially nearing puberty. Boys ten d to be taller and physically stronger than girls. However, girls tend to mature faster durin g adolescence, while boys mature over a longer period of time. The physical structure of their bodies also has differences which make boys more athletic and suited for activities that require physical rigour. Their temperaments also vary, making them show interest in different things.

\section*{Hormones}

Hormones belong to the endocrine system and influence the various functions of our bo dies. They are produced by different glands that are situated in specific parts of the body to secrete hormones that control body functions. Their timely functioning is critical for $n$ ormal physical growth and development in children. Imbalances in the functioning of hor mone-secreting glands can result in growth defects, obesity, behavioural problems and o ther diseases. During puberty, the gonads produce sex hormones which control the devel opment of the sex organs and the appearance of secondary sexual characteristics in boy $s$ and girls.

\section*{N/B heredity influences}
-Physical characters i.e. genes transtmitted to a child from the parent determines the chil d's physical traits such as height, resemblance, colour -Intelligence i.e. I.Q. levels are passed from a parent to the off sring mental abilities are th us inheritable
-Character traits such as moral values are passed from parent to children
2.0 factors influencing child growth and development
2.1 maternal, child and nutrition (1 HR)
a. analyze the importance of maternal health and nutrition in enhancing good health
b. distinguish the health and nutritional needs of both the mother and child in order to pr omote good health
-The importance of maternal health and nutrition in enhancing good health
- Maternal and newborn nutrition saves lives and supports development and gr eater economic prosperity. Matemal and newborn health are connected. Goo d nutrition in the first 1,000 days supports a healthy start for children, while pr egnant women need good nutrition for their own and their babies' health.
- Good maternal nutrition during pregnancy promotes healthy weight of the new born. Good weight at birth means increased chances for healthy growth.
- Good maternal nutrition during breastfeeding promotes baby's healthy growth.
- Good nutrition from birth to three years is the most important foundation for b aby to grow healthy and bright. After the age of two or three years, the effects of chronic malnutrition in your baby will be irreversible.
- A nutrient-rich maternal diet before and during pregnancy is associated with i mproved fetal health, more appropriate birth weight, and increased rates of ma ternal and infant survival. Physicians need a better understanding of the role o $f$ diet in shaping fetal outcomes
- Lack of adequate maternal nutrition during pregnancy can cause health proble
ms for both the mother and baby. For the woman, malnutrition increases the risk of gestational anaemia, high blood pressure, miscarriage, preterm delivery and maternal mortality. Poor maternal nutrition during pregnancy has an increased risk of having a baby with a low birth weight.
- A healthy maternal diet should include an adequate amount of protein, calciu m , iron, zinc, sodium, iodine, magnesium, folic acid, and vitamins. Taking care of matemal health is important to deliver a healthy baby as well as reduce mat ernal mortality rates.

\section*{-Health and nutritional needs of both the mother and child}

More than half of all child deaths are associated with malnutrition, which weakens the b ody's resistance to illness. Poor diet, frequent illness, and inadequate or inattentive care of young children can lead to malnutrition.

If a woman is malnourished during pregnancy, or if her child is malnourished during the $f$ irst two years of life, the child's physical and mental growth and development may be slo wed. This cannot be made up when the child is older - it will affect the child for the rest of his or her life.

Children have the right to a caring, protective environment and to nutritious food and bas ic health care to protect them from illness and promote growth and development.

To maintain a healthy pregnancy, approximately 300 extra calories are needed each day. These calories should come from a balanced diet of protein, fruits, vegetables and whole grains. Sweets and fats should be kept to a minimum. A healthy, well-balanced diet can also help to reduce some pregnancy symptoms, such as nausea and constipation.

Fluid intake is also an important part of pregnancy nutrition. Follow these recommendati ons for fluid intake during pregnancy:
- You can take in enough fluids by drinking several glasses of water each day, in ad dition to the fluids in juices and soups. Talk to your health care provider or midwif e about restricting your intake of caffeine and artificial sweeteners.
- Avoid all forms of alcohol.

The following foods are beneficial to your health and fetal development during pregnanc $y$ :
- Vegetables: carrots, sweet pota toes, pumpkin, spinach, cooked greens, tomatoes and red sweet peppers (for vitamin A and potassium)
- Fruits: cantaloupe, honeydew, mangoes, prunes, bananas, apricots, oranges, and r ed or pink grapefruit (for potassium)
- Dairy: fat-free or low-fat yogurt, skim or $1 \%$ milk, soy milk (for calcium, potassium, vitamins A and D)
- Grains: ready-to-eat cereals/cooked cereals (for iron and folic acid)
- Proteins: beans and peas; nuts and seeds; lean beef, lamb and pork; salmon, trout, herring,
-Avoid eating the following foods during pregnancy:
- Unpasteurized milk and foods made with unpasteurized milk (soft cheeses)
- Hot dogs and luncheon meats (unless they are heated until steaming hot before s erving)
- Raw and undercooked seafood, eggs and meat. Do not eat sushi made with raw fi sh (cooked sushi is safe).
- Refrigerated pâté and meat spreads
- Refrigerated smoked seafood
children: They should receive a lot of high-energy foods, such as carbohydrates in the fo rm of whole-grain cereals, full-fat dairy or soy milk, vegetable oils, fruits (two servings) a nd vegetables in boiled, baked, steamed or sautéed form (three servings). A little butter is also helpful in adding energy for their needs

\section*{How do you promote good health and nutrition in child development?}

Plenty of fresh or frozen fruits and vegetables and whole-grain products should be offer ed to children. The addition of fat, sugar and sources of sodium should be minimized. F ood preparation and service should be consistent with best practices for food safety and sanitation.

\section*{2.0 factors influencing child growth and development 2.3 environmental factors ( 1 hr )}

\section*{-Environmental Factors Affecting Child Growth and Development}
-The environment plays a critical role in the development of children and it represents the sum total of physical and psychological stimulation the child receives. Some of the envir onmental factors influencing early childhood development involve the physical surround ings and geographical conditions of the place the child lives in, as well his social environ ment and relationships with family and peers. It is easy to understand that a well-nurture $d$ child does better than a deprived one; the environment children are constantly immerse d in contributes to this. A good school and a loving family builds in children strong socia I and interpersonal skills, which will enable them to excel in other areas such as academi
cs and extracurricular activities. This will, of course, be different for children who are rais ed in stressful environments.
-The family, school, or general environment a child lives and interacts with generally affe cts their growth and development. In the early formative years, children pick up things fro m their environment, learn how to solve problems, habits, and behaviors, socialize, and g eneral functioning. Consequently, studying the main environmental factors affecting the growth and development of a child is necessary. These include the social, emotional, ec onomic, and physical environment.
-The physical environment is the space and location in which the child grows, affecting t heir health, learning, and behavior. In addition, research shows that effects of the physic al environment, such as housing, exposure to pollution, and neighborhood quality, all aff ect the psychosocial aspect of the child. For example, assume a child with disabilities ge tting access to a ramp to help them access various areas of their home quickly. This exa mple depicts the impact of the physical environment on growth.

\section*{-Social Environment}

The social environment influences on child development are those that affect the social relationships that children will form throughout their lives and the quality of said relation ships, whether with their families, or the neighborhood where they reside.

Some examples of a child's social environment include educational facilities, housing, re creational facilities, and the places they spend most of their interactive social time. Durin g the preschool stage, children largely imitate the social behaviors around them, mostly what they see people do in their daily environment. Exposure to their peers will also enab le them to handle school better, once they join. These observations affect how they form relationships and interact with their peers.

\section*{-Emotional Environment}

The emotional environment in child development refers to how well their interpersonal a nd relational needs are being met at home. This factor may include learning what emotio ns are, understanding and communicating their feelings, learning empathy, and developi ng appropriate ways to manage and handle their feelings and those of others.

Children who grow up in less than ideal emotional environments tend to struggle in the $f$ uture and are unable to form meaningful relationships as they grow up and, in extreme c ases, get involved in crime. Studies have also linked poor emotional environments to late r mental health issues such as anxiety.

\section*{Economic Environment}

The economic environment in child development essentially refers to the financial situat ion in which a child grows up. Economic factors primarily affect child development since child rearing is an expensive endeavor. Research asserts that the most preventable negat ive impact on a child's development is a direct result of the economic environment. There are claims that children from low-income families have poorer health, and are more likely to perform poorly in school than their wealthier counterparts.

\section*{2.0 factors that impact child growth and development}

\section*{2.4 social cultural issues ( 1 hr )}
- DIscuss social cultural issues that influence child growth and development
- Analyze gender issues that that influence child growth and development

\section*{i-Social cultural issues that influence child growth and development}

Socio-cultural factors include language, law, aesthetics (appearance), religion, values, attitudes, social organization, family, community a person's role or status among other
-Culture of the society: Culture is very important in the society for child development. Chil dren are the future of every nation and people have always strived for helping them to re ach the most of their potential in the life span. The present days have more complex nee ds which should be fulfilled for their proper level of development. Child development is a dynamic process, interactive process of physical development, behavioural development, cognitive development, personality development, emotional growth and change. It descri bes the development of children throughout the life span, from birth to death. A lot of ch anges take place at various stages of life; Infancy, childhood, adolescence and adulthoo d. Child development is the basic fact of human existence and each person develops uni quely. Socio-cultural factors are the larger scale forces within societies and culture that a ffect the thoughts behaviour and feeling of child development of those societies and cult ures. Socio-cultural factors include language, law, aesthetics (appearance), religion, valu es, attitudes, social organization, family, community a person's role or status among othe rs.

\section*{-The home/family background:}

The family is the foundation from which learning activities of any child take off. The typ e of family environment a child is born sets the limit for life's adjustment (Isangedigi 201 1). In this discussion aspect of family background are limited to family socio-economic status, parent's educational status and parental discipline, adult predominance, differenc e in language and the culture of community where the child comes. Many studies the fin d out that family characteristic can significant affect in child development.

\section*{-Culture of the society}

Culture is very important in the society for child development. Some sub-culture regard a ggressive behaviour as acts of self-defence and toughness (child militancy). Parents trai $n$ their children to be tough and aggressive in order to survive in the midst of violent ethni c group. In the midst of plural marriages where there are more children than food supply,
children must learn to eat at a speed that will give them an adage over the weak and slo $w$ eaters when all of them have to eat from a common fund of food supply. So cultural d if ferences in interactions between adults and children also influence how a child behave s socially.

\section*{-Religion}

Religion played a significant role in creating a sense of fatalism about child developme nt that shaped the illness and caring experience. Any mother explained that life and deat h is in God control. Religion has been a controversial issue in the society. And Children w ho are socialized within religious families and communities often have beliefs and beha viours that conflict with those of the school. Religious fundamentalists often challenge $t$ he scientific theories taught by schools about the origin of man.

\section*{-Language:}

Language is one of the many ways through which culture affects in child development. As early as infancy, mothers from different cultures talk to their babies differently. Germa n mothers tend to focus on their infants' needs, wishes or them as a person. Mothers of t he African tribal group Nso, on the other hand, focus more on social context. This is the c hild interaction with other people. So, children develop receptive language abilities before their verbal or expressive language development.

\section*{ii. Gender issues that that influence child growth and development}
-Gender also affects physical growth in infancy. Weight, length, and head circumference are greater in boys than in girls throughout the first year of life (Geary, Pringle, Rodeck, Ki ngdom, \& Hindmarsh, 2003). These growth differences are related to hormonal differenc es between boys and girls. In many communities, gender inequality is one important root cause of children's poor development in the early years. ... Gender discrimination togethe $r$ with son preference mean that young girls receive less nutrition, opportunities to play a nd access early learning than young boys
-Boys were around 10\% more likely to show what we call "externalising behaviours" such as destructiveness and aggressiveness. Girls, on the other hand, were more likely to have "internalising problems" such as anxiety.
-Gender roles influence adolescents' self-esteem. While self-confidence is a stereotypical male feature, the presentation of self-confidence by girls is considered a breach of traditi onal gender roles. Therefore, it is not surprising that boys report higher self-esteem than girls
-Children learn at a young age that there are distinct expectations for boys and girls. Cros s-cultural studies reveal that children are aware of gender roles by age two or three. At fo ur or five, most children are firmly entrenched in culturally appropriate gender roles (Kane 1996). Children acquire these roles through socialization, a process in which people lear n to behave in a particular way as dictated by societal values, beliefs, and attitudes.
-Children may also use gender stereotyping readily. Gender stereotyping involves overgen eralizing about the attitudes, traits, or behavior patterns of women or men
-Children who are allowed to explore different toys, who are exposed to non-traditional ge nder roles, and whose parents and caregivers are open to allowing the child to take part i n non-traditional play (allowing a boy to nurture a doll, or allowing a girl to play doctor) t end to have broader definitions of what is gender appropriate, and may do less gender st ereotyping.

-Through play, children learn about the world and themselves.
-They also learn skills they need for study, work and relationships such as:
- confidence
- self-esteem

- social skills
- independence
- curiosity
- coping with challenging situations
-Physical play such as running, skipping and riding a bicycle helps children develop:
- good physical fitness
- agility
- stamina
- co-ordination
- balance

P-laying can help children develop their social skills with others. By listening, paying atte
ntion and sharing play experiences, this helps a child:
- explore their feelings
- develop self-discipline
- learn how to express themselves
- work out emotional aspects of life
-Through play, parents can connect fully with their children and have fun.
- A parent or caregiver can support and take part in their child's play activities but th ey shouldn't direct what happens.
- It's important they give their children time, freedom and choice to play. If an adult makes all the decisions about how, what and when their child plays, the child won' t enjoy their play experiences.

\section*{ii. Types of play and materials needed for stimulation of young people}

\section*{Types of play of young children}

Children love to play because it's fun-but it's also vital to healthy development. During di fferent types of play, children learn and practice key social, thinking, physical, and emoti onal skills, including creativity, imagination, and problem-solving. The benefits of play are progressive, meaning that the skills kids develop during their fun and games build upon each other.

\section*{Types of Play include:}
- Unoccupied play
- Independent play
- Onlooker play
- Parallel play
- Associative play
- Cooperative play
- Competitive play
- Constructive play
- Dramatic play
- Physical play
- Symbolic play

\section*{1. Unoccupied Play}

The first stage of play is unoccupied play. primarily from birth to three months. This type of play likely doesn't look like play at all. However, when babies observe their surroundin gs or make random movements that don't seem to have an objective, this is actually uno ccupied play. It sets the stage for future play exploration.

Parents don't need to do anything special to foster this type of play. Babies do it instincti vely. However, it's important to allow babies to explore, even if it's just wiggling their hand $s$ and feet in the air.

\section*{2. Solitary (Independent) Play}

Solitary play is just what it sounds like-your child playing alone. This type of play teach es children how to keep themselves entertained, one of the steps on the path to being sel f-sufficient. ${ }^{3}$ Once your baby can interact with toys, such as by grasping a rattle, they are starting to move into the independent play stage.

Any child can play independently, but this type of play is most common in children betwe en two and three years old. At that age, children are still pretty self-focused and lack goo d communication and sharing skills.

Preschoolers and older kids may continue to choose independent play even after learnin g to play well with others as it provides unique opportunities to explore their own interest s on their own terms.

\section*{3. Onlooker Play}

In onlooker play, a child simply observes other children playing and doesn't partake in the action. They may watch what you or other adults are doing as well. Onlooker play is typi cal for children between two and three years old and is especially common for younger c hildren whose vocabulary is developing.

Don't dismiss the importance of this type of play. It's a healthy form of learning and part of your child's play journey. It could be that the child feels tentative, needs to learn the rul es, or just prefers to watch before joining in play with others. Watching helps kids gain c onfidence and prepare for future stages of play.

During onlooker play, by observing and possibly mimicking the play of others, your child is building their own skills.

Your child may be using their own toys while engaging in onlooker play, but this type of p
lay is about observing rather than playing alongside others, which is called parallel play. However, children in onlooker play may comment on what they're seeing. They are learni ng about how other kids play and interact.

\section*{4. Parallel Play}

Put two three-year-kids in a room together and you are likely to see them having fun, play ing side by side in their own little worlds. It doesn't mean that they don't like one another; they are just engaging in parallel play. This type of play begins around age two and diffe rs from playing together in that neither child tries to influence the play of the other.

Despite having little overt contact with each other, children in parallel play learn quite a bi t from one another. ${ }^{5}$ Even though it appears that they aren't paying attention to each othe $r$, they truly are and often mimic their playmate's behavior.

Like each of the other stages, this type of play is a bridge to the later stages of play. Man y types of activities, from drawing to playing with toy cars, can occur during parallel play.

\section*{5. Associative Play}

Associative play commonly begins around age three or four. Like parallel play, it features children playing separately. But in this type of play, children are involved with what other $s$ are doing.

Think of a small group of kids building a city with blocks. As they build their individual b uildings, they talk to one another, but they primarily work on their own.

This stage of play helps little ones develop a whole host of skills, such as socialization (what should we build now?), taking turns (can I have the blue one now?), problem-solvin g (how can we make this city bigger?), cooperation, and language development. ${ }^{6}$

Associative play is how many children begin to make real friendships. Typically, this for $m$ of play phases out by age five.

\section*{6. Cooperative Play}

Cooperative play is where all the stages come together and children truly start playing to gether. Typically starting between four and five years of age, this is the predominant type of play in groups of kids this age and up, or in younger preschoolers who have older sibli ngs or have been around a lot of children.

Cooperative play uses all of the social skills your child has been working on and puts the m into action.

This stage of play can encompass many different types of play activities. Whether they are building a puzzle together, playing a board game, or enjoying an outdoor group activi ty, cooperative play sets the stage for future interactions as your child matures. However, kids will still return to the earlier stages of play from time to time as well.

\section*{7. Competitive Play}

The stages of play are vital to your child's social development. Once a child reaches the cooperative play stage, you may see them trying out other types of play. These also cont ribute to development of social, thinking, and physical skills.

When your child is playing Chutes and Ladders or joins a sports team, they are engaging in competitive play. This helps them learn about rules, turn-taking, functioning as part of a team, and the realities of winning and losing.

Competitive play can also help kids develop motional regulation, sportsmanship, and the ability to cope with defeat.

\section*{8. Constructive Play}

Constructive play teaches kids about manipulation, building, and fitting things together. Examples include building with blocks, , making a road for toy cars, or constructing a fort out of couch pillows.

During constructive play, kids use cognitive skills to figure out how to make something w ork, whether it is a block tower that won't stand up or a sandcastle that keeps collapsing. This type of play also teaches the power of trying again.

\section*{9. Dramatic Play}

When your child plays dress-up, school, or restaurant, it's dramatic or fantasy play. Throu gh this type of play, your child's imagination gets a workout. Plus they learn how to take t ums, cooperate, and share, and they work on language development.

Role play also helps teach kids about functioning in the greater community.

\section*{10. Physical Play}

Physical play includes activities such as throwing a ball, climbing a play structure, riding a bike, or playing a game like tag. This type of play builds gross and fine motor skills. Ph ysical play encourages kids to develop fitness skills and to enjoy physical activity, which provides lifelong benefits.

Physical play can include dancing or ball games. This will help your child build their muscl es, bones and physical skills.

You should encourage your child to move as much as possible.

\section*{11. Symbolic Play}

This type of play can include vocal activities (singing, jokes, or rhymes), graphic arts (dra wing, coloring, or working with clay), counting, or making music. Symbolic play helps chi Idren learn to express themselves and explore and process their experiences, ideas, and e motions.

\section*{-Social play}

By playing with others, children learn how to take turns, cooperate and share. This also help s them to develop their language skills.

You can encourage social play by taking your child to playgrounds. Parent and toddler grou ps can also help them meet other children.

\section*{-Constructive play}

Constructive play allows children to experiment with drawing, music and building things.

This helps them to develop their movement skills and become less clumsy. Constructive pl ay also helps children to understand distance and size. An example of this could be if objec ts are small or far away.

You should encourage your child to do arts and crafts and play with building blocks.

Let your child work problems out for themselves during constructive play. This is important. It is better than trying to show them the "right way" to do something.

\section*{Fantasy play}

Using their imagination during play is good for your child's communication skills. It is good for them to create their own games.

You can encourage your child to develop their imagination by giving them props. These co uld be things such as a whisk and bowl if they are pretending to be a baker.

Dress up costumes also encourage fantasy play.

\section*{-Materials needed for stimulation of young people}

Things to play pretend with-baby dolls, puppets, plastic and wood vehicles with wheel s, and water toys. Things to drop and take out-plastic bowls, large beads, balls, and nes ting toys. Things to build with-large soft blocks and wooden cubes.

\section*{iii. The importance of play for children's growth and development}

Play improves the cognitive, physical, social, and emotional well-being of children and young people. Through play, children learn about the world and themselves. They also le arn skills they need for study, work and relationships such as: confidence.
1.

Child play can promote brain development in many ways, including providing the child $w$ ith a better understanding of the world and setting the groundwork for later brain growth ${ }^{1}$
2.

Early playing also has an important role in a child's intellectual development.
3.

Perhaps the most obvious benefit of playing is that it increases a child's creativity.

Creativity is closely tied to divergent thinking, which is the thought process that explores many possible solutions and generates new ideas. Many studies have found that playin g is highly associated with divergent thinking.
4.

The link between early play and later communication skills is evident in research, too.
5.

Self-regulation is one of the most important skills for school readiness. Well-regulated ch ildren can wait for a turn, resist the temptation to grab objects from other children, contro I negative emotions, and persist through challenging activities.
6.

Playing is crucial in enhancing social development in children. Unstructured active play with others - including parents, siblings, and peers - is a significant opportunity to culti vate social skills. While playing, the act of pretending as well as negotiating with peers e nhances children's social skills

Playing also provides opportunities for children to learn social interaction. While playing together, children learn to cooperate, follow the rules, develop self-control, and generally get along with other people.
7.

We already know that play promotes a child's emotional development. Emotional intellig ence is vital for a child's resilience and mental health.

Playing that involves physical activities also promotes gross motor skills, strength, endur ance, and physical health.
8.

Play helps children develop problem solving skills.

When children act out life's problems in pretend-playing, it helps them cope with the strug gles in their own ways. It also provides a safe opportunity for children to rehearse skills a nd future social roles.

When children try out various roles, they learn to take on different perspectives, which wil I further assist them in abstract thinking
9.

Parents who play with their children form a stronger bond with them. Even simple games like scavenger hunts can become a special bonding moment for both parents and childr en. These interactions provide positive life experiences that stimulate children's brain dev elopment.

\section*{-Infancy and Childhood}

Babies whose needs are met quickly and warmly (e.g., feeding, changing, holding/cradlin g , and soothing them) achieve a crucial developmental task - attachment. This bond of affection between parents and children is necessary for a healthy parent-child relationshi p, and also extends to relationships between children, their siblings, and other family me mbers (e.g., grandparents, aunts/uncles, etc) and caregivers. When infants attach succes sfully to their parents and caregivers, they learn to trust that the outside world is a welco ming place and are more likely to explore and interact with their environment. This lays t he groundwork for further social, emotional, and cognitive development.
Research has found that relationships between parents and caregivers and youth that:
- Are warm, open, and communicative;
- Include appropriate limits, and
- Provide reasoning for rules for behavior are associated with higher self-esteem, better performance in school, and fewer negative outcomes such as depression or drug use in children and teenagers.

\section*{Adolescence}

As children reach adolescence, parents and caregivers face a whole new set of tasks tha t require new approaches to deal with the changing needs of children. Children are chang ing on a physical as well as cognitive and social basis.

Parents and caregivers must prepare for the upcoming changes in the parent-child relati onship; teens will begin to detach to a greater degree from existing family bonds and foc us more on their peers and the outside world. This quest for greater independence and a utonomy is a natural part of the developmental process in adolescence.

Parents and caregivers must find the delicate balance between maintaining the familial bond and allowing teens increasing autonomy as they mature. Teenagers who feel conn
ected to yet not constrained by their families tend to flourish.
Research has found that parents and caregivers that maintain a warm, communicative a nd reasoned style of parenting raise teenagers who have higher rates of socially compet ent behavior, take fewer drugs, and exhibit less anxiety or depression.

\section*{ii. Role of caregivers in promoting holistic children development}

The term "caregivers" is used to mean anyone taking care of or responsible for young ch ildren, in any setting, and can include people such as: parents, teachers, early care educa tors, childcare providers, nannies, grandmas, family friends, and coaches.

This key driver is about how caregivers behave towards and interact with children on a re gular basis, in all care settings. An important part of caregiver behavior is knowledge and awareness, including accurate information about child development and appropriate exp ectations for children's behavior at every age. Such knowledge can help caregivers see th eir children in a positive light and promote their healthy development.

Caregivers are influenced by information from many sources, including family members as well as parent education classes and surfing the internet. Studies show that informati on is most effective when it comes at the precise time caregivers need it to understand $t$ heir own children or children in their care. Caregivers who experienced harsh discipline or other negative childhood experiences may need extra help to change the parenting patter ns they learned as children.

Parents and caregivers make sure children are healthy and safe, equip them with the skill s and resources to succeed as adults, and transmit basic cultural values to them.

Parents and caregivers offer their children love, acceptance, appreciation, encouragemen $t$, and guidance. They provide the most intimate context for the nurturing and protection of children as they develop their personalities and identities and also as they mature phy sically, cognitively,

\section*{-Challenges faced by caregivers in providing childcare services}

Caregiving is a complex task with many moving parts. Caregivers often find they have le ss time for activities like chores, spending time with family \& friends, hobbies, or running errands. Those who maintain full or even part-time employment may have difficulty in ke eping a healthy work-life balance.

In all, the challenges caregivers face can be daunting. They'll quickly become overwhelm ed if precautions, plans, and proactive measures are not in place to combat the many iss ues that emerge.

\section*{Time Management}

Caregivers often sacrifice much of their schedule to care for their loved one, even if it me ans a lesser quality of life for themselves. It's important, then, to understand that there ar e ways to provide care without sacrificing your own mental and physical health. This sta its with effective time management skills.

Most people who claim they don't have enough time for themselves are unaware of how much time they waste intermittently throughout the day. Therefore, the single best time management tactic starts with keeping a daily diary.

\section*{Lack of Privacy}

To provide adequate care, close proximity is somewhat of necessity, sometimes as close as living with a loved one. In that case, it may seem difficult to find time alone for any ex tended period of time. Depending on how advanced an illness or ailment may be, some p atients need round-the-clock care. Eating, bathing, light exercise, medication-these tasks can take up large chunks of a caregiver's day.

A general lack of privacy can lead caregivers to feeling depressed, lonely even. The world feels small when you're only interacting with your loved one everyday. Although it may b e difficult to ask for help, caregivers should understand that they are not alone. There are plenty of organizations and groups available for caregivers to participate in..

\section*{Strains on Relationships}

Caring for a loved one can take away time from relationships with others, just as much a s it can take away time from self. Dinner dates, hobbies, and other activities with friends and family may seem difficult to attend.

\section*{Conflicts about Care}

If you split responsibilities with a sibling, friend, or another family member, you may find from time to time-perhaps of ten-arguments about caregiving duties getting in the way. This is common, as conflicts can emerge regarding scheduling, level of care, medication, and more.

\section*{Conflicts with Loved One}

When you're inside all day with the same person-no matter the situation or dynamic-th ere is going to be tension at times. Human beings are complex creatures with a plethora of wants and needs. Sometimes these wants and needs are drastically different from ot her individuals, and this is where conflict emerges.

This can be even more difficult to handle when dealing with a loved one whose needs ar e immediate and necessary. The relationship between caregiver and patient can also bec ome toxic if a patient begins to take the caregiver for granted, taking advantage of their k indness and asking for more than they need.

\section*{Stress}

Caregivers should covet stress management. Routinely, they may find their days not goin g according to plan. Problems will arise when you least expect it. Something as simple a s car issues can snowball into a mess of missed appointments and dropped responsibili ties.

\section*{Physical Stress}

Dealing with a loved one can induce various kinds of stress that physically manifests. P ain, anxiety, even hair loss, is your body's way of signaling that you're overloaded with str ess and need a break.

\section*{Emotional Stress}

Managing expectations goes hand in hand with stress management. Be careful in expec ting things to go exactly as planned, and certainly do not expect other people will have $y$ our best interests in mind. Just this small change in perspective can help you manage yo ur mood better.

\section*{Isolation}

The daily drudgery of menial tasks associated with caregiving can leave caregivers feeli ng isolated. You're normally dealing with the same person and problems day in and day out with seemingly no end in sight.

\section*{Depression}

Many of the aforementioned issues are not singular issues existing in a vacuum. These problems usually come with more problems, and those problems domino down the line u
ntil caregivers are neck deep in depression, feeling completely defeated.

\section*{Guilt}

Guilt can spring up from time to time in the caregiving journey, although it may not be as obvious as other emotions. Caregiver guilt normally arises during caregiving in three spe cific ways:
- Guilt over inadequate care (even if only perceived)
- Guilt over neglected relationships
- Guilt over negative feelings towards your loved one

\section*{Fatigue}

When an individual takes on the caregiving challenge, they are essentially committing to two schedules: their own and their loved one's. Without help, many caregivers run around frantically, cramming tasks while haphazardly finishing others. At the end of the day, the y feel drained with little energy to offer.

\section*{Sleep Loss}

It's important that a caregiver has energy in order to take care of themselves first and the ir loved one second. Sleep loss or lack of deep sleep can wreak havoc on a caregiver's lif e, leading to poor energy levels throughout the day. This, in turn, leads to half completed tasks, unscheduled daytime naps, falling asleep at work, and even dangerous behavior li ke falling asleep while driving.

\section*{Finances}

Caregiving can be extremely expensive, almost too much for one person to manage. Med ication, medical devices, transportation, and surgical procedures are costly. Many caregi vers have to get more than one job in order to make ends meet.

\section*{Health Risks}

Health risks associated with caregiving include (but are not limited to) stress, sleep issue s , a weakened immune system, depression, and anxiety. These risks are normally attribut ed to a confluence of factors like lack of help, lack of rest, finance troubles, poor self-car e and more.

Some of these theories focus on the developmental milestones or specific achievements

\section*{i. Freud's Psychoanalytic Theory}

According to Sigmund Freud, development is primarily unconscious and behavior is moti vated by unconscious/inner forces, memories, and conflicts over which a person has littl e control or awareness. Although much of his theory is considered outdated, Freud made a revolutionary contribution to the field of human development by emphasizing the idea that early childhood experiences affect our experiences as adults.

In order to understand Freud's theoretical perspective, we must first consider what Freud believed about the structure of personality.

\section*{-Structure of Personality}

Freud believed our personality comprised three parts: the id, the ego, and the superego, which become integrated as we grow and develop. Each component adds its own unique contribution to personality and the three interact in ways that have a powerful influence on an individual. Each element of personality emerges at different points in life.

According to Freud's theory, certain aspects of your personality are more primal and mig ht pressure you to act upon your most basic urges. Other parts of your personality work t o counteract these urges and strive to make you conform to the demands of reality. Here's a closer look at each of these key parts of the personality, how they work individua lly, and how they interact.
-The Id

According to Freud, the id is the source of all psychic energy, making it the primary comp
onent of personality. The id is the only component of personality that is present from birt h. This aspect of personality is entirely unconscious and includes instinctive and primitiv e behaviors.

The id is driven by the pleasure principle, which strives for immediate gratification of all desires, wants, and needs. If these needs are not satisfied immediately, the result is a sta te of anxiety or tension. For example, an increase in hunger or thirst should produce an i mmediate attempt to eat or drink.

The id is very important early in life because it ensures that an infant's needs are met. If t he infant is hungry or uncomfortable, they will cry until the demands of the id are satisfie d. Young infants are ruled entirely by the id; there is no reasoning with them when these needs demand satisfaction.

\section*{-Examples of the Id}

Imagine trying to convince a baby to wait until lunchtime to eat their meal. The id require s immediate satisfaction, and because the other components of personality are not yet p resent, the infant will cry until these needs are fulfilled.

However, immediately fulfilling these needs is not always realistic or even possible. If we were ruled entirely by the pleasure principle, we might find ourselves grabbing the things that we want out of other people's hands to satisfy our cravings.

This behavior would be both disruptive and socially unacceptable. According to Freud, th e id tries to resolve the tension created by the pleasure principle through the use of prima ry process thinking, which involves forming a mental image of the desired object to satis fy the need.

N/B Although people eventually learn to control the id, this part of personality remains th
e same infantile, primal force throughout life. It is the development of the ego and the su perego that allows people to control the id's basic instincts and act in ways that are both realistic and socially acceptable.

\section*{-The Ego}

According to Freud, the ego develops from the id and ensures that the impulses of the id can be expressed in a manner acceptable in the real world. The ego functions in the cons cious, preconscious, and unconscious mind. The ego is the personality component respo nsible for dealing with reality.

Everyone has an ego. The term ego is sometimes used to describe your cohesive awaren ess of your personality, but personality and ego are not the same. The ego represents jus t one component of your full personality.

The ego operates based on the reality principle, which strives to satisfy the id's desires i n realistic and socially appropriate ways. The reality principle weighs the costs and bene fits of an action before deciding to act upon or abandon impulses.

In many cases, the id's impulses can be satisfied through a process of delayed gratificat ion-the ego will eventually allow the behavior, but only in the appropriate time and plac e. 1

The term ego is often used informally to suggest that someone has an inflated sense of self. However, the ego in personality has a positive effect. It is the part of your personalit $y$ that keeps you grounded in reality and prevents the id and superego from pulling you t oo far toward your most basic urges or moralistic virtues. Having a strong ego means ha ving a strong sense of self-awareness.

Freud compared the id to a horse and the ego to the horse's rider. The horse provides po wer and motion, while the rider provides direction and guidance. Without its rider, the hor se would wander wherever it wished and do whatever it pleased. The rider gives the hors
e directions and commands to get it where it wants it to go.
The ego also discharges tension created by unmet impulses through secondary process thinking, in which the ego tries to find an object in the real world that matches the mental image created by the id's primary process.

\section*{-Examples of the Ego}

Imagine that you are stuck in a long meeting at work. You find yourself growing increasi ngly hungry as the meeting drags on. While the id might compel you to jump up from yo ur seat and rush to the break room for a snack, the ego guides you to sit quietly and wait for the meeting to end.

Instead of acting upon the primal urges of the id, you spend the rest of the meeting imag ining yourself eating a cheeseburger. Once the meeting is finally over, you can seek out t he object you were imagining and satisfy the demands of the id realistically and appropr iately.
=The Superego

The last component of personality to develop is the superego.
- According to Freud, the superego begins to emerge at around age five.
- The superego holds the internalized moral standards and ideals that we acquire fr om our parents and society (our sense of right and wrong).
- The superego provides guidelines for making judgments.

\section*{-The superego has two parts:}
1. The conscience includes information about things that are viewed as bad by pare nts and society. These behaviors are often forbidden and lead to bad consequenc
es, punishments, or feelings of guilt and remorse.
2. The ego ideal includes the rules and standards for behaviors that the ego aspires to.

The superego tries to perfect and civilize our behavior. It suppresses all id's unacceptable urges and struggles to make the ego act upon idealistic standards rather than on realisti c principles. The superego is present in the conscious, preconscious, and unconscious.

\section*{Examples of the Superego}

For example, if you give in to the urges of the id, the superego is what will cause you to $f$ eel a sense of guilt or even shame about your actions. The superego may help you feel g ood about your behavior when you suppress your most primal urges.

\section*{Other examples of the superego include:}
- A woman feels an urge to steal office supplies from work. However, her superego counteracts this urge by focusing on the fact that such behaviors are wrong.
- A man realizes that the cashier at the store forgot to charge him for one of the ite ms he had in his cart. He returns to the store to pay for the item because his intern alized sense of right and wrong urge him to do so.
- A student forgot to study for a history test and feels an urge to cheat off of a stud ent sitting nearby. Even though he feels like the chances of getting caught are low, he knows that cheating is wrong, so he suppresses the urge.

\section*{-How is Psychoanalysis applied in Education?}
- Psycho-analysis has given rise to many movements and practices which have pro vided a stimulus to new education. It has changed the conception of education an
d intended its aim. Education is no longer considered as restraint to be achieved by e xternal regulatory means such as punishment and rewards.
- The aim of education is the development of the whole personality - the developm ent of intellect as well as emotions for socially desirable purposes.
- Psychoanalysis has laid stress on such psychological incentives as love, use of in stincts, permissiveness and leniency and the child's own will or interest. It has thro wn light on and explained the variations that we find in the assimilation of variou s subjects among different children. This means that specific disabilities may be due to affective inhibition among other causes.
- Psychoanalysis has explained the child's resistance to learning in terms of unfavo urable environmental conditions, unsympathetic and critical teachers and parents, lack of preparations and emotional blocking caused by anxiety and aggression in the form of phobias or due to inharmonious parent-child or intra-parental relations hips.
- Psychoanalysis, thus, brings out the importance or proper environment for the edu cation of children. The environment in the school and in the home should be such as to reduce the chances of repression and increase the chances of sublimation. I t should provide opportunities for spontaneous and creative activities and for all s ublimations.
- Psychoanalysis has stressed the significance of play in the education of children. Play along with other natural interests of children should determine the various cu rricular and cocurricular activities in the school. This emphasis play has given rise to play therapy and play-way as important techniques in the treatment of scholast ic and emotional problems.
- The success of educational efforts much depends upon the personal relationship
between the teacher and the pupil. This point should not be neglected either by the p ractical teacher or the education theorist. The teacher is prone to the influence of parental complexes, because for the pupil, he is in the psychological situation of t he father or mother.
- The teacher is in a position of authority which may provide a favorable opportunit y for the gratification of such powerful impulses as self- esteem, self love, and ple asure in inflicting pain. These impulses work in such a disguised form that consci ousness cannot easily recognize their true nature.
- The pupils, too, can resort to narcissism and exhibitionism if the teacher is not abl e to handle them in a psychological manner. All this requires that the teacher mus t be able to understand his own psyche so that he may take due precautions agai nst his special tendencies and complexes. He should also be able to get into cont act with the pupil's psychic life.

\section*{Psychoanalytic theory \& children's classroom activities}
-Psychoanalytic theories seek to understand how and why humans think and behave i n certain patterns from infancy. Psychoanalytic theories seek to understand how and w hy humans think and behave in certain patterns from infancy.

When applying psychoanalytic theories to children in the classroom, activities are typical ly categorised into either behaviorism or cognitivism.
-Behaviorism focuses on tangible behaviours, such as a child who will share her toys ver sus a child of the same age who refuses to share.
- Behaviorism also looks at conditioning and social learning to understand where a child picks up his personality traits and habits.
-Cognitivism looks at mental processes and events rather than tangible behaviours. Cog
nitive structure, or the structure and function of the brain, is of particular concern here. In cognitive science, psychologists are concerned with whether behaviours can be justified chemically or structurally in biological differences between people.
-When behaviorism and cognitivism are understood, teachers, parents and psychologist s can attempt to answer behavioural disorders from a social conditioning and chemical perspective. A behavioural problem may be rooted in either or both areas of psychoanaly sis.

\section*{Examples}

An example of a classic activity used for psychoanalysis in the classroom is role playin g. During a role play, the teacher exercises control over the basic set-up of the scenario. Students then act with in those boundaries to produce original decisions and actions. In each scenario, a student knows there are things she should or should not do. For exampl e, if the scenario involves seeing another child break a rule, the actor in the role play mus t decide what to do. Should he tell the teacher, attempt to punish or correct the child hims elf or let the child get away with it?

Classroom activities around psychoanalytic theory can be public or anonymous. An exa mple of an anonymous psychoanalytic activity is the question and answer game. Stude nts write anonymous questions about social situations on a piece of paper and submit t hem to the teacher. The teacher will pass the questions back out to students, making sur e each student gets a question he did not write. Students take the questions home and a nswer them overnight, and resubmit them anonymously. The teacher then reads them al oud for class discussion.

\section*{ii. Humanistic Theory by Carl Rogers}

One pioneering humanistic theorist was Carl Rogers. He was an influential humanistic p sychologist who developed a personality theory that emphasized the importance of the s elf-actualizing tendency in shaping human personalities. He also believed that humans are constantly reacting to stimuli with their subjective reality (phenomenal field), which changes continuously. Over time, a person develops a self-concept based on the feedbac $k$ from this field of reality.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_07_4615923b0638e69541efg-66.jpg?height=843&width=1831&top_left_y=1240&top_left_x=331)

Figure 1. The phenomenal field refers to a person's subjective reality, which includes exte mal objects and people as well as internal thoughts and emotions. The person's motivati ons and environments both act on their phenomenal field.

One of Rogers's main ideas about personality regards self-concept, our thoughts and feel ings about ourselves.

Rogers further divided the self into two categories: the ideal self and the real self. The id eal self is the person that you would like to be; the real self is the person you actually a re. Rogers focused on the idea that we need to achieve consistency between these two s elves.

\section*{-Unconditional Positive Regard/Love}

Human beings develop an ideal self and a real self, based on the conditional status of p ositive regard. How closely one's real self matches up with their ideal self is called congr uence. We experience congruence when our thoughts about our real self and ideal self ar e very similar-in other words when our self-concept is accurate. High congruence leads t o a greater sense of self-worth and a healthy, productive life. Conversely, when there is a great discrepancy between our ideal and actual selves, we experience a state Rogers call ed incongruence, which can lead to maladjustment.

According to Rogers, parents can help their children achieve their ideal self by giving the m unconditional positive regard, or unconditional love. In the development of self-concep $t$, positive regard is key. Unconditional positive regard is an environment that is free of pr econceived notions of value. Conditional positive regard is full of conditions of worth tha t must be achieved to be considered successful. Rogers (1980) explained it this way: "As persons are accepted and prized, they tend to develop a more caring attitude towards the mselves" (p. 116).

\section*{-The Good Life}

Rogers described life in terms of principles rather than stages of development. These pri nciples exist in fluid processes rather than static states. He claimed that a fully functioni ng person would continually aim to fulfill their potential in each of these processes, achi eving what he called "the good life." These people would allow personality and self-conc ept to emanate from experience. He found that fully functioning individuals had several t
raits or tendencies in common:
1. A growing openness to experience-they move away from defensiveness.
2. An increasingly existential lifestyle-living each moment fully, rather than distort ing the moment to fit personality or self-concept.
3. Increasing organismic trust-they trust their own judgment and their ability to $c$ hoose behavior that is appropriate for each moment.
4. Freedom of choice-they are not restricted by incongruence and are able to mak e a wide range of choices more fluently. They believe that they play a role in det ermining their own behavior and so feel responsible for their own behavior.
5. Higher levels of creativity-they will be more creative in the way they adapt to th eir own circumstances without feeling a need to conform.
6. Reliability and constructiveness-they can be trusted to act constructively. Even aggressive needs will be matched and balanced by intrinsic goodness in congr uent individuals.
7. A rich full life-they will experience joy and pain, love and heartbreak, fear and c ourage more intensely.

\section*{-Application of humanistic theory in learning}

Good teachers are always looking for ways to improve their methods to help students thr ive in their classroom. Different learning theories and techniques help teachers connect with different students based on their learning style and abilities. Teaching strategies tha $t$ are student-centered often have great success in helping students learn and grow bette r. Learner-centered approaches place the student as the authority in the educational setti ng, helping ensure that they are the focus of education and are in control of their learnin g to an extent.
-The idea of student-centered learning is an example of the humanistic learning theory in
action. It's valuable for current and aspiring educators alike to learn about student-center ed education and other humanistic approaches to use in their classroom. These approac hes can be vital in helping students truly learn and succeed in their education.
-there are several important principles involved in the humanistic learning theory that all I ead to self-actualization. Self-actualization is when all your needs are met, you've becom e the best you've can, and you are fulfilled.
-Student Choice is central to the humanistic learning theory and humanistic psychology. Humanistic learning is student-centered, so students are encouraged to take control over their education. They make choices that can range from daily activities to future goals. S tudents are encouraged to focus on a specific subject area of interest for a reasonable a mount of time that they choose. Teachers who utilize humanistic learning believe that it' s crucial for students to find motivation and engagement in their learning, and that is mo re likely to happen when students are choosing to learn about something that they really want to know.

Fostering engagement to inspire students to become self-motiv ated to learn. The effecti veness of this psychology approach is based on learners feeling engaged and self-motiv ated so they want to learn. So humanistic learning relies on educators working to engage students, encouraging them to find things they are passionate about so they are excited about learning.
- The importance of self-evaluation. For most humanistic teachers, grades don't really matter. Self-evaluation is the most meaningful way to evaluate how learning is going. Grading students encourages students to work for the grade, instead of doing things based on their own satisfaction and excitement of learning. Routine testing and rote memorization don't lead to meaningful learning in this theory, and thus aren't encoura ged by humanistic teachers. Humanistic educators help students perform self-evalua tions so they can see how students feel about their progress.
- Feelings and knowledge are both important to the learning process and should not be
separated according to humanistic psychology. Humanistic teachers believe that knowle dge and feelings go hand-in-hand in the learning process. Cognitive and affective lear ning are both important to humanistic learning. Lessons and activities should focus on the whole student and their intellect and feelings, not one or the other.
- A safe learning environment. Because humanistic learning focuses on the entire stud ent, humanistic educators understand that they need to create a safe environment so students can have as many as their needs met as possible. They need to feel safe ph ysically, mentally, and emotionally in order to be able to focus on learning. So humani stic educators are passionate about the idea of helping students meet as many of th eir needs as possible.

\section*{The role of teacher and student in humanistic learning theory.}

In the humanistic learning theory, teachers and students have specific roles for success. The overall role of a teacher is to be a facilitator and role model, not necessarily to be the one doing the teacher. The role of the teacher includes:
- Teach learning skills. Good teachers in humanistic learning theory focus on helping s tudents develop learning skills. Students are responsible for learning choices, so helpi ng them understand the best ways to learn is key to their success.
- Provide motivation for classroom tasks. Humanistic learning focuses on engagemen t , so teachers need to provide motivation and exciting activities to help students feel engaged about learning.
- Provide choices to students in task/subject selection. Choice is central to humanistic learning, so teachers have a role in helping work with students to make choices about what to learn. They may offer options, help students evaluate what they're excited ab out, and more.
- Create opportunities for group work with peers. As a facilitator in the classroom, teac hers create group opportunities to help students explore, observe, and self evaluate. T
hey can do this better as they interact with other students who are learning at the same ti me that they are.

Humanistic approach examples in education.
Some examples of humanistic education in action include:
- Teachers can help students set learning goals at the beginning of the year, and then $h$ elp design pathways for students to reach their goals. Students are in charge of their learning, and teachers can help steer them in the right direction.
- Teachers can create exciting and engaging learning opportunities. For example, teach ers trying to help students understand government can allow students to create their own government in the classroom. Students will be excited about learning, as well as be in-charge of how everything runs.
- Teachers can create a safe learning environment for students by having snacks, enco uraging students to use the bathroom and get water, and creating good relationships with students so they will trust speaking to their teacher if there is an issue.
- Teachers can utilize journaling to help students focus on self-evaluation and their fee lings as part of learning. Using prompt questions can help students better understand their feelings and progress in learning.

\section*{Best practices from humanistic theory to bring to your classroom.}

A teaching degree is a crucial step for those who want to be teachers. A degree can help them learn about current practices and trends in teaching, learning theories, and how to apply them to the classroom. Established teachers can also greatly benefit from continui ng education and continuously expanding their techniques.

When considering their own teaching practices, teachers can work to incorporate humani stic theory into their classroom by:
- Making time to collaborate with other educators
- Co-planning lessons with other teachers
- Evaluating student needs and wants regularly
- Connecting with parents to help meet specific student needs
- Preparing to try new things with students regularly

\section*{iii. Behaviorism Theory}

The behavior perspective, or behaviorism, is the belief that personality is the result of an i ndividual's interactions with their environment, including the decisions they make and th e actions they take. Psychologists can pinpoint and connect habits and behavior to predi ct how a person's personality was shaped.

The interactions that may form the path of your life and the shape of your personality in clude:
- Traumatic life experiences
- Lessons from your parents and teachers
- Lessons from movies, TV, and other forms of media
- Relationships

\section*{Behaviourist Theories of Personality}

Our behaviors are reflections of our personality. Behaviorists such as Skinner and Rotter have formulated their respective theorists of personality.

\section*{i. Personality and Skinner}
B.F. Skinner proposed that our differences in our learning experiences are the main reaso n behind our individual differences in our behavior. And we learn these patterns of behav ior either directly (reward as positive reinforcement of good behavior or punishment as a negative reinforcement of behavior). Skinner believed that it is simply human nature that
we behave in such a way that we would receive rewards of favorable things. If we want t o experience reinforcement, then we should develop personality traits that are positive, $s$ uch as those attributes included in the "agreeableness" category of the Big Five (e.g. bein g understanding, compassionate, empathetic, and a positive thinker). In this sense, Skinn er argued that we respond to every kind of reinforcement, and that our behavior and pers onality traits can be shaped and controlled by the society. In addition to this, Skinner imp lied that if we want our negative traits to be changed into positive ones, we must change our environment first. This strict behaviorist point of view tries to refute other psychologi sts belief that we must alter our inner self first (that is, our own personality traits) before we can fully experience the change that we want.ad behavior) or indirectly (through obse rvational learning or modeling).

\section*{ii. Personality and Rotter}

When Julian Rotter started developing his social learning theory, he refused to embrace t he ideologies of Freudian Psychoanalysis, which was the dominating viewpoint of the cir cle of psychologists during his time. Instead, he utilized the law of effect, wherein people are being driven to pursue positive reinforcement and to avert negative reinforcement. According to his theory, personality and behaviorism are not connected by our physiologi cal instincts and drives.

The main viewpoint in the social learning theory of Rotter is that personality is a represe ntation of the contact between the person and his environment. Therefore, his theory pos its that we must consider both the individual and his environment before having a full un derstanding of his behavior. In line with this, Rotter believed that personality is a set of p otentials that man uses to respond in certain circumstances.

For Rotter, personality and behavior can always be altered. According to him, changing t he environment the individual is in and changing his way of thinking would lead to a cha nge in his behavior, and therefore in his personality traits also change according to that s
pecific situation. In contrast with psychoanalytical theories and strict behavioral theorie s, Rotter argues that humans do not just behave to avoid punishment; rather, we are moti vated to act by our life goals and our vision to maximize the rewards we would receive. N ow that's a more optimistic way to view personality and behavior, isn't it?

Personality and behavior are no doubt connected with each other. Our behavior provides us hints on who we truly are, and our personality traits are given meaning by the way we behave.

\section*{-Factors Affecting Personality Development of Children}

Personality development for kids depends on various internal factors such as heredity a nd hormone levels which could affect the physical and emotional characteristics of an in dividual. The factors that can be controlled though are external factors, so we are going t o look at them in detail.

\section*{1. Parental Influence}

A child's personality development depends on how their parents behave with them, the al lowances they give the child, the atmosphere that they create at home, and even the way they behave with others. Children often mimic their parents' mannerisms, so it is very crit ical that parents behave well with and around their kids and become good role models fo $r$ them.

\section*{2. Home Environment}

A home with a peaceful and loving environment is the backbone of a child's mental healt $h$ and stability. The child should feel relaxed and free to express themself at home. Over discipline and overprotection can make your child either rebellious or dependent. Therefo
re, to foster good personality development of your child, ensure that you create a friendly environment at home where the child feels adored and encouraged.

\section*{3. School Environment}

Children spend most of their time in school, hence parents need to understand how the s chool environment is affecting their personality development. An ideal school must not b urden the kids with a lengthy syllabus and curriculum, rather it should have a good mixo f extracurricular activities like sports, dramatics, dance, hiking trips, and soft skills develo pment.

Pay attention to the kind of friends your child has and do so without being too intrusive. You can also ask the teachers to help in grooming your child well.

\section*{4. Culture}

The social behaviour and norms of the society that you and your child live in have a maj or effect on your child's knowledge, beliefs, thoughts, and habits. A child subconsciously absorbs the values of the culture they grow up in. For example, if a child grows up in a c ommunity that is very religious and devoted to praying; that is a habit the child might ad opt as well. Or if a child belongs to a country where art and other intellectual things are p ursued heavily, their interests will be influenced by that kind of culture.

\section*{5. Family Treatment}

Some personality traits are based on the position of the kid in the family, but they can be modified if needed. For example, an only child is overprotected by the family, hence they
might pick up some negative traits like selfishness. Also, they might not be able to mingl e well in a group. So, it becomes vital to ensure that such children participate in various g roup games and activities and are taught how to share and care.

\section*{6. Mass Media and Social Media}

It's the 21st century - the era of entertainment platforms like YouTube, television, movie s, Instagram, etc. where even kids are not isolated from watching celebrity and influencer stories. They try to imitate their favourite stars by following related news and social medi a accounts. While it is nice to acquire some good qualities through media, we need to be careful about not developing any bad traits. Therefore, as a parent, make sure that the m edia is influencing your child's behaviour in a positive way only.

A child goes through various phases in life from toddlerhood to school age. Each phase comes with different challenges, experiences, and learnings. It is important to help your c hild make the most of these years to develop themself into a well-rounded individual.

\section*{i. Cognitive development theories in relation to growth and development}

\section*{Piaget's Cognitive Developmental Theory}

Cognitive theory is concerned with the development of a person's thought processes. It al so looks at how these thought processes influence how we understand and interact with the world.

Piaget proposed an idea that seems obvious now, but helped revolutionize how we think about child development: Children think differently than adults

His cognitive theory seeks to describe and explain the development of thought processes and mental states. It also looks at how these thought processes influence the way we un derstand and interact with the world.

Piaget then proposed a theory of cognitive development to account for the steps and seq uence of children's intellectual development.
- Sensorimotor Stage: A period of time between birth and age two during which an infant's knowledge of the world is limited to his or her sensory perceptions and m otor activities. Behaviors are limited to simple motor responses caused by sensor y stimuli.
in this stage, infants progressively construct knowledge and understanding of the world by coordinating experiences (such as vision and hearing) with physical inter actions with objects (such as grasping, sucking, and stepping). Infants gain know ledge of the world from the physical actions they perform within it. They progress from reflexive, instinctual action at birth to the beginning of symbolic thought tow ard the end of the stage.

Children learn that they are separated from the environment. They have aspect of environment, even though they may be outside the reach of a child's senses. In thi
