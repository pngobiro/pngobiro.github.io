                        <p>The environment plays a critical role in the development of children and it represents the sum total of physical and psychological stimulation the child receives. Some of the environmental factors influencing early childhood development involve the physical surroundings and geographical conditions of the place the child lives in, as well his social environment and relationships with family and peers. It is easy to understand that a well-nurtured child does better than a deprived one; the environment children are constantly immersed in contributes to this. A good school and a loving family builds in children strong social and interpersonal skills, which will enable them to excel in other areas such as academics and extracurricular activities. This will, of course, be different for children who are raised in stressful environments.</p>
                        <p>The family, school, or general environment a child lives and interacts with generally affects their growth and development. In the early formative years, children pick up things from their environment, learn how to solve problems, habits, and behaviors, socialize, and general functioning. Consequently, studying the main environmental factors affecting the growth and development of a child is necessary. These include the social, emotional, economic, and physical environment.</p>
                        <p>The physical environment is the space and location in which the child grows, affecting their health, learning, and behavior. In addition, research shows that effects of the physical environment, such as housing, exposure to pollution, and neighborhood quality, all affect the psychosocial aspect of the child. For example, assume a child with disabilities getting access to a ramp to help them access various areas of their home quickly. This example depicts the impact of the physical environment on growth.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Social Environment</h3>
                        <p>The social environment influences on child development are those that affect the social relationships that children will form throughout their lives and the quality of said relationships, whether with their families, or the neighborhood where they reside.</p>
                        <p>Some examples of a child's social environment include educational facilities, housing, recreational facilities, and the places they spend most of their interactive social time. During the preschool stage, children largely imitate the social behaviors around them, mostly what they see people do in their daily environment. Exposure to their peers will also enable them to handle school better, once they join. These observations affect how they form relationships and interact with their peers.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Emotional Environment</h3>
                        <p>The emotional environment in child development refers to how well their interpersonal and relational needs are being met at home. This factor may include learning what emotions are, understanding and communicating their feelings, learning empathy, and developing appropriate ways to manage and handle their feelings and those of others.</p>
                        <p>Children who grow up in less than ideal emotional environments tend to struggle in the future and are unable to form meaningful relationships as they grow up and, in extreme cases, get involved in crime. Studies have also linked poor emotional environments to later mental health issues such as anxiety.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Economic Environment</h3>
                        <p>The economic environment in child development essentially refers to the financial situation in which a child grows up. Economic factors primarily affect child development since child rearing is an expensive endeavor. Research asserts that the most preventable negative impact on a child's development is a direct result of the economic environment. There are claims that children from low-income families have poorer health, and are more likely to perform poorly in school than their wealthier counterparts.</p>
