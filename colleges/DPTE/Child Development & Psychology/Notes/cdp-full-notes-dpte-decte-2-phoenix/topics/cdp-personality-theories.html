                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">i. Personality development theories on child development (psychoanalytic, humanistic and behavioristic theories)</h3>
                        <p>Some of these theories focus on the developmental milestones or specific achievements children reach by a certain age. Others focus on specific aspects of child development such as personality, cognition, and moral growth.</p>
                        
                        <h4>i. Freud's Psychoanalytic Theory</h4>
                        <p>According to Sigmund Freud, development is primarily unconscious and behavior is motivated by unconscious/inner forces, memories, and conflicts over which a person has little control or awareness. Although much of his theory is considered outdated, Freud made a revolutionary contribution to the field of human development by emphasizing the idea that early childhood experiences affect our experiences as adults.</p>
                        <p>In order to understand Freud's theoretical perspective, we must first consider what Freud believed about the structure of personality.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Structure of Personality</h5>
                        <p>Freud believed our personality comprised three parts: the id, the ego, and the superego, which become integrated as we grow and develop. Each component adds its own unique contribution to personality and the three interact in ways that have a powerful influence on an individual. Each element of personality emerges at different points in life.</p>
                        <p>According to Freud's theory, certain aspects of your personality are more primal and might pressure you to act upon your most basic urges. Other parts of your personality work to counteract these urges and strive to make you conform to the demands of reality. Here's a closer look at each of these key parts of the personality, how they work individually, and how they interact.</p>
                        
                        <h6>The Id</h6>
                        <p>According to Freud, the id is the source of all psychic energy, making it the primary component of personality. The id is the only component of personality that is present from birth. This aspect of personality is entirely unconscious and includes instinctive and primitive behaviors.</p>
                        <p>The id is driven by the pleasure principle, which strives for immediate gratification of all desires, wants, and needs. If these needs are not satisfied immediately, the result is a state of anxiety or tension. For example, an increase in hunger or thirst should produce an immediate attempt to eat or drink.</p>
                        <p>The id is very important early in life because it ensures that an infant's needs are met. If the infant is hungry or uncomfortable, they will cry until the demands of the id are satisfied. Young infants are ruled entirely by the id; there is no reasoning with them when these needs demand satisfaction.</p>

                        <h6>Examples of the Id</h6>
                        <p>Imagine trying to convince a baby to wait until lunchtime to eat their meal. The id requires immediate satisfaction, and because the other components of personality are not yet present, the infant will cry until these needs are fulfilled.</p>
                        <p>However, immediately fulfilling these needs is not always realistic or even possible. If we were ruled entirely by the pleasure principle, we might find ourselves grabbing the things that we want out of other people's hands to satisfy our cravings.</p>
                        <p>This behavior would be both disruptive and socially unacceptable. According to Freud, the id tries to resolve the tension created by the pleasure principle through the use of primary process thinking, which involves forming a mental image of the desired object to satisfy the need.</p>
                        <aside class="callout note" role="note">
                             <h4 class="callout-title"><span class="callout-icon"></span>Note</h4>
                             <p>Although people eventually learn to control the id, this part of personality remains the same infantile, primal force throughout life. It is the development of the ego and the superego that allows people to control the id's basic instincts and act in ways that are both realistic and socially acceptable.</p>
                        </aside>
                        
                        <h6>The Ego</h6>
                        <p>According to Freud, the ego develops from the id and ensures that the impulses of the id can be expressed in a manner acceptable in the real world. The ego functions in the conscious, preconscious, and unconscious mind. The ego is the personality component responsible for dealing with reality.</p>
                        <p>Everyone has an ego. The term ego is sometimes used to describe your cohesive awareness of your personality, but personality and ego are not the same. The ego represents just one component of your full personality.</p>
                        <p>The ego operates based on the reality principle, which strives to satisfy the id's desires in realistic and socially appropriate ways. The reality principle weighs the costs and benefits of an action before deciding to act upon or abandon impulses.</p>
                        <p>In many cases, the id's impulses can be satisfied through a process of delayed gratification—the ego will eventually allow the behavior, but only in the appropriate time and place.</p>
                        <p>The term ego is often used informally to suggest that someone has an inflated sense of self. However, the ego in personality has a positive effect. It is the part of your personality that keeps you grounded in reality and prevents the id and superego from pulling you too far toward your most basic urges or moralistic virtues. Having a strong ego means having a strong sense of self-awareness.</p>
                        <p>Freud compared the id to a horse and the ego to the horse's rider. The horse provides power and motion, while the rider provides direction and guidance. Without its rider, the horse would wander wherever it wished and do whatever it pleased. The rider gives the horse directions and commands to get it where it wants it to go.</p>
                        <p>The ego also discharges tension created by unmet impulses through secondary process thinking, in which the ego tries to find an object in the real world that matches the mental image created by the id's primary process.</p>
                        
                        <h6>Examples of the Ego</h6>
                        <p>Imagine that you are stuck in a long meeting at work. You find yourself growing increasingly hungry as the meeting drags on. While the id might compel you to jump up from your seat and rush to the break room for a snack, the ego guides you to sit quietly and wait for the meeting to end.</p>
                        <p>Instead of acting upon the primal urges of the id, you spend the rest of the meeting imagining yourself eating a cheeseburger. Once the meeting is finally over, you can seek out the object you were imagining and satisfy the demands of the id realistically and appropriately.</p>

                        <h6>The Superego</h6>
                        <p>The last component of personality to develop is the superego.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>According to Freud, the superego begins to emerge at around age five.</li>
                            <li>The superego holds the internalized moral standards and ideals that we acquire from our parents and society (our sense of right and wrong).</li>
                            <li>The superego provides guidelines for making judgments.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h6>The superego has two parts:</h6>
                        <ol>
                            <li>The <strong>conscience</strong> includes information about things that are viewed as bad by parents and society. These behaviors are often forbidden and lead to bad consequences, punishments, or feelings of guilt and remorse.</li>
                            <li>The <strong>ego ideal</strong> includes the rules and standards for behaviors that the ego aspires to.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>The superego tries to perfect and civilize our behavior. It suppresses all id's unacceptable urges and struggles to make the ego act upon idealistic standards rather than on realistic principles. The superego is present in the conscious, preconscious, and unconscious.</p>

                        <h6>Examples of the Superego</h6>
                        <p>For example, if you give in to the urges of the id, the superego is what will cause you to feel a sense of guilt or even shame about your actions. The superego may help you feel good about your behavior when you suppress your most primal urges.</p>
                        <p>Other examples of the superego include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>A woman feels an urge to steal office supplies from work. However, her superego counteracts this urge by focusing on the fact that such behaviors are wrong.</li>
                            <li>A man realizes that the cashier at the store forgot to charge him for one of the items he had in his cart. He returns to the store to pay for the item because his internalized sense of right and wrong urge him to do so.</li>
                            <li>A student forgot to study for a history test and feels an urge to cheat off of a student sitting nearby. Even though he feels like the chances of getting caught are low, he knows that cheating is wrong, so he suppresses the urge.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">How is Psychoanalysis applied in Education?</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Psycho-analysis has given rise to many movements and practices which have provided a stimulus to new education. It has changed the conception of education and intended its aim. Education is no longer considered as restraint to be achieved by external regulatory means such as punishment and rewards.</li>
                            <li>The aim of education is the development of the whole personality - the development of intellect as well as emotions for socially desirable purposes.</li>
                            <li>Psychoanalysis has laid stress on such psychological incentives as love, use of instincts, permissiveness and leniency and the child's own will or interest. It has thrown light on and explained the variations that we find in the assimilation of various subjects among different children. This means that specific disabilities may be due to affective inhibition among other causes.</li>
                            <li>Psychoanalysis has explained the child's resistance to learning in terms of unfavourable environmental conditions, unsympathetic and critical teachers and parents, lack of preparations and emotional blocking caused by anxiety and aggression in the form of phobias or due to inharmonious parent-child or intra-parental relationships.</li>
                            <li>Psychoanalysis, thus, brings out the importance or proper environment for the education of children. The environment in the school and in the home should be such as to reduce the chances of repression and increase the chances of sublimation. It should provide opportunities for spontaneous and creative activities and for all sublimations.</li>
                            <li>Psychoanalysis has stressed the significance of play in the education of children. Play along with other natural interests of children should determine the various curricular and cocurricular activities in the school. This emphasis play has given rise to play therapy and play-way as important techniques in the treatment of scholastic and emotional problems.</li>
                            <li>The success of educational efforts much depends upon the personal relationship between the teacher and the pupil. This point should not be neglected either by the practical teacher or the education theorist. The teacher is prone to the influence of parental complexes, because for the pupil, he is in the psychological situation of the father or mother.</li>
                            <li>The teacher is in a position of authority which may provide a favorable opportunity for the gratification of such powerful impulses as self- esteem, self love, and pleasure in inflicting pain. These impulses work in such a disguised form that consciousness cannot easily recognize their true nature.</li>
                            <li>The pupils, too, can resort to narcissism and exhibitionism if the teacher is not able to handle them in a psychological manner. All this requires that the teacher must be able to understand his own psyche so that he may take due precautions against his special tendencies and complexes. He should also be able to get into contact with the pupil's psychic life.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Psychoanalytic theory & children's classroom activities</h3>
                        <p>Psychoanalytic theories seek to understand how and why humans think and behave in certain patterns from infancy. When applying psychoanalytic theories to children in the classroom, activities are typically categorised into either behaviorism or cognitivism.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Behaviorism</strong> focuses on tangible behaviours, such as a child who will share her toys versus a child of the same age who refuses to share. Behaviorism also looks at conditioning and social learning to understand where a child picks up his personality traits and habits.</li>
                            <li><strong>Cognitivism</strong> looks at mental processes and events rather than tangible behaviours. Cognitive structure, or the structure and function of the brain, is of particular concern here. In cognitive science, psychologists are concerned with whether behaviours can be justified chemically or structurally in biological differences between people.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>When behaviorism and cognitivism are understood, teachers, parents and psychologists can attempt to answer behavioural disorders from a social conditioning and chemical perspective. A behavioural problem may be rooted in either or both areas of psychoanalysis.</p>

                        <h4>Examples</h4>
                        <p>An example of a classic activity used for psychoanalysis in the classroom is role playing. During a role play, the teacher exercises control over the basic set-up of the scenario. Students then act with in those boundaries to produce original decisions and actions. In each scenario, a student knows there are things she should or should not do. For example, if the scenario involves seeing another child break a rule, the actor in the role play must decide what to do. Should he tell the teacher, attempt to punish or correct the child himself or let the child get away with it?</p>
                        <p>Classroom activities around psychoanalytic theory can be public or anonymous. An example of an anonymous psychoanalytic activity is the question and answer game. Students write anonymous questions about social situations on a piece of paper and submit them to the teacher. The teacher will pass the questions back out to students, making sure each student gets a question he did not write. Students take the questions home and answer them overnight, and resubmit them anonymously. The teacher then reads them aloud for class discussion.</p>
                        
                        <h4>ii. Humanistic Theory by Carl Rogers</h4>
                        <p>One pioneering humanistic theorist was Carl Rogers. He was an influential humanistic psychologist who developed a personality theory that emphasized the importance of the self-actualizing tendency in shaping human personalities. He also believed that humans are constantly reacting to stimuli with their subjective reality (phenomenal field), which changes continuously. Over time, a person develops a self-concept based on the feedback from this field of reality.</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_06_07_4615923b0638e69541efg-66-1.jpg" alt="Diagram of Carl Rogers' Phenomenal Field, showing how a person's motivations and environment influence their subjective reality, which includes external objects, people, and internal thoughts and emotions." class="content-image">
                            <figcaption class="muted-text-color">Figure 1. The phenomenal field refers to a person's subjective reality, which includes external objects and people as well as internal thoughts and emotions. The person's motivations and environments both act on their phenomenal field.</figcaption>
                        </figure>
                        <p>One of Rogers's main ideas about personality regards self-concept, our thoughts and feelings about ourselves.</p>
                        <p>Rogers further divided the self into two categories: the ideal self and the real self. The ideal self is the person that you would like to be; the real self is the person you actually are. Rogers focused on the idea that we need to achieve consistency between these two selves.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Unconditional Positive Regard/Love</h5>
                        <p>Human beings develop an ideal self and a real self, based on the conditional status of positive regard. How closely one's real self matches up with their ideal self is called congruence. We experience congruence when our thoughts about our real self and ideal self are very similar—in other words when our self-concept is accurate. High congruence leads to a greater sense of self-worth and a healthy, productive life. Conversely, when there is a great discrepancy between our ideal and actual selves, we experience a state Rogers called incongruence, which can lead to maladjustment.</p>
                        <p>According to Rogers, parents can help their children achieve their ideal self by giving them unconditional positive regard, or unconditional love. In the development of self-concept, positive regard is key. Unconditional positive regard is an environment that is free of preconceived notions of value. Conditional positive regard is full of conditions of worth that must be achieved to be considered successful. Rogers (1980) explained it this way: "As persons are accepted and prized, they tend to develop a more caring attitude towards themselves" (p. 116).</p>
                        
                        <h5>The Good Life</h5>
                        <p>Rogers described life in terms of principles rather than stages of development. These principles exist in fluid processes rather than static states. He claimed that a fully functioning person would continually aim to fulfill their potential in each of these processes, achieving what he called "the good life." These people would allow personality and self-concept to emanate from experience. He found that fully functioning individuals had several traits or tendencies in common:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>A growing openness to experience-they move away from defensiveness.</li>
                            <li>An increasingly existential lifestyle-living each moment fully, rather than distorting the moment to fit personality or self-concept.</li>
                            <li>Increasing organismic trust-they trust their own judgment and their ability to choose behavior that is appropriate for each moment.</li>
                            <li>Freedom of choice-they are not restricted by incongruence and are able to make a wide range of choices more fluently. They believe that they play a role in determining their own behavior and so feel responsible for their own behavior.</li>
                            <li>Higher levels of creativity-they will be more creative in the way they adapt to their own circumstances without feeling a need to conform.</li>
                            <li>Reliability and constructiveness-they can be trusted to act constructively. Even aggressive needs will be matched and balanced by intrinsic goodness in congruent individuals.</li>
                            <li>A rich full life-they will experience joy and pain, love and heartbreak, fear and courage more intensely.</li>

                        <h5>Application of humanistic theory in learning</h5>
                        <p>Good teachers are always looking for ways to improve their methods to help students thrive in their classroom. Different learning theories and techniques help teachers connect with different students based on their learning style and abilities. Teaching strategies that are student-centered often have great success in helping students learn and grow better. Learner-centered approaches place the student as the authority in the educational setting, helping ensure that they are the focus of education and are in control of their learning to an extent.</p>
                        <p>The idea of student-centered learning is an example of the humanistic learning theory in action. It's valuable for current and aspiring educators alike to learn about student-centered education and other humanistic approaches to use in their classroom. These approaches can be vital in helping students truly learn and succeed in their education.</p>
                        <p>There are several important principles involved in the humanistic learning theory that all lead to self-actualization. Self-actualization is when all your needs are met, you've become the best you've can, and you are fulfilled.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Student Choice</strong> is central to the humanistic learning theory and humanistic psychology. Humanistic learning is student-centered, so students are encouraged to take control over their education. They make choices that can range from daily activities to future goals. Students are encouraged to focus on a specific subject area of interest for a reasonable amount of time that they choose. Teachers who utilize humanistic learning believe that it's crucial for students to find motivation and engagement in their learning, and that is more likely to happen when students are choosing to learn about something that they really want to know.</li>
                            <li><strong>Fostering engagement</strong> to inspire students to become self-motivated to learn. The effectiveness of this psychology approach is based on learners feeling engaged and self-motivated so they want to learn. So humanistic learning relies on educators working to engage students, encouraging them to find things they are passionate about so they are excited about learning.</li>
                            <li><strong>The importance of self-evaluation.</strong> For most humanistic teachers, grades don't really matter. Self-evaluation is the most meaningful way to evaluate how learning is going. Grading students encourages students to work for the grade, instead of doing things based on their own satisfaction and excitement of learning. Routine testing and rote memorization don't lead to meaningful learning in this theory, and thus aren't encouraged by humanistic teachers. Humanistic educators help students perform self-evaluations so they can see how students feel about their progress.</li>
                            <li><strong>Feelings and knowledge</strong> are both important to the learning process and should not be separated according to humanistic psychology. Humanistic teachers believe that knowledge and feelings go hand-in-hand in the learning process. Cognitive and affective learning are both important to humanistic learning. Lessons and activities should focus on the whole student and their intellect and feelings, not one or the other.</li>
                            <li><strong>A safe learning environment.</strong> Because humanistic learning focuses on the entire student, humanistic educators understand that they need to create a safe environment so students can have as many as their needs met as possible. They need to feel safe physically, mentally, and emotionally in order to be able to focus on learning. So humanistic educators are passionate about the idea of helping students meet as many of their needs as possible.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4>iii. Behaviorism Theory</h4>
                        <p>The behavior perspective, or behaviorism, is the belief that personality is the result of an individual's interactions with their environment, including the decisions they make and the actions they take. Psychologists can pinpoint and connect habits and behavior to predict how a person's personality was shaped.</p>
                        <p>The interactions that may form the path of your life and the shape of your personality include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Traumatic life experiences</li>
                            <li>Lessons from your parents and teachers</li>
                            <li>Lessons from movies, TV, and other forms of media</li>
                            <li>Relationships</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h5>Behaviourist Theories of Personality</h5>
                        <p>Our behaviors are reflections of our personality. Behaviorists such as Skinner and Rotter have formulated their respective theorists of personality.</p>
                        
                        <h6>Personality and Skinner</h6>
                        <p>B.F. Skinner proposed that our differences in our learning experiences are the main reason behind our individual differences in our behavior. And we learn these patterns of behavior either directly (reward as positive reinforcement of good behavior or punishment as a negative reinforcement of behavior) or indirectly (through observational learning or modeling). Skinner believed that it is simply human nature that we behave in such a way that we would receive rewards of favorable things. If we want to experience reinforcement, then we should develop personality traits that are positive, such as those attributes included in the "agreeableness" category of the Big Five (e.g. being understanding, compassionate, empathetic, and a positive thinker). In this sense, Skinner argued that we respond to every kind of reinforcement, and that our behavior and personality traits can be shaped and controlled by the society. In addition to this, Skinner implied that if we want our negative traits to be changed into positive ones, we must change our environment first. This strict behaviorist point of view tries to refute other psychologists belief that we must alter our inner self first (that is, our own personality traits) before we can fully experience the change that we want.</p>
                        
                        <h6>Personality and Rotter</h6>
                        <p>When Julian Rotter started developing his social learning theory, he refused to embrace the ideologies of Freudian Psychoanalysis, which was the dominating viewpoint of the circle of psychologists during his time. Instead, he utilized the law of effect, wherein people are being driven to pursue positive reinforcement and to avert negative reinforcement. According to his theory, personality and behaviorism are not connected by our physiological instincts and drives.</p>
                        <p>The main viewpoint in the social learning theory of Rotter is that personality is a representation of the contact between the person and his environment. Therefore, his theory posits that we must consider both the individual and his environment before having a full understanding of his behavior. In line with this, Rotter believed that personality is a set of potentials that man uses to respond in certain circumstances.</p>
                        <p>For Rotter, personality and behavior can always be altered. According to him, changing the environment the individual is in and changing his way of thinking would lead to a change in his behavior, and therefore in his personality traits also change according to that specific situation. In contrast with psychoanalytical theories and strict behavioral theories, Rotter argues that humans do not just behave to avoid punishment; rather, we are motivated to act by our life goals and our vision to maximize the rewards we would receive. Now that's a more optimistic way to view personality and behavior, isn't it?</p>
                        <p>Personality and behavior are no doubt connected with each other. Our behavior provides us hints on who we truly are, and our personality traits are given meaning by the way we behave.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Factors Affecting Personality Development of Children</h3>
                        <p>Personality development for kids depends on various internal factors such as heredity and hormone levels which could affect the physical and emotional characteristics of an individual. The factors that can be controlled though are external factors, so we are going to look at them in detail.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Parental Influence</strong>
                                <p>A child's personality development depends on how their parents behave with them, the allowances they give the child, the atmosphere that they create at home, and even the way they behave with others. Children often mimic their parents' mannerisms, so it is very critical that parents behave well with and around their kids and become good role models for them.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Home Environment</strong>
                                <p>A home with a peaceful and loving environment is the backbone of a child's mental health and stability. The child should feel relaxed and free to express themself at home. Over-discipline and overprotection can make your child either rebellious or dependent. Therefore, to foster good personality development of your child, ensure that you create a friendly environment at home where the child feels adored and encouraged.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>School Environment</strong>
                                <p>Children spend most of their time in school, hence parents need to understand how the school environment is affecting their personality development. An ideal school must not burden the kids with a lengthy syllabus and curriculum, rather it should have a good mix of extracurricular activities like sports, dramatics, dance, hiking trips, and soft skills development.</p>
                                <p>Pay attention to the kind of friends your child has and do so without being too intrusive. You can also ask the teachers to help in grooming your child well.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Culture</strong>
                                <p>The social behaviour and norms of the society that you and your child live in have a major effect on your child's knowledge, beliefs, thoughts, and habits. A child subconsciously absorbs the values of the culture they grow up in. For example, if a child grows up in a community that is very religious and devoted to praying; that is a habit the child might adopt as well. Or if a child belongs to a country where art and other intellectual things are pursued heavily, their interests will be influenced by that kind of culture.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Family Treatment</strong>
                                <p>Some personality traits are based on the position of the kid in the family, but they can be modified if needed. For example, an only child is overprotected by the family, hence they might pick up some negative traits like selfishness. Also, they might not be able to mingle well in a group. So, it becomes vital to ensure that such children participate in various group games and activities and are taught how to share and care.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Mass Media and Social Media</strong>
                                <p>It's the 21st century - the era of entertainment platforms like YouTube, television, movies, Instagram, etc. where even kids are not isolated from watching celebrity and influencer stories. They try to imitate their favourite stars by following related news and social media accounts. While it is nice to acquire some good qualities through media, we need to be careful about not developing any bad traits. Therefore, as a parent, make sure that the media is influencing your child's behaviour in a positive way only.</p>
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>A child goes through various phases in life from toddlerhood to school age. Each phase comes with different challenges, experiences, and learnings. It is important to help your child make the most of these years to develop themself into a well-rounded individual.</p>
