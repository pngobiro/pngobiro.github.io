                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">1.2.1 Male reproductive organs in human being</h3>
                        <p>The male reproductive system is mostly located outside of the body. These external organs include the penis, scrotum and testicles. Internal organs include the vas deferens, prostate and urethra. The male reproductive system is responsible for sexual function, as well as urination.</p>
                        <p>The male reproductive organs do the following jobs within your body:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>They produce, maintain and transport sperm (the male reproductive cells) and semen (the protective fluid around sperm).</li>
                            <li>They discharge sperm into the female reproductive tract.</li>
                            <li>They produce and secrete male sex hormones.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The male reproductive system is made up of internal (inside your body) and external (outside your body) parts. Together, these organs help you urinate (rid your body of liquid waste materials), have sexual intercourse and make children.</p>
                        
                        <h4>How does the male reproductive system function?</h4>
                        <p>The entire male reproductive system is dependent on hormones. These are chemicals that stimulate or regulate the activity of your cells or organs. The primary hormones involved in the functioning of the male reproductive system are follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH) and testosterone.</p>
                        <p>FSH and LH are produced by the pituitary gland. It's located at the base of your brain and it's responsible for many functions in your body. FSH is necessary for sperm production (spermatogenesis). LH stimulates the production of testosterone, which is necessary to continue the process of spermatogenesis. Testosterone is also important in the development of male characteristics, including muscle mass and strength, fat distribution, bone mass and sex drive.</p>

                        <h4>External male reproductive structures</h4>
                        <p>Most of the male reproductive system is located outside of your abdominal cavity or pelvis. The external parts of the male reproductive system include the penis, the scrotum and the testicles.</p>
                        <h5>Penis</h5>
                        <p>The penis is the male organ for sexual intercourse.</p>
                        <h5>Scrotum</h5>
                        <p>The scrotum is the loose pouch-like sac of skin that hangs behind the penis. It holds the testicles (also called testes), as well as many nerves and blood vessels. The scrotum protects your testes, as well as providing a sort of climate control system. For normal sperm development, the testes must be at a temperature slightly cooler than the body temperature. Special muscles in the wall of the scrotum allow it to contract (tighten) and relax, moving the testicles closer to the body for warmth and protection or farther away from the body to cool the temperature.</p>
                        <h5>Testicles (testes)</h5>
                        <p>The testes are oval organs about the size of very large olives that lie in the scrotum, secured at either end by a structure called the spermatic cord. Most men have two testes. The testes are responsible for making testosterone, the primary male sex hormone, and for producing sperm. Within the testes are coiled masses of tubes called seminiferous tubules. These tubules are responsible for producing the sperm cells through a process called spermatogenesis.</p>

                        <h4>The internal male reproductive organs</h4>
                        <p>These organs include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Vas deferens:</strong> The vas deferens is a long, muscular tube that travels from the epididymis into the pelvic cavity, to just behind the bladder. The vas deferens transports mature sperm to the urethra in preparation for ejaculation.</li>
                            <li><strong>Ejaculatory ducts:</strong> These ducts are formed by the fusion of the vas deferens and the seminal vesicles. The ejaculatory ducts empty into the urethra.</li>
                            <li><strong>Urethra:</strong> The urethra is the tube that carries urine from the bladder to outside of your body. In males, it has the additional function of expelling (ejaculating) semen when you reach orgasm. When the penis is erect during sex, the flow of urine is blocked from the urethra, allowing only semen to be ejaculated at orgasm.</li>
                            <li><strong>Seminal vesicles:</strong> The seminal vesicles are sac-like pouches that attach to the vas deferens near the base of the bladder. The seminal vesicles make a sugar-rich fluid (fructose) that provides sperm with a source of energy and helps with the sperms' ability to move (motility). The fluid of the seminal vesicles makes up most of the volume of your ejaculatory fluid, or ejaculate.</li>
                            <li><strong>Prostate gland:</strong> The prostate gland is a walnut-sized structure that's located below the urinary bladder in front of the rectum. The prostate gland contributes additional fluid to the ejaculate. Prostate fluids also help to nourish the sperm. The urethra, which carries the ejaculate to be expelled during orgasm, runs through the center of the prostate gland.</li>
                            <li><strong>Bulbourethral glands:</strong> The bulbourethral glands, or Cowper's glands, are pea-sized structures located on the sides of the urethra, just below the prostate gland. These glands produce a clear, slippery fluid that empties directly into the urethra. This fluid serves to lubricate the urethra and to neutralize any acidity that may be present due to residual drops of urine in the urethra.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">1.2.2 Female reproductive organs</h3>
                        <p>The female reproductive system is made up of the internal and external sex organs that function in reproduction of new offspring. In humans, the female reproductive system is immature at birth and develops to maturity at puberty to be able to produce gametes, and to carry a foetus to full term.</p>
                        <p>The internal sex organs are the vagina, uterus, Fallopian tubes, and ovaries. The vagina allows for sexual intercourse and birth, and is connected to the uterus at the cervix. The uterus or womb accommodates the embryo which develops into the foetus. The uterus also produces secretions which help the transit of sperm to the Fallopian tubes, where sperm fertilize ova (egg cells) which are produced by the ovaries.</p>
                        <p>The external sex organs are also known as the genitals and these are the organs of the vulva including the labia, clitoris, and vaginal opening.</p>
                        <h5>The vagina serves three purposes:</h5>
                        <ol>
                            <li>It's where the penis is inserted during sexual intercourse.</li>
                            <li>It's the pathway (the birth canal) through which a baby leaves a woman's body during childbirth.</li>
                            <li>It's the route through which menstrual blood leaves the body during periods.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">1.2.3 Fertilization in human beings</h3>
                        <p>Fertilisation occurs when a sperm fuses with the female act during intercourse and further forms an egg that gets implanted in uterus of the female. The sperm travels through the fallopian tube and penetrates the zona pellucida layer of the ovum (female egg) and fuses with it which forms zygote (fertilized egg). Thousand of sperms are produced in male body to compensate for the ones unfit and non-motile ones. Once the zygote is formed, it gets implanted in the uterus and further growth takes place when cells start dividing and forming tissues and tissues form organ which results in formation of an organ system, ultimately turning into an organism.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">1.2.4 Factors that influence prenatal development in a human being</h3>
                        <p>Prenatal care is the regular health care women should receive from an obstetrician or midwife during pregnancy. Prenatal development is the growth of a single-celled zygote formed by the combination of a sperm and an egg into a baby.</p>
                        <h4>Factors influencing development</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Poverty.</li>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">1.2.5 Types and effects of teratogens on the foetus</h3>
                        <p>A teratogen is something that can cause birth defects or abnormalities in a developing embryo or fetus upon exposure. Teratogens include some medications, recreational drugs, tobacco products, chemicals, alcohol, certain infections, and in some cases, health problems such as uncontrolled diabetes in pregnant people. Exposure to a teratogen can occur through ingestion or environmental exposure during pregnancy. Teratogens can begin affecting the developing embryo as early as 10 to 14 days after conception. During embryonic development, there are periods when the developing organ systems show more sensitivity to teratogens.</p>
                        <p>A teratogen is any agent that causes an abnormality following fetal exposure during pregnancy. Teratogens are usually discovered after an increased prevalence of a particular birth defect.</p>
                        <p>Teratogens can also be found at home or the workplace. The effect is related to type of agent, dose and duration and time of exposure. The first half of pregnancy is the most vulnerable. Teratogenic agents include infectious agents (herpes simplex, syphilis, etc.); physical agents (ionizing agents, hyperthermia); maternal health factors (diabetes); environmental chemicals (organic mercury compounds, herbicides and industrial solvents); and drugs (prescription, over-the-counter, or recreational).</p>
