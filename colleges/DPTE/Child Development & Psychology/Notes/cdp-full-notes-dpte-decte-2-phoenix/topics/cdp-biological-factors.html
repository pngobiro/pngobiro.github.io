                        <p><strong>Analyze how biological factors influence child growth and development</strong></p>
                        <p>Biological factors include genetic influences, brain chemistry, hormone levels, nutrition, and gender.</p>
                        <p>Nature and nurture both contribute to the growth and development of children. Although what's endowed by nature is constant, nurture tends to make a big difference too. Here are a few factors affecting children's growth and development.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Heredity</h3>
                        <p>Heredity is the transmission of physical characteristics from parents to children through their genes. It influences all aspects of physical appearance such as height, weight, body structure, the colour of the eye, the texture of the hair, and even intelligence and aptitudes. Diseases and conditions such as heart disease, diabetes, obesity, etc., can also be passed through genes, thereby affecting the growth and development of the child adversely. However, environmental factors and nurturing can bring the best out of the already present qualities in the genes.</p>
                        <p>Genetics/Hereditary, also known as inheritance or biological inheritance is the transmission of physical characteristics from you to your children through your genes (the basic physical and functional unit of inheritance). Genes have an effect on most of the physical characteristics of your child such as height, weight, body structure, the colour of their eye, the texture of their hair, and even intelligence and aptitudes. For example, if you are tall, it is most likely that your child will also inherit this trait and be tall.</p>
                        <p>The genes that a person have inherited are referred to as a genotype; while a phenotype refers to how the genes are actually expressed. For instances, phenotypes include physical traits like height and eyes colour, as well as non-physical traits like personality traits, such as extroversion (Ludlow & Gutierrez, 2014). Genetic Interaction refers to a phenomenon where two or more genes affects the expression of each other in various ways in the development of a single character of an organism (Shinde, 2015). In other words, genes can sometimes contain conflicting information, and in most cases, one gene will win the battle for dominance (Cherry, 2020).</p>
                        <p>Not only this, various disorders and health conditions such as heart disease, diabetes, obesity, etc., may also be passed on to your child through your genes, thereby affecting the growth and development of your child.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Sex</h3>
                        <p>The sex of the child is another major factor affecting the physical growth and development of a child. Boys and girls grow in different ways, especially nearing puberty. Boys tend to be taller and physically stronger than girls. However, girls tend to mature faster during adolescence, while boys mature over a longer period of time. The physical structure of their bodies also has differences which make boys more athletic and suited for activities that require physical rigour. Their temperaments also vary, making them show interest in different things.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Hormones</h3>
                        <p>Hormones belong to the endocrine system and influence the various functions of our bodies. They are produced by different glands that are situated in specific parts of the body to secrete hormones that control body functions. Their timely functioning is critical for normal physical growth and development in children. Imbalances in the functioning of hormone-secreting glands can result in growth defects, obesity, behavioural problems and other diseases. During puberty, the gonads produce sex hormones which control the development of the sex organs and the appearance of secondary sexual characteristics in boys and girls.</p>
