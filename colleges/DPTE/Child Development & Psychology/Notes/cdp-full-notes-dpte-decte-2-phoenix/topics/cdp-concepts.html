                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Growth</strong> - This is the increase in size, height, shape and mass depending on age</li>
                            <li><strong>Development</strong> - This is increase in complexity of functioning in a person</li>
                            <li><strong>Personality</strong> - This is the scientific study of the human mind, functions and behavior in a given context</li>
                            <li><strong>Memory</strong> - Memory is today defined in psychology as the faculty of encoding, storing, and retrieving information (Squire, 2009). Psychologists have found that memory includes three important categories: sensory, short-term, and long-term</li>
                            <li><strong>Intelligence</strong> - The intelligence is the ability to learn, adjust and take a significant role at right time in the overall growth and development of a child. It affects his social behaviour, moral adjustment and emotional growth</li>
                            <li><strong>Attitude</strong> - In psychology, an attitude refers to a set of emotions, beliefs, and behaviors toward a particular object, person, thing, or event. Attitudes are often the result of experience or upbringing. They can have a powerful influence over behavior and affect how people act in various situations</li>
                            <li><strong>Motivation</strong> - Motivation is the process that initiates, guides, and maintains goal-oriented behaviors. It is what helps you lose extra weight, for instance, or pushes you to get that promotion at work. In short, motivation causes you to act in a way that gets you closer to your goals</li>
                            <li><strong>Emotions</strong> - Emotions are distinct feelings or qualities of consciousness, such as joy or sadness, that reflect the personal significance of emotion-arousing events. The major types of emotions include fear, sadness, anger, surprise, excitement, guilt, shame, disgust, interest, and happiness. These emotions develop in an orderly sequence over the course of infancy and childhood</li>
                            <li><strong>Learning</strong> - Learning can be defined in many ways, but most psychologists would agree that it is a relatively permanent change in behavior that results from experience. Learning is the process of acquiring new understanding, knowledge, behaviors, skills, values, attitudes, and preferences. Human learning starts at birth it might even start before in terms of an embryo's need for both interaction with, and freedom within its environment within the womb and continues until death as a consequence of ongoing interactions between people and their environment.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">b. Differences between growth and development</h3>
                        <p>The term Growth and Development are inseparable but different concepts. The terms growth & Development are used interchangeably to refer to the changes that take place in the life of an individual from his birth to maturity.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Growth</h4>
                        <p>Growth refers to the increase in height, weight, and body size of a person. In biology, growth is considered as the increase in the size of an organ or cell.</p>

                        <h4>Development</h4>
                        <p>On the other hand, development refers to the growth process where a person can develop in terms of physical, mental, social, emotional, moral, etc. Development depend upon both heredity and the environment.</p>
