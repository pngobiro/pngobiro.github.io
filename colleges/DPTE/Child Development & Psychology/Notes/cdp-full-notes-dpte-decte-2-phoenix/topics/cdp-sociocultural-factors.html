                        <p>Socio-cultural factors include language, law, aesthetics (appearance), religion, values, attitudes, social organization, family, community a person's role or status among other.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Culture of the society</h4>
                        <p>Culture is very important in the society for child development. Children are the future of every nation and people have always strived for helping them to reach the most of their potential in the life span. The present days have more complex needs which should be fulfilled for their proper level of development. Child development is a dynamic process, interactive process of physical development, behavioural development, cognitive development, personality development, emotional growth and change. It describes the development of children throughout the life span, from birth to death. A lot of changes take place at various stages of life; Infancy, childhood, adolescence and adulthood. Child development is the basic fact of human existence and each person develops uniquely. Socio-cultural factors are the larger scale forces within societies and culture that affect the thoughts behaviour and feeling of child development of those societies and cultures. Socio-cultural factors include language, law, aesthetics (appearance), religion, values, attitudes, social organization, family, community a person's role or status among others.</p>

                        <h4>The home/family background</h4>
                        <p>The family is the foundation from which learning activities of any child take off. The type of family environment a child is born sets the limit for life's adjustment (Isangedigi 2011). In this discussion aspect of family background are limited to family socio-economic status, parent's educational status and parental discipline, adult predominance, difference in language and the culture of community where the child comes. Many studies the find out that family characteristic can significant affect in child development.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Culture of the society</h4>
                        <p>Culture is very important in the society for child development. Some sub-culture regard aggressive behaviour as acts of self-defence and toughness (child militancy). Parents train their children to be tough and aggressive in order to survive in the midst of violent ethnic group. In the midst of plural marriages where there are more children than food supply, children must learn to eat at a speed that will give them an adage over the weak and slow eaters when all of them have to eat from a common fund of food supply. So cultural differences in interactions between adults and children also influence how a child behaves socially.</p>

                        <h4>Religion</h4>
                        <p>Religion played a significant role in creating a sense of fatalism about child development that shaped the illness and caring experience. Any mother explained that life and death is in God control. Religion has been a controversial issue in the society. And Children who are socialized within religious families and communities often have beliefs and behaviours that conflict with those of the school. Religious fundamentalists often challenge the scientific theories taught by schools about the origin of man.</p>

                        <h4>Language</h4>
                        <p>Language is one of the many ways through which culture affects in child development. As early as infancy, mothers from different cultures talk to their babies differently. German mothers tend to focus on their infants' needs, wishes or them as a person. Mothers of the African tribal group Nso, on the other hand, focus more on social context. This is the child interaction with other people. So, children develop receptive language abilities before their verbal or expressive language development.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">ii. Gender issues that that influence child growth and development</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Gender also affects physical growth in infancy. Weight, length, and head circumference are greater in boys than in girls throughout the first year of life (Geary, Pringle, Rodeck, Kingdom, & Hindmarsh, 2003). These growth differences are related to hormonal differences between boys and girls. In many communities, gender inequality is one important root cause of children's poor development in the early years. ... Gender discrimination together with son preference mean that young girls receive less nutrition, opportunities to play and access early learning than young boys.</li>
                            <li>Boys were around 10% more likely to show what we call "externalising behaviours" such as destructiveness and aggressiveness. Girls, on the other hand, were more likely to have "internalising problems" such as anxiety.</li>
                            <li>Gender roles influence adolescents' self-esteem. While self-confidence is a stereotypical male feature, the presentation of self-confidence by girls is considered a breach of traditional gender roles. Therefore, it is not surprising that boys report higher self-esteem than girls.</li>
                            <li>Children learn at a young age that there are distinct expectations for boys and girls. Cross-cultural studies reveal that children are aware of gender roles by age two or three. At four or five, most children are firmly entrenched in culturally appropriate gender roles (Kane 1996). Children acquire these roles through socialization, a process in which people learn to behave in a particular way as dictated by societal values, beliefs, and attitudes.</li>
                            <li>Children may also use gender stereotyping readily. Gender stereotyping involves overgeneralizing about the attitudes, traits, or behavior patterns of women or men.</li>
                            <li>Children who are allowed to explore different toys, who are exposed to non-traditional gender roles, and whose parents and caregivers are open to allowing the child to take part in non-traditional play (allowing a boy to nurture a doll, or allowing a girl to play doctor) tend to have broader definitions of what is gender appropriate, and may do less gender stereotyping.</li>
