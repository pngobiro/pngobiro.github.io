                        <h4>Parenting</h4>
                        <h5>Introduction</h5>
                        <p>Parents and caregivers make sure children are healthy and safe, equip them with the skills and resources to succeed as adults, and transmit basic cultural values to them. Parents and caregivers offer their children love, acceptance, appreciation, encouragement, and guidance. They provide the most intimate context for the nurturing and protection of children as they develop their personalities and identities and also as they mature physically, cognitively, emotionally, and socially.</p>

                        <h5>Infancy and Childhood</h5>
                        <p>Babies whose needs are met quickly and warmly (e.g., feeding, changing, holding/cradling, and soothing them) achieve a crucial developmental task - attachment. This bond of affection between parents and children is necessary for a healthy parent-child relationship, and also extends to relationships between children, their siblings, and other family members (e.g., grandparents, aunts/uncles, etc) and caregivers. When infants attach successfully to their parents and caregivers, they learn to trust that the outside world is a welcoming place and are more likely to explore and interact with their environment. This lays the groundwork for further social, emotional, and cognitive development.</p>
                        <p>Research has found that relationships between parents and caregivers and youth that:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Are warm, open, and communicative;</li>
                            <li>Include appropriate limits, and</li>
                            <li>Provide reasoning for rules for behavior are associated with higher self-esteem, better performance in school, and fewer negative outcomes such as depression or drug use in children and teenagers.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h5>Adolescence</h5>
                        <p>As children reach adolescence, parents and caregivers face a whole new set of tasks that require new approaches to deal with the changing needs of children. Children are changing on a physical as well as cognitive and social basis.</p>
                        <p>Parents and caregivers must prepare for the upcoming changes in the parent-child relationship; teens will begin to detach to a greater degree from existing family bonds and focus more on their peers and the outside world. This quest for greater independence and autonomy is a natural part of the developmental process in adolescence.</p>
                        <p>Parents and caregivers must find the delicate balance between maintaining the familial bond and allowing teens increasing autonomy as they mature. Teenagers who feel connected to yet not constrained by their families tend to flourish.</p>
                        <p>Research has found that parents and caregivers that maintain a warm, communicative and reasoned style of parenting raise teenagers who have higher rates of socially competent behavior, take fewer drugs, and exhibit less anxiety or depression.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">ii. Role of caregivers in promoting holistic children development</h3>
                        <p>The term "caregivers" is used to mean anyone taking care of or responsible for young children, in any setting, and can include people such as: parents, teachers, early care educators, childcare providers, nannies, grandmas, family friends, and coaches.</p>
                        <p>This key driver is about how caregivers behave towards and interact with children on a regular basis, in all care settings. An important part of caregiver behavior is knowledge and awareness, including accurate information about child development and appropriate expectations for children's behavior at every age. Such knowledge can help caregivers see their children in a positive light and promote their healthy development.</p>
                        <p>Caregivers are influenced by information from many sources, including family members as well as parent education classes and surfing the internet. Studies show that information is most effective when it comes at the precise time caregivers need it to understand their own children or children in their care. Caregivers who experienced harsh discipline or other negative childhood experiences may need extra help to change the parenting patterns they learned as children.</p>
                        <p>Parents and caregivers make sure children are healthy and safe, equip them with the skills and resources to succeed as adults, and transmit basic cultural values to them.</p>
                        <p>Parents and caregivers offer their children love, acceptance, appreciation, encouragement, and guidance. They provide the most intimate context for the nurturing and protection of children as they develop their personalities and identities and also as they mature physically, cognitively.</p>

                        <h4>Challenges faced by caregivers in providing childcare services</h4>
                        <p>Caregiving is a complex task with many moving parts. Caregivers often find they have less time for activities like chores, spending time with family & friends, hobbies, or running errands. Those who maintain full or even part-time employment may have difficulty in keeping a healthy work-life balance.</p>
                        <p>In all, the challenges caregivers face can be daunting. They'll quickly become overwhelmed if precautions, plans, and proactive measures are not in place to combat the many issues that emerge.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Time Management</h5>
                        <p>Caregivers often sacrifice much of their schedule to care for their loved one, even if it means a lesser quality of life for themselves. It's important, then, to understand that there are ways to provide care without sacrificing your own mental and physical health. This starts with effective time management skills.</p>
                        <p>Most people who claim they don't have enough time for themselves are unaware of how much time they waste intermittently throughout the day. Therefore, the single best time management tactic starts with keeping a daily diary.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Lack of Privacy</h5>
                        <p>To provide adequate care, close proximity is somewhat of necessity, sometimes as close as living with a loved one. In that case, it may seem difficult to find time alone for any extended period of time. Depending on how advanced an illness or ailment may be, some patients need round-the-clock care. Eating, bathing, light exercise, medication-these tasks can take up large chunks of a caregiver's day.</p>
                        <p>A general lack of privacy can lead caregivers to feeling depressed, lonely even. The world feels small when you're only interacting with your loved one everyday. Although it may be difficult to ask for help, caregivers should understand that they are not alone. There are plenty of organizations and groups available for caregivers to participate in.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Strains on Relationships</h5>
                        <p>Caring for a loved one can take away time from relationships with others, just as much as it can take away time from self. Dinner dates, hobbies, and other activities with friends and family may seem difficult to attend.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Conflicts about Care</h5>
                        <p>If you split responsibilities with a sibling, friend, or another family member, you may find from time to time-perhaps often-arguments about caregiving duties getting in the way. This is common, as conflicts can emerge regarding scheduling, level of care, medication, and more.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Conflicts with Loved One</h5>
                        <p>When you're inside all day with the same person-no matter the situation or dynamic-there is going to be tension at times. Human beings are complex creatures with a plethora of wants and needs. Sometimes these wants and needs are drastically different from other individuals, and this is where conflict emerges.</p>
                        <p>This can be even more difficult to handle when dealing with a loved one whose needs are immediate and necessary. The relationship between caregiver and patient can also become toxic if a patient begins to take the caregiver for granted, taking advantage of their kindness and asking for more than they need.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Stress</h5>
                        <p>Caregivers should covet stress management. Routinely, they may find their days not going according to plan. Problems will arise when you least expect it. Something as simple as car issues can snowball into a mess of missed appointments and dropped responsibilities.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Physical Stress</h5>
                        <p>Dealing with a loved one can induce various kinds of stress that physically manifests. Pain, anxiety, even hair loss, is your body's way of signaling that you're overloaded with stress and need a break.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Emotional Stress</h5>
                        <p>Managing expectations goes hand in hand with stress management. Be careful in expecting things to go exactly as planned, and certainly do not expect other people will have your best interests in mind. Just this small change in perspective can help you manage your mood better.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Isolation</h5>
                        <p>The daily drudgery of menial tasks associated with caregiving can leave caregivers feeling isolated. You're normally dealing with the same person and problems day in and day out with seemingly no end in sight.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Depression</h5>
                        <p>Many of the aforementioned issues are not singular issues existing in a vacuum. These problems usually come with more problems, and those problems domino down the line until caregivers are neck deep in depression, feeling completely defeated.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Guilt</h5>
                        <p>Guilt can spring up from time to time in the caregiving journey, although it may not be as obvious as other emotions. Caregiver guilt normally arises during caregiving in three specific ways:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Guilt over inadequate care (even if only perceived)</li>
                            <li>Guilt over neglected relationships</li>
                            <li>Guilt over negative feelings towards your loved one</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h5>Fatigue</h5>
                        <p>When an individual takes on the caregiving challenge, they are essentially committing to two schedules: their own and their loved one's. Without help, many caregivers run around frantically, cramming tasks while haphazardly finishing others. At the end of the day, they feel drained with little energy to offer.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Sleep Loss</h5>
                        <p>It's important that a caregiver has energy in order to take care of themselves first and their loved one second. Sleep loss or lack of deep sleep can wreak havoc on a caregiver's life, leading to poor energy levels throughout the day. This, in turn, leads to half completed tasks, unscheduled daytime naps, falling asleep at work, and even dangerous behavior like falling asleep while driving.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Finances</h5>
                        <p>Caregiving can be extremely expensive, almost too much for one person to manage. Medication, medical devices, transportation, and surgical procedures are costly. Many caregivers have to get more than one job in order to make ends meet.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Health Risks</h5>
                        <p>Health risks associated with caregiving include (but are not limited to) stress, sleep issues, a weakened immune system, depression, and anxiety. These risks are normally attributed to a confluence of factors like lack of help, lack of rest, finance troubles, poor self-care and more.</p>
