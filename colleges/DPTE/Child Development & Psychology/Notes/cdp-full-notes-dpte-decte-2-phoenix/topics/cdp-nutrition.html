                        <ul>
                            <li>Maternal and newborn nutrition saves lives and supports development and greater economic prosperity. Maternal and newborn health are connected. Good nutrition in the first 1,000 days supports a healthy start for children, while pregnant women need good nutrition for their own and their babies' health.</li>
                            <li>Good maternal nutrition during pregnancy promotes healthy weight of the newborn. Good weight at birth means increased chances for healthy growth.</li>
                            <li>Good maternal nutrition during breastfeeding promotes baby's healthy growth.</li>
                            <li>Good nutrition from birth to three years is the most important foundation for baby to grow healthy and bright. After the age of two or three years, the effects of chronic malnutrition in your baby will be irreversible.</li>
                            <li>A nutrient-rich maternal diet before and during pregnancy is associated with improved fetal health, more appropriate birth weight, and increased rates of maternal and infant survival. Physicians need a better understanding of the role of diet in shaping fetal outcomes.</li>
                            <li>Lack of adequate maternal nutrition during pregnancy can cause health problems for both the mother and baby. For the woman, malnutrition increases the risk of gestational anaemia, high blood pressure, miscarriage, preterm delivery and maternal mortality. Poor maternal nutrition during pregnancy has an increased risk of having a baby with a low birth weight.</li>
                            <li>A healthy maternal diet should include an adequate amount of protein, calcium, iron, zinc, sodium, iodine, magnesium, folic acid, and vitamins. Taking care of maternal health is important to deliver a healthy baby as well as reduce maternal mortality rates.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Health and nutritional needs of both the mother and child</h3>
                        <p>More than half of all child deaths are associated with malnutrition, which weakens the body's resistance to illness. Poor diet, frequent illness, and inadequate or inattentive care of young children can lead to malnutrition.</p>
                        <p>If a woman is malnourished during pregnancy, or if her child is malnourished during the first two years of life, the child's physical and mental growth and development may be slowed. This cannot be made up when the child is older - it will affect the child for the rest of his or her life.</p>
                        <p>Children have the right to a caring, protective environment and to nutritious food and basic health care to protect them from illness and promote growth and development.</p>
                        <p>To maintain a healthy pregnancy, approximately 300 extra calories are needed each day. These calories should come from a balanced diet of protein, fruits, vegetables and whole grains. Sweets and fats should be kept to a minimum. A healthy, well-balanced diet can also help to reduce some pregnancy symptoms, such as nausea and constipation.</p>
                        <p>Fluid intake is also an important part of pregnancy nutrition. Follow these recommendations for fluid intake during pregnancy:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>You can take in enough fluids by drinking several glasses of water each day, in addition to the fluids in juices and soups. Talk to your health care provider or midwife about restricting your intake of caffeine and artificial sweeteners.</li>
                            <li>Avoid all forms of alcohol.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>The following foods are beneficial to your health and fetal development during pregnancy:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Vegetables:</strong> carrots, sweet potatoes, pumpkin, spinach, cooked greens, tomatoes and red sweet peppers (for vitamin A and potassium)</li>
                            <li><strong>Fruits:</strong> cantaloupe, honeydew, mangoes, prunes, bananas, apricots, oranges, and red or pink grapefruit (for potassium)</li>
                            <li><strong>Dairy:</strong> fat-free or low-fat yogurt, skim or 1% milk, soy milk (for calcium, potassium, vitamins A and D)</li>
                            <li><strong>Grains:</strong> ready-to-eat cereals/cooked cereals (for iron and folic acid)</li>
                            <li><strong>Proteins:</strong> beans and peas; nuts and seeds; lean beef, lamb and pork; salmon, trout, herring,</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>Avoid eating the following foods during pregnancy:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Unpasteurized milk and foods made with unpasteurized milk (soft cheeses)</li>
                            <li>Hot dogs and luncheon meats (unless they are heated until steaming hot before serving)</li>
                            <li>Raw and undercooked seafood, eggs and meat. Do not eat sushi made with raw fish (cooked sushi is safe).</li>
                            <li>Refrigerated pâté and meat spreads</li>
                            <li>Refrigerated smoked seafood</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <p><strong>Children:</strong> They should receive a lot of high-energy foods, such as carbohydrates in the form of whole-grain cereals, full-fat dairy or soy milk, vegetable oils, fruits (two servings) and vegetables in boiled, baked, steamed or sautéed form (three servings). A little butter is also helpful in adding energy for their needs.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">How do you promote good health and nutrition in child development?</h3>
                        <p>Plenty of fresh or frozen fruits and vegetables and whole-grain products should be offered to children. The addition of fat, sugar and sources of sodium should be minimized. Food preparation and service should be consistent with best practices for food safety and sanitation.</p>
