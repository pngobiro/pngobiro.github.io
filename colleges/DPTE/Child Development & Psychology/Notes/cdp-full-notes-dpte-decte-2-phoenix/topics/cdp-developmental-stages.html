                        <p>This stage is characterized by rapid physical, cognitive psychosocial development.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Physical Development</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The infants exhibit reflexes e.g. feeding, blinking to protect the eye objects or coughing. They later develop motor skills more advance than mere reflexes.</li>
                            <li>they start crawling by 6th month and walking by 13th month</li>
                            <li>the develop ability to manipulate objects and move about and development depends on nutrition</li>

                            <li>social factors in the early stages</li>
                            <li>psychological factors in early years</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h6>Secondary factors</h6>
                        <ul>
                           <li>social economic class</li>

                        </ul>

                        <h5>Psychological or development needs of infants include</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>warmth</li>

                        </ul>

                        <h4>Social Development</h4>
                        <p>A child is expected to behave according to societal expectations. The way a child interacts and socializes with people around him during the formative years influences his/her future life.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Social interaction of the infant is basically between the mother and child</li>
                            <li>As the child grows it develops to include interaction with other people e.g. the peers</li>
                            <li>They rely on imitation than speech to coordinate play</li>
                            <li>Children are affected by relationships with friends, siblings, and their parents</li>
                            <li>Few children develop friendship before the age of 3 and if it does then is with members of the same sex</li>
                            <li>Child birth order also affects social development, firstborns are less socially because they interact more with adults than siblings while lastborns are more social because they interact more with siblings and adults</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Cognitive Development of infants</h4>

                        <h5>Piaget's theory of mental development</h5>
                        <p>Jean Piaget is the most noted theorist when it comes to children's cognitive development. He believed that children's cognition develops in stages. He explained this growth in the following stages:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Sensory Motor Stage (Birth through 2 years old)</strong></li>
                            <li><strong>Preoperational Stage (2-7 years old)</strong></li>
                            <li><strong>Concrete Operational Stage (7-11 years old)</strong></li>
                            <li><strong>Formal Operational Stage (12 years old-adulthood)</strong></li>
                        </ul>
                        <h6>-Sensorimotor Stage (Birth through 2 years old)</h6>
                        <p>In this stage, an infant's knowledge of the world is limited to their sensory perceptions and motor activities.</p>
                        <h6>-Preoperational stage (2-6)</h6>
                        <p>Language develops but the child can't mentally manipulate information</p>
                        <h6>-Concrete operational stage (7-11)</h6>
                        <p>The child gains a better understanding of mental operations</p>
                        <h6>-Formal operational stage (12 years and beyond)</h6>
                        <p>The child develops the ability to think about abstract concepts</p>

                        <h4>Emotional Development during Infancy</h4>
                        <p>Infants express the emotions of fear, surprise, and happiness through reflex action. Emotional development depend on learning which in turn is affected by the objects in the environment. Before the end of the first 2 years children express the emotions of anger, sadness, excitement and uneasiness.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">ii. Toddlers (2-3)</h3>
                        <h4>Physical Development of Toddlers</h4>
                        <p>Toddlers will quickly master walking and move on to running, jumping and climbing. Around age two, most toddlers will be able to navigate stairs, kick or throw a ball and draw simple lines. During this time, children may still stumble frequently and be accident prone.</p>
                        <p>Some of the physical developments you're likely to see during this action packed year include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>faster running, and changing direction quickly without falling over,</li>

                        <p>Toddlers are developing a sense of their identity and increase for independence makes them increasingly determined to challenge rules. All it takes is a small disappointment for a toddler's self-confidence to fail, sending them in need for a reassuring cuddle. Toddlers will begin to become more sociable, although contact with other children may begin in fighting over toys, before developing the social skills to learn to take turns and share.</p>
