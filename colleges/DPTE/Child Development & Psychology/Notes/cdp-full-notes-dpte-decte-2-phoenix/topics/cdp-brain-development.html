                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">1. Process of brain development in children in the first 5 years</h3>
                        <p>From birth to age 5, a child's brain develops more, and more rapidly, than at any other time in life. And while genetics plays a significant role, scientific research has made clear that the quality of a child's experiences in the first few years of life - positive or negative helps shape how their brain develops. And that these experiences have lasting impact on their health and ability to learn and succeed in school and in life. 90% of a Child's Brain Develops by Age 5.</p>
                        <p>The human brain, the command center of the entire body, is the only organ not fully developed at birth. At birth, the average baby's brain is about a quarter of the size of the average adult brain. Incredibly, it doubles in size in the first year and keeps growing to about 80% of adult size by age 3 and 90% - nearly full grown - by age 5.</p>
                        <p>A newborn baby has all of the brain cells (neurons) they'll have for the rest of their life, but what really makes the brain work - and enables us to move, think, communicate and just about everything else - are the connections between those cells. And the early years of a child's life are a crucial time for making those connections - at least one million new neural connections (synapses) every second, far more than at any other time in life.</p>
                        <p>Different areas of the brain - which are responsible for different abilities like movement, language and emotion - develop at different rates. Eventually brain connections connect with each other in more complex ways, enabling the child to move and speak and think in more complex ways.</p>

                        <h4>Brain Development V/S Child Development</h4>
                        <p>All children develop differently - some will walk or talk earlier than usual, while others may take more time - but it's clear that the early years are the best opportunity for a child's brain to develop the connections they need to be healthy, capable, successful adults.</p>
                        <p>Recent scientific research has shown that the connections needed for many important, higher-level abilities - like motivation, self-regulation, problem solving, communication and self-esteem - are formed in these early years. Or not formed. And it's much harder for these essential brain connections to be made later in life.</p>
                        
                        <h4>How Brain Connections Are Built</h4>
                        <p>Starting from birth, brain connections are built through a child's every day experiences by positive interactions with their parents and caregivers, and by using their senses to interact with the world around them. It's a young child's daily experiences - the amount and quality of care, stimulation and interaction they receive in their first days, weeks, months and years - that determines which brain connections develop and will last for a lifetime.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Caring, Responsive Relationships</h4>
                        <p>The most important influences on a child's development are their relationships with the adults in their life. Loving relationships with warm, responsive, dependable adults are essential to a child's healthy development. These relationships begin at home, with parents and family, but also include child care providers, teachers and other members of the community.</p>
                        <p>From birth, young children serve up invitations to engage with their parents and other adult caregivers in their lives. Babies do it by cooing and smiling and crying; toddlers are able to communicate their needs and interests more directly. Each of these little invitations is an opportunity for the caregiver to either be responsive or unresponsive to the child's needs. This "serve and return" process is fundamental to the wiring of the brain. Parents and caregivers who give attention and respond and interact with their child are literally building the child's brain. That's why it's so important to talk, sing, read and play with young children from the day they're born, to give them opportunities to explore their physical world, and to provide safe, stable and nurturing environments.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Brain lateralization in children in the first 5 years</h3>
                        <p>Lateralization of brain function is the view that functions are performed by distinct regions of the brain. For instance, it is believed that there are different areas of the brain that are responsible for controlling language, formulating memories, and making movements.</p>
                        <p>If a certain area of the brain becomes damaged, the function associated with that area will also be affected. It contrasts with the holistic theory of the brain, that all parts of the brain are involved in the processing of thought and action.</p>
                        <p>The human brain is split into two hemispheres, right and left. They are both joined together by the corpus callosum, a bundle of nerve fibres which is located in the middle of the brain.</p>
                        <p>Hemispheric lateralization is the idea that each hemisphere is responsible for different functions. Each of these functions are localized to either the right or left side.</p>
                        <p>The left hemisphere is associated with language functions, such as formulating grammar and vocabulary, and containing different language centres.</p>
                        <p>The right hemisphere is associated with more visuospatial functions such as visualization, depth perception, and spatial navigation. These left and right functions are the case in the majority of people, especially those who are right-handed.</p>
                        <p>Each hemisphere controls the opposite side of the body. Left hemisphere controls the muscle movements of the right arm and leg. Likewise, damage to the right occipital lobe (responsible for vision) can result in loss of sight in the left field of vision.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">2. Factors which contribute to normal brain development in children</h3>
                        <p>The early years of a child's life are very important for later health and development. One of the main reasons is how fast the brain grows starting before birth and continuing into early childhood. Although the brain continues to develop and change into adulthood, the first 8 years can build a foundation for future learning, health and life success. How well a brain develops depends on many factors:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>genetics/ inheritance from parents</li>
                            <li>Proper nutrition and exercise</li>
                            <li>Exposure to toxins or infections</li>
                            <li>The child's experiences with other people and the world/Social Interactions with Caring People.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Children also need this type of constructive, meaningful relationship with adults they can trust and rely on for support and comfort. When children don't feel they can rely on the people in their life for those things, whether it be parents, teachers, aunts, uncles, babysitters, or really anyone who spends a significant amount of time with them, they can feel isolated and alone, which impacts how they think and view the world. Scientific studies have found that sometimes a simple hug or understanding conversation can calm brain activity and bridge gaps in synapses.</p>
                        <p>A child's relationships with the adults in their life are the most important influences on their brain development. Loving relationships with responsive, dependable adults are essential to a child's healthy development.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Structure and Consistency in Different Environments</strong>
                                <p>Discipline is an important part of children's upbringing in that it offers them structure and consistency-a dependable model they can rely on for guidance while they're figuring out the world and themselves. Through healthy disciplinary techniques, and explaining in your child's language the reasons why we as adults must discipline them can ease your child's anxiety and help them connect logical brain processes with emotional development in a healthy way.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Talking Through Tough Emotions</strong>
                                <p>Perhaps one of the most important aspects of your child's brain development is teaching them how to identify, express, and regulate their own emotions. Most parents don't realize that brain development plays such a critical role in emotions, that it's easy for them to become angry, frustrated, or fed up with children's egocentrism and "bad behavior." Children often struggle with making sense of how they're feeling, and it's our job to help them understand themselves better-especially when it relates to others. Talking through tough emotions and engaging with your child will help them feel safe to explore their emotions and learn ways of identifying them and coping with them as they grow into healthy adults.</p>
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">3. Responsibilities of caregivers in enhancing normal brain lateralization</h3>
                        <p>Positive caregiver-child interaction is crucial to healthy attachment. Even though interaction is a mutual process, adults in an infant's life are primarily responsible for shaping the attachment relationship.</p>
                        <p>Children depend upon the adults in their life to provide a consistent, loving environment that promotes healthy attachment. The environment must be predictable and nurturing and must support exploration.</p>
                        <p>In positive caregiver-child interactions, caregivers:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>are emotionally and physically available</li>
                            <li>are sensitive and responsive to each individual child's needs</li>
                            <li>respond promptly and appropriately</li>
                            <li>provide opportunities for exploration</li>
                            <li>gently guide children's behavior</li>
                            <li>provide a secure base of love and protection</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Consistent and positive early interactions - such as holding, gazing, smiling, kissing, singing and laughing - cause specific neurochemical activities in the brain. These neurochemical activities lead to organization and wiring of brain systems that are responsible for attachment.</p>
                        <p>The brain's earliest wiring for relationships occurs in the limbic system. The amygdala receives and integrates the emotional information that comes in from interactions with caregivers. The hippocampus stores those emotional experiences. Emotional memories stay in the limbic system. Even when infants cannot actively remember or discuss an emotional memory, that memory has an ongoing effect on that infant's behavior and development.</p>
