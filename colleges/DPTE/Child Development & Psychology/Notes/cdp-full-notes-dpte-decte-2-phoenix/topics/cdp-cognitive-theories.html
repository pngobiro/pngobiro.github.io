                        <h4>Piaget's Cognitive Developmental Theory</h4>
                        <p>Cognitive theory is concerned with the development of a person's thought processes. It also looks at how these thought processes influence how we understand and interact with the world.</p>
                        <p>Piaget proposed an idea that seems obvious now, but helped revolutionize how we think about child development: <strong>Children think differently than adults.</strong></p>
                        <p>His cognitive theory seeks to describe and explain the development of thought processes and mental states. It also looks at how these thought processes influence the way we understand and interact with the world.</p>
                        <p>Piaget then proposed a theory of cognitive development to account for the steps and sequence of children's intellectual development.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Sensorimotor Stage:</strong> A period of time between birth and age two during which an infant's knowledge of the world is limited to his or her sensory perceptions and motor activities. Behaviors are limited to simple motor responses caused by sensory stimuli. In this stage, infants progressively construct knowledge and understanding of the world by coordinating experiences (such as vision and hearing) with physical interactions with objects (such as grasping, sucking, and stepping). Infants gain knowledge of the world from the physical actions they perform within it. They progress from reflexive, instinctual action at birth to the beginning of symbolic thought toward the end of the stage.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Children learn that they are separated from the environment. They have aspect of environment, even though they may be outside the reach of a child's senses. In this stage, infants' knowledge of the world is limited to their sensory perceptions and motor activities.</p>
