                        <p>Each stakeholder in education plays a unique role and can help increase support for educational goals. Stakeholder involvement in education plays an important part, as the purpose of each stakeholder is to reach a common educational goal through team effort. When multiple stakeholders are engaged, the team effort increases the chances of success in reaching these goals. Therefore, a team effort on the part of stakeholders is involved in achieving educational goals.</p>

                                <strong>The School Board</strong>
                                <p>School board members have key responsibilities as stakeholders in education. Some of these key responsibilities are:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>A legal responsibility to ensure schools within their district are meeting educational standards by providing a quality education for all students.</li>
                                    <li>A financial responsibility to use taxpayer money wisely and to have a good handle on other resources given to their schools.</li>
                                    <li>Often each member has a personal responsibility to ensure their schools are effectively helping students to succeed. For example, they can request that school administrators at each school within the district develop programs to meet specific educational goals of the school board.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Students as Stakeholders in Education</strong>
                                <p>Students are the primary stakeholders in education. The primary purpose of why the school was created is for student learning. Thus, students are directly impacted by the educational system and are the greatest stakeholders in education. Students need a good education to receive the knowledge and skills to be successful in life.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Parents as Stakeholders in Education</strong>
                                <p>Parents play a key role as stakeholders in education, as parents are responsible for raising their children. Parents have a vested interest and are impacted by the education their children receive. They want their children to receive a good education to prepare them for life after leaving home.</p>
                                <p>Yet, parents also play a role in supplementing the education their children receive. Parents supplement this education by providing support at home with good nutrition and sleep schedules and ensuring homework is completed, exams are studied for, and the school's policies are adhered to, such as attendance requirements.</p>
                                <p>Parents have a stake in their children's education because they want to ensure schools teach the values they want their children to learn about. They do not want their children to learn about things that parents think are harmful or inappropriate.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Teachers</strong>
                                <p>Teachers are the ones who actually carry out the work of educating students, making them examples of internal stakeholders. They have a great deal of control over what and how students learn in their classrooms.</p>
                                <p>Teachers also have a vested interest in ensuring that schools are effective because their jobs depend on their success. If parents think their child is not learning, they may withdraw their child from the school and the school will fail.</p>
                                <p>As an educator, another reason teachers feel they have a big stake in education is that they feel they have the expertise to know what to teach and how it should be taught to their students.</p>
                                <p>Thus, teachers try to engage closely with other stakeholders (in particular, parents) to come up with the best approaches to educate each child.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>School Administrators</strong>
                                <p>School administrators include the principal, assistant principals, and other school leaders. They have a great deal of responsibility for ensuring that the school runs smoothly and effectively and that there's a positive school culture.</p>
                                <p>They are often people employed for their deep knowledge of education, meaning they're a respected source of input on how the school can be improved.</p>
                                <p>However, school administrators are also often the people who need to listen to other stakeholders and gather their input when making strategic decisions so that the schools reflect the values of their communities.</p>

                                <strong>Business Community</strong>
                                <p>The business community is an interest group that has a stake in education because they want to ensure that the schools are preparing students for the workforce. They want to make sure that graduates have the skills and knowledge necessary to be successful employees.</p>
                                <p>The business community also provides many of the resources that schools need, such as funding, books, and supplies. And businesses often partner with schools to provide internship and job opportunities for students.</p>

                                <p>Philanthropists are people who donate money to organizations, typically charities. In the case of education, philanthropists might donate money to schools, scholarships, or educational programs.</p>
                                <p>Philanthropists have a stake in education because they want their money to be used effectively to improve the lives of others. They want to ensure that their donations are making a difference in the world and that they are supporting a worthy cause.</p>

                                <p>Local and state governments have a stake in education because they want to ensure that their citizens are educated and prepared for the workforce.</p>
                                <p>They also want to make sure that schools are preparing students for the future so that they can be successful, contributing members of society.</p>
                                <p>Federal governments may also have a stake in ensuring students develop citizenship skills and values so that they can be informed and engaged citizens.</p>

                            <li>
                                <strong>Government Representatives</strong>
                                <p>Government officials, such as local representatives, members of Congress, and state governors, have a stake in education because they are the elected representatives who set the overall strategic direction of an education system.</p>
                                <p>They usually run for election with an education platform and, when in office, they have a vested interest in implementing that platform so they can go back to the voters and show results. Should education systems fail, government representatives may also get the blame. They therefore want to keep a keen eye on the direction in which the education system is headed.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Unions</strong>
                                <p>Unions represent the interests of teachers and other education employees. They negotiate salaries, benefits, and working conditions on behalf of their members.</p>
                                <p>Unions also work to ensure that their members are treated fairly and have a voice in decisions that affect them.</p>
                                <p>They want to make sure that teachers have the resources they need to do their jobs effectively and that they are not overworked or underpaid. Workers deserve a fair day's pay for a fair day's work, and unions are in place to ensure this happens.</p>
