                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The Ministry of Education in Kenya has several roles in the management of education. These include:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Promoting education</strong>
                                <p>As you probably already know, Kenya has come quite a long way to promote and boost education activities. This has always been made possible through the Ministry of Education and Sports participating in activities like;</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Sensitizing citizens about the importance of education</li>
                                    <li>Preaching about the value of girl-child education</li>
                                    <li>Establishing and opening schools</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>Not all the heads of the education ministry are equally effective in this endeavor, and that affects the completion and achievement of this goal.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Revising and approves the curriculum</strong>
                                <p>The Education ministry is not necessarily responsible for designing or drafting the curriculum. However, Kenya Institute of Curriculum Development (KICD) designs the curriculum and forwards it to the education ministry for approval.</p>
                                <p>This, therefore means the schools are allowed to adopt and follow the curricular path that's already been set and predetermined.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Organizing workshops & seminars to discuss education issues</strong>
                                <p>So many times, people create seminars and workshops to discuss problems and come up with potential solutions thereof.</p>
                                <p>Therefore, the education ministry is entirely responsible for calling all the teachers together and getting ideas from them on how to better the standards of education across the country.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Coming up with plans for education reforms</strong>
                                <p>As always, there are some things that aren't going in the right direction, and that's where the education ministry comes in handy. The ministry is made of extraordinary people usually with experience in teaching. This makes them better capacitated to come up with solutions and suitable plans for education reforms.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Setting standards for schools at all levels</strong>
                                <p>The education ministry is responsible for setting standards that every school just has to follow or they don't get a chance to do business. Some of them include;</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Requirements for a school to be licensed</li>
                                    <li>Desired student population</li>
                                    <li>The kind of staff hired at school</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>For the few schools that have not met the standards, they are denied licenses and it's a punishable crime to see them open up for business before they're licensed.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Organizing and Approving International Examinations</strong>
                                <p>There are numerous international schools in Kenya that don't let their students sit for exams because they want to provide an unlimited domain of qualification to their students.</p>
                                <p>The education ministry is charged with thoroughly examining these exams so that they suit the job market in Kenya.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Supervising Countrywide Education Standards</strong>
                                <p>For anything to grow exponentially and be maintained in the right shape, it always has to be supervised. The Ministry of education and sports is charged with supervising every government and private schools in the country for things like;</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Population of students versus space and equipment</li>
                                    <li>Whether the teachers are well qualified</li>
                                    <li>Living and feeding standards of students</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>When this is done correctly by the right people, it is then certain that everything will go smoothly as far as education is concerned.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Directing the development of higher education</strong>
                                <p>While the elementary and secondary school level of education is becoming more and more accessible by people at a faster rate, the same is not true for higher education institutions.</p>
                                <p>This is why the education ministry is charged with establishing the possible government solutions based on the problems they've found in the higher education sector.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Ensuring proper management of funds</strong>
                                <p>While it is known that the government generously funds the education ministry, there are high and alarming levels of corruption in almost every institution. Therefore, there are people assigned the role of keeping the state funds safe until they play their desired goal in the end.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Funding government schools</strong>
                                <p>The government, in order to achieve the desired goals in line of education, allocates the necessary funds to the ministry of education, making it easier for the ministry to facilitate the construction of schools even in rural areas.</p>
                                <p>Due to the effectiveness and efficiency of the education ministry, it then becomes an easier and cost-efficient option for the government.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Licensing private schools</strong>
                                <p>So many people want to start up private schools, and just think of how many they would be, or even how pathetic the quality of education would be if there weren't any strict requirements set for them to meet.</p>
                                <p>Once these standards are met, the ministry them issues licenses to these private schools so they can conduct academic activities like the rest.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Take Full Control of Policies, Decisions and Planning activities.</strong>
                                <p>MoE must ensure strong grip and governance on the educational policies, regulation, educational systems across the country.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Regulation of New School Systems</strong>
                                <p>It is observed that every now and then a new school system is introduced specially in India, Pakistan and African nations, claiming to be the best whereas no genuine efforts to meet the minimum acceptance criteria of a new schooling system. Such new business lack in proper planning for curriculum setup, teaching faculties training, integration with existing school systems and compliance with local laws.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Careful Utilization of Educational Budget</strong>
                                <p>There could be so many possible expenses when it comes to allocation of budget. For example, new school opening, salary payments of staff, investment in science and technology, IT infrastructure upgrade, training, international memberships, marketing and media needs and so on. It is extremely important for the MOE to assign Subject Matter Experts with a strong analytical and visionary approach. Every single penny incorrectly spent will result in huge loss for the nation.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Guidance to all Educational Institutes</strong>
                                <p>MoE should provide macro level guidance to all educational institutes covering Marketing, HR, market dynamics, industry trends.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Integration of Different Schooling Systems</strong>
                                <p>Many students face problems while moving from one schooling system to another. The Ministry should work with policy makers to establish a unified integration system to avoid such issues.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Schools Ranking System</strong>
                                <p>There should be a dedicated government department that defines criteria for the best institute. Annual strict audits should be performed against these points and school ranking to be released on the official website. Each school should be graded as Poor, Acceptable, Good or Excellent. This approach will result in competition and continuous improvement. The bench-marking should cover a wide range of aspects linked with the education industry.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Compulsory Education Assurance</strong>
                                <p>MoE should establish a dedicated committee supported by auditors who can consistently perform audits on whether compulsory education is being ensured.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Counseling Service for Higher Education</strong>
                                <p>MoE should have an online portal where students should be given guidance and exposure about different options they can consider. In the form of FAQs students should be given guidance for how, where and when.</p>
                            </li>

                                <strong>Issuance of Scholarships Programs</strong>
                                <p>The Ministry should collaborate with international organizations across the globe to arrange scholarships for the bright students. There should be a dedicated section on the MoE's website where students are provided the details about all kinds of scholarships.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Teaching Regulations</strong>
                                <p>Not everyone should be allowed to start a teaching career. This ruins the quality of education. MoE must establish a mechanism for best teachers criteria that results in qualification of certain individuals to start teaching. The Ministry should maintain a database of all the teachers of the country and provide them online training about new teaching techniques, perform surveys, seek feedback and take annual exams of all teachers.</p>
                            </li>

                                <strong>Curriculum Catalogues</strong>
                                <p>The Ministry should create and distribute curriculum guidance in line with national interests and international trends. Schools are required to comply with such requirements and produce evidence of actions taken. Annual audits may be performed.</p>

                                <strong>Ensuring Strict Compliance and Governance</strong>
                                <p>Any schools which do not meet with MoEs instructions and compliance, should be given notices to improve. Counseling and auditing services should be provided. Consistent violators must be penalized to set an example for others and to maintain high standards.</p>

                                <p>Ministries should encourage NGOs by providing tax free authorization to promote better education, rural student's assistance and so on.</p>
                            </li>

                                <p>The Ministry should prioritize the efforts of improving literacy rate. This may be achieved via free campaigns and advertisements on state owned TV channels, radio stations and social media. There should be a dedicated committee that can work with philanthropists for orphan-education support or for opening new schools.</p>
