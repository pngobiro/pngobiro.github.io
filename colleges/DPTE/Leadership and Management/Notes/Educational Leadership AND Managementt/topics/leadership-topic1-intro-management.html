                        <p>Instructional leadership is leadership that supports the development of teaching and learning. It is referred to using different names including pedagogical leadership, learningcentred leadership, leadership for learning, and student-centred leadership. These terms can be considered under the broad umbrella of instructional leadership and represent the specific and focused practices in which school leaders engage to intentionally support the development of effective teaching and learning in schools.</p>
                        <p>What is unique about instructional leadership is that, first and foremost, it is tightly connected to the work of improving learning for students. Leadership is complex work and can have a range of purposes. For example, some leadership tasks may be primarily managerial and not directed towards improving learning and teaching. The motivation for instructional leadership is the improvement of instruction</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>A strong focus on learning</li>
                            <li>Developing teaching and learning objectives</li>
                            <li>Holding high expectations of students</li>
                            <li>Creating and supporting student learning goals</li>
                            <li>Monitoring learner progress</li>
                            <li>Protecting instructional time</li>
                            <li>Coordinating curriculum</li>
                            <li>Providing instructional support</li>
                            <li>Supporting teacher learning</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Instructional leadership can be conceptualised as leadership practice that supports effective teaching and learning and provides guidance and direction for instructional improvement, by buffering teachers from distraction, providing material resources and psychological support, and promoting professional learning are all examples of close-to-theclassroom instructional leadership practices.</p>
                        <p>The effect of instructional leadership comes from the establishment of processes, tools, and a learning culture in which the work of effective teaching can happen.</p>
                        <p>International research metanalyses reveal that instructional leadership has a positive influence on student achievement. Understanding how instructional leadership impacts on student achievement is the key challenge because leadership typically has an indirect effect on student achievement.</p>
                        <p>Student learning mainly happens in classrooms where teachers have the biggest effect on their learning, but leadership has the second largest effect. Principal instructional leadership impacts on student achievement through strategies that affect what happens in classroom.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Who is responsible for instructional leadership?</h3>
                        <p>Instructional leadership is distributed through networks of influence in and across schools. While the principal and senior leadership team have an important and central role in instructional leadership, it is also clear that middle leaders and other teachers who have responsibility for teaching and learning beyond their own classroom play a key role in instructional leadership in schools. Distributed or shared leadership are terms used to describe the network of both formal and informal sources of influence within a school.</p>
                        <p>Distributed leadership doesn't mean that anyone and everyone is a leader, but that leadership is situated through a web of influence in a school based on expertise and influence. For example, if you were to walk into a school and ask teachers who they go to for advice on curriculum issues, it is likely that a few key names would emerge. Those named may be people who don't hold 'positional' leadership roles such as principal or deputy principal, but who exercise influence and contribute to instructional leadership within the school due to their specific expertise and the willingness of others to seek out their advice.</p>
                        <p>When we consider what instructional and distributed leadership means, the concept of teacher leadership comes readily to mind. Teacher leaders are ideally situated to provide instructional leadership within a distributed network of influence within and even across schools and networks of schools. Recognizing that many people in a school can contribute to instructional leadership enables one of its key features, which is leading collective work to improve instruction.</p>

                            <li>Instructional leadership is an important concept for our schools because it provides a framework that can be used to evaluate current approaches and practices of leadership.</li>
                            <li>It can also be used to inform possible changes in direction so that leadership practices may be introduced or further developed to enhance the quality of teaching and learning in the school.</li>
                            <li>Syntheses of international research on educational leadership concur that instructional leadership has demonstrated the strongest impact on student learning.</li>
                            <li>A number of large international studies have shown that, even after controlling for other variables such as school context and student demographics, principal instructional leadership accounts for a significant amount of variance in student achievement.</li>
                            <li>In addition, these metanalyzes that compare different leadership practices indicate instructional leadership to be the most effective in improving student achievement across a range of school contexts and levels.</li>
                            <li>Simply put, the instructional leadership practices of leaders and teachers in schools increases student achievement by improving teaching and learning in the school.</li>

                        <p>Instructional leadership research findings can inform how to prioritize leadership time and tasks to improve teaching and learning in your school. Researchers have identified a range of different ways to represent the strategies and approaches of instructional leadership. As you read these strategies, bear in mind that current research demonstrates that it is more than just the instructional leadership of the principal that matters - the instructional leadership of others in the school is also very important.</p>
                        <p>The following key strategies and approaches are from research. Some of these strategies are more relevant to the principal, while others are more relevant to senior leadership, middle leadership and other teachers in the school who provide leadership beyond the classroom. Where these sit will depend on the context and structure of the school.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Establishing and supporting the achievement of goals</strong>
                                <p>Schools sometimes have too many goals and this can get in the way of staff gaining sufficient focus and momentum to create improvement for students. Instructional leaders prioritize a few key goals and create focus, resources and support so that these can be achieved. In addition to creating coherence across goals, instructional leaders buffer their staff from distractions. They also avoid tasks themselves that distract from the main purpose of their work and the achievement of these goals. Instructional leaders have an important role in holding high expectations of students and staff, and in listening to them and responding to their needs to enable the achievement of valued goals. Creating coherence is an important part of planning as schools that try to do too much without a coherent focus can struggle to be effective.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Monitoring and responding to student progress</strong>
                                <p>Monitoring student progress is central to effective instructional leadership. This will look different across contexts and levels: for example, the way that data or information are collected and used with a class of five-year olds will look quite different to a Year 13 class. However, the purpose remains the same, which is to create data systems and support teachers in interpreting and using data to make decisions that support the learning and development of students. By creating systems, using data to track student achievement, and supporting teachers to interpret and use data, instructional leaders support teachers to make informed decisions about how to meet the needs of their students.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Supporting teacher and leader learning</strong>
                                <p>Promoting professional learning and development is a central strategy of instructional leadership.</p>
                                <p>Effective instructional leadership provides professional learning for teachers and leaders that is focused on what they need to know and do in order to support student learning. Rather than simply engaging with the latest and most popular (or affordable) professional development programme on offer, professional learning needs to be intentionally designed to create coherence and address the learning needs of teachers in relation to their specific students and context. Effective instructional leaders participate in the professional learning of their teachers and also in professional learning to support their own leadership. Holding an inquiry stance and promoting collaborative inquiry amongst staff are both very important in supporting teacher and leader learning.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Evaluating curriculum and pedagogy</strong>
                                <p>The role of the principal and other key leaders is central in improving teaching through practices such as observing in classrooms and engaging in conversations and feedback with teachers. This assumes that the leader will have in-depth knowledge about curricular content and pedagogy. In some schools this is possible, although in larger schools or secondary schools it poses more of a challenge. Secondary principals cannot be expected to provide substantive in-depth feedback on curriculum and pedagogy across multiple disciplines, so the focus must be how senior leaders can create systems that enable middle leaders and others with expertise to engage in observations and feedback.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Ensuring a supportive learning environment</strong>
                                <p>Strong instructional leadership creates a supportive learning environment for students, teachers, and leaders. Creating a safe and orderly learning environment for students includes creating systems so that students feel safe, providing a caring environment and ensuring high expectations for social behaviour. Creating a supportive and collaborative learning environment for teachers and leaders is important as evidence shows that teacher collaboration can have a positive effect on student achievement<sup>tiii</sup>. Encouraging teachers to collaborate can create collective responsibility in the school which means teachers and leaders work together and have a shared sense of responsibility for students beyond those in their own class. Ensuring a supportive learning environment for students and staff can enable a learning culture where ongoing learning is central for everyone in the school.</p>
                                <p>Strategic resourcing is an important aspect of all of these strategies. Providing the conditions and resources needed for effective learning and teaching is central to the role of instructional leadership. These strategies are all intended to ensure high quality teaching. However, a list like this can raise questions.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Instructional leadership skills are the traits possessed by effective educational leaders to inspire action and optimism. These leaders set an example for others by treating people fairly and making an impression with their honesty and integrity. Effective leaders are supportive of those around them and provide inspiration to achieve individual and collective goals. They use their excellent communication skills to gather feedback, ask for ideas and make informed decisions regarding the processes of the educational institutions they run.Some specific skills related to instructional leadership include:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Communication skills</strong>
                                <p>Verbal and written communication skills are essential to leadership success. An instructional leader must be able to effectively communicate their intentions regarding students' education. This may involve emails and other written communication, or it could mean holding meetings with teachers to set goals and assess lesson plans.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Effective planning</strong>
                                <p>An instructional leader's ability to research and provide necessary resources improves learning and allows teachers to be more effective at their jobs. For example, a principal may adopt new technology for teaching tools and for overseeing staff initiatives, and this process requires planning. Instructional leaders must be able to maintain a balance between procedure and adaptability to support creativity and innovative teaching in their schools.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Trustworthiness</strong>
                                <p>A positive and fair leader easily earns the trust of their staff, allowing the staff to look to the leader in good times as well as challenging times. A good instructional leader can remain calm and fair during a discussion where people present opposing ideas, weighing the merits and drawbacks of each while gathering feedback from other members of staff who would be affected by any changes in plans. An instructional leader's balanced judgment leads their teachers to trust and respect them, and this trust helps build a united educational community.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Competence</strong>
                                <p>Teachers rely on instructional leaders for information associated with instructional methods, current trends in education and other pertinent news related to effective teaching. Additionally, principals are expected to be a visible representation of positivity and transparency in the institution, leading by example and focusing on important learning objectives to promote innovations in teaching.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Team building and collaboration</strong>
                                <p>As the role ultimately responsible for the success of a school, an instructional leader must be adept at uniting the staff and students to further the creation of new ideas and teaching methods.</p>
                                <p>They must be able to create a dependable team that works together to create a more effective and positive learning environment.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Optimism</strong>
                                <p>Staff and students often adopt the disposition of their leader, so an instructional leader must maintain a positive attitude regardless of their current situation. The more upbeat and excited a leader is, the more this attitude spreads to teachers and students, creating an overall environment of positivity. This is also true when providing encouragement, rewarding a good job and focusing on the success and happiness of teachers, students and the institution as a whole.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Interaction with parents</strong>
                                <p>Instructional leaders recognize the importance of a parent's role in the success of their child and the cumulative effect on the success of the school. Principals can identify family members as a critical resource for important events such as fundraisers and extracurricular activities. To get parents excited about participating in these events, principals sometimes choose to host workshops or meetings so that parents can become familiar with each other as well as with teachers and school policies. It also provides them with opportunities to offer their input and ideas to improve the learning environment for their children</p>

                        <p>For education to play its key role in the transformation of a nation, it needs to be adequately and effectively planned because a faulty educational planning can jeopardize the development of a nation for decades.</p>
                        <p>Planning means deciding in advance what is to be done, when to do it, where to do it, how to do it and who is to do it in order to achieve predetermined goals and objectives.</p>
                        <p>Educational planning on the other hand involves a systematic and scientific set of decisions for future action with the aim of achieving set educational goals and objective through optimal use of scarce resources.</p>
                        <p>This implies that educational planning provides the tool for coordinating and controlling the direction of the different components of an educational enterprise so that educational objectives can be achieved.</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>The desire of government to meet the yearnings</li>
                            <li>To cater for the needs and aspirations of the citizenry</li>
                            <li>The demand for education and access to education</li>
                            <li>Provide quality education to the people</li>
                            <li>To respond to technological development</li>
                            <li>To ensure global competitiveness and more importantly</li>
                            <li>To actualize government political philosophy.</li>

                        <p>Knowing your leadership styles may help you improve with limited feedback. Each leadership style has its pitfalls, allowing you to proactively address areas of improvement. This is critical because some employees might hesitate to speak up, even in an anonymous survey.</p>
                        <p>Knowing your leadership style helps you provide adequate guidance and feedback to employees, and better understand your thoughts, how you make decisions and strategies you can consider implementing when making business decisions.</p>
                        <p>It can also help you understand how your direct reports see you and why they may give you specific feedback. For example, if employees feel stifled at work and don't have many opportunities to speak their minds, they may be telling you that you're an autocratic leader who can benefit from changing their style.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">1. Democratic Leadership</h3>
                        <p>Also called: Participative or Facilitative Leadership</p>
                        <p>Democratic leadership is exactly what it sounds like - the leader makes decisions based on each team member's input. Although a leader makes the final call, each employee has an equal say in a project's direction.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Why this leadership style works for institutions:</h4>
                        <p>This leadership style resembles how leaders often make decisions in company board meetings.</p>
                        <p>For example, a democratic leader might give the team a few decision-related options in a company board meeting. They could then open a discussion about each option. After a discussion, this leader might consider the board's thoughts and feedback, or they might open this decision up to a vote.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Why this leadership style is good for the team:</h4>
                        <p>The democratic leadership style is one of the most effective because it encourages everyone to participate in all processes, share their opinions, and know that you will hear them. It also encourages employees to be engaged because they know you will hear their feedback.</p>
                        <p>Team members feeling like they have space to participate can also increase employee empowerment, motivation, and participation.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Potential challenges for leaders with a Democratic style:</h4>
                        <p>Reaching a consensus can take considerable time, resources, and communication with a democratic style. It can also impact decision-making because some team members may not have the right expertise to make critical decisions.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">2. Autocratic Leadership</h3>
                        <p>Also called: Authoritarian, Coercive, or Commanding Leadership</p>
                        <p>Autocratic leadership is the inverse of democratic leadership. In this leadership style, the leader makes decisions without taking input from anyone who reports to them.</p>
                        <p>This style is most useful when a business needs to control specific situations, not as a standalone leadership style.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Why this leadership style works for businesses:</h4>
                        <p>Autocratic leaders carry out strategies and directives with absolute focus. So, when a situation calls for it, an authoritative leader can make a quick best-fit decision for a business without needing to get additional input (helpful on a case-by-case basis).</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Why this leadership style is good for the team:</h4>
                        <p>This type of leadership is most effective when a company makes difficult decisions that don't benefit from additional input from others who aren't fully knowledgeable on the subject.</p>
                        <p>Responsible parties can make a decision and give employees a clear sense of direction, and it can also make up for a lack of experience on a team.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Potential challenges for leaders with an Autocratic style:</h4>
                        <p>Most organizations can't sustain such a hegemonic culture without losing employees, which can significantly lower morale and creative problem-solving.</p>
                        <p>An example of authoritative leadership gone bad could be when a manager changes the hours of work shifts for employees without consulting anyone.</p>
                        <p>Other challenges with autocratic leaders include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Intimidation</li>
                            <li>Micromanagement</li>
                            <li>Over-reliance on a single leader</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">3. Laissez-Faire Leadership</h3>
                        <p>Also called: Delegative or Hands-off Leadership</p>
                        <p>If you remember your high-school French, you'll accurately assume that laissez-faire leadership is the least intrusive form of leadership. The French term "laissez-faire" literally translates to "let them do."</p>
                        <p>Leaders who embrace it give nearly all authority to their employees and don't often interject unless the situation calls for it.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Why this leadership style works for businesses:</h4>
                        <p>Laissez-faire leaders make employees accountable for their work. This gives many employees an incentive to do their best work.</p>
                        <p>This type of leader often creates a more relaxed company culture. This makes it a good model for creative businesses like ad agencies or product design. It's also a good fit for a business with a highly-skilled team.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Why this leadership style is good for the team:</h4>
                        <p>In a young startup, for example, you might see a laissez-faire company founder who makes no major office policies around work hours or deadlines. They might put complete trust in their employees while they focus on the overall workings of running the company.</p>
                        <p>Because of this high level of trust, employees working for laissez-faire leaders feel valued. They get the information they need and use their resources and experience to meet business goals.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Potential challenges for leaders with a Laissez-Faire style:</h4>
                        <p>Although laissez-faire leadership can empower employees by trusting them to work however they'd like, there are downsides. It can limit team development and pose a challenge for new or inexperienced employees who would benefit from guidance as they get ramped up. Roles and responsibilities can also become unclear, and it can build a culture of working in silos where people might work autonomously rather than as a cohesive group.</p>
                        <p>This style can lead to overlooking critical company growth and learning opportunities, so keeping this leadership style in check is important.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">4. Strategic Leadership</h3>
                        <p>Strategic leaders sit between a company's primary operations and its growth opportunities. This form of leadership requires vision, competitive awareness, and adaptability.</p>
                        <p>These leaders accept the burden of executive interests but also ensure that working conditions are stable for everyone else.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Why this leadership style works for businesses:</h4>
                        <p>Strategic leaders tie plans for growth and strategy to how they manage a team. They ask questions, develop and execute strategies, and consider future growth. This approach supports popular business goals like:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Accountability</li>
                            <li>Productivity</li>
                            <li>Collaboration</li>
                            <li>Transparency</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Why this leadership style is good for the team:</h4>
                        <p>This is a desirable leadership style in many companies because strategic thinking supports many types of employees at once.</p>
                        <p>Strategic thinking supports many employees at once, so it's a desirable style for many companies. It encourages visualization, planning, and making the most of existing resources, and it can motivate employees.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Potential challenges for leaders with a strategic leadership style:</h4>
                        <p>Leaders who work strategically might take on too much and risk thinking too far into the future of possibilities while missing critical present-day issues. It's important to learn how to delegate with this leadership style and share the weight of decision-making.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">5. Transformational Leadership</h3>
                        <p>Transformational leaders gain the trust and confidence of their teams, encourage team members, and lead employees toward meeting company goals.</p>
                        <p>Transformational leadership also always improves upon the company's conventions and motivates employees to grow and further develop their skills.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Why this leadership style works for businesses:</h4>
                        <p>Transformational leaders can inspire their teams to think in new ways. This can help companies update business processes to improve productivity and profitability. It can also help with employee satisfaction, morale, and motivation.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Why this leadership style is good for the team:</h4>
                        <p>This is a highly encouraging form of leadership where employees are supported and encouraged to see what they're capable of.</p>
                        <p>When starting a job with this type of leader, all employees might get a list of goals to reach and deadlines for reaching them. The goals might begin quite simple, but as employees grow and meet their goals, leaders will give them more tasks and challenges to conquer as they grow with the company.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Potential challenges for leaders with a Transformational style:</h4>
                        <p>Transformational leaders can lose sight of everyone's individual learning curves in place of the company's goals. Employee burnout can also become an issue, so it's important to work with your team to update benchmarks.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">6. Transactional Leadership</h3>
                        <p>Transactional leadership is based on reward and punishment, and these managers tell employees they can expect rewards if a goal is met. A transactional leader may require more 1:1s or checkins if people aren't meeting goals.</p>
                        <p>This leadership style also assumes that teams need structure and monitoring to meet business goals and that they are reward-motivated.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Why this leadership style works for businesses:</h4>
                        <p>This style is popular in enterprise companies as it focuses on results, existing structures, and set systems of rewards or penalties. This leadership style also recognizes and rewards commitment.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Why this leadership style is good for the team:</h4>
                        <p>Transactional leaders can offer helpful clarity and structure of expectations, which can help employees feel safe because they understand expectations. Employees also have a clear view of what they get in return for meeting business goals.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Potential challenges for leaders with a transactional style:</h4>
                        <p>This style is more about using rewards to motivate and less about building relationships with employees, coaching, and developing team morale. Keeping a diverse team engaged can be hard if only some are reward-motivated, and it can lead to low creativity and fear of punishment.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">7. Coaching Leadership</h3>
                        <p>Also called: Conscious Leadership</p>
                        <p>A coaching leader focuses on identifying and nurturing the individual strengths of each member of the team and developing strategies that will enable teams to work better together.</p>
                        <p>This style is similar to strategic and democratic leadership, but it emphasizes individual employees' success.</p>
                        <p>A manager with this leadership style might help employees improve on their strengths by:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Giving them new tasks to try</li>
                            <li>Offering guidance</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Meeting to discuss constructive feedback</p>
                        <p>They might also encourage one or more team members to expand on their strengths by learning new skills from other teammates.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Why this leadership style works for businesses:</h4>
                        <p>Coaching leaders actively support skill development and independent problem-solving. They meet ambitious business goals by creating a strong company culture and add to a business's longterm vision as valuable mentors, often even after leaving a company.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Why this leadership style is good for the team:</h4>
                        <p>This leadership style can motivate employees as they feel supported on the team. It recognizes that each employee is unique and can build diverse and exciting teams where each employee offers something different.</p>
                        <p>This leader focuses on high performance, with employees that can communicate well and embrace unique skill sets to get work done.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Potential challenges for leaders with a coaching style:</h4>
                        <p>It can take a lot of time to develop employees with a coaching style, but mentoring isn't effective for every employee.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">8. Bureaucratic Leadership</h3>
                        <p>Bureaucratic leaders follow the rules. Unlike autocratic leadership, they might listen and consider the input of employees, but they might reject input that doesn't align with company policy or past practices.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Why this leadership style works for businesses:</h4>
                        <p>This style works best for larger, older, or traditional companies that are successful in their current processes. This leadership style works for these businesses because they want to maintain existing business models and processes because their current strategies are successful, and trying something new that doesn't work could waste time and resources.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Why this leadership style is good for the team:</h4>
                        <p>This leadership style can be challenging for some, but it has many benefits. It lowers the risk of favoritism and replaces it with central duties, job security, and predictability.</p>
                        <p>This clear and efficient leadership style can lead to high levels of creativity for some employees.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Potential challenges for leaders with a bureaucratic leadership style:</h4>
                        <p>Employees might not feel as controlled as autocratic leadership, but there can be a lack of freedom in how much people can do in their roles. This approach can shut down innovation and is not the right fit for companies chasing ambitious goals and quick growth.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">9. Visionary Leadership</h3>
                        <p>Also called: Affiliative Leadership</p>
                        <p>Visionary leadership focuses on future and long-term goals. This type of leader encourages collaboration, emotional intelligence, and teamwork.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Why this leadership style works for businesses:</h4>
                        <p>Visionary leaders can create a clear plan for employees to follow and execute. They are powerful and persuasive communicators, which helps them energize teams toward impactful business growth.</p>
                        <p>As the focus is on future growth, visionary leaders can forecast potential roadblocks and outline action plans, giving employees increased confidence during uncertainty or challenging times.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Why this leadership style is good for the team:</h4>
                        <p>Teams can do more and enjoy their work more if they have a vision to work toward. This type of leader offers vision statements and other tools to inspire and motivate teams to engage at work.</p>

                        <p>Visionary leaders can skip over day-to-day issues to focus on long-term ideas, missing roadblocks that could build up and cause problems in the future.
