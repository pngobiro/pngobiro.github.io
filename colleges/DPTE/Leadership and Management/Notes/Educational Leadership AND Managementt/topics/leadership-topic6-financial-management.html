                        <p>Finance management is the strategic planning and managing of an individual or organization's finances to better align their financial status to their goals and objectives. Depending on the size of a school, finance management seeks to optimize shareholder value, generate profit, mitigate risk, and safeguard the organization's financial health in the short and long term. When working with individuals, finance management may entail planning for retirement, college savings, and other personal investments.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Cycle of Financial Management</h3>
                        <p>The financial management cycle is a financial planning process critical to a company's growth and development. It includes:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Planning and budgeting</li>
                            <li>Resource allocation</li>
                            <li>Operations and monitoring</li>
                            <li>Evaluation and reporting</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Effective financial management aligned with an organization's goals and objectives can lead to greater efficiency and stability. These parts of the financial management cycle must work together to be the most effective.</p>
                        
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Planning and budgeting</strong>
                                <p>During this analytical phase in the financial management cycle, a company uses past and current financial data to set financial targets, modify objectives, and make changes to the current budget. This phase will typically involve detailed planning as well as a big picture one, meaning a company will look at day-to-day operations, long-term financial plans, and try to link financial targets to these activities.</p>
                                <p>The goal is to create a strategic financial plan for the company that aligns with objectives for the next three to five years. When setting specific budgets, a company may budget for one fiscal year at a time. A big reason for this is that a budget involves many moving parts that are subject to change by market fluctuations.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Resource allocation</strong>
                                <p>Financial managers assign value to capital resources (anything a company uses to manufacture/produce goods/services) and offer advice on allocating these resources based on criteria like projected company growth and financial goals. Resource allocation is important because it allows a company to have a long-term financial plan focused on its business objectives. Financial management professionals help companies by providing a framework for using capital resources and creating a portfolio that will generate the most revenue, given the company's financial status.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Operations and monitoring</strong>
                                <p>This phase is critical to protect against fraudulent activity, errors, compliance issues, or other variances in the allocation of funds, etc. Financial management professionals should run regular financial reviews of business operations and cash flow. These periodic reviews can help mitigate fraud and identify other issues. It is a preventative step that ensures the continuity of business operations by securing the validity and accuracy of a company's financial processes.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Evaluation and reporting</strong>
                                <p>Financial management professionals should evaluate a company's current financial management system and propose changes when necessary. Financial reports and financial data can be helpful when assessing the efficiency and success of an existing system.</p>
                                <p>Some criteria a financial management professional may consider when evaluating a financial management system include security, compliance, company data needs, and level of support needed. These criteria vary by the company's size, industry, current financial situation, and long-term goals.</p>
                                <p>Financial management professionals should be able to offer research-based suggestions that can help a company securely store and manage financial data in compliance with relevant laws and harness that data when needed.</p>
                            </li>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Financial management involves analyzing money and investments to make the right decisions for the long and short term. The goals differ depending on whether you are working with an organization or an individual. Here are some goals of financial management in an institution:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Profit maximization:</strong> When marginal cost equals marginal revenue, the institution has achieved profit maximization. This is one of the main objectives of financial management.</li>
                            <li><strong>Wealth maximization:</strong> Once an organization has achieved profit maximization, the next goal is growing wealth for stakeholders. A successful investment plan contributes significantly to the business.</li>
                            <li><strong>Company survival:</strong> Effective financial management helps institutions to avoid bankruptcy and stay in existence, which means that employees continue to have jobs and services continue to reach the market.</li>
                            <li><strong>Cash flow maintenance:</strong> While it is a short-term objective of financial management, managing cash flow keeps money available for daily expenses, including the purchase of raw materials to produce goods and the payment of utilities and salaries. Keeping enough cash on hand to pay bills and other obligations on time is essential to the reputation and credit rating of the company.</li>
                            <li><strong>Capital cost minimization:</strong> Raising capital involves spending money on interest, fees and other costs. Keeping these expenses under control contributes directly to profits.</li>
                            <li><strong>Funds estimation:</strong> Schools/Learning institutions must make the best estimate of how much money is needed to operate in the short and long term.</li>
                            <li><strong>Capital structure determination:</strong> Capital structure establishes how the institution's finances operation and growth through various sources. Financial managers determine the right mix of debt and equity to do this.</li>
                            <li><strong>Tracking liquidity and cash flow:</strong> Ensure the learning institution has enough money on hand to meet its obligations</li>
                            <li><strong>Ensuring compliance:</strong> Keep up with state, federal, and industry-specific regulations.</li>
                            <li><strong>Developing financial scenarios:</strong> These are based on the school's current state and forecasts that assume a wide range of outcomes based on possible market conditions.</li>
                            <li><strong>Manage relationships:</strong> Dealing effectively with investors and the boards of directors.</li>
                            <li><strong>Strategizing:</strong> Identifying what needs to happen financially for the learning institution to achieve its short- and long-term goals. Leaders need insights into current performance for scenario planning.</li>
                            <li><strong>Decision-making:</strong> Helping school leaders decide the best way to execute on plans by providing up-to-date financial reports and data on relevant KPIs.</li>
                            <li><strong>Controlling:</strong> Ensuring each department is contributing to the vision and operating within budget and in alignment with strategy.</li>

                        <p>Here is a brief guide to school budgeting, highlighting five critical steps in the process:</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Step 1: Review spending from the past year</h4>
                        <p>Begin by analyzing the previous year's budget and performance to gain insights into the school's spending.</p>
                        <p>The point of this is not to copy exactly what you did last year but to increase the next budget's accuracy by identifying underspends and overspends. It's an opportunity to make improvements on resource allocation.</p>
                        <p>A thorough review of the last school budget will also help you form a base template or benchmark for the new draft.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Step 2: Create a list of goals and objectives</h4>
                        <p>Make educated forecasts of your school's financial needs for the upcoming fiscal year and create a prioritized list of measurable goals.</p>
                        <p>Be sure to consider and account for the impacts that external and internal factors, such as school development aspirations, legal compliance, economic stability, and curriculum changes, may have on the school budget.</p>
                        <p>In short, every financial goal must be realistic, achievable, and in line with the school's core mission.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Step 3: Calculate existing expenditures</h4>
                        <p>Evaluate the actual costs of various expenses within the school to work out its spending capacity. Sum up all the direct expenditures, recurring expenses, technology service providers, and indirect costs, and pit them against the available funds to gauge the school's fiscal fitness.</p>
                        <p>Doing this should tell you how much wiggle room there is in the school's budget and the areas to prioritize when working with limited funds.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Step 4: Implement a strategic plan of action</h4>
                        <p>You need to understand three things when creating a financial plan: the funds available spending opportunities or expenses the budget's objectives</p>
                        <p>A plan of action brings all these variables together and translates the school budget into manageable and immediately actionable procedures.</p>
                        <p>The action plan should highlight the steps for acquiring, disbursing, and spending funds earmarked for various opportunities. It should also include operations plans and key performance indicators for all expenditures.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Step 5: Follow up</h4>
                        <p>The final step in school budgeting is evaluation.<br>
                        Follow up on the budget's implementation to make sure everything goes as planned. Check in regularly with the institution's finance department for progress reports and audits to maintain accountability for funds utilization and visibility into the financial pipelines.</p>
                        <p>The ongoing evaluation also helps you identify efficiency or accuracy improvements for the next annual budget or supplementary funding.</p>

                        <p>A school budget is a financial plan that reflects the educational goals and needs of a school or a school district.

                        <p>A supplemental budget is a budget that provides additional funding for activities or expenditures that were not adequately covered or anticipated in the original budget. A supplemental budget may be requested by state departments, agencies, or the Governor in the course of a fiscal year. The funding for a supplemental budget needs to be available from other sources, such as revenue surplus or savings.</p>
                        <p>A supplementary budget is a request by state departments and agencies for additional funding in the course of a financial year. It is meant to take care of expenditure that was not factored in during budget-making.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Today in Kenya, there are numerous ways students can fund for their higher Education programmes. We explore some of the common and most popular ways students fund for their college or university education in Kenya</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Parallel Program</strong>
                                <p>If you are rich and you can pay for your own education program, then this is the best way to go. This one also guarantees you to take the best course you want, place of study and time to study. It is also less stressing and causes minimal interruptions during study</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>HELB</strong>
                                <p>Kenya's government body HELB aka Higher Loans Education board, is the best option if you fail the one above.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Grants</strong>
                                <p>A grant is a way the government funds your ideas and projects to provide public services and stimulate the economy. Grants support critical recovery initiatives, innovative research, and many other programs listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA). A grant is one of many different forms of federal financial assistance.</p>
                                <p>However, this one picks students according to their KCSE results and may not favor average or low grade students. One big advantage of this loan is that is it easy to get and allows payment after employment of the graduate.</p>
                                <p>However, learners don't get 100% chance to pick their places of study, course and even the course to take</p>

                            <li>
                                <strong>NGAAF- National Government Affirmative Action Fund</strong>
                                <p>The National Government Affirmative Action Fund (NGAAF) which falls under the Ministry of Public Service, Youth and Gender Affairs is here to finance the students who miss on the two above.</p>
                                <p>NGAAF works as the CDF - Constituency Development Fund, including the mode of financing One big advantage of this method is that it does to allocate funds based on the KCSE score, but rather more partial and considerate.</p>
                                <p>However, the disadvantage is that one has to be already in school before can qualify to apply. Due to high competition, the allocation is not as big as the HELB or any other loan since it is based on equity for all.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>CDF- Constituencies Development Fund</strong>
                                <p>It is better known as National Government Constituencies Development Fund. CDF is more like the NGAAF, however it is only accessible to constituency level. It is easier to get this allocation than NGAAF, however the amount is rather small. CDF is sometimes dominated by political affiliations and members from other constituencies could likely miss out.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Talent Scholarship</strong>
                                <p>We have those students who are exceptionally talented in sports or other areas such as music or scouts. Such students could land an independent sponsor or even the college they want to study from with the aim of exploiting their talents.</p>
                                <p>The downside is that this method is purely based on luck, and it should not discourage you from seeking sponsorship from your talent as long as your sponsor can benefit from the talent</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Banking Scholarship</strong>
                                <p>Most of top leading banks in Kenya have university programmes for students in Kenya. The advantage of this fund is that is very lucrative and can guarantee employment in the same bank However, these banks look only for the top cream in the KCSE results, making it virtually inaccessible for average students. Popular bank scholarships include Equity Bank's Wings to Fly and KCB Bank scholarships.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>NGOs</strong>
                                <p>Famous NGOs in Kenya such as UKAID and USAID are a very good source for higher education funding.</p>
                                <p>One big hit is that the funding takes care of students needs even during holidays. It does not choose students based on top marks, but rather best and average However, the pitfall of this fund comes in hand with levels of wealth, if you are in a well off family, it is not easy to get such a funding.</p>
                                <p>It needs destitute and orphaned students on many occasions A big hit of this fund comes in handy due to availability of thousands of NGOs ready to fund for students.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Government Institutes</strong>
                                <p>Government parastatals such as KYEOP, Ajiri, NYS, TVET, and Polytechnics are a good source of funding. These comes in handy for all average students who can have their shot to excel in their career.</p>
                                <p>They are holistic and does not choose based on grades. This kind of funding is also among the top best since it teaches hand on skill courses and students can graduate within months of training and receive employment.</p>
                                <p>Some are so good that they directly employ their graduates such as NYS graduates joining police force or the army.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Self -Student Funding</strong>
                                <p>Though it looks unrealistic, this kind of funding is gradually gain popularity. Many Kenyan students whose funding sources suddenly collapsed mid their career have chosen to be fighter rather than losers.</p>
                                <p>Many will open small business or do manual works on part time basis, enough to pay for their school fees. However, it is the best kind of funding since it so stressing</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Religious Funds</strong>
                                <p>Even though it is not popular, it is so common in today world of funding in Kenya. Churches, mosques and temples are all good sources of funding for students. This kind of funding can be accessed via the information office within the church compound. The big hit of this is that it is more on equity and has high chances of getting the funds However, is very religious biased and it discriminates members who don't follow their believes, Anglican and Catholic are the leading religious groups on student funding.</p>

                        <p>When are you leaving a position, it is likely that your manager or supervisor will ask you to help in the handover period to your successor. Being organized and proactive will help to ensure that your company has a smooth transition and you leave with an excellent professional reputation.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">1. Organizing Your Handover</h4>
                        <p><strong>Discuss the handover with your manager.</strong> You should start by having a detailed discussion with your manager to determine exactly how they want you to handle the handover. Depending on your job and how your manager likes to work, you may be asked to contribute extensively to the handover. This could include the new person shadowing you for a few days or longer.</p>
                        <p>In most instances you will have to at least prepare a formal handover document.<br>
                        Discuss this with your manager and find out how much you are expected to contribute, and what the focus of your handover should be.</p>
                        <p><strong>Draw up an early outline of your handover document.</strong> Once you have a clear idea of your manager's expectations, you can start by drawing up a draft handover document. This will help you to organize yourself, and catalogue all the various tasks and pieces of information that you will need to pass on during the handover period. This document should include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Detailed information on your day-to-day activities, tasks and priorities.</li>
                            <li>An outline of the key points of the role.</li>
                            <li>A clear outline of what is expected of your successor.</li>
                            <li>A list of any essential files that will be handed over. This might include a particular contract, or work programme.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Tie up loose ends.</strong> If you know you will be leaving your post soon, it can be helpful to put in a little extra work to make sure that you tie up any loose ends. You will get a sense of satisfaction at achieving this, and you will also be helping your successor start off with a clean slate. Doing this will also help ensure that you leave on excellent terms and with a good reputation.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>This won't always be possible, but if you have something that is nearly over the line, put in a little extra work to get it done.</li>
                            <li>A new person coming into a deal right when it is near the line may struggle to get it closed, because they are unfamiliar with all its intricacies.</li>
                            <li>Let your manager and/or colleagues know what deliverables and milestones you will have completed before your last day.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Communicate with your colleagues.</strong> Before your successor is due to start, try to make some time to talk to your colleagues about the handover and ask if there is anything your colleagues think you should highlight. If there is a developing issue that you are unaware of, this is a good opportunity to touch base and find out.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Developing issues are not likely to affect your final days, but if you are aware of them then you can flag them up to your successor.</li>
                            <li>This is also a chance to make sure everyone knows you're leaving and when. Let your colleagues know about the handover period, so that they can take it into consideration.</li>
                            <li>Your productivity is likely to slow during the handover, so its good practice to give your colleagues some advance warning.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Write up a formal handover document.</strong> The final step of your handover preparation is to complete a formal handover document. You can build on the draft document, but try to elaborate and include all the important information. You will need to run through the document with your manager and any other key staff it will affect. Try to have this completed and sent to your successor at least a few days before they are set to start. The content will vary from job to job, but it may include some of the following:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>A list and timetable of actions.</li>
                            <li>A briefing of ongoing issues.</li>
                            <li>A calendar of forthcoming events and deadlines.</li>
                            <li>Passwords and login information.</li>
                            <li>A list of useful contacts.</li>
                            <li>A guide to navigating files and folders on the computer system.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">2. Managing the Handover Period</h4>
                        <p><strong>Allow as much time as possible.</strong> When your successor begins in the office, you may still be around and be asked to do a more complete handover. The length of this will vary, but in some instances you will be given a few days or longer to help the new person get to grips with the job. Generally the more time you have available for a full handover, the more information you will be able to pass on.</p>
                        <p>There are bound to be things that you forgot about, and having someone shadow you is a good way to expose them to the variety of day-to-day activity.</p>
                        <p><strong>Hand over key documents personally.</strong> During the handover, it is good practice to ensure that all the key pieces of data and documentation and handed over personally. This will help you to make sure that the most important things are dealt with appropriately and priorities are clearly set out. Handing over documents face-to-face means that complex information can be discussed fully before you leave.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>This opportunity to explain key information, and for your successor to ask you direct questions is vital for a good handover.</li>
                            <li>This will also give you an opportunity to provide nuance and context in a discussion that might have been overlooked otherwise.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Make the effort to help.</strong> If you are in the office with your successor, you should always be attentive and proactive. Make the effort to identify and help resolve any occurring issues. Your successor may be a little shy or intimidated in their first few days, and may not want to hassle you with questions.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Make sure you make it clear that you are there to help, and you welcome queries.</li>
                            <li>By doing this, you will be helping to foster a situation in which the responsibility for the handover is shared between you and your successor</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Have a final handover meeting.</strong> The last thing to do before you leave and complete the handover, is to do full handover meeting with your successor. Ask your successor to bring along any outstanding questions they have, and the notes they have made. This meeting is a great opportunity for the new person to ensure that they understand their role and responsibilities.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Any uncertainties can be cleared up in the meeting.</li>
                            <li>Depending on where you work, it might be prudent to invite your manager or supervisor to attend the meeting.</li>
                            <li>You should certainly inform your manager of when and where it is taking place, and ask them if there is anything they would like to add</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">3. Thinking of Long-Term Development</h4>
                        <p><strong>Highlight available support and training.</strong> Try to think of the handover as an opportunity for you to really contribute to giving someone the best possible chance to succeed. You are not just trying to hand off tasks and jobs, but are trying to help your successor's professional development and your former employer's long term-health.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Do this by pointing out any relevant training opportunities that you know of</li>
                            <li>Perhaps when you started the job, you received a suite of training to help you adapt and develop.</li>
                            <li>Be sure you mention this to your successor, and encourage them to explore the possibilities.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Don't neglect the working culture.</strong> If you are spending time with the person who will be filling your position, it's important not to focus solely on technical aspects of the job. Each place has a unique working environment and culture that can be intimidating or confusing for a newcomer. Be sure to set some time aside to give the new person the lowdown on how the office functions.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Make the effort to take them around the office and introduce them to everyone.</li>
                            <li>Be sure you clearly define the role of the new employee as well as existing employees.</li>
                            <li>If the job description of the new arrival is slightly different to yours, or their responsibilities and priorities are focused elsewhere, make sure existing staff recognize this.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Provide your contact details.</strong> If you really want to go the extra mile, you could provide the new employee with your contact details. You might say that they can contact you if there is a major issue or they need a little guidance. Not everyone will be happy to do this, and it is likely to depend on your relationship with your former employer.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Often a problem can be resolved with a simple email.</li>
                            <li>Offering to help out after you leave will make a good impression and help boost your reputation.</li>
