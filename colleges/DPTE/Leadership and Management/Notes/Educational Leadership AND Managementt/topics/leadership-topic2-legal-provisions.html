                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) aim to transform our world. They are a call to action to end poverty and inequality, protect the planet, and ensure that all people enjoy health, justice and prosperity. It is critical that no one is left behind.</p>
                        <p>The 17 SDGs are integrated-they recognize that action in one area will affect outcomes in others, and that development must balance social, economic and environmental sustainability.</p>
                        <p>Countries have committed to prioritize progress for those who're furthest behind. The SDGs are designed to end poverty, hunger, AIDS, and discrimination against women and girls.</p>
                        <p>The creativity, knowhow, technology and financial resources from all of society is necessary to achieve the SDGs in every context.</p>
                        <p>Eradicating poverty in all its forms remains one of the greatest challenges facing humanity. While the number of people living in extreme poverty dropped by more than half between 1990 and 2015, too many are still struggling for the most basic human needs.</p>
                        <p>As of 2015, about 736 million people still lived on less than US $1.90 a day; many lack food, clean drinking water and sanitation. Rapid growth in countries such as China and India has lifted millions out of poverty, but progress has been uneven. Women are more likely to be poor than men because they have less paid work, education, and own less property.</p>
                        <p>Progress has also been limited in other regions, such as South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, which account for 80 percent of those living in extreme poverty. New threats brought on by climate change, conflict and food insecurity, mean even more work is needed to bring people out of poverty.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Sustainable Development Goals (SDG's) and their Link to Education</h3>
                        <p>The SDGs are a bold commitment to finish what we started, and end poverty in all forms and dimensions by 2030. This involves targeting the most vulnerable, increasing basic resources and services, and supporting communities affected by conflict and climate-related disasters. The SDG 4 is coined to help in the achievement of the National Goals of Education of Kenya.</p>

                        <p>The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is universal, holistic and indivisible, with a special imperative to leave no one behind.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Establishing and implementing an inclusive education system Access to, and completion of inclusive quality education Quality early childhood development, care and pre-primary education.</li>
                            <li>Access to higher education and availability of scholarships by persons with disabilities</li>
                            <li>Acquiring skills for employment, decent jobs and entrepreneurship skills by persons with disabilities.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all - plays a central role in building sustainable, inclusive and resilient societies. Much progress was made under the Millennium Development Goals toward universal primary school enrollment; SDG 4 now aims to raise the bar and make education a catalyst for broader change toward sustainable development.</p>
                        <p>Education is a basic right and elementary to human dignity. SDG 4 also has reciprocal linkages across the 2030 Agenda.Access to quality education is an avenue for social mobility and reducing inequalities.</p>
                        <p>Education is essential for building the knowledge base we need to tackle critical challenges like climate change. Education will help youth prepare for employment in the high-skill jobs of the fourth industrial revolution.</p>
                        <p>And education is a foundation for peaceful societies and effective institutions. Education is essential for sustainable development, but investments in education that are not accompanied by concurrent progress in other aspects of human wellbeing will fall short of enabling all people to realize their full potential in life.</p>
                        <p>Good child health and nutrition are essential for securing learning outcomes - not only in terms of increased class attendance, but also for improving educational achievements. Similarly, ending poverty, thereby reducing pressures to put children to work, may be essential to universal school enrolment.</p>
                        <p>Such considerations may be especially relevant for vulnerable groups that tend to suffer from multiple deprivations and are therefore critical to realizing the overall objective of 'leaving no one behind'.</p>
                        <p>While education in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is most explicitly formulated as a stand-alone goal (SDG4), there are also a number of education-related targets and/or indicators in other sustainable development goals. These include health and well-being, gender equality, decent, responsible consumption and growth, and climate change mitigation.</p>
                        <p>Education provides the means to transmit knowledge, values and skills across generation, enabling societies to set the foundation for thriving in the future.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Requirements of Sustainable Development Goal 4 (SDG's) in Relation to Basic Education</h3>
                        <p>In 2015, world leaders agreed to 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for a safer, cleaner and more prosperous world by 2030. Now it's up to all of us to join forces to address the most pressing global challenges and turn goals into action.To accelerate progress towards the SDGs for every child, UNICEF embraces a "3As" approach: raising awareness, taking action and holding decision makers accountable for progress.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Awareness</strong>
                                <p>With the right tools and information, children and young people can play a critical role in the implementation and monitoring of the SDGs, sparking action in their communities and holding leaders to account. This is why UNICEF works to raise awareness of children's rights - educating and engaging young people on why the goals matter to their everyday lives.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Action</strong>
                                <p>With millions of children and young people becoming aware of the goals, more and more are taking action across the globe.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Accountability</strong>
                                <p>Global leaders must be held to account on commitments made. At UNICEF, we help do this in two ways:</p>
                                <ol type="a">
                                    <li>by collecting, analyzing and sharing data on children to monitor progress, and</li>
                                    <li>by bringing children's perspectives on the SDGs to decision makers to promote accountability</li>
                                </ol>
                            </li>
                            <li>Governments to place education as a priority in both policy and practice.</li>
                            <li>Lobby our governments to make firm commitments to provide free primary school education to all, including vulnerable or marginalized groups.</li>
                            <li>Encourage the private sector to invest resources in the development of educational tools and facilities</li>
                            <li>Urge NGOs to partner with youth and other groups to foster the importance of education within local communities.</li>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">The Importance of the Kenyan Constitution and how it Impacts Basic Education (Bill of Rights and its impact on Basic Education)</h3>
                        <p>The Constitution of Kenya, in Article 53 (1) (b) state that every child has a right to free and compulsory basic education and Article 55 (a) the State shall take measures, including affirmative action programmes, to ensure that the youth access relevant education and training.</p>
                        <p>The Kenyan Basic Education Act of 2013 ensures the right of all children with disabilities to free and compulsory education for the first time in Kenya. However, the Act continues to perpetuate discrimination against Kenyan children with disabilities. First, the law fails to provide reasonable accommodations in education, which amounts to disability discrimination.</p>
                        <p>Second, the law fails to ensure an inclusive education system as required by article 24 of the CRPD. While there has been some debate as to whether article 24 bans all specials schools, the Basic Education Act creates a system in which all children with disabilities are required to attend separate schools, solely based on their disability.</p>
                        <p>Although an inclusive education system may not be possible to achieve in Kenya overnight, the law does not do enough to promote equal educational opportunities for children with disabilities as required by the CRPD. At the very least, children with disabilities should be guaranteed the right to an education in the least restrictive environment, which, we argue, is possible to achieve immediately.</p>
                        <p>The right to education in the least restrictive setting ensures that children with disabilities are provided the opportunity to learn with their non-disabled peers. However, enforcing the right to education in the least restrictive environment should not be the final goal; it is only a means that will lead towards full inclusion for all children with disabilities in Kenya, as mandated by the CRPD。</p>

                        <p>Goal: To improve quality of education at all levels through competency- based curricula. The National Curriculum that was revised in 2002 laid emphasis on achievement of stated objectives (The Eight National Goals of Education). Subsequent evaluation of the curriculum has focused on the same. Whereas objectives are fundamental in all types of curricula, it is the resulting outcomes that are desired in terms of what the learner is able to do. The 8-4-4 curriculum envisaged that, based on the designed objectives, the learner would be able to exhibit behaviour commensurate with the aspects taught at each level.</p>
                        <p>The rapid technological changes demand quality education that emphasizes the importance of producing learners who can take initiative and creatively innovate products and processes that spur talents and development of values. Competence based curriculum is the ideal option for achieving this objective.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">SESSIONAL PAPER NO. 1 OF 2019 ON A POLICY FRAMEWORK</h4>
                        <p>for: Reforming Education and Training for Sustainable Development in Kenya. The Policy underscores the need for education to promote respect for and development of Kenya's rich and varied cultures. Education, training and research is a major platform for national socio-economic transformation.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">SESSIONAL PAPER NO. 1 (2005) ON A POLICY FRAMEWORK FOR EDUCATION TRAINING AND RESEARCH</h4>
                        <p>The Kenya Government through the Sessional Paper No. 1 (2005) on A Policy Framework for Education Training and Research had anticipated that in the long run, secondary education would be integrated as part of basic education. The move taken to provide subsidized secondary education aims at ensuring that children from poor households acquire quality education that enables them to access opportunities for self advancement and become productive members of society. Subsidized Secondary Education is an effort to attain EFA (Education For All)goals by 2015, by increasing transition rates from primary to secondary by 70% in 2008.</p>
                        <p>The move is quite timely since many households cannot afford to educate their children especially through the current hard economic times. The Kenya Government has undertakenfarreaching measures, such as increasing enrolment in classrooms from 40 to 45 students, tuition waiver and provision of instructional materials to targeted schools in ord er to increaseaccess, quality, equity and completion rates. However, as observed by Asayo (2009),problems are already being experienced in the provision of educational resources like shortage of teachers, overcrowded classrooms and limited materials. To achieve any meaningful gains from this programme, the exact problems of access to education by 2015, needed to be identified and addressed.</p>
                        <p>The purpose of the study was to assess the impact of Subsidized Secondary Education on access to educational resources. The study was conducted in the then Butere District. A survey design was employed in the study. Stratified and simple random sampling were used to get the sample out of the target population. Data were collected from 14 head teachers, 28 class teachers, 27 PTA members, 278 students, three AEOs and two DEOs making 352 respondents. Data collection instruments included questionnaires, interviews and observation checklists.</p>
                        <p>The instruments were piloted using test re-test method to determine their reliability which yielded a coefficient correlation of 0.64 thus the instruments were reliable. Data were organized, interpreted and analyzed using descriptive statistics such as frequency, percentages, graphs and measures of central tendency using SPSS Package. The findings of the study pointed out that student enrollment had been increasing consistently since the introduction of SSE in 2008 while the basic educational resources were available but not adequate.</p>
                        <p>The study revealed that there was delay in disbursement of funds to schools by the government, shortage of teachers, inadequate physical facilities and instructional materials and parents' negative attitude towards SSE. The researcher concluded that SSE had attracted more students to schools while the facilities were not equally improved therefore causing a strain on the educational resources in schools. The study recommends that the Kenya government disburses SSE funds promptly, posts more teachers to schools, and sensitizes parents and other stakeholders on their role in education among others. It was anticipated that the recommendations of the study would be useful by policy-makers in decision-making to improve the provision of Subsidized Secondary Education in the country.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">SESSIONAL PAPER NO. 5 OF 1978 ON EDUCATIONAL OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES</h4>
                        <h5>Education, Culture and National Development</h5>
                        <p>The Report notes that the ideals of Harambee have formed the foundation and guidelines for the continued enhancement of our national unity. It observes with satisfaction that the Government, while deeply conscious of a real threat to the nation's values, is resolutely committed to preserve and promote the ideals of democracy and the importance of the individual, the tradition of mutual social responsibility and a distinctive national culture drawn from the rich traditions of Kenya's people. It appears that our education system has not taken the necessary measures to impart these ideals of the Kenya society to the youth and to show them how the ideals relate to the rapidly changing social and economic circumstances of the country in particular and the world in general. It is reassuring, however, that the Government is committed to revive and propagate those traditional practices and values which are relevant for modem Kenya; to seek to change the attitudes of people, particularly youth, to agriculture and other occupations involving manual labour; to evolve a scheme of service for youth as a means of inculcating such values and attitudes and to introduce social ethics into the curricula of educational institutions.</p>
                        <p>The human resources of a nation determine the character and pace of its social and economic development. Financial and natural resources assist the nation in the attainment of its development objectives. But a balanced and relevant educational system helps to stimulate and facilitate the activities that constitute national development.</p>
                        <p>The Report acknowledges the fact that the Government and the people of Kenya are satisfied with the prominent role played by our educational endeavour which has helped to bring the nation's rapid economic progress since independence through the development of indigenous trained manpower. However, the enthusiasm for development of education has caused an expansion which has not been matched by a similar expansion in income-earning opportunities, resulting in too many school leavers in relation to available jobs.</p>
                        <p>Creation of productive employment remains one of the biggest challenges. Labour is plentiful in the country. Hence the efforts to develop the rural areas will be intensified to create more employment. The Report notes a weakness in science teaching. Yet science provides the necessary knowledge which underlines the development of the appropriate skills and technology required to meet the needs of mankind.</p>
                        <p>Rural development entails the totality of the processes of change aimed at enhancing the quality of life of 'the people living in the rural areas. Education for rural development must be planned and implemented as a lifelong process, of which formal schooling is only an integral part. This will mean that all the factors that underlie rural development are taken into consideration in an increasingly integrated manner in the planning and implementation of the education system. It is acknowledged that the Government has already initiated several measures through the existing rural development programme and accepts the need to intensify the integration of educational institutions with the environmental conditions in all areas. Apart from extension of primary education the programme includes agriculture, roads, rural water, health, rural works and improvement of life generally.</p>
                        <p>Education as one of the features of rural development has to compete with other services for the available but limited resources. The Report, therefore, recommends that the role of education should facilitate the process of integration of educational institutions into their immediate surroundings. Problems relating to preparation of young people for parental and other social responsibilities have arisen with the adoption of formal education. Even educated parents are increasingly unable to instruct their children adequately about their roles in society. In traditional African customs young people are expected to learn social obligations such as self-reliance, community responsibility and parenthood.</p>
                        <p>Most of Kenya is not suitable for intensive arable agriculture, and the high potential agricultural land is currently carrying very high and increasing densities of population. Priority will therefore be given to uplifting the productive capacity of land, and possible reclamation of desertland, motivation and improvement of quality of life of rural populations through investing more resources in agriculture to enable the rural people to become more effective in their endeavours.</p>
                        <p>The problem of unemployment is aggravated by the annual output of school leavers whose formal education has not equipped them with skills and qualities required by the economy. The formal qualifications demanded by the employers are rising rapidly and usually bear no functional relationship to the jobs concerned. It has been observed that urban areas generate only a small proportion of the required employment opportunities. The number of working poor people making such small incomes that they do not make any meaningful living is also rising. The school leaver fits into both unemployment and working poor categories.</p>
                        <p>It has become clear that the existing education system has not been related to the social and economic realities of the country. On the whole, the curriculum has not incorporated the teaching and learning of creative capability and has therefore tended to alienate youth against the realities of their surroundings. This in turn has created frustration by widening the gap between aspirations and achievements in wage employment in which they have put all their expectations.</p>
                        <p>A number of recommendations have been made:</p>
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li>To make general education give increasing emphasis to adaptability.</li>
                            <li>To make formal educational institutions, including primary schools, give increasing emphasis on problem-solving teaching methods that have a bearing on the real life situation of the Kenyan environment.</li>
                            <li>To promote the full development of the talents and potentialities of individuals within the context of mutual social responsibility.</li>
                            <li>To develop those being educated into useful citizens capable of, and motivated towards, contributing to the improvement of the nation as a whole as well as that of their own welfare.</li>
                            <li>To focus education on the basic needs and income-earning opportunities for the rural areas and to foster changes of social values, aspirations and motivations.</li>
                            <li>To provide for ethical education and training and for such social matters as family life education, issues of the environment, and national and international understanding.</li>
                            <li>To promote traditional practices that have educational and occupational values.</li>
                            <li>To codify and use the traditional practices which can serve as sources of basic knowledge.</li>
                            <li>To bring about a sense of dignity towards social service and productive labour through appropriately programmed activities of basic education.</li>
                            <li>To give greater rewards and incentives to crafts, fanning, productive manual work and creativity.</li>
                            <li>To make formal education include the teaching of prevocational craft-orientated skills, including small-scale business techniques, in order to encourage self-confidence, creative ability and evaluative capacity.</li>
                            <li>To encourage youth to relate the knowledge they get in education to a purpose in life.</li>
                            <li>To expose students to practical problems encountered in endeavours to develop rural areas.</li>
                            <li>To give more Government guidance on development priorities for harambee, with special emphasis on co-ordination to avoid duplication.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>The Government accepts the social, cultural and economic values enumerated in the Report and will help promote them through relevant education that imparts a sense of national and international consciousness. The role of students in society will increasingly be taught in schools since the modern parent in this transitional period, is less certain of what to impart to the child. The listed recommendations on promoting national unity, removing inequalities, adaptability instilling positive attitudes and bringing about relevant changes in education are acceptable.</p>
                        <p>The need for research is accepted by the Government in particular to help the creation of the most appropriate technology to create employment for the increasing numbers of unemployed school leavers. In this regard, it will be necessary to intensify research and development activities in such areas as arid zone agriculture, small-scale agriculture and business co-operative development, as well as the educational and social requirements for facilitating these developments.</p>
                        <p>The Government accepts that agriculture and related industries have the highest capacity for creating jobs in the rural areas and there is an urgent need to make general conditions and incomes in these areas more attractive to reduce rural-urban migration.</p>
                        <p>The Government, being aware of the importance of the rural-orientated strategy, will not only reallocate resources towards the rural areas but also restructure the pattern of incentives and rewards in favour of rural economic activities and the poorer sections of the community. A comprehensive incomes policy, which is implied by this, will also seek to reduce the present emphasis on allocating jobs and awarding promotions on the basis of formal education qualifications.</p>
                        <p>The Government also accepts the need for co-operation between all ministries and departments in areas of conservation, extension services and integrated programmes in the rural areas in order to bring about the required development.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Importance of Legal Documents in Administration of Learning Institutions</h3>
                        <p>Legal documents contain policies which are generally an intent, a set of rules and principles, adopted for ease of governance within an organization. It is fundamentally important for organizations to have implementable policies, as it forms a linking pin between the school management, teachers, students, parents, and the rule of law. An organization without policy is an organization without control.</p>
                        <p>If there are no formal policies, then organization staff at any level would have no guidance on how to make right consistent decisions. Below are the benefits of conserving and upholding the legal documents within a learning institution.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Internal Controls</strong>
                                <p>Organizational policies should serve as an important form of internal control. Policy form as a control mechanism that will effectively limit the behaviour of teaching and non-teaching staff. Instructions could be that two teachers must be involved in any assessment process, one to correct the answer script, and another to audit the sheet. Policy should always be enforced through some kind of scrutinizing mechanism, or it will be a weak internal control. School management can make life easier by creating proper internal controls that are enforceable.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Minimise Costs:</strong>
                                <p>Management always feel the need to minimise costs. This can take the form of examining the real amount of resources required for what the School actually needs, such as finding the cheapest suppliers without sacrificing quality. It can also be about limiting the financial losses that can cripple school operations, such as shortages, wastages, errors and other kinds of losses. When policies address potential sources of risk and require employees to know them, it creates awareness of the need for risk management. It is best to ensure that employees comply with company policies intended to minimise risk.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Maintain Compliance</strong>
                                <p>School policies must enable the organization to maintain a degree of accountability in the eyes of internal and external stakeholders. School has an obligation towards the law of the land. Compliance is to follow these established defined statutory procedures and practices. Educational policies are rules that are intended to help schools teach students efficiently, fairly and safely as per the regulatory norms, and the Board to which the Institution is affiliated. These terms determine how students are taught, what they are taught, how schools manage students and its personnel.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Build a Learning Culture</strong>
                                <p>Academics being the major service of a school, it is mandatory to create a learning culture by encouraging the staff to continuously add to their knowledge. This includes determining which capability each staff should acquire and creating a process for updating it throughout the year. For example, a policy to have a staff competency matrix and training need analysis for all staff must be completed before becoming eligible for the appraisal. Initially each staff learning should include a checklist of tasks, such as required training and development, work samples and formal learning instructions.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Safe Learning Environments</strong>
                                <p>Students, teachers and staff members deserve to feel physically and psychologically secure in their environment. Policies influence how safe individuals are in school. In order to create this environment, guidelines need to be developed and reinstated that establish safety standards for the physical environment and mental state of students and staff. Disciplined rules have an effect on the safety of students and staff at school level, therefore, procedures should extend beyond the classroom, frequency of fire drills, anti-bullying, and how staff should respond during a medical emergency.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Setting Goals and Establishing Productivity</strong>
                                <p>Students and teachers are the major customers of all the policies in a school. Management should establish standard rules to guide acceptable behaviour, and help create a conducive learning environment. All of these are necessary to help the institution run smoothly to ensure that students receive a quality education. In order for an institution to encourage higher learning, plans must be in place that establish goals as set forth by the school management. This is important for relating education to the community and making it responsible to the larger world. Accountability through the use of goal-oriented policies ensures productivity - thus save time, prevent confusion and unify the school.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Suspension and Expulsion</strong>
                                <p>Although the law strictly disapproves it, the school should be very careful in determining when a student should be suspended or expelled, because it can impact a child's future. Although it is common to expel students for excessive violations of school rules, this is not always a good option for dealing with behaviour problems. When a child is expelled, he may lose his desire to continue attending traditional institution and quit. Suspension policies can inadvertently discourage students from attending school, leading to a lifetime of low-paying jobs or dependency of others. For this reason, it is important to have policies that incorporate other solutions before resorting to suspension and expulsion.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Equality</strong>
                                <p>Equality in the schools is again determined by its policies. School must have guidelines requiring acts of discrimination to be reported to their administrators and to be remedied promptly. There are also rules in place to make sure that children with disabilities, or slow-learners, receive the same access to an education as other students. This ensures that everyone gets the opportunity to contribute to society and thrive economically.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Teacher Engagement</strong>
                                <p>Another important thing is that policies on teacher training and engagement should focus more on the professional continuum of teachers. Teacher engagement is the key element for teacher retention, including teacher interventions, and their continuous professional development all over their career - they are a whole and they are interconnected. A proper workplace policy also aims to guide teaching and non-teaching staff in how to perform in the school for various prohibited issues in - harassment, internet use, health and safety, and social media are just a few.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Stakeholder involvement</strong>
                                <p>Last but not the least, collaboration between all the stakeholders should be much larger. It is extremely important that everyone is involved in the policy-making, that each stakeholder has his/her role, and should be able to take that role into the process. Schools should have welldocumented and comprehensive policies and standard-operating-procedures for all the internal and external stake holders.</p>
                            </li>
                        </ol>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Having well-developed policies and rules can empower the School to:</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Help teachers and students know what is expected of them with respect to standards of behaviour and performance.</li>
                            <li>Set guidelines for decision-making in routine situations so that teachers and managers do not need to continually ask senior management what to do.</li>
                            <li>Help to adopt a consistent and clear response across the school to continually refer to situations involving any interactions between peers, students and parents.</li>
                            <li>Allow to demonstrate good faith that employees will be treated fairly and equally.</li>
                            <li>Allow to have an accepted method of dealing with complaints and misunderstandings in place to help avoid favouritism.</li>
                            <li>Set a framework for delegation of decision-making.</li>
                            <li>Give a means of communicating information to all stakeholders.</li>
                            <li>Offer protection from breaches of legislations, compliances, etc.</li>
