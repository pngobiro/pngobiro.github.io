                                <p>Teachers help their colleagues by sharing instructional resources. These might include websites, instructional materials, readings, or other resources to use with students.

                                <p>An instructional specialist helps colleagues implement effective teaching strategies. This help might include ideas for differentiating instruction or planning lessons in partnership with fellow teachers. Instructional specialists might study research-based classroom</p>

                                <p>Understanding content standards, how various components of the curriculum link together, and how to use the curriculum in planning instruction and assessment is essential to ensuring consistent curriculum implementation throughout a school.

                                <p>Classroom supporters work inside classrooms to help teachers implement new ideas, often by demonstrating a lesson, co-teaching, or observing and giving feedback. Blase and Blase (2006) found that consultation with peers enhanced teachers' self-efficacy (teachers' belief in their own abilities and capacity to successfully solve teaching and learning problems) as they reflected on practice and grew together, and it also encouraged a bias for action (improvement through collaboration) on the part of teachers.</p>

                                <p>Facilitating professional learning opportunities among staff members is another role for teacher leaders. When teachers learn with and from one another, they can focus on what most directly improves student learning. Their professional learning becomes more relevant, focused on teachers' classroom work, and aligned to fill gaps in student learning. Such communities of learning can break the norms of isolation present in many schools.</p>

                                <p>Serving as a mentor for novice teachers is a common role for teacher leaders. Mentors serve as role models; acclimate new teachers to a new school; and advise new teachers about instruction, curriculum, procedure, practices, and politics. Being a mentor takes a great deal of time and expertise and makes a significant contribution to the development of a new professional.</p>

                                <strong>School Leader</strong>
                                <p>Being a school leader means serving on a committee, such as a school improvement team; acting as a grade-level or department chair; supporting school initiatives; or representing the school on community or district task forces or committees. A school leader shares the vision of the school, aligns his or her professional goals with those of the school and district, and shares responsibility for the success of the school as a whole.</p>

                                <p>Although teachers have access to a great deal of data, they do not often use that data to drive classroom instruction. Teacher leaders can lead conversations that engage their peers in analyzing and using this information to strengthen instruction.</p>

                                <p>Teacher leaders can also be catalysts for change, visionaries who are "never content with the status quo but rather always looking for a better way" (Larner, 2004, p. 32). Teachers who take on the catalyst role feel secure in their own work and have a strong commitment to continual improvement. They pose questions to generate analysis of student learning.</p>

                                <p>Among the most important roles teacher leaders assume is that of learner. Learners model continual improvement, demonstrate lifelong learning, and use what they learn to help all students achieve.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Role of other School Personnel in a Learning Institution</h3>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">School Leaders</h4>
                        <p>School leaders are those who are involved in overseeing the operation of the school district and/or the individual school.</p>
                        <h5>Board of Education</h5>
                        <p>The board of education is ultimately responsible for most decision-making in a school. The board of education is made up of elected community members most usually consisting of five members. The eligibility requirement for a board member varies by state. The board of education generally meets once per month. They are responsible for hiring the district superintendent. They also generally take into account the recommendations of the superintendent in the decision-making process.</p>
                        <h5>Superintendent</h5>
                        <p>The superintendent oversees the daily operations of the school district as a whole. They are generally responsible for providing recommendations to the school board in a variety of areas. The superintendent's primary responsibility is handling the financial matters of the school district. They also lobby on behalf of their district with the State government.</p>
                        <h5>Assistant Superintendent</h5>
                        <p>A smaller district may not have any assistant superintendents, but a larger district may have several. The assistant superintendent oversees a specific part or parts of a school district's daily operations. For example, there may be an assistant superintendent for curriculum and another assistant superintendent for transportation. The assistant superintendent is overseen by the district superintendent.</p>
                        <h5>Principal</h5>
                        <p>The principal oversees the daily operations of an individual school building within a district. The principal is primarily in charge of overseeing the students and faculty/staff in that building. They are also responsible for building community relationships within their area. The principal is often responsible for interviewing prospective candidates for job openings within their building as well as making recommendations to the superintendent for hiring a new teacher.</p>
                        <h5>Assistant Principal</h5>
                        <p>A smaller district may not have any assistant principals, but a large district may have several. The assistant principal may oversee a specific part or parts of a school's daily operations. For example, there may be an assistant principal who oversees all student discipline either for the entire school or for a particular grade depending on the size of the school. The assistant principal is overseen by the building principal.</p>
                        <h5>Athletic Director</h5>
                        <p>The athletic director oversees all of the athletic programs in the district. The athletic director is often the person in charge of all the athletic scheduling. They also often have their hand in the hiring process of new coaches and/or the removal of a coach from their coaching duties. The athletic director also oversees the spending of the athletic department.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">School Faculty</h4>
                        <p>School faculty are employees who work more directly with students than school leaders, including teaching them, counseling them, and assisting them with any special needs.</p>
                        <h5>Teacher</h5>
                        <p>Teachers are responsible for providing the students they serve with direct instruction in the area of content in which they specialize. The teacher is expected to use the district-approved curriculum to meet state objectives within that content area. The teacher is responsible for building relationships with parents of children which they serve.</p>
                        <h5>Counselor</h5>

The benefits of classroom routines and procedures include:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Creates consistency:</strong> Students will learn what to expect when you're consistent. Routine consistency fosters a positive learning environment because the same rules apply to everyone so no one can be discriminated against or favored.</li>
                            <li><strong>Enhances behavior management:</strong> Students will learn your rules and what you do to enforce them. Enforcing your rules will increase your students' respect for you and decrease behavioral problems.</li>
                            <li><strong>Reduces classroom distractions:</strong> An established routine will lessen student movement in the classroom or direct it where you want it to go. When the students know what they're supposed to be doing, it will also reduce distractions. If someone comes to class late, they can easily catch up without disrupting the class because they know the class structure.</li>
                            <li><strong>Boosts focus and engagement:</strong> Students will become familiar with the classroom flow and what comes next, making it easier for them to be focused and engaged.</li>
                            <li><strong>Creates an effective classroom management plan:</strong> The only way for your classroom management plan to work is if you are consistent and enforce the rules. If you don't, students will think they can get away with things, which leads to behavioral problems.</li>
                            <li><strong>Makes lesson planning easier:</strong> Once you have a routine, it serves as an outline for lesson planning. It makes lesson planning easier because all you have to do is fill in the blanks based on the times you set for various subjects or activities.</li>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Office Routines</h4>
                        <p>Office routine is a planned sequence of operations for handling recurring school official activities and procedures uniformly. Office routine occupies a significant part of office system and it consists of a number of steps involved in doing a piece of work.</p>
                        <p>Employers may not feel responsible for a productive routine within the office but it is important to remember that the first few hours of the day can affect productivity for the rest of the work day. A routine at the office involving all your employees is the easiest way to keep them motivated and productive.</p>
                        <p>Employees may be resistant to having too much structure at work so keep the routine simple and straightforward. Try to encourage your employees to do the following:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Be punctual in the morning. If they arrive a little early, they have the opportunity to review the day ahead while it will also make them feel accomplished.</li>
                            <li>Have a cup of tea or coffee. Before they get into their work, encourage them to take five minutes to take a breather and settle in. They should use this time to let go of their stressful commute and anything else not work-related.</li>
                            <li>Avoid being the morning grump. Everyone has their off days but they should not bring their bad attitudes to work. A single moody employee can affect the entire office's morale.</li>
                            <li>Outline their priorities. Hold a quick meeting for everyone to outline their goals for the day and decide what their priority is, as the first few hours are the best for dealing with the most important issues. Encourage them to keep to-do lists and update them daily by ticking off their accomplishments and adding new actions. This time will also allow you as a leader to connect with your team members and set the day's tone.</li>
                            <li>Make important calls or answer urgent emails first. Emails and calls are more likely to be answered within the first few hours of the day, so do not allow projects to remain incomplete because answers were not found.</li>
                            <li>Take a break! Try to get your employees to have at least two breaks during the day: midmorning and lunch. These breaks will revitalize them for the rest of the day.</li>
                            <li>Clean up their space. Designate someone to clean up the workspace at the end of the day, tidying up, moving away stray coffee cups, clearing papers... Rotate this role between all employees: not only will the employees become aware of the mess they make but the office will be spick-and-span for the next working day.</li>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>In its broadest sense, teaching is a process that facilitates learning. Teaching is the specialized application of knowledge, skills and attributes designed to provide unique service to meet the educational needs of the individual and of society. The choice of learning activities whereby the goals of education are realized in the school is the responsibility of the teaching profession.</p>
                        <p>In addition to providing students with learning opportunities to meet curriculum outcomes, teaching emphasizes the development of values and guides students in their social relationships. Teachers employ practices that develop positive self-concept in students.</p>
                        <p>The first thing that you must know about teaching as a profession is that teaching is about inspiring and motivating students to realize and exceed their potential. The greatest teachers of all time have devoted their lives to inspiring and empowering their students to achieve great things and be good human beings.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Basic Characteristics of Teaching Profession</h3>
                        <p>Following are the basic characteristics of the teaching profession:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Teaching is an interaction between teacher and students.</li>
                            <li>Providing guidance and training to the students.</li>
                            <li>Increases the knowledge, skills, and creativity of students.</li>
                            <li>Helps in the self-development of the students.</li>
                            <li>Teachers are a source of motivation and inspiration to the students.</li>
                            <li>Teachers build confidence and increase the self-esteem of the students.</li>
                            <li>Teachers cultivate obedience and discipline in the students.</li>
                            <li>Helping the students to achieve their goals.</li>
                            <li>Develop communication skills in the students.</li>
                            <li>Teachers help in building future leaders with their guidance.</li>
                            <li>The continued professionalization of teaching is a long-standing goal of the all teachers. Teaching Associations continue to work to advance teaching as a profession. Professionalism is a complex and elusive concept; it is dynamic and fluid.</li>
                            <li>It serves a great social purpose. Teachers carry responsibilities weighted with social purpose. Through a rigid and self-imposed adherence to the Code of Professional Conduct, which sets out their duties and responsibilities, teachers pass on their accumulated culture and assist each student under their care in achieving self-realization.</li>
                            <li>There is cooperation achieved through a professional organization. Cooperation plays an important role in the development of the teaching profession because it represents a banding together to achieve commonly desired purposes. The teaching profession has won its well-deserved place in the social order through continuous cooperation in research, professional preparation and strict adherence to the Code of Professional Conduct, which obligates every teacher to treat each student within a sacred trust. Teachers have control or influence over their own governance, socialization into teaching and research connected with their profession.</li>
                            <li>There is a formal period of preparation and a requirement for continuous growth and development. Teachers are required to complete a defined teacher preparation program followed by a period of induction or internship prior to being granted permanent certification. This period includes support for the formative growth of teachers and judgments about their competence. Teachers are devoted to continuous development of their ability to deliver their service.</li>
                            <li>There is a degree of autonomy accorded the professional. Teachers have opportunities to make decisions about important aspects of their work. Teachers apply reasoned judgment and professional decision making daily in diagnosing educational needs, prescribing and implementing instructional programs, and evaluating the progress of students. Teacher judgment unleashes learning and creates the basis for experience.</li>
                            <li>The profession has control or influence over education standards, admissions, licensing, professional development, ethical and performance standards, and professional discipline. As professionals, teachers are governed in their professional relationships with other members, school boards, students and the general public by rules of conduct set out in the Association's Code of Professional Conduct. The code stipulates minimum standards of professional conduct for teachers, but it is not an exhaustive list of such standards.</li>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Qualities of a Good Teacher</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Good Teachers Are Strong Communicators.</strong>
                                <p>When it comes to effective teaching, strong communication skills are a must, By communicating with students at the beginning of the year about how math applies to their favorite hobbies, sports and future careers, the teacher and his students are able to approach the subject in a more enjoyable way that better supported their learning.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Good Teachers Listen Well.</strong>
                                <p>Great communication doesn't stop when the teacher is done talking. Listening well is one of the most important skills needed to be a teacher.</p>
                                <p>Teachers that are skilled in listening and observing often pick up on what isn't being said, such as any anxieties a student may have, and can then help the student build their skills and confidence levels.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Good Teachers Focus on Collaboration.</strong>
                                <p>Working in education means you're never truly working alone. From paraprofessionals and teaching assistants to other classroom teachers and school leaders, working as a teacher often means working effectively in a group. It's also important to keep an open mind and learn from other educators.</p>
                                <p>The key to success in this kind of environment, is the ability to collaborate. You really need to be able to fill various roles in order to collaborate effectively. If you already have someone on your team who is going to be the one to critique all of the suggestions made, then you don't need to join in on that. Instead, maybe you need to be the person who is going to come up with creative ideas. You need to have that flexibility.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Good Teachers Are Adaptable.</strong>
                                <p>Effective teachers need to be able to work in a constantly evolving environment and adjust their teaching methods based on the age of their students, the resources available and changing curriculum, practices and requirements. "Change is a constant," she said. "Learning how to adapt and adjust, that's been one of the skills that's been most helpful in my career. It's about keeping my finger on the pulse of who my students are over time and all the trends, standards and new research, and being able to continually improve."</p>
                                <p>Adaptability is also one of the key skills needed to be a teacher who may be educating students of varying grade levels or different learning styles. "You have to be able to adapt based upon your audience,"</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Good Teachers Are Engaging.</strong>
                                <p>Being able to engage students with humor, creative lessons and a strong classroom presence is an important part of what makes someone a good teacher. If you were to envision that teacher that you would want in your life, even now, you're going to want someone who is very engaging in front of the classroom.</p>
                                <p>A good teacher will perform for their students to keep them going... It's not about sitting back and just lecturing, it's about engaging in the work. What an engaging teacher looks like will vary depending on grade level and subject matter.</p>
                                <p>In kindergarten, an engaging teacher might be one who gets down on the floor to do activities with their students on their level. In high school, an engaging teacher may be one who thinks outside the box, adds humor to their lessons and finds creative ways to bring learning into the real world.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Good Teachers Show Empathy.</strong>
                                <p>Another key to engaging students and improving their learning is to treat each student as an individual, by being empathetic and understanding to what may be going on in their lives. "We need to take a moment to think back and think about what could be going on in this student's life," he said. "It's so important to be observant, attentive, and empathetic and always have a positive attitude."</p>
                                <p>Something that may be easy for one student may not be so easy for someone else. Everyone learns differently, whether it be faster or slower than normal, learns better by writing, reading or hands-on. Teachers need to always keep this in mind and always pay close attention to ensure each student is on the track they need to be.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Good Teachers Have Patience.</strong>
                                <p>No matter what grade level you're teaching, your patience will be tested while working as an educator. Whether you're managing classroom behavior, working with colleagues with different views, or communicating student issues or progress with parents, patience is one of the most important skills to practice as a teacher.</p>
                                <p>More often than not you actually have to have more patience with the parents than you do with the students. Parents are coming in with their perceptions of what happened to them when they were students or previous experiences that may have been detrimental to their child... You have to be patient and understanding of them</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Good Teachers Value Real-World Learning.</strong>
                                <p>Teachers who bring their students' learning into the real world are often some of the most engaging. But it's important for teachers to bring their own learning into the real world, too.</p>
                                <p>One of the best preparations for effective teaching is to ensure that education students get plenty of classroom experience. They spend time at a local school once a week to collaborate with teacher partners and apply their learning to the classroom. A year-long student teaching experience is also a powerful way to ensure soon-to-be teachers have the time to hone their teaching skills. "Our students have that benefit of seeing the practical application (of) what they're learning in the moment they're learning it," she said.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Good Teachers Share Best Practices.</strong>
                                <p>A willingness to share knowledge and experiences with others is one of the most important qualities of a good teacher.</p>
                                <p>Education is a hands-on field and often requires experimentation within the classroom to discover which methods of communicating with students work best. Part of being an effective teacher is sharing your findings and best practices with others in the field.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Good Teachers Are Lifelong Learners.</strong>
                                <p>One of the key skills needed to be a good teacher is a dedication to continued education and a love of learning. Whether you're learning more about your subject area, learning new methods of communication or even exploring how to bring more technology into your classroom, continuing to expand your own knowledge is key to expanding that of your students. "No matter your education level, you can learn something from everyone you encounter, including fellow educators as well as students," she said. "Being willing to continually add tools to your toolbox - even unconventional ones at times - will keep things new and exciting, as well as giving you excellent skills."</p>

                                <p>As mentioned, teachers have the added responsibility of shaping future generations. More often than not students look up to teachers and get inspired by the things that they say and do. Teachers have an opportunity to make a difference. As a teacher, you will have the unique opportunity to steer a mass in the right direction. This need not be huge things. You can teach them to be responsible and sensible citizens. For instance, you can throw light on things that matter such as climate change, marine life, and likewise.</p>

When you are in an environment that asks a lot of questions and is inquisitive, you grow and develop each day. You get to polish your skills and techniques. For instance, teachers across the globe are familiar with online teaching now. It is the sudden development that urges teachers to upskill themselves. There are a lot of teaching blogs that help teachers to upskill and polish themselves.</p>

                                <p>As learning has no boundaries, one can never stop learning. In the teaching profession also, the teacher can learn at any stage and age too. Even R.N.

                                <p>The teaching profession makes one multi-tasker; in spite of teaching academics to students, teachers, and Organizational skills. Being organized means one can manage time and resources efficiently and effectively for better productivity.</p>

                        <p>A teachers' union is a special type of labor union designed to fight for the rights of educators. These organizations play critical roles not only in securing benefits for teachers but also shaping the way education works.</p>
                        <p>The teachers' unions' purpose is to help them; they aim to achieve proper functioning of the education system. These unions are made up of people interested in and passionate about education. Teachers have limited opportunities to develop and little influence to change this, so they need a meaningful and independent voice at the level of policy and practice, labor carried out by unions, to make a significant change and solve your working conditions and professional learning needs.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">IMPORTANCE/PURPOSE OF FORMING TRADE UNIONS: Influence of the Trade Unions on the Teaching Profession</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Developing a negotiation plan focused on social dialogue so that the voice of teachers is heard.</li>
                            <li>Ensure access to professional development is provided to meet the need to train educators.</li>
                            <li>Help build the narrative about public education, which supports changing how people view investment in education resources.</li>
                            <li>Developing an extended bargaining agenda: the importance of social dialogue. Building professional issues into social dialogue processes ensures that teachers have a genuine independent voice to represent them and that contractual safeguards embed and protect teachers' rights to professional development.</li>
                            <li>Meeting teachers' professional needs: educating the educators. Education trade unions play a key role in ensuring teachers' access to professional development by providing professional learning opportunities independently or in partnership with others.</li>
                            <li>Facilitating self-organising. Engagement in teachers' professional needs opens up opportunities for self-organising in which union members work together to identify and address their own professional needs. Such approaches support individual teachers but also help build the collective capacity of the union organisation.</li>
                            <li>Shaping the discourse about quality education and support for the teaching profession. Education trade unions act as advocates for quality education and investment in education as a public good. This work performs a vital role in framing the narrative about public education and can help shift popular thinking about investment in the resources required to address the problems identified in this report.</li>
                            <li>Building alliances and developing partnerships. Education trade unions work with a wide range of governmental and non-governmental bodies to ensure teachers' professional needs are addressed</li>
                            <li>Supporting teachers' career and professional development. Professional development is vital to career progression and therefore a central trade union concern.</li>
                            <li>Unions as the teachers' voice at work. Union members expect the union to be their voice on all the key issues that impact them in their daily work as teachers. There is no simple separation between 'industrial' and 'professional' issues - a teacher's experience of work is invariably a mixture of both. Unions exist to give voice to employees in relation to the totality of their experience as workers.</li>
                            <li>Building and strengthening the union. A focus on professional issues enables unions to engage members who otherwise might not participate in union activity. Developing member engagement and connections builds union identity amongst the membership and strengthens the organisation. Such work develops the activist base of the union.</li>
                            <li>Enhanced teachers' good working conditions help in enhancing service delivery and hence good performance.</li>
                            <li>Satisfaction with the working conditions</li>
                            <li>Positive association between union membership and teachers' and principals' satisfaction with working conditions.</li>
