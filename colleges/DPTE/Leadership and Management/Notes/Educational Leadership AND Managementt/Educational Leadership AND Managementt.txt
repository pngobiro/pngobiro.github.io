\section*{TOPIC 1: EDUCATIONAL LEADERSHIP AND MANAGEMENT}

\section*{Instructional leadership is leadership that supports the development of teaching and} learning. It is referred to using different names including pedagogical leadership, learningcentred leadership, leadership for learning, and student-centred leadership. These terms can be considered under the broad umbrella of instructional leadership and represent the specific and focused practices in which school leaders engage to intentionally support the development of effective teaching and learning in schools.

What is unique about instructional leadership is that, first and foremost, it is tightly connected to the work of improving learning for students. Leadership is complex work and can have a range of purposes. For example, some leadership tasks may be primarily managerial and not directed towards improving learning and teaching. The motivation for instructional leadership is the improvement of instruction
- A strong focus on learning
- Developing teaching and learning objectives
- Holding high expectations of students
- Creating and supporting student learning goals
- Monitoring learner progress
- Protecting instructional time
- Coordinating curriculum
- Providing instructional support
- Supporting teacher learning

Instructional leadership can be conceptualised as leadership practice that supports effective teaching and learning and provides guidance and direction for instructional improvement, by buffering teachers from distraction, providing material resources and psychological support, and promoting professional learning are all examples of close-to-theclassroom instructional leadership practices.

The effect of instructional leadership comes from the establishment of processes, tools, and a learning culture in which the work of effective teaching can happen.

International research metanalyses reveal that instructional leadership has a positive influence on student achievement. Understanding how instructional leadership impacts on student achievement is the key challenge because leadership typically has an indirect effect on student achievement.

Student learning mainly happens in classrooms where teachers have the biggest effect on their learning, but leadership has the second largest effect. Principal instructional leadership impacts on student achievement through strategies that affect what happens in classroom.

\section*{Who is responsible for instructional leadership?}

Instructional leadership is distributed through networks of influence in and across schools. While the principal and senior leadership team have an important and central role in instructional leadership, it is also clear that middle leaders and other teachers who have responsibility for teaching and learning beyond their own classroom play a key role in instructional leadership in schools. Distributed or shared leadership are terms used to describe the network of both formal and informal sources of influence within a school.

Distributed leadership doesn't mean that anyone and everyone is a leader, but that leadership is situated through a web of influence in a school based on expertise and influence. For example, if you were to walk into a school and ask teachers who they go to for advice on curriculum issues, it is likely that a few key names would emerge. Those named may be people who don't hold 'positional' leadership roles such as principal or deputy principal, but who exercise
influence and contribute to instructional leadership within the school due to their specific expertise and the willingness of others to seek out their advice.

When we consider what instructional and distributed leadership means, the concept of teacher leadership comes readily to mind. Teacher leaders are ideally situated to provide instructional leadership within a distributed network of influence within and even across schools and networks of schools. Recognizing that many people in a school can contribute to instructional leadership enables one of its key features, which is leading collective work to improve instruction.

\section*{Purpose/Importance of Instructional Leadership}

Instructional leadership is the most effective type of leadership practice for improving student learning outcomes.
1. Is correlated with higher teacher efficacy
2. Contributes to creating a strong learning culture
3. Creates coherence
4. Reduces teacher isolation
5. Increases teacher collaboration
6. Creates a shared focus on student learning goals
7. Provides structures to support collaborative inquiry
8. Instructional leadership is an important concept for our schools because it provides a framework that can be used to evaluate current approaches and practices of leadership.
9. It can also be used to inform possible changes in direction so that leadership practices may be introduced or further developed to enhance the quality of teaching and learning in the school.
10. Syntheses of international research on educational leadership concur that instructional leadership has demonstrated the strongest impact on student learning.
11. A number of large international studies have shown that, even after controlling for other variables such as school context and student demographics, principal instructional leadership accounts for a significant amount of variance in student achievement.
12. In addition, these metanalyzes that compare different leadership practices indicate instructional leadership to be the most effective in improving student achievement across a range of school contexts and levels.
13. Simply put, the instructional leadership practices of leaders and teachers in schools increases student achievement by improving teaching and learning in the school.
14. By understanding some of the strategies of instructional leadership, the focus of these tasks can be better aligned with research-informed practices that promote improvement.
15. Effective instructional leaders direct their attention and actions towards ensuring all components within the educational system support the learning of students. There are several 'close to the classroom' practical strategies that enable this.

\section*{Practical strategies and approaches Instructional leadership/ Functions of instructional leader in a school}

Instructional leadership research findings can inform how to prioritize leadership time and tasks to improve teaching and learning in your school. Researchers have identified a range of different ways to represent the strategies and approaches of instructional leadership. As you read these strategies, bear in mind that current research demonstrates that it is more than just the instructional leadership of the principal that matters - the instructional leadership of others in the school is also very important.

The following key strategies and approaches are from research. Some of these strategies are more relevant to the principal, while others are more relevant to senior leadership, middle leadership and other teachers in the school who provide leadership beyond the classroom. Where these sit will depend on the context and structure of the school.
(i) Establishing and supporting the achievement of goals

Schools sometimes have too many goals and this can get in the way of staff gaining sufficient focus and momentum to create improvement for students. Instructional leaders prioritize a few key goals and create focus, resources and support so that these can be achieved. In addition to creating coherence across goals, instructional leaders buffer their staff from distractions. They also avoid tasks themselves that distract from the main purpose of their work and the achievement of these goals. Instructional leaders have an important role in holding high expectations of students and staff, and in listening to them and responding to their needs to enable the achievement of valued goals. Creating coherence is an important part of planning as schools that try to do too much without a coherent focus can struggle to be effective.
(ii) Monitoring and responding to student progress

Monitoring student progress is central to effective instructional leadership. This will look different across contexts and levels: for example, the way that data or information are collected and used with a class of five-year olds will look quite different to a Year 13 class. However, the purpose remains the same, which is to create data systems and support teachers in interpreting and using data to make decisions that support the learning and development of students. By creating systems, using data to track student achievement, and supporting teachers to interpret and use data, instructional leaders support teachers to make informed decisions about how to meet the needs of their students.

\section*{(iii) Supporting teacher and leader learning}

Promoting professional learning and development is a central strategy of instructional leadership.

Effective instructional leadership provides professional learning for teachers and leaders that is focused on what they need to know and do in order to support student learning. Rather than simply engaging with the latest and most popular (or affordable) professional development programme on offer, professional learning needs to be intentionally designed to create coherence and address the learning needs of teachers in relation to their specific students and context. Effective instructional leaders participate in the professional learning of their teachers and also in professional learning to support their own leadership. Holding an inquiry stance and promoting collaborative inquiry amongst staff are both very important in supporting teacher and leader learning.

\section*{(iv) Evaluating curriculum and pedagogy}

The role of the principal and other key leaders is central in improving teaching through practices such as observing in classrooms and engaging in conversations and feedback with teachers. This assumes that the leader will have in-depth knowledge about curricular content and pedagogy. In some schools this is possible, although in larger schools or secondary schools it poses more of a challenge. Secondary principals cannot be expected to provide substantive in-depth feedback
on curriculum and pedagogy across multiple disciplines, so the focus must be how senior leaders can create systems that enable middle leaders and others with expertise to engage in observations and feedback.

\section*{(v) Ensuring a supportive learning environment}

Strong instructional leadership creates a supportive learning environment for students, teachers, and leaders. Creating a safe and orderly learning environment for students includes creating systems so that students feel safe, providing a caring environment and ensuring high expectations for social behaviour. Creating a supportive and collaborative learning environment for teachers and leaders is important as evidence shows that teacher collaboration can have a positive effect on student achievement ${ }^{\text {tiii }}$. Encouraging teachers to collaborate can create collective responsibility in the school which means teachers and leaders work together and have a shared sense of responsibility for students beyond those in their own class. Ensuring a supportive learning environment for students and staff can enable a learning culture where ongoing learning is central for everyone in the school.

Strategic resourcing is an important aspect of all of these strategies. Providing the conditions and resources needed for effective learning and teaching is central to the role of instructional leadership. These strategies are all intended to ensure high quality teaching. However, a list like this can raise questions.

\section*{Instructional Leadership Skills}

Instructional leadership skills are the traits possessed by effective educational leaders to inspire action and optimism. These leaders set an example for others by treating people fairly and making an impression with their honesty and integrity. Effective leaders are supportive of those around them and provide inspiration to achieve individual and collective goals. They use their excellent communication skills to gather feedback, ask for ideas and make informed decisions regarding the processes of the educational institutions they run.Some specific skills related to instructional leadership include:

\section*{1. Communication skills}

Verbal and written communication skills are essential to leadership success. An instructional leader must be able to effectively communicate their intentions regarding students' education. This may involve emails and other written communication, or it could mean holding meetings with teachers to set goals and assess lesson plans.

\section*{2. Effective planning}

An instructional leader's ability to research and provide necessary resources improves learning and allows teachers to be more effective at their jobs. For example, a principal may adopt new technology for teaching tools and for overseeing staff initiatives, and this process requires planning. Instructional leaders must be able to maintain a balance between procedure and adaptability to support creativity and innovative teaching in their schools.

\section*{3. Trustworthiness}

A positive and fair leader easily earns the trust of their staff, allowing the staff to look to the leader in good times as well as challenging times. A good instructional leader can remain calm and fair during a discussion where people present opposing ideas, weighing the merits and drawbacks of each while gathering feedback from other members of staff who would be affected by any changes in plans. An instructional leader's balanced judgment leads their teachers to trust and respect them, and this trust helps build a united educational community.

\section*{4. Competence}

Teachers rely on instructional leaders for information associated with instructional methods, current trends in education and other pertinent news related to effective teaching. Additionally, principals are expected to be a visible representation of positivity and transparency in the institution, leading by example and focusing on important learning objectives to promote innovations in teaching.

\section*{5. Team building and collaboration}

As the role ultimately responsible for the success of a school, an instructional leader must be adept at uniting the staff and students to further the creation of new ideas and teaching methods.

They must be able to create a dependable team that works together to create a more effective and positive learning environment.

\section*{6. Optimism}

Staff and students often adopt the disposition of their leader, so an instructional leader must maintain a positive attitude regardless of their current situation. The more upbeat and excited a leader is, the more this attitude spreads to teachers and students, creating an overall environment of positivity. This is also true when providing encouragement, rewarding a good job and focusing on the success and happiness of teachers, students and the institution as a whole.

\section*{7. Interaction with parents}

Instructional leaders recognize the importance of a parent's role in the success of their child and the cumulative effect on the success of the school. Principals can identify family members as a critical resource for important events such as fundraisers and extracurricular activities. To get parents excited about participating in these events, principals sometimes choose to host workshops or meetings so that parents can become familiar with each other as well as with teachers and school policies. It also provides them with opportunities to offer their input and ideas to improve the learning environment for their children

\section*{PLANNING}

For education to play its key role in the transformation of a nation, it needs to be adequately and effectively planned because a faulty educational planning can jeopardize the development of a nation for decades.

Planning means deciding in advance what is to be done, when to do it, where to do it, how to do it and who is to do it in order to achieve predetermined goals and objectives.

Educational planning on the other hand involves a systematic and scientific set of decisions for future action with the aim of achieving set educational goals and objective through optimal use of scarce resources.

This implies that educational planning provides the tool for coordinating and controlling the direction of the different components of an educational enterprise so that educational objectives can be achieved.

\section*{The purpose of planning in a learning institution}

In any country, educational planning is necessitated by varied reasons which include among others:
- The desire of government to meet the yearnings
- To cater for the needs and aspirations of the citizenry
- The demand for education and access to education
- Provide quality education to the people
- To respond to technological development
- To ensure global competitiveness and more importantly
- To actualize government political philosophy.

\section*{Leadership Styles}

Knowing your leadership styles may help you improve with limited feedback. Each leadership style has its pitfalls, allowing you to proactively address areas of improvement. This is critical because some employees might hesitate to speak up, even in an anonymous survey.

Knowing your leadership style helps you provide adequate guidance and feedback to employees, and better understand your thoughts, how you make decisions and strategies you can consider implementing when making business decisions.

It can also help you understand how your direct reports see you and why they may give you specific feedback. For example, if employees feel stifled at work and don't have many opportunities to speak their minds, they may be telling you that you're an autocratic leader who can benefit from changing their style.

Knowing your leadership styles may help you improve with limited feedback. Each leadership style has its pitfalls, allowing you to proactively address areas of improvement. This is critical because some employees might hesitate to speak up, even in an anonymous survey.
1. Democratic Leadership
2. Autocratic Leadership
3. Laissez-Faire Leadership
4. Strategic Leadership
5. Transformational Leadership
6. Transactional Leadership
7. Coaching Leadership
8. Bureaucratic Leadership
9. Visionary Leadership
10. Pacesetting Leadership
11. Situational Leadership

\section*{1. Democratic Leadership}

Also called: Participative or Facilitative Leadership
Democratic leadership is exactly what it sounds like - the leader makes decisions based on each team member's input. Although a leader makes the final call, each employee has an equal say in a project's direction.

\section*{Why this leadership style works for institutions:}

This leadership style resembles how leaders often make decisions in company board meetings.

For example, a democratic leader might give the team a few decision-related options in a company board meeting. They could then open a discussion about each option. After a discussion, this leader might consider the board's thoughts and feedback, or they might open this decision up to a vote.

Why this leadership style is good for the team:

The democratic leadership style is one of the most effective because it encourages everyone to participate in all processes, share their opinions, and know that you will hear them. It also encourages employees to be engaged because they know you will hear their feedback.

Team members feeling like they have space to participate can also increase employee empowerment, motivation, and participation.

\section*{Potential challenges for leaders with a Democratic style:}

Reaching a consensus can take considerable time, resources, and communication with a democratic style. It can also impact decision-making because some team members may not have the right expertise to make critical decisions.

\section*{2. Autocratic Leadership}

Also called: Authoritarian, Coercive, or Commanding Leadership

Autocratic leadership is the inverse of democratic leadership. In this leadership style, the leader makes decisions without taking input from anyone who reports to them.

This style is most useful when a business needs to control specific situations, not as a standalone leadership style.

\section*{Why this leadership style works for businesses:}

Autocratic leaders carry out strategies and directives with absolute focus. So, when a situation calls for it, an authoritative leader can make a quick best-fit decision for a business without needing to get additional input (helpful on a case-by-case basis).

\section*{Why this leadership style is good for the team:}

This type of leadership is most effective when a company makes difficult decisions that don't benefit from additional input from others who aren't fully knowledgeable on the subject.

Responsible parties can make a decision and give employees a clear sense of direction, and it can also make up for a lack of experience on a team.

\section*{Potential challenges for leaders with an Autocratic style:}

Most organizations can't sustain such a hegemonic culture without losing employees, which can significantly lower morale and creative problem-solving.

An example of authoritative leadership gone bad could be when a manager changes the hours of work shifts for employees without consulting anyone.

Other challenges with autocratic leaders include:
- Intimidation
- Micromanagement
- Over-reliance on a single leader

\section*{3. Laissez-Faire Leadership}

Also called: Delegative or Hands-off Leadership

If you remember your high-school French, you'll accurately assume that laissez-faire leadership is the least intrusive form of leadership. The French term "laissez-faire" literally translates to "let them do."

Leaders who embrace it give nearly all authority to their employees and don't often interject unless the situation calls for it.

\section*{Why this leadership style works for businesses:}

Laissez-faire leaders make employees accountable for their work. This gives many employees an incentive to do their best work.

This type of leader often creates a more relaxed company culture. This makes it a good model for creative businesses like ad agencies or product design. It's also a good fit for a business with a highly-skilled team.

\section*{Why this leadership style is good for the team:}

In a young startup, for example, you might see a laissez-faire company founder who makes no major office policies around work hours or deadlines. They might put complete trust in their employees while they focus on the overall workings of running the company.

Because of this high level of trust, employees working for laissez-faire leaders feel valued. They get the information they need and use their resources and experience to meet business goals.

\section*{Potential challenges for leaders with a Laissez-Faire style:}

Although laissez-faire leadership can empower employees by trusting them to work however they'd like, there are downsides. It can limit team development and pose a challenge for new or inexperienced employees who would benefit from guidance as they get ramped up. Roles and responsibilities can also become unclear, and it can build a culture of working in silos where people might work autonomously rather than as a cohesive group.

This style can lead to overlooking critical company growth and learning opportunities, so keeping this leadership style in check is important.

\section*{4. Strategic Leadership}

Strategic leaders sit between a company's primary operations and its growth opportunities. This form of leadership requires vision, competitive awareness, and adaptability.

These leaders accept the burden of executive interests but also ensure that working conditions are stable for everyone else.

\section*{Why this leadership style works for businesses:}

Strategic leaders tie plans for growth and strategy to how they manage a team. They ask questions, develop and execute strategies, and consider future growth. This approach supports popular business goals like:
- Accountability
- Productivity
- Collaboration
- Transparency

\section*{Why this leadership style is good for the team:}

This is a desirable leadership style in many companies because strategic thinking supports many types of employees at once.

Strategic thinking supports many employees at once, so it's a desirable style for many companies. It encourages visualization, planning, and making the most of existing resources, and it can motivate employees.

\section*{Potential challenges for leaders with a strategic leadership style:}

Leaders who work strategically might take on too much and risk thinking too far into the future of possibilities while missing critical present-day issues. It's important to learn how to delegate with this leadership style and share the weight of decision-making.

\section*{5. Transformational Leadership}

Transformational leaders gain the trust and confidence of their teams, encourage team members, and lead employees toward meeting company goals.

Transformational leadership also always improves upon the company's conventions and motivates employees to grow and further develop their skills.

\section*{Why this leadership style works for businesses:}

Transformational leaders can inspire their teams to think in new ways. This can help companies update business processes to improve productivity and profitability. It can also help with employee satisfaction, morale, and motivation.

\section*{Why this leadership style is good for the team:}

This is a highly encouraging form of leadership where employees are supported and encouraged to see what they're capable of.

When starting a job with this type of leader, all employees might get a list of goals to reach and deadlines for reaching them. The goals might begin quite simple, but as employees grow and meet their goals, leaders will give them more tasks and challenges to conquer as they grow with the company.

\section*{Potential challenges for leaders with a Transformational style:}

Transformational leaders can lose sight of everyone's individual learning curves in place of the company's goals. Employee burnout can also become an issue, so it's important to work with your team to update benchmarks.

\section*{6. Transactional Leadership}

Transactional leadership is based on reward and punishment, and these managers tell employees they can expect rewards if a goal is met. A transactional leader may require more $1: 1 \mathrm{~s}$ or checkins if people aren't meeting goals.

This leadership style also assumes that teams need structure and monitoring to meet business goals and that they are reward-motivated.

\section*{Why this leadership style works for businesses:}

This style is popular in enterprise companies as it focuses on results, existing structures, and set systems of rewards or penalties. This leadership style also recognizes and rewards commitment.

\section*{Why this leadership style is good for the team:}

Transactional leaders can offer helpful clarity and structure of expectations, which can help employees feel safe because they understand expectations. Employees also have a clear view of what they get in return for meeting business goals.

\section*{Potential challenges for leaders with a transactional style:}

This style is more about using rewards to motivate and less about building relationships with employees, coaching, and developing team morale. Keeping a diverse team engaged can be hard if only some are reward-motivated, and it can lead to low creativity and fear of punishment.

\section*{7. Coaching Leadership}

Also called: Conscious Leadership

A coaching leader focuses on identifying and nurturing the individual strengths of each member of the team and developing strategies that will enable teams to work better together.

This style is similar to strategic and democratic leadership, but it emphasizes individual employees' success.

A manager with this leadership style might help employees improve on their strengths by:
- Giving them new tasks to try
- Offering guidance

Meeting to discuss constructive feedback

They might also encourage one or more team members to expand on their strengths by learning new skills from other teammates.

\section*{Why this leadership style works for businesses:}

Coaching leaders actively support skill development and independent problem-solving. They meet ambitious business goals by creating a strong company culture and add to a business's longterm vision as valuable mentors, often even after leaving a company.

\section*{Why this leadership style is good for the team:}

This leadership style can motivate employees as they feel supported on the team. It recognizes that each employee is unique and can build diverse and exciting teams where each employee offers something different.

This leader focuses on high performance, with employees that can communicate well and embrace unique skill sets to get work done.

\section*{Potential challenges for leaders with a coaching style:}

It can take a lot of time to develop employees with a coaching style, but mentoring isn't effective for every employee.

\section*{8. Bureaucratic Leadership}

Bureaucratic leaders follow the rules. Unlike autocratic leadership, they might listen and consider the input of employees, but they might reject input that doesn't align with company policy or past practices.

\section*{Why this leadership style works for businesses:}

This style works best for larger, older, or traditional companies that are successful in their current processes. This leadership style works for these businesses because they want to maintain
existing business models and processes because their current strategies are successful, and trying something new that doesn't work could waste time and resources.

\section*{Why this leadership style is good for the team:}

This leadership style can be challenging for some, but it has many benefits. It lowers the risk of favoritism and replaces it with central duties, job security, and predictability.

This clear and efficient leadership style can lead to high levels of creativity for some employees.

\section*{Potential challenges for leaders with a bureaucratic leadership style:}

Employees might not feel as controlled as autocratic leadership, but there can be a lack of freedom in how much people can do in their roles. This approach can shut down innovation and is not the right fit for companies chasing ambitious goals and quick growth.

\section*{9. Visionary Leadership}

Also called: Affiliative Leadership

Visionary leadership focuses on future and long-term goals. This type of leader encourages collaboration, emotional intelligence, and teamwork.

\section*{Why this leadership style works for businesses:}

Visionary leaders can create a clear plan for employees to follow and execute. They are powerful and persuasive communicators, which helps them energize teams toward impactful business growth.

As the focus is on future growth, visionary leaders can forecast potential roadblocks and outline action plans, giving employees increased confidence during uncertainty or challenging times.

\section*{Why this leadership style is good for the team:}

Teams can do more and enjoy their work more if they have a vision to work toward. This type of leader offers vision statements and other tools to inspire and motivate teams to engage at work.

\section*{Potential challenges for leaders with a visionary style:}

Visionary leaders can skip over day-to-day issues to focus on long-term ideas, missing roadblocks that could build up and cause problems in the future. Another common challenge is hyper-focus on a single goal, which can impact consideration for other ideas that may be just as valuable to the business.

\section*{10. Pacesetting Leadership}

A pacesetting leader sets ambitious standards and expects employees to meet those goals in the exact manner they've laid out. These leaders expect productivity and high-quality outputs from employees, and they may step in to ensure things are done correctly and on time.

\section*{Why this leadership style works for businesses:}

This type of leader sets ambitious goals with a clear and focused effort, so employees know exactly what is expected of them. For example, pacesetting sales leaders set and exceed ambitious quarterly sales cadences.

These leaders might also work alongside their team and push performance, boosting team morale.

\section*{Why this leadership style is good for the team:}

Skilled and experienced teams often thrive under this kind of leader. They use the abilities of motivated and competent team members and make meeting goals feel urgent and exciting.

It can also be gratifying for team members to see their leader working hard alongside them.

\section*{Potential challenges for leaders with a pacesetting style:}

Pacesetting leaders can sometimes create a high-stress workplace environment if goals are unrealistic, which can overwhelm and demotivate teams. This can impact engagement and lead to burnout, where people struggle to meet goals and perform as expected.

Focusing on goals can also stifle creativity and diversity of thought, so employees don't feel they can use their expertise to suggest alternative goals or strategies.

\section*{11. Situational Leadership}

Situational leaders change their management style to meet the needs of the situation or team. This leadership style is proactive and recognizes that change is the only constant.

\section*{Why this leadership style works for businesses:}

This leadership approach can motivate employees and ensure that people aren't stuck working in a way that doesn't make sense for the situation. It's also valuable for startups or businesses requiring frequent changes and flexible talent and support.

\section*{Why this leadership style is good for the team:}

Situational leaders are great communicators and use team feedback to make decisions. They also analyze market changes and can quickly evaluate and update processes to ensure success. This can create strong relationships and help employees see and feel their value to the business.

\section*{Potential challenges for leaders with a situational style:}

Leaders need a high level of expertise in all business processes and functions to make decisions, and they must be able to pivot quickly. It's important to remember long-term goals and meet immediate needs; not every leader can do this effectively.

It can become confusing and stressful for teams if a leader's approach changes too often, as they won't know what to expect.

\section*{Deciding Between Different Leadership Styles}

There's no single "best" leadership style, so figuring out what is best for you and your environment is essential.

\section*{How to Understand Your Instinctive Leadership Style}

Leaders need good instincts, and many leaders focus on their own experiences and habits as they develop a leadership style. As you start your path toward leadership, you may want to keep notes. Write down how you would handle specific situations or problems.

Doing this can help you be a confident and capable leader, but if you notice things aren't going as expected, you may want to reconsider your approach.

Your instincts and habits will always impact the way you lead. But if you find yourself in situations that you're unsure how to respond to, you may want to look at other leadership styles. For example, if you're an extrovert with a shy member on your team, you may want to work on active listening. If you're an introvert leading a team of outgoing people, you may need to learn new ways to nurture, support, and inspire your team.

Can you change your leadership style?

While it may take some time and effort, you can always change your leadership style and improve your processes.

The first step to making changes is recognizing the need for change. Whether this comes from direct employee feedback, noticing that goals aren't being met, or people seeming to experience burnout, identifying this is the first step.

Next, you need to prepare yourself for changes. For example, your leadership style may be effective for your team, but you might have a more challenging time connecting with stakeholders. In this case, you wouldn't want to throw out your current style, but you'd want to identify what is and isn't working. Then, get curious, and begin the work of adjusting the way you lead.

\section*{How to Choose the Right Leadership Style for You}

There are many ways to find a leadership style that works for you. Because of this, it can be tough to know where to begin. If you're not sure what leadership styles will work for you, these steps can help.

\section*{1. Get to know yourself.}

Everyone has a unique path to self-discover. Some take risks and try new things and others prioritize quiet time, writing exercises, and listing strengths and weaknesses.

Another path to learning about yourself is through physical activity and spending time with other people. However you go about it, getting to know yourself is an important first step toward being a leader.

\section*{2. Outline your values and challenges.}

Knowing yourself will help you understand what's important to you and where you struggle. Being a leader means working quickly and making decisions quickly, so having your values mapped out can be extremely helpful.

As you write out your values, look at pivotal moments in your life to date. Then, look for trends, people you're drawn to, and common themes. If your list is long, group similar ideas together.

Having an outline can help you see how you react, your strengths and weaknesses, and a base for your core values.

\section*{3. Watch leaders you respect.}

Observing leaders you respect can also help you define your leadership style. As you watch them in meetings, client conversations, and presentations, take notes of what you like.

Another approach is to view their actions with specific leadership styles in mind, helping you figure out what their approach is and whether it will work for you.

\section*{4. Try different leadership styles.}

A hands-on option is to try out different leadership styles. You can create an outline of what interests you and review your notes before your next meeting to see how you can incorporate it into your interactions.

\section*{5. Find a business coach or mentor.}

Working with a business coach can also help you hone your leadership style.

A mentor can be someone in your workplace you respect and would appreciate feedback from, whether it's another leader or a colleague you respect.

\section*{6. Ask colleagues and leaders for feedback.}

Another way to find the best style for your needs is to ask other colleagues, leaders, and team members for feedback.

The best approach for this strategy is to plan out what you want to ask and why so you get the feedback you need. Think about how people might respond and also set clear guidelines and expectations.

When you get feedback, make sure to listen carefully. You'll gain valuable information about your strengths and weaknesses that will help you understand where you need to improve and the style that will help you improve.

\section*{7. Complete a leadership style assessment.}

Leadership assessments are helpful tools for leaders, for yourself as an individual, and to assess your teams.

A leadership quiz can make it easier to understand your strengths and skills. It can surface habits and qualities you might not be aware of and give you a clear direction for growth.

If this is something you want to try, the leadership assessment below is a great place to start.

Leaders carry a mix of the leadership styles mentioned above. At the root of these styles, leadership experts Bill Torbert and David Rooke say, are what are called "action logics."

These action logics assess "how [leaders] interpret their surroundings and react when their power or safety is challenged."

That's the idea behind the Leadership Development Profile, a popular management survey tool. Created by professor Torbert and psychologist Susanne Cook-Greuter - and featured in the book, 'Personal and Organizational Transformations' - the survey uses a set of 36 open-ended sentence completion tasks to help researchers better understand how leaders develop and grow.

Below we've used open-ended sentences to outline six action logics that describe each one. Review the sentences, see how they resonate with you, and figure out which leadership style upholds based on the action logic you most align with.

\section*{1. Individualist}

The individualist is self-aware, creative, and primarily focused on their actions and development as opposed to overall organizational performance. This action logic is exceptionally driven by the desire to exceed personal goals and constantly improve their skills.

Here are some things an individualist might say:

Individualist 1: "A good leader should always trust their own intuition over established organizational processes."
Individualist 2: "It's important to be able to relate to others so I can easily communicate complex ideas to them."

Individualist 3: "I'm more comfortable with progress than sustained success."

\section*{2. Strategist}

Strategists are acutely aware of the environments they're in and have a deep understanding of the structures and processes that make their businesses tick. Still, they're also able to evaluate what could be improved.

\section*{Here are some things a strategist might say:}

Strategist 1: "A good leader should always be able to build a consensus in divided groups."
Strategist 2: "It's important to help develop the organization as a whole, as well as the growth and individual achievements of my direct reports."
Strategist 3: "Conflict is inevitable, but I'm knowledgeable enough about my team's personal and professional relationships to handle the friction."

\section*{3. Alchemist}

Rooke and Tolbert describe the alchemist as highly evolved and effective at managing organizational change. They differ from other action logics in their unique ability to simultaneously see the big picture and minute details. No department or employee gets overlooked with an alchemist leader.

Here are some things an alchemist might say:
Alchemist 1: "A good leader helps their employees reach their highest potential, and possesses the necessary empathy and moral awareness to get there."

Alchemist 2: "It's important to make a profound and positive impact on whatever I'm working on."

Alchemist 3: "I have a unique ability to balance short-term needs and long-term goals."

\section*{4. Opportunist}

Opportunists are guided by a certain level of mistrust of others, relying on a facade of control to keep their employees in line. "Opportunists tend to regard their bad behavior as legitimate in the cut and thrust of an eye-for-an-eye world," Rooke and Tolbert write.

Here are some things an opportunist might say:

Opportunist 1: "A good leader should always view others as potential competition to be bested, even if it's at the expense of their professional development."
Opportunist 2: "I reserve the right to reject the input of those who question or criticize my ideas."

\section*{5. Diplomat}

Unlike the opportunist, the diplomat isn't concerned with competition or assuming control over situations. Instead, this action logic seeks to cause minimal impact on their organization by conforming to existing norms and completing their daily tasks with as little friction as possible.

Here are some things a diplomat might say:

Diplomat 1: "A good leader should always resist change since it risks causing instability among their direct reports."
Diplomat 2: "It's important to provide the 'social glue' in team situations, safely away from conflict."
Diplomat 3: "I tend to thrive in more team-oriented or supporting leadership roles."

\section*{6. Expert}

The expert is a pro in their given field, constantly striving to perfect their knowledge of a subject and perform to meet their own high expectations. Rooke and Tolbert describe the expert as a
talented individual contributor and a source of knowledge for the team. But this action logic does lack something central to many good leaders: emotional intelligence.

Here are some things a diplomat might say:
Expert 1: "A good leader should prioritize their own pursuit of knowledge over the needs of the organization and their direct reports."
Expert 2: "When problem-solving with others in the company, my opinion tends to be the correct one."

\section*{STAFF DEVELOPMENT AND MENTORING}

Successful career development requires much more than technical and jobrelated skills. Typically, crafting a successful career requires effective communication and other soft skills, professional relationships and networks, and a career vision.

Many professionals fail to move up the career ladder even while excelling at their jobs because they lack some of these important competencies. However, a mentor can help professionals develop some of these extra-role skills and build key relationships; being a part of a mentoring relationship can be transformational for early career professionals.

Mentoring is a longer-term relationship lasting at least 9 months, typically between more experienced professionals and their mentees. The main purpose of a mentoring relationship is the continual development of the mentee, although there are other benefits.

The mentor acts as a trusted advisor to the mentee, and supports them in developing new skills, navigating political environments, challenging ideas, and encouraging career development. Most professionals who make it to the executive level cite mentoring as an important contributor to their career success.

Developing Employees through Mentoring, Coaching and Shadowing.

As a business owner, you can use mentoring, coaching and shadowing to develop employees' skills at little or no cost to your business.

Investing time into developing employees can help you make the most of an employee's skills and abilities and avoid expensive and time-consuming recruitment processes, and ensure that valuable knowledge stays within your business.

Mentoring, coaching and shadowing can also help your business:
- improve staff satisfaction, retention rates, and team relations
- increase profits through improved performance and productivity
- foster innovative ideas.

By pairing a more experienced individual with a less experienced one, you can use mentoring, coaching and shadowing:
- as a form of induction for new employees
- to develop employee skills in a particular area, such as customer service
- to prepare existing employees to move into different or more senior roles
- for succession planning, if you plan to hand your business over to someone else one day.

\section*{1. Mentoring}

Mentoring is based on a relationship between the mentor and mentee. The mentor provides:
- advice, guidance and direction
- ongoing support and feedback.

Through this relationship, the mentor and mentee can benefit from a range of personal and professional development opportunities.

Regardless of whether the arrangement is informal or formal:
- the mentor-mentee relationship must be based on trust and open communication
- the mentor and mentee must invest time to get to know each other, invest their time and energy and take responsibility for making the relationship work
- together, the mentor and mentee should meet regularly and track the mentee's progress
- mentees can use their mentor as a sounding board for ideas, which can help them make decisions faster and with more certainty. Mentees can learn from their mentor's experience and knowledge and use this information to improve their own career and business skills.

\section*{Mentoring can:}
- help with career progression
- introduce new ways of thinking
- increase job satisfaction and motivation
- develop leadership and problem-solving skills
- build confidence and change limiting thoughts and beliefs
- provide regular constructive feedback
- widen networking circles.

\section*{2. Coaching}

Coaching is a development tool to unlock employee potential and improve performance.

Workplace coaching can focus on:
- executive coaching
- conflict coaching
- leadership coaching
- performance coaching
- individual employee coaching.

A coach can help an employee:
identify and set important goals
$\checkmark$ identify the steps and behaviours needed to meet these goals
$\checkmark$ develop key targets and measures of success
$\checkmark$ be accountable
$\checkmark$ increase existing skills, abilities and knowledge
$\checkmark$ reach their potential.

Coaching can be:
- internal, with managers working with employees in formal, one-on-one coaching sessions or informal, on-the-job coaching sessions.
- external with an outside coach brought in to work with managers or employees.

\section*{3. Shadowing}

Shadowing refers to one employee following and observing another employee for a specific period. This allows the employee to learn the ins and outs of the job while watching someone perform it. Job shadowing is a very effective on-the-job learning method.

Job shadowing can be beneficial for:
- new employees
- employees looking to develop new skills
- employees who move from one part of your business to another.

Job shadowing may occur over a few days, weeks or months. This will depend on the specific job, the complexities and the individual employee.

It could also be extended into a job-swap, where employees trade roles to get experience of working in another role or another part of your business.

\section*{Potential benefits of job shadowing:}
$\checkmark$ opportunity to learn the role and responsibilities
$\checkmark$ develop relationships and network
$\checkmark$ new experiences and perspectives
$\checkmark$ cross training
$\checkmark$ enables internal mobility
$\checkmark$ develops coaching/mentoring skills
$\checkmark$ improvements in business processes
$\checkmark$ upskilling employees
$\checkmark$ improves communications across your business.

A good job shadowing program can bring many benefits to your employees and your business. Make sure to continuously communicate these benefits and available opportunities to your employees.

\section*{Procudure/Stages for Developing/Implementing a Mentorship Program}

To implement the right training for your business, you need to identify your business and employee training needs. You can do this yourself, or you can recruit a human resources (HR) consultant or training organisation to help you.
1. Review your business plan: Is your business plan providing realistic or achievable objectives of the staff development task.
2. Consider the costs: Is it affordable or expensive to the management. Will the program exploit or eat into unnecessary resources.
3. Talk to your staff: Conduct a brief research tofind out what the employees prefer to be trained/mentored on. Allow them to contribute on the methods to be used in delivering the knowledge.
4. Choose and plan training and development activities: From the list of preferred activities by employees, now select the best programs inorder of priority while considering important factors at the work place.
5. Communicate your training program: Here you need to officially announce the mentorship activity in terms of content/topic area, venue, time, etc this is done to prepare the staff psychologically beforehand.

\section*{BENEFITS/IMPORTANCE OF STAFF DEVELOPMENT AND MENTORING}

\section*{1. Increase self-confidence/self-esteem}

Mentoring enhances self-esteem and confidence in individuals, enabling them to take on greater responsibilities, stretch their comfort zones and reach beyond their expectations.

\section*{2. Unbiased feedback}

Mentors are usually impartial, providing honest insight into an employee's performance. This allows employees to identify areas for improvement and develop strategies for overcoming any weaknesses.

\section*{3. Unlocks hidden talent}

Mentors are able to identify unique skills and talents in their mentees, bringing them to the surface and helping them discover paths they may not have otherwise realized.

It also helps mentees identify the areas they excel at and those that need improvement and guide how to use those strengths more effectively.

\section*{4. Improves soft skills}

Organizations focused more on technical skills and often overlooked their employees' soft skills. A mentor provides a safe space for individuals to hone soft skills, such as communication, leadership, problem-solving, and collaboration, which are essential for success in any role or organization. This can include active listening, public speaking, interpersonal communication, and negotiation.

\section*{5. Enhances goal setting}

Through mentoring, individuals learn how to set realistic goals for themselves and develop a plan of action to help them reach those goals.

\section*{6. Provides A listening Ear}

Mentors are a great source of advice and support for employees. They provide an opportunity for employees to openly discuss their performance, share their successes, and work through any issues or challenges they may be facing.
7. A learning culture is created where knowledge is continually shared in a collaborative nature.
8. Mentoring helps employees reach their full potential; thus promoting their personal and professional development in a supportive way.
9. Mentorship enhances leadership and coaching skills in current and future managers.
10. Mentorship engages and motivates your top-talent employees.
11. Employers of mentored employees gain from greater productivity in the workplace.
12. Employees turn to mentors for advice; thus making fewer mistakes; thus cutting loss to employers.
13. Employees in mentntoring relationships tend to have greater job satisfaction and feel a high level of engagement in their roles.
14. Greater job satisfaction leads to a more positive work environment.
15. A positive work environment creates less employee turnover and workers feel a greater sense of loyalty to their company.
16. Mentors are leaders. Leaders don't produce followers. They create additional leaders.
17. Increase productivity and business profits
18. Improve employee motivation and confidence
19. Improve employee career development
20. Increase employee job satisfaction and lower staff turnover
21. Improve work quality and safety
22. Attract good employees
23. Assist with succession planning.

\section*{Characteristics of Staff Development/Mentorship Programs}

Most employee development programs will have the following elements.

\section*{i) A learning Management System (LMS) to offer courses}

Through an LMS, employers can organize and deliver education in an organized fashion that allows tracking progress and completion.

Employees access the materials at their convenience and often can take assessments to demonstrate their comprehension of the material. LMS enables both employers and employees to identify any areas requiring further development.

\section*{ii) $\mathbf{3 6 0}$ performance reviews}

A 360 performance reviews provide a comprehensive and structured evaluation of employees' performance to guide their development.

Though it can help develop every employee, it's most useful for an already effective employee who has stalled. According to Jeff Nally, SHRM-SCP's chief HR officer and coaching officer at CoachSource, "It helps them get out of their comfort zone."

\section*{iii) Setting SMART goals}

Setting a development goal is one thing; implementing various stages of the goal is another. SMART goals are a well-known productivity practice that helps employees advance their professional development.

This framework ensures goals are properly defined, clear, attainable within a reasonable timeframe, and provide a measurable result.

\section*{iv) Setting performance goals and milestones with managers}

While setting a SMART goal is effective, it will do wonders when managers help their employees achieve performance goals and milestones.

Irial O'Farrell, the author of SMART Objective Setting for Managers: A Roadmap (Evolution Consulting, 2020), says, "They might agree to the goal, but they might not know how to go about [achieving] it, and if that's the case, then it will be the last thing on their to-do list."

\section*{v) Monitor the mentoring}

Program coordinators shouldn't just leave the program to mentors and mentees. They should check in regularly to assess the progress.

Mentors should also ask their mentees for feedback, identify any issues or challenges that need to be overcome, and offer additional support. This also helps mentors track what skills and knowledge their mentees have gained and any new goals that need to be set.

\section*{vi) Create an environment of mutual respect}

Many organizations complain about building a workplace learning culture without creating an environment of mutual respect.

Safe space allows employees to be open and honest with each other. The same goes for mentormentee relationships, which will help them learn and grow. Additionally, mentors must respect mentees' boundaries by respecting confidentiality requests. This should also include executive buy-in.

\section*{v) Celebrate successful milestones}

Recognize and celebrate successes along the way. It could be recognizing when a goal is achieved or simply recognizing both parties' efforts.

\section*{INSTRUCTIONAL SUPPORT}

Instructional Support is a process to maximize individual student success, while at the same time serving as a screening process for students who may be in need of specialized education services. Instructional Support is a positive, success-oriented program which uses specific assessment and intervention techniques to help remove educational or behavioral stumbling blocks for all students in the regular classroom.

The process consists of a team working together to identify the student's needs, set goals, and develop an intervention plan to achieve those goals. The Instructional Support Facilitator, administrators, faculty, and parents are all members of the Instructional Support Team.

\section*{Functions of the Instructional Support Facilitator}

The Instructional Support Facilitator provides informal collaborative support to parents, teachers, and students. Once a formal "Request for Instructional Support Team Collaboration" has been made, the Instructional Support Facilitator works with the referring teacher/grade level team, parents, and student to implement the process.

\section*{Duties of the Instructional Support Facilitator}
- data collection and maintenance of records
- curriculum-based assessments
- perform classroom observations
- conduct interviews with parents, teachers, and students
- establish meeting schedules
- assist the Team in identifying concerns and goals
- monitor the intervention plan
- coordinate efforts of teachers, parents, and outside agencies
- model strategies for students, teachers, or parents
- coordinate referrals for available services

\section*{Benefits of Instructional Support}
1. Identifies students in need of academic, emotional and/or behavioral support.
2. Identifies students at risk of failure through a variety of screening methods and referral procedures.
3. Provides initial and timely assistance to teachers, students, and parents.
4. Uses a team approach that always encourages parent participation.
5. Systematically searches to identify and prioritize problems as well as strategies to assist students.
6. Monitors the progress of the student.
7. Evaluates progress and determines recommendations.

\section*{COORDINATION}

According to Mooney and Reelay, "Co-ordination is orderly arrangement of group efforts to provide unity of action in the pursuit of common goals".

According to Charles Worth, "Co-ordination is the integration of several parts into an orderly hole to achieve the purpose of understanding".

Management seeks to achieve co-ordination through its basic functions of planning, organizing, staffing, directing and controlling. That is why, coordination is not a separate function of management because achieving of harmony between individuals efforts towards achievement of group goals is a key to success of management.

Co-ordination is the essence of management and is implicit and inherent in all functions of management.

A manager can be compared to an orchestra conductor since both of them have to create rhythm and unity in the activities of group members. Co-ordination is an integral element or ingredient of all the managerial functions as discussed below: -
a. Co-ordination through Planning - Planning facilitates co-ordination by integrating the various plans through mutual discussion, exchange of ideas. e.g. - co-ordination between finance budget and purchases budget.
b. Co-ordination through Organizing - Mooney considers co-ordination as the very essence of organizing. In fact when a manager groups and assigns various activities to subordinates, and when he creates department's co-ordination uppermost in his mind.
c. Co-ordination through Staffing - A manager should bear in mind that the right no. of personnel in various positions with right type of education and skills are taken which will ensure right men on the right job.
d. Co-ordination through Directing - The purpose of giving orders, instructions \& guidance to the subordinates is served only when there is a harmony between superiors \& subordinates.
e. Co-ordination through Controlling - Manager ensures that there should be coordination between actual performance \& standard performance to achieve organizational goals.

\section*{Coordination and Cooperation}

Co-ordination is an orderly arrangement of efforts to provide unity of action in the fulfillment of common objective whereas co-operation denotes collective efforts of persons working in an enterprise voluntarily for the achievement of a particular purpose. It is the willingness of individuals to help each other.

Co-ordination is an effort to integrate effectively energies of different groups whereas co-operation is sort to achieve general objectives of business.

Though these two are synonymous but they are different as below:

\section*{Differences between Co-ordination and Co-operation}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline Basis & Co-ordination & Co-operation \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline Meaning & It is an orderly arrangement of group efforts in pursuit of common goals. & It means mutual help willingly. \\
\hline Scope & It is broader than co-operation which includes as well because it harmonizes the group efforts. & It is termed as a part of coordination. \\
\hline Process & The function of co-ordination is performed by top management. & The functions of co-operation are prepared by persons at any level \\
\hline Requirements & Co-ordination is required by employees and departments at work irrespective of their work. & Co-operation is emotional in nature because it depends on the willingness of people working together. \\
\hline Relationship & It establishes formal and informal relationships. & It establishes informal relationship. \\
\hline Freedom & It is planned and entrusted by the central authority \& it is essential. & It depends upon the sweet will of the individuals and therefore it is not necessary. \\
\hline Support & It seeks wholehearted support from various people working at various levels. & Co-operation without coordination is fruitless \& therefore it may lead to unbalanced developments. \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

Therefore, existence of co-operation may prove to be effective condition or requisite for coordination. But it does not mean that co-ordination originates automatically from the voluntary efforts of the group of members. It has to be achieved through conscious \& deliberate efforts of managers, therefore to conclude we can say that co-operation without co-ordination has no fruit and co-ordination without co-operation has no root.

\section*{RESOURCE ACQUISITION AND ALLOCATION}

Resource allocation is the process of assigning and managing assets in a manner that supports an organization's strategic planning goals.

Resource allocation includes managing tangible assets such as hardware to make the best use of softer assets such as human capital. Resource allocation involves balancing competing needs and priorities, and determining the best course of action to maximize the use of limited resources and get the best return on investment or profit.

In practicing resource allocation, educational organizations must first establish their desired goal, such as increased revenue, improved productivity or better brand recognition. They then must assess what resources will be needed to reach that goal.

While resource allocation often refers to activities related to project management, the term is also used in other contexts, including the following:
- economics, where it is a component of public finance; and
- computer storage, where it describes how operating systems manage data storage resources.

Resources are a significant investment for most educational institutions. Therefore, organizations strive to utilize them optimally for profitability and sustainability. However, managers often focus on keeping resources occupied with work and assign tasks without considering employee skills or interests.Resource allocation is an essential step in the resource planning process, and an efficient resource management system helps achieve the same.

\section*{Challenges of Resource Allocation}

There also are challenges associated with the resource allocation process, including the following:
1. Resource scarcity. Sometimes there are not enough resources available to achieve the tasks laid out in the project plan. Some resources may only be partially available throughout the project. In other cases, project resources may be available at the beginning of a project but not later on as it progresses.
2. Skill shortages. If specific skills are in short supply, that can have a negative effect on the project. The additional training or hiring required can take time that may not be built into the project's schedule.
3. Resource overallocation. Too many resources can also negatively affect efficiency and productivity. If more resources are allocated to a task than needed, employees may get overwhelmed trying to make use of them all.
4. Visibility. Poor visibility into the details of how a project is progressing can result in project managers not allocating the right resources where they're needed. A lack of visibility can also negatively affect a business's ability to forecast future project requirements, leading to future misallocation of resources. The lack of a centralized resource planning tool is often the cause of poor visibility.
5. Miscommunication. Poor communication among team members or teams can cause a range of problems. For example, a common point of miscommunication is between the sales and delivery team. If the team delivering the product to the customer isn't informed of all project requirements, it may not be able to ensure resources are properly allocated and the deliverables adhere to customer expectations.
6. Outdated technology. Legacy technology, such as a spreadsheet application, may not provide adequate real-time data for tracking This can lead to missed opportunities or overallocation of resources as project requirements shift.
7. Scope creep. Project scope can change at any point in the project lifecycle and lead to fluctuating resource demands. Scope creep is a change to the original goals or tasks of a project and can result in continuous changes or unsustainable growth in the project's scope. If requirements are continually added, resources may be exhausted and team members can be negatively affected.

\section*{Benefits of Resource Allocation}

Resource allocation is essential in educational project management as it allows you to plan and prepare for project implementation or achieving goals. In addition, it helps schedule resources in advance and provides an insight into the project team's progress.

Resource allocation is much more than just delegating assignments. It plays a vital role in project and operations management and eventually improves business performance. It also helps achieve optimum utilization and enhances ROI.

\section*{Benefits of Resource Allocation}

In educational project management, Effective resource allocation offers the following benefits:
1. Collaboration. Resource allocation helps facilitate communication among teams and fosters collaboration. A resource allocation strategy allows communication with stakeholders, to keep them informed about progress toward strategic goals.
2. Efficiency. Resource availability helps teams complete a project on time and use only the resources needed to achieve each goal. A solid resource allocation strategy helps project teams avoid mistakes related to conflicting dependencies.
3. Team morale. Resource allocation improves employee engagement and team member morale. Resource allocation allows a more equitable distribution of responsibilities so that no team member is overworked. This approach can improve productivity because as team members' well-being is improved, they have the bandwidth and agency to take on additional work.
4. Cost reduction. Effective resource allocation can result in significant cost savings because it increases efficiency, reduces waste and avoids costly mistakes, setbacks and delays.
5. Reduce project resource costs significantly
6. Maximize the productivity of resources on projects
7. Enhance employee engagement and satisfaction
8. Facilitate client satisfaction with successful project delivery
9. Achieve the best outcome within existing resource constraints

\section*{Procedure for Resource Allocation while maintain integrity}

The following five steps are important when allocating available resources as part of project management:
1. Plan. Project managers should first map out the project. They must divide the project into separate tasks and identify what skills are needed. They also must examine any constraints, such as the deadlines and budget. Project managers should also identify potential team members based on their skills and availability. They also need to determine task dependencies that might affect completion of specific steps. Planning also requires the development of a work breakdown structure, which matches each task to start and end dates and establishes a budget.

\section*{2. Identify and allocate the Best-Visible-Best-Fit resources}

A resource management system consolidates resource data from various systems into a centralized platform. Complete visibility enables effective allocation of resources to the project based on skills, qualifications, experience, availability, costs, and other selection criteria. Scheduling cost-effective global resources from low-cost locations maintains profitability without compromising quality.

One of the best methods of project resource allocation is assigning best-visible-best-fit instead of first-available-first-fit resources.

\section*{3. Avoid under or overallocation of resources:}

Uniform distribution of resources across all projects ensures that no employee is under or overallocated with work. Underallocation of resources results in productivity and revenue loss. Conversely, overallocation can cause burnout, affect the quality of output, or, worst, result in unplanned attrition.
Forecasting billable /strategic utilization helps project managers to move resources periodically from non-billable to billable/strategic work. Thus, it facilitates optimum resource utilization and improves business efficiency.

\section*{4. Subscribe to an automated resource request process}

While allocating resources, manually sifting through the resource pool or taking phone/email requests from individual project managers can be cumbersome. An automated resource requesting that is independent of cumbersome spreadsheets streamlines the process.
It allows project managers to specify the required skill sets, qualifications, experience, cost, and project timelines. This request directly reaches the inbox of the resource manager in charge, who starts planning for the same. As the entire process is documented and auditable, tracking allocation records eliminates any process-related confusion.

\section*{5. Empower employees to work on projects of interest:}

Studies have shown that when employees work on tasks of their choice, it has a positive effect on their engagement and productivity. Therefore, managers must also consider their interests instead of allocating resources only based on their skills and availability. To achieve this, resource managers can create open positions and publish the same, which becomes visible to all the relevant personnel across the enterprise.

Accordingly, interested resources can show their interest in joining the project, and the concerned resource manager can select the appropriate project team. It also saves the resource
manager's time from looking across the enterprise to find the right fit and negotiating with their line/ project managers. Therefore, this method is a win-win for both resources and the managers responsible for their allocation.
6. Gauge availability. Sick time, vacation time, holidays and other projects all impact a team's availability. During this stage, managers must establish lines of communication with team members so resource allocation and shifts and changes in the project or its schedule can be communicated. Open communication is critical to enable cross-collaboration among teams and optimize the use of shared resources. It also helps identify team members that have conflicting commitments or are balancing multiple projects that might slow down the project.
7. Schedule. Managers assign tasks and develop project timelines. They use resource management tools to automate and streamline this process and improve workload management. Effectively managing workloads can prevent burnout, identify opportunities to enhance team members' skills and indicate additional staff is needed. Resource scheduling involves blocking time for priority tasks and designating the priority level of each task.
8. Track. Once the project begins, it's important to track the performance of team members and monitor how effectively they complete tasks. Resource allocations should be adjusted to maximize efficiency and take advantage of new opportunities that arise. Business intelligence tools and project management software and tools facilitate the collection of realtime data needed to ensure the team remains on the project's schedule.

\section*{9. Diversify employee skill sets and responsibilities:}

Encourage employees to have at least two or more skills. Allocating resources on projects that need various skills allows them to sharpen their primary skill sets and an opportunity
to build new ones. They can also be given further training on acquired skills, and on-thejob experience helps them improve their capabilities.

Sometimes, when employees get roll-off from a project, there isn't any task to assign them based on their primary skills. Here, their secondary skill sets will come in handy, and they can be made billable by allocating them to other projects.
Sometimes, the demand for a niche skillset to start a new project may arise. As these resources are hard to find, out-rotating a niche resource from an ongoing project helps kickstart the new project. Simultaneously, another resource having minimum qualifications can backfill to continue the current project. This dynamic resource allocation ensures that none of the projects suffer.

\section*{10. Evaluate/ Use real-time intelligence to monitor and improve resource allocation.}

The success of the project is evaluated based on metrics that show how well it met expectations. Data from these findings can be used to refine resource allocation strategies in new projects.

\section*{Types of Resources}

Three kinds of resource are necessary for delivery of quality formal and non-formal primary education programs: Human resources, Material resources and Financial resources. These are defined below.

\section*{1. Human resources}

There is a full range of human resources that are essential for success. These resources include planners, administrators, teachers, mentors, managers, and support staff. Here, we focus on teachers as one of the critical aspects of human resource commitment.

Study after study shows that quality teaching is the most powerful factor in student learning. There are three critical domains of supportive interactions in good teaching: emotional support, organizational support and instructional support.

\section*{Emotional support includes:}
1. Positive connection of teacher and students,
2. Low level of negativity expressed by teacher and students,
3. Teacher sensitivity to students' needs,
4. Teacher regard for students' interests, motivations, and points of view

\section*{Organizational support includes:}
1. Behavior management
2. Classroom productivity

\section*{Instructional support includes:}
1. Learning strategies - how teachers engage students in activities and facilitate activities so that learning opportunities are maximized,
2. Concept development - how teachers use instructional discussions and activities to promote students' higher-order thinking skills and cognition,
3. Quality of feedback - how teachers extend students' learning through their participation in activities,
4. Language modeling - the extent to which teachers facilitate and encourage students' language development

The ways in which the absence of teacher quality is a disincentive, particularly to school completion and contributes to pushing students out of school and adding to OOSC numbers, is further explored in Human Resources.

\section*{2. Instructional/Material resources}

Both the availability and quality of materials can be barriers to a quality education.

In many countries there are insufficient basic materials such as blackboards and chalk, textbooks, teacher support materials, student workbooks, and supplementary learning aids. They may be unavailable due to lack of financial resources to publish and transport them, lack of human
resources to develop them and/or make them appropriate, and or due to geographical barriers that make delivery untimely or impossible.

A key element in delivery of quality primary education is the quality of material resources for delivery of content. This is reflected in relevance and design of the curriculum and learning materials available for acquisition of basic skills in the areas of literacy, numeracy and skills for life, and knowledge in such areas as gender, health, nutrition, HIV/AIDS prevention and peace. (See characteristics of quality education as defined by UNICEF, listed in Further Reading).

How low quality in material resources is a disincentive to school participation and completion is explored more in Material Resources.

\section*{3. Financial resources}

The most important source of financing for education comes from sources within a country/domestic sources.

The majority of OOSC live in economically poor countries. In recent years, these countries have suffered further from the impact of the global economic crisis. Even in many of those countries where the domestic spending on education is a significant and respectable percentage of GDP, the actual amount of money available is insufficient to provide a quality education to those children who are in school, let alone those who are excluded.External funding to education can play a critical role in filling funding gaps and as a means to serve as a catalyst to provide resources for those who are underserved in a given country.

\section*{QUALITY CONTROL}

Quality Control (QC) is a process undertaken to ensure that the standards and goals of an operation are both realistic and being met. In education, quality control is an important issue, as parents, students, and educators want to ensure that all students receive adequate training for the future. There are many methods of quality control in education, including standardized testing, teaching review, and training.

Education quality control usually begins with the formation of school standards. These may be institution, district, state, or national guidelines that determine what a student should know by the end of each grade. For instance, a quality control standard might require all students to have taken and passed geometry by the tenth grade. Quality control standards also lay out guidelines for the education requirements for teachers, such as possession of a valid teaching credential. Once school standards are set, the overseeing board can implement a cycle of investigation, policy changes and additions, and implementation that ensures that a school meets its standards.

\section*{Methods of Quality Control in Education}

\section*{1. Standardized Testing}

Students in each grade are given a test that measures their aptitude in required subjects, such as spelling, reading comprehension, and mathematics. These tests are often administered by a third party company and do not constitute part of the regular grading process. Standardized tests let school authorities know the level of student education as compared to the existing standard. If an age group or grade is struggling in a particular area of the test, measures may be implemented to improve classes in that area.

\section*{2. Teacher Review}

This is another important method of QC in education. In many regions, teachers are periodically observed by quality control experts, colleagues, or school management in order to assess their success at meeting quality standards. In determining a teacher's performance, observers may interview students, examine recent grades given, and judge whether the methods used in the classroom are truly adding to education. Using many different tactics to determine teacher performance level is often considered very important; teachers rated based on standardized testing alone may leave out important areas of learning that cannot be measured by tests.

\section*{3. Listening to student, teacher, and parent feedback}

It is sometimes an important part of quality control in education. Teachers can give a clear picture of how a particular class is struggling or succeeding, while students are often full of valuable information about how teachers manage a classroom and how it could be improved. Paying careful attention to feedback can help create solutions to quality control lapses.

\section*{4. Government Laws and funded programs}

They are sometimes used to help improve QC in education. Governmental intervention can sometimes try to bridge a quality lapse that is widespread and outside of the jurisdiction of a single school or educational system. One example of government involvement in educational quality control would be a government funded program that provided free nursery school to help prepare young children for an educational environment.

\section*{5. Online standardized assessments help gauge education programs.}

Quality control in education must be an ongoing process; meeting standards one year does not guarantee future performance. By creating a continual process of data gathering, review, and implementation allows school officials to stay on top of quality assurance from year to year. Relying on a variety of methods also helps guarantee that the whole picture of a school or school system is being examined.

\section*{TOPIC 2: LEGAL PROVISIONS IN BASIC EDUCATION}

\section*{1. SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS}

The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) aim to transform our world. They are a call to action to end poverty and inequality, protect the planet, and ensure that all people enjoy health, justice and prosperity. It is critical that no one is left behind.

The 17 SDGs are integrated-they recognize that action in one area will affect outcomes in others, and that development must balance social, economic and environmental sustainability.

Countries have committed to prioritize progress for those who're furthest behind. The SDGs are designed to end poverty, hunger, AIDS, and discrimination against women and girls.

The creativity, knowhow, technology and financial resources from all of society is necessary to achieve the SDGs in every context.

Eradicating poverty in all its forms remains one of the greatest challenges facing humanity. While the number of people living in extreme poverty dropped by more than half between 1990 and 2015, too many are still struggling for the most basic human needs.

As of 2015, about 736 million people still lived on less than US $\$ 1.90$ a day; many lack food, clean drinking water and sanitation. Rapid growth in countries such as China and India has lifted millions out of poverty, but progress has been uneven. Women are more likely to be poor than men because they have less paid work, education, and own less property.

Progress has also been limited in other regions, such as South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, which account for 80 percent of those living in extreme poverty. New threats brought on by climate change, conflict and food insecurity, mean even more work is needed to bring people out of poverty.

\section*{Sustainable Development Goals (SDG's) and their Link to Education}

The SDGs are a bold commitment to finish what we started, and end poverty in all forms and dimensions by 2030. This involves targeting the most vulnerable, increasing basic resources and services, and supporting communities affected by conflict and climate-related disasters. The SDG 4 is coined to help in the achievement of the National Goals of Education of Kenya.

\section*{Influence of Sustainable Development Goals (SDG 4) on Basic Education}

The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is universal, holistic and indivisible, with a special imperative to leave no one behind.

Establishing and implementing an inclusive education system Access to, and completion of inclusive quality education Quality early childhood development, care and pre-primary education.

Access to higher education and availability of scholarships by persons with disabilities

Acquiring skills for employment, decent jobs and entrepreneurship skills by persons with disabilities. Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all - plays a central role in building sustainable, inclusive and resilient societies. Much progress was made under the Millennium Development Goals toward universal primary
school enrollment; SDG 4 now aims to raise the bar and make education a catalyst for broader change toward sustainable development.

Education is a basic right and elementary to human dignity. SDG 4 also has reciprocal linkages across the 2030 Agenda.Access to quality education is an avenue for social mobility and reducing inequalities.

Education is essential for building the knowledge base we need to tackle critical challenges like climate change. Education will help youth prepare for employment in the high-skill jobs of the fourth industrial revolution.

And education is a foundation for peaceful societies and effective institutions. Education is essential for sustainable development, but investments in education that are not accompanied by concurrent progress in other aspects of human wellbeing will fall short of enabling all people to realize their full potential in life.

Good child health and nutrition are essential for securing learning outcomes - not only in terms of increased class attendance, but also for improving educational achievements. Similarly, ending poverty, thereby reducing pressures to put children to work, may be essential to universal school enrolment.

Such considerations may be especially relevant for vulnerable groups that tend to suffer from multiple deprivations and are therefore critical to realizing the overall objective of 'leaving no one behind'.

While education in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is most explicitly formulated as a stand-alone goal (SDG4), there are also a number of education-related targets and/or indicators in other sustainable development goals. These include health and well-being, gender equality, decent, responsible consumption and growth, and climate change mitigation.

Education provides the means to transmit knowledge, values and skills across generation, enabling societies to set the foundation for thriving in the future.

\section*{Requirements of Sustainable Development Goal 4 (SDG's) in Relation to Basic Education}

In 2015, world leaders agreed to 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for a safer, cleaner and more prosperous world by 2030. Now it's up to all of us to join forces to address the most pressing global challenges and turn goals into action.To accelerate progress towards the SDGs for every child, UNICEF embraces a "3As" approach: raising awareness, taking action and holding decision makers accountable for progress.

\section*{1. Awareness}

With the right tools and information, children and young people can play a critical role in the implementation and monitoring of the SDGs, sparking action in their communities and holding leaders to account. This is why UNICEF works to raise awareness of children's rights - educating and engaging young people on why the goals matter to their everyday lives.

\section*{2. Action}

With millions of children and young people becoming aware of the goals, more and more are taking action across the globe.

\section*{3. Accountability}

Global leaders must be held to account on commitments made. At UNICEF, we help do this in two ways:
a) by collecting, analyzing and sharing data on children to monitor progress, and
b) by bringing children's perspectives on the SDGs to decision makers to promote accountability
4. Governments to place education as a priority in both policy and practice.
5. Lobby our governments to make firm commitments to provide free primary school education to all, including vulnerable or marginalized groups.
6. Encourage the private sector to invest resources in the development of educational tools and facilities
7. Urge NGOs to partner with youth and other groups to foster the importance of education within local communities.

\section*{2. EAST AFRICA COMMUNITY HARMONIZATION FRAMEWORK}

East African Community (EAC) is an economic integration and a regional intergovernmental organization involving 7 partner states: Burundi, Kenya, Congo,Rwanda, South Sudan, Tanzania and Uganda.

\section*{3. THE KENYAN CONSTITUTION}
- The Importance of the Kenyan Constitution and how it Impacts Basic Education (Bill of Rights and its impact on Basic Education)

The Constitution of Kenya, in Article 53 (1) (b) state that every child has a right to free and compulsory basic education and Article 55 (a) the State shall take measures, including affirmative action programmes, to ensure that the youth access relevant education and training.

The Kenyan Basic Education Act of 2013 ensures the right of all children with disabilities to free and compulsory education for the first time in Kenya. However, the Act continues to perpetuate discrimination against Kenyan children with disabilities. First, the law fails to provide reasonable accommodations in education, which amounts to disability discrimination.

Second, the law fails to ensure an inclusive education system as required by article 24 of the CRPD. While there has been some debate as to whether article 24 bans all specials schools, the Basic Education Act creates a system in which all children with disabilities are required to attend separate schools, solely based on their disability.

Although an inclusive education system may not be possible to achieve in Kenya overnight, the law does not do enough to promote equal educational opportunities for children with disabilities as required by the CRPD. At the very least, children with disabilities should be guaranteed the right to an education in the least restrictive environment, which, we argue, is possible to achieve immediately.

The right to education in the least restrictive setting ensures that children with disabilities are provided the opportunity to learn with their non-disabled peers. However, enforcing the right to education in the least restrictive environment should not be the final goal; it is only a means that will lead towards full inclusion for all children with disabilities in Kenya, as mandated by the CRPD。

\section*{Analysis of the aspects of the chapter (6) six of the Constitution and how they influence school leadership. (Apply requirements of the Kenya Constitution to school leadership)}

\section*{Requirements of the Constitution in the Curriculum Implementation Process.}

Goal: To improve quality of education at all levels through competency- based curricula. The National Curriculum that was revised in 2002 laid emphasis on achievement of stated objectives (The Eight National Goals of Education). Subsequent evaluation of the curriculum has focused on the same. Whereas objectives are fundamental in all types of curricula, it is the resulting outcomes that are desired in terms of what the learner is able to do. The 8-4-4
curriculum envisaged that, based on the designed objectives, the learner would be able to exhibit behaviour commensurate with the aspects taught at each level.

The rapid technological changes demand quality education that emphasizes the importance of producing learners who can take initiative and creatively innovate products and processes that spur talents and development of values. Competence based curriculum is the ideal option for achieving this objective.

\section*{Policy Statements}
- To establish and entrench a competency- based curriculum, MOE will implement the following:
- Establish a competency- based curriculum at all levels and;
- Utilize technology to enhance innovation in the implementation of competency- based curriculum.

\section*{Strategies}

The following strategies will be implemented to achieve the above
i. Establish a competency- based curriculum at all levels
ii. Carry out a comprehensive needs assessment to inform development of competencybased curriculum;
iii. Develop appropriate education structure for competency- based curriculum;
iv. Develop a curriculum framework for competency- based curriculum;
v. Design a curriculum that is re-oriented towards learning outcomes;
vi. Develop standards and indicators for competencies at each level;
vii. Develop mechanisms of including learners with disabilities in the CBC;
viii. Develop and approve competency- based curriculum designs and curriculum support materials;
ix. Create awareness among all stakeholders on the competency- based curriculum and; x. Ensure that an interdisciplinary and holistic learning is embedded in the curricula.

\section*{Utilization of Technology to Enhance Innovation in the Implementation of CompetencyBased Curriculum}
i. Design appropriate digital content for a competency- based curriculum taking cognizance of the needs of SNE learners;
ii. Identify and procure appropriate technology for utilisation in the competency- based curriculum and;
iii. Build the capacity of curriculum implementers on digital instructional methods that cater for diverse learning.

\section*{6. SESSIONAL PAPERS FOR EDUCATION}

\section*{SESSIONAL PAPER NO. 1 OF 2019 ON A POLICY FRAMEWORK}
for: Reforming Education and Training for Sustainable Development in Kenya. The Policy underscores the need for education to promote respect for and development of Kenya's rich and varied cultures. Education, training and research is a major platform for national socio-economic transformation.

\section*{SESSIONAL PAPER NO. 1 (2005) ON A POLICY FRAMEWORK FOR EDUCATION TRAINING AND RESEARCH}

The Kenya Government through the Sessional Paper No. 1 (2005) on A Policy Framework for Education Training and Research had anticipated that in the long run, secondary
education would be integrated as part of basic education. The move taken to provide subsidized secondary education aims at ensuring that children from poor households acquire quality education that enables them to access opportunities for self advancement and become productive members of society. Subsidized Secondary Education is an effort to attain EFA (Education For All)goals by 2015, by increasing transition rates from primary to secondary by $70 \%$ in 2008.

The move is quite timely since many households cannot afford to educate their children especially through the current hard economic times. The Kenya Government has undertakenfarreaching measures, such as increasing enrolment in classrooms from 40 to 45 students, tuition waiver and provision of instructional materials to targeted schools in ord er to increaseaccess, quality, equity and completion rates. However, as observed by Asayo (2009),problems are already being experienced in the provision of educational resources like shortage of teachers, overcrowded classrooms and limited materials. To achieve any meaningful gains from this programme, the exact problems of access to education by 2015, needed to be identified and addressed.

The purpose of the study was to assess the impact of Subsidized Secondary Education on access to educational resources. The study was conducted in the then Butere District. A survey design was employed in the study. Stratified and simple random sampling were used to get the sample out of the target population. Data were collected from 14 head teachers, 28 class teachers, 27 PTA members, 278 students, three AEOs and two DEOs making 352 respondents. Data collection instruments included questionnaires, interviews and observation checklists.

The instruments were piloted using test re-test method to determine their reliability which yielded a coefficient correlation of 0.64 thus the instruments were reliable. Data were organized, interpreted and analyzed using descriptive statistics such as frequency, percentages, graphs and measures of central tendency using SPSS Package. The findings of the study pointed out that student enrollment had been increasing consistently since the introduction of SSE in 2008 while the basic educational resources were available but not adequate.

The study revealed that there was delay in disbursement of funds to schools by the government, shortage of teachers, inadequate physical facilities and instructional materials and parents' negative attitude towards SSE. The researcher concluded that SSE had attracted more students to schools while the facilities were not equally improved therefore causing a strain on the educational resources in schools. The study recommends that the Kenya government disburses SSE funds promptly, posts more teachers to schools, and sensitizes parents and other stakeholders on their role in education among others. It was anticipated that the recommendations of the study would be useful by policy-makers in decision-making to improve the provision of Subsidized Secondary Education in the country.

\section*{SESSIONAL PAPER NO. 5 OF 1978 ON EDUCATIONAL OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES}

\section*{Education, Culture and National Development}

The Report notes that the ideals of Harambee have formed the foundation and guidelines for the continued enhancement of our national unity. It observes with satisfaction that the Government, while deeply conscious of a real threat to the nation's values, is resolutely committed to preserve and promote the ideals of democracy and the importance of the individual, the tradition of mutual social responsibility and a distinctive national culture drawn from the rich traditions of Kenya's people. It appears that our education system has not taken the necessary measures to impart these ideals of the Kenya society to the youth and to show them how the ideals relate to the rapidly changing social and economic circumstances of the country in particular and the world in general. It is reassuring, however, that the Government is committed to revive and propagate those traditional practices and values which are relevant for modem Kenya; to seek to change the attitudes of people, particularly youth, to agriculture and other occupations involving manual labour; to evolve a scheme of service for youth as a means of inculcating such values and attitudes and to introduce social ethics into the curricula of educational institutions.

The human resources of a nation determine the character and pace of its social and economic development. Financial and natural resources assist the nation in the attainment of its development objectives. But a balanced and relevant educational system helps to stimulate and facilitate the activities that constitute national development.

The Report acknowledges the fact that the Government and the people of Kenya are satisfied with the prominent role played by our educational endeavour which has helped to bring the nation's rapid economic progress since independence through the development of indigenous trained manpower. However, the enthusiasm for development of education has caused an expansion which has not been matched by a similar expansion in income-earning opportunities, resulting in too many school leavers in relation to available jobs.

Creation of productive employment remains one of the biggest challenges. Labour is plentiful in the country. Hence the efforts to develop the rural areas will be intensified to create more employment. The Report notes a weakness in science teaching. Yet science provides the necessary knowledge which underlines the development of the appropriate skills and technology required to meet the needs of mankind.

Rural development entails the totality of the processes of change aimed at enhancing the quality of life of 'the people living in the rural areas. Education for rural development must be planned and implemented as a lifelong process, of which formal schooling is only an integral part. This will mean that all the factors that underlie rural development are taken into consideration in an increasingly integrated manner in the planning and implementation of the education system. It is acknowledged that the Government has already initiated several measures through the existing rural development programme and accepts the need to intensify the integration of educational institutions with the environmental conditions in all areas. Apart from extension of primary education the programme includes agriculture, roads, rural water, health, rural works and improvement of life generally.

Education as one of the features of rural development has to compete with other services for the available but limited resources. The Report, therefore, recommends that the role of education should facilitate the process of integration of educational institutions into their immediate
surroundings. Problems relating to preparation of young people for parental and other social responsibilities have arisen with the adoption of formal education. Even educated parents are increasingly unable to instruct their children adequately about their roles in society. In traditional African customs young people are expected to learn social obligations such as self-reliance, community responsibility and parenthood.

Most of Kenya is not suitable for intensive arable agriculture, and the high potential agricultural land is currently carrying very high and increasing densities of population. Priority will therefore be given to uplifting the productive capacity of land, and possible reclamation of desertland, motivation and improvement of quality of life of rural populations through investing more resources in agriculture to enable the rural people to become more effective in their endeavours.

The problem of unemployment is aggravated by the annual output of school leavers whose formal education has not equipped them with skills and qualities required by the economy. The formal qualifications demanded by the employers are rising rapidly and usually bear no functional relationship to the jobs concerned. It has been observed that urban areas generate only a small proportion of the required employment opportunities. The number of working poor people making such small incomes that they do not make any meaningful living is also rising. The school leaver fits into both unemployment and working poor categories.

It has become clear that the existing education system has not been related to the social and economic realities of the country. On the whole, the curriculum has not incorporated the teaching and learning of creative capability and has therefore tended to alienate youth against the realities of their surroundings. This in turn has created frustration by widening the gap between aspirations and achievements in wage employment in which they have put all their expectations.

\section*{A number of recommendations have been made:}
(a) To make general education give increasing emphasis to adaptability.
(b) To make formal educational institutions, including primary schools, give increasing emphasis on problem-solving teaching methods that have a bearing on the real life situation of the Kenyan environment.
(c) To promote the full development of the talents and potentialities of individuals within the context of mutual social responsibility.
(d) To develop those being educated into useful citizens capable of, and motivated towards, contributing to the improvement of the nation as a whole as well as that of their own welfare.
(e) To focus education on the basic needs and income-earning opportunities for the rural areas and to foster changes of social values, aspirations and motivations.
(f) To provide for ethical education and training and for such social matters as family life education, issues of the environment, and national and international understanding.
(g) To promote traditional practices that have educational and occupational values.
(h) To codify and use the traditional practices which can serve as sources of basic knowledge.
(i) To bring about a sense of dignity towards social service and productive labour through appropriately programmed activities of basic education.
(j) To give greater rewards and incentives to crafts, fanning, productive manual work and creativity.
(k) To make formal education include the teaching of prevocational craft-orientated skills, including small-scale business techniques, in order to encourage self-confidence, creative ability and evaluative capacity.
(l) To encourage youth to relate the knowledge they get in education to a purpose in life.
(m) To expose students to practical problems encountered in endeavours to develop rural areas.
(n) To give more Government guidance on development priorities for harambee, with special emphasis on co-ordination to avoid duplication.

The Government accepts the social, cultural and economic values enumerated in the Report and will help promote them through relevant education that imparts a sense of national and
international consciousness. The role of students in society will increasingly be taught in schools since the modern parent in this transitional period, is less certain of what to impart to the child. The listed recommendations on promoting national unity, removing inequalities, adaptability instilling positive attitudes and bringing about relevant changes in education are acceptable.

The need for research is accepted by the Government in particular to help the creation of the most appropriate technology to create employment for the increasing numbers of unemployed school leavers. In this regard, it will be necessary to intensify research and development activities in such areas as arid zone agriculture, small-scale agriculture and business co-operative development, as well as the educational and social requirements for facilitating these developments.

The Government accepts that agriculture and related industries have the highest capacity for creating jobs in the rural areas and there is an urgent need to make general conditions and incomes in these areas more attractive to reduce rural-urban migration.

The Government, being aware of the importance of the rural-orientated strategy, will not only reallocate resources towards the rural areas but also restructure the pattern of incentives and rewards in favour of rural economic activities and the poorer sections of the community. A comprehensive incomes policy, which is implied by this, will also seek to reduce the present emphasis on allocating jobs and awarding promotions on the basis of formal education qualifications.

The Government also accepts the need for co-operation between all ministries and departments in areas of conservation, extension services and integrated programmes in the rural areas in order to bring about the required development.

\section*{Importance of Legal Documents in Administration of Learning Institutions}

Legal documents contain policies which are generally an intent, a set of rules and principles, adopted for ease of governance within an organization. It is fundamentally important for organizations to have implementable policies, as it forms a linking pin between the school management, teachers, students, parents, and the rule of law. An organization without policy is an organization without control.

If there are no formal policies, then organization staff at any level would have no guidance on how to make right consistent decisions. Below are the benefits of conserving and upholding the legal documents within a learning institution.

\section*{1. Internal Controls}

Organizational policies should serve as an important form of internal control. Policy form as a control mechanism that will effectively limit the behaviour of teaching and non-teaching staff. Instructions could be that two teachers must be involved in any assessment process, one to correct the answer script, and another to audit the sheet. Policy should always be enforced through some kind of scrutinizing mechanism, or it will be a weak internal control. School management can make life easier by creating proper internal controls that are enforceable.

\section*{2. Minimise Costs:}

Management always feel the need to minimise costs. This can take the form of examining the real amount of resources required for what the School actually needs, such as finding the cheapest suppliers without sacrificing quality. It can also be about limiting the financial losses that can cripple school operations, such as shortages, wastages, errors and other kinds of losses. When policies address potential sources of risk and require employees to know them, it creates awareness of the need for risk management. It is best to ensure that employees comply with company policies intended to minimise risk.

\section*{3. Maintain Compliance}

School policies must enable the organization to maintain a degree of accountability in the eyes of internal and external stakeholders. School has an obligation towards the law of the land. Compliance is to follow these established defined statutory procedures and practices. Educational policies are rules that are intended to help schools teach students efficiently, fairly and safely as per the regulatory norms, and the Board to which the Institution is affiliated. These terms determine how students are taught, what they are taught, how schools manage students and its personnel.

\section*{4. Build a Learning Culture}

Academics being the major service of a school, it is mandatory to create a learning culture by encouraging the staff to continuously add to their knowledge. This includes determining which capability each staff should acquire and creating a process for updating it throughout the year. For example, a policy to have a staff competency matrix and training need analysis for all staff must be completed before becoming eligible for the appraisal. Initially each staff learning should include a checklist of tasks, such as required training and development, work samples and formal learning instructions.

\section*{5. Safe Learning Environments}

Students, teachers and staff members deserve to feel physically and psychologically secure in their environment. Policies influence how safe individuals are in school. In order to create this environment, guidelines need to be developed and reinstated that establish safety standards for
the physical environment and mental state of students and staff. Disciplined rules have an effect on the safety of students and staff at school level, therefore, procedures should extend beyond the classroom, frequency of fire drills, anti-bullying, and how staff should respond during a medical emergency.

\section*{6. Setting Goals and Establishing Productivity}

Students and teachers are the major customers of all the policies in a school. Management should establish standard rules to guide acceptable behaviour, and help create a conducive learning environment. All of these are necessary to help the institution run smoothly to ensure that students receive a quality education. In order for an institution to encourage higher learning, plans must be in place that establish goals as set forth by the school management. This is important for relating education to the community and making it responsible to the larger world. Accountability through the use of goal-oriented policies ensures productivity - thus save time, prevent confusion and unify the school.

\section*{7. Suspension and Expulsion}

Although the law strictly disapproves it, the school should be very careful in determining when a student should be suspended or expelled, because it can impact a child's future. Although it is common to expel students for excessive violations of school rules, this is not always a good option for dealing with behaviour problems. When a child is expelled, he may lose his desire to continue attending traditional institution and quit. Suspension policies can inadvertently discourage students from attending school, leading to a lifetime of low-paying jobs or dependency of others. For this reason, it is important to have policies that incorporate other solutions before resorting to suspension and expulsion.

\section*{8. Equality}

Equality in the schools is again determined by its policies. School must have guidelines requiring acts of discrimination to be reported to their administrators and to be remedied promptly. There are also rules in place to make sure that children with disabilities, or slow-learners, receive the
same access to an education as other students. This ensures that everyone gets the opportunity to contribute to society and thrive economically.

\section*{9. Teacher Engagement}

Another important thing is that policies on teacher training and engagement should focus more on the professional continuum of teachers. Teacher engagement is the key element for teacher retention, including teacher interventions, and their continuous professional development all over their career - they are a whole and they are interconnected. A proper workplace policy also aims to guide teaching and non-teaching staff in how to perform in the school for various prohibited issues in - harassment, internet use, health and safety, and social media are just a few.

\section*{10. Stakeholder involvement}

Last but not the least, collaboration between all the stakeholders should be much larger. It is extremely important that everyone is involved in the policy-making, that each stakeholder has his/her role, and should be able to take that role into the process. Schools should have welldocumented and comprehensive policies and standard-operating-procedures for all the internal and external stake holders.

\section*{Having well-developed policies and rules can empower the School to:}
- Help teachers and students know what is expected of them with respect to standards of behaviour and performance.
- Set guidelines for decision-making in routine situations so that teachers and managers do not need to continually ask senior management what to do.
- Help to adopt a consistent and clear response across the school to continually refer to situations involving any interactions between peers, students and parents.
- Allow to demonstrate good faith that employees will be treated fairly and equally.
- Allow to have an accepted method of dealing with complaints and misunderstandings in place to help avoid favouritism.
- Set a framework for delegation of decision-making.
- Give a means of communicating information to all stakeholders.
- Offer protection from breaches of legislations, compliances, etc.

\section*{TOPIC 3: BASIC EDUCATION IN KENYA}

\section*{THE STRUCTURE OF THE MINISTRY OF EDUCATION}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_20_aafeeaf34af30c7ad64fg-109.jpg?height=966&width=1629&top_left_y=1328&top_left_x=248)

An Organogram showing the Structure of the Ministry of Education

\section*{FUNCTIONS OF THE MINISTRY OF EDUCATION: Role Played by the Ministry of Education in the Administration of Basic Education}

The Ministry of Education in Kenya has several roles in the management of education. These include:

\section*{1. Promoting education}

As you probably already know, Kenya has come quite a long way to promote and boost education activities. This has always been made possible through the Ministry of Education and Sports participating in activities like;
- Sensitizing citizens about the importance of education
- Preaching about the value of girl-child education
- Establishing and opening schools
- Not all the heads of the education ministry are equally effective in this endeavor, and that affects the completion and achievement of this goal.

\section*{2. Revising and approves the curriculum}

The Education ministry is not necessarily responsible for designing or drafting the curriculum. However, Kenya Institute of Curriculum Development (KICD) designs the curriculum and forwards it to the education ministry for approval.

This, therefore means the schools are allowed to adopt and follow the curricular path that's already been set and predetermined.

\section*{3. Organizing workshops \& seminars to discuss education issues}

So many times, people create seminars and workshops to discuss problems and come up with potential solutions thereof.

Therefore, the education ministry is entirely responsible for calling all the teachers together and getting ideas from them on how to better the standards of education across the country.

\section*{4. Coming up with plans for education reforms}

As always, there are some things that aren't going in the right direction, and that's where the education ministry comes in handy. The ministry is made of extraordinary people usually with experience in teaching. This makes them better capacitated to come up with solutions and suitable plans for education reforms.

\section*{5. Setting standards for schools at all levels}

The education ministry is responsible for setting standards that every school just has to follow or they don't get a chance to do business. Some of them include;
- Requirements for a school to be licensed
- Desired student population
- The kind of staff hired at school
- For the few schools that have not met the standards, they are denied licenses and it's a punishable crime to see them open up for business before they're licensed.

\section*{6. Organizing and Approving International Examinations}

There are numerous international schools in Kenya that don't let their students sit for exams because they want to provide an unlimited domain of qualification to their students.

The education ministry is charged with thoroughly examining these exams so that they suit the job market in Kenya.

\section*{7. Supervising Countrywide Education Standards}

For anything to grow exponentially and be maintained in the right shape, it always has to be supervised. The Ministry of education and sports is charged with supervising every government and private schools in the country for things like;
- Population of students versus space and equipment
- Whether the teachers are well qualified
- Living and feeding standards of students

When this is done correctly by the right people, it is then certain that everything will go smoothly as far as education is concerned.

\section*{8. Directing the development of higher education}

While the elementary and secondary school level of education is becoming more and more accessible by people at a faster rate, the same is not true for higher education institutions.

This is why the education ministry is charged with establishing the possible government solutions based on the problems they've found in the higher education sector.

\section*{9. Ensuring proper management of funds}

While it is known that the government generously funds the education ministry, there are high and alarming levels of corruption in almost every institution. Therefore, there are people assigned the role of keeping the state funds safe until they play their desired goal in the end.

\section*{10. Funding government schools}

The government, in order to achieve the desired goals in line of education, allocates the necessary funds to the ministry of education, making it easier for the ministry to facilitate the construction of schools even in rural areas.

Due to the effectiveness and efficiency of the education ministry, it then becomes an easier and cost-efficient option for the government.

\section*{11. Licensing private schools}

So many people want to start up private schools, and just think of how many they would be, or even how pathetic the quality of education would be if there weren't any strict requirements set for them to meet.

Once these standards are met, the ministry them issues licenses to these private schools so they can conduct academic activities like the rest.

\section*{12. Take Full Control of Policies, Decisions and Planning activities.}

MoE must ensure strong grip and governance on the educational policies, regulation, educational systems across the country.

\section*{13. Regulation of New School Systems}

It is observed that every now and then a new school system is introduced specially in India, Pakistan and African nations, claiming to be the best whereas no genuine efforts to meet the minimum acceptance criteria of a new schooling system. Such new business lack in proper planning for curriculum setup, teaching faculties training, integration with existing school systems and compliance with local laws.

\section*{14. Careful Utilization of Educational Budget}

There could be so many possible expenses when it comes to allocation of budget. For example, new school opening, salary payments of staff, investment in science and technology, IT infrastructure upgrade, training, international memberships, marketing and media needs and so on. It is extremely important for the MOE to assign Subject Matter Experts with a strong
analytical and visionary approach. Every single penny incorrectly spent will result in huge loss for the nation.

\section*{15. Guidance to all Educational Institutes}

MoE should provide macro level guidance to all educational institutes covering Marketing, HR, market dynamics, industry trends.

\section*{16. Integration of Different Schooling Systems}

Many students face problems while moving from one schooling system to another. The Ministry should work with policy makers to establish a unified integration system to avoid such issues.

\section*{17. Schools Ranking System}

There should be a dedicated government department that defines criteria for the best institute. Annual strict audits should be performed against these points and school ranking to be released on the official website. Each school should be graded as Poor, Acceptable, Good or Excellent. This approach will result in competition and continuous improvement. The bench-marking should cover a wide range of aspects linked with the education industry.

\section*{18. Compulsory Education Assurance}

MoE should establish a dedicated committee supported by auditors who can consistently perform audits on whether compulsory education is being ensured.

\section*{19. Counseling Service for Higher Education}

MoE should have an online portal where students should be given guidance and exposure about different options they can consider. In the form of FAQs students should be given guidance for how, where and when.

\section*{20. Issuance of Scholarships Programs}

The Ministry should collaborate with international organizations across the globe to arrange scholarships for the bright students. There should be a dedicated section on the MoE's website where students are provided the details about all kinds of scholarships.

\section*{21. Teaching Regulations}

Not everyone should be allowed to start a teaching career. This ruins the quality of education. MoE must establish a mechanism for best teachers criteria that results in qualification of certain individuals to start teaching. The Ministry should maintain a database of all the teachers of the country and provide them online training about new teaching techniques, perform surveys, seek feedback and take annual exams of all teachers.

\section*{22. Curriculum Catalogues}

The Ministry should create and distribute curriculum guidance in line with national interests and international trends. Schools are required to comply with such requirements and produce evidence of actions taken. Annual audits may be performed.

\section*{23. Ensuring Strict Compliance and Governance}

Any schools which do not meet with MoEs instructions and compliance, should be given notices to improve. Counseling and auditing services should be provided. Consistent violators must be penalized to set an example for others and to maintain high standards.

\section*{24. Seek Support from NGOs (Private Organizations)}

Ministries should encourage NGOs by providing tax free authorization to promote better education, rural student's assistance and so on.

\section*{25. Countrywide Regulation of Literacy Rate}

The Ministry should prioritize the efforts of improving literacy rate. This may be achieved via free campaigns and advertisements on state owned TV channels, radio stations and social media. There should be a dedicated committee that can work with philanthropists for orphan-education support or for opening new schools.

\section*{26. Establishment of Open Forum}

An online forum for parents, teachers, business owners will definitely help for brainstorming of new ideas. Specially parents can provide critical feedback on student-specific issues.

b. Management of institutes of science and technology
c. Management of national polytechnics
d. National council for science and technology

\section*{STAKEHOLDERS IN BASIC EDUCATION}

\section*{Major Stakeholders in Administration of Basic Education}

\section*{1. TSC-Teachers Service Commission}

The Teachers Service Commission (TSC) of Kenya is an Independent Commission established under the Constitution of Kenya to manage human resource within the education sector. It is based in the capital city, Nairobi with offices in all the 47 Counties

\section*{2. KNUT}

The KEPSHA App is a virtual place which brings together Head Teachers of Primary Schools in Kenya and allows them to socialize and interact with each other. It is also a one-stop shop that allows them to access content and material from across the Education Industry in one place.

\section*{6. The School Board}

School board members have key responsibilities as stakeholders in education. Some of these key responsibilities are:

A legal responsibility to ensure schools within their district are meeting educational standards by providing a quality education for all students.

A financial responsibility to use taxpayer money wisely and to have a good handle on other resources given to their schools.

Often each member has a personal responsibility to ensure their schools are effectively helping students to succeed. For example, they can request that school administrators at each school within the district develop programs to meet specific educational goals of the school board.

\section*{7. Students as Stakeholders in Education}

Students are the primary stakeholders in education. The primary purpose of why the school was created is for student learning. Thus, students are directly impacted by the educational system and are the greatest stakeholders in education. Students need a good education to receive the knowledge and skills to be successful in life.

\section*{8. Parents as Stakeholders in Education}

Parents play a key role as stakeholders in education, as parents are responsible for raising their children. Parents have a vested interest and are impacted by the education their children receive. They want their children to receive a good education to prepare them for life after leaving home.

Yet, parents also play a role in supplementing the education their children receive. Parents supplement this education by providing support at home with good nutrition and sleep schedules and ensuring homework is completed, exams are studied for, and the school's policies are adhered to, such as attendance requirements.

Parents have a stake in their children's education because they want to ensure schools teach the values they want their children to learn about. They do not want their children to learn about things that parents think are harmful or inappropriate.

\section*{9. Teachers}

Teachers are the ones who actually carry out the work of educating students, making them examples of internal stakeholders. They have a great deal of control over what and how students learn in their classrooms.

Teachers also have a vested interest in ensuring that schools are effective because their jobs depend on their success. If parents think their child is not learning, they may withdraw their child from the school and the school will fail.

As an educator, another reason teachers feel they have a big stake in education is that they feel they have the expertise to know what to teach and how it should be taught to their students.

Thus, teachers try to engage closely with other stakeholders (in particular, parents) to come up with the best approaches to educate each child.

\section*{10. School Administrators}

School administrators include the principal, assistant principals, and other school leaders. They have a great deal of responsibility for ensuring that the school runs smoothly and effectively and that there's a positive school culture.

They are often people employed for their deep knowledge of education, meaning they're a respected source of input on how the school can be improved.

However, school administrators are also often the people who need to listen to other stakeholders and gather their input when making strategic decisions so that the schools reflect the values of their communities.

\section*{Other Stakeholders in Administration of Basic Education}

\section*{6. Business Community}

The business community is an interest group that has a stake in education because they want to ensure that the schools are preparing students for the workforce. They want to make sure that graduates have the skills and knowledge necessary to be successful employees.

The business community also provides many of the resources that schools need, such as funding, books, and supplies. And businesses often partner with schools to provide internship and job opportunities for students.

\section*{6. Philanthropists and Charitable Organizations}

Philanthropists are people who donate money to organizations, typically charities. In the case of education, philanthropists might donate money to schools, scholarships, or educational programs.

Philanthropists have a stake in education because they want their money to be used effectively to improve the lives of others. They want to ensure that their donations are making a difference in the world and that they are supporting a worthy cause.

\section*{7. Local, State and Federal Governments}

Local and state governments have a stake in education because they want to ensure that their citizens are educated and prepared for the workforce.

They also want to make sure that schools are preparing students for the future so that they can be successful, contributing members of society.

Federal governments may also have a stake in ensuring students develop citizenship skills and values so that they can be informed and engaged citizens.

\section*{9. Government Representatives}

Government officials, such as local representatives, members of Congress, and state governors, have a stake in education because they are the elected representatives who set the overall strategic direction of an education system.

They usually run for election with an education platform and, when in office, they have a vested interest in implementing that platform so they can go back to the voters and show results. Should education systems fail, government representatives may also get the blame. They therefore want to keep a keen eye on the direction in which the education system is headed.

\section*{10. Unions}

Unions represent the interests of teachers and other education employees. They negotiate salaries, benefits, and working conditions on behalf of their members.

Unions also work to ensure that their members are treated fairly and have a voice in decisions that affect them.

They want to make sure that teachers have the resources they need to do their jobs effectively and that they are not overworked or underpaid. Workers deserve a fair day's pay for a fair day's work, and unions are in place to ensure this happens.

\section*{TOPIC 5: EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATION}

\section*{Instructional Leaders}
- Principal
- Deputy Principal
- Teachers
- Senior Teacher
- Dean of Students
- Heads of Departments (H.O.Ds)
- Examination Officer
- Director of Studies or Academic officer

\section*{The Role of School Principal \& Deputy as Instructional Leader}
(1) To create a shared vision and clear goals for their schools and ensure continuous progress toward achieving the goals
(2) Support the implementation of high-quality standards based instruction that results in higher levels of achievement for all students
(3) Provide opportunities for all members of the school community to build their capacity and participate in important school decisions

(5) Allocate resources and manage school operations in order to ensure a safe and productive learning environment and engage parents and community members in the educational process and create an environment where community resources support student learning, achievement and wellbeing.
(6) Supervising instruction by stimulating staff development, to influence teacher behaviour in the classroom and to foster selection, development, use and evaluation of good instructional approaches and materials.
(7) School principals as instructional leaders along with teachers become engaged in monitoring learners' progress closely and frequently by means of evaluating tests and examinations.
(8) Promoting a positive school learning climate viewed as one dimension of instructional leadership and serves the principal to influence the social organization and thereby establish environment that supports the instructional process
(9) Protecting instructional time: research conducted during the late 1970s and 1980s indicates the substantial effects of time on students learning.
(10) Providing incentive for teachers: an important part of the principal's role in creating a positive learning climate involves setting up work structure that rewards and recognizes teachers for their efforts.
(11) Providing incentive for learners: this principal's role can create a school climate in which students value academic achievement by frequently rewarding and recognizing students' academic achievement both within the class and before the school as a whole.
(12) Promoting professional development: principals need to promote professional development through organizing and leading in-service training activities and ensure that staff development activities are closely linked to school goals.

\section*{Role of Class Teachers as Instructional Leaders}

\section*{1. Resource Provider}

Teachers help their colleagues by sharing instructional resources. These might include websites, instructional materials, readings, or other resources to use with students. They might also share such professional resources as articles, books, lesson or unit plans, and assessment tools.

\section*{2. Instructional Specialist}

An instructional specialist helps colleagues implement effective teaching strategies. This help might include ideas for differentiating instruction or planning lessons in partnership with fellow teachers. Instructional specialists might study research-based classroom

\section*{3. Curriculum Specialist}

Understanding content standards, how various components of the curriculum link together, and how to use the curriculum in planning instruction and assessment is essential to ensuring consistent curriculum implementation throughout a school. Curriculum specialists lead teachers to agree on standards, follow the adopted curriculum, use common pacing charts, and develop shared assessments.

\section*{4. Classroom Supporter}

Classroom supporters work inside classrooms to help teachers implement new ideas, often by demonstrating a lesson, co-teaching, or observing and giving feedback. Blase and Blase (2006) found that consultation with peers enhanced teachers' self-efficacy (teachers' belief in their own abilities and capacity to successfully solve teaching and learning problems) as they reflected on practice and grew together, and it also encouraged a bias for action (improvement through collaboration) on the part of teachers.

\section*{5. Learning Facilitator}

Facilitating professional learning opportunities among staff members is another role for teacher leaders. When teachers learn with and from one another, they can focus on what most directly improves student learning. Their professional learning becomes more relevant, focused on teachers' classroom work, and aligned to fill gaps in student learning. Such communities of learning can break the norms of isolation present in many schools.

\section*{6. Mentor}

Serving as a mentor for novice teachers is a common role for teacher leaders. Mentors serve as role models; acclimate new teachers to a new school; and advise new teachers about instruction, curriculum, procedure, practices, and politics. Being a mentor takes a great deal of time and expertise and makes a significant contribution to the development of a new professional.

\section*{7. School Leader}

Being a school leader means serving on a committee, such as a school improvement team; acting as a grade-level or department chair; supporting school initiatives; or representing the school on community or district task forces or committees. A school leader shares the vision of the school,
aligns his or her professional goals with those of the school and district, and shares responsibility for the success of the school as a whole.

\section*{8. Data Coach}

Although teachers have access to a great deal of data, they do not often use that data to drive classroom instruction. Teacher leaders can lead conversations that engage their peers in analyzing and using this information to strengthen instruction.

\section*{9. Catalyst for Change}

Teacher leaders can also be catalysts for change, visionaries who are "never content with the status quo but rather always looking for a better way" (Larner, 2004, p. 32). Teachers who take on the catalyst role feel secure in their own work and have a strong commitment to continual improvement. They pose questions to generate analysis of student learning.

\section*{10. Lifelong earner}

Among the most important roles teacher leaders assume is that of learner. Learners model continual improvement, demonstrate lifelong learning, and use what they learn to help all students achieve.
11. Plan and implement a range of teaching programs or courses of study
12. Provide a child safe environment in accordance with the child safe standards
13. Teach an area of the curriculum or a general curriculum to a year level
14. Monitor, evaluate and report student progress in key learning areas
15. Implement strategies to achieve targets related to student learning outcomes
16. Maintain records of class attendance and recording student progress
17. Implement effective student management consistent with the school's strategic plan, and
18. In their first year of teaching work with a mentor to participate in professional development planning, implementation and reflection and developing a professional portfolio.
19. Supervising a range of student activities including support and welfare programs, and 20. Contributing to a range of co-curricular programs

\section*{4. School and Office Routines}

The school routine refers to the programme of the activities that have been planned to take place every day in the school. Different schools have different routines for example, day schools have different routines from boarding schools.

\section*{BENEFITS OF CLASSROOM ROUTINES AND PROCEDURES}

Effective classroom procedures and routines offer many benefits to students. Students who know how they should act in the classroom can be more successful because they can learn and achieve more. Students will spend more time learning instead of getting ready for class or asking questions about what they should do because you've streamlined the process for daily tasks. The benefits of classroom routines and procedures include:
1. Creates consistency: Students will learn what to expect when you're consistent. Routine consistency fosters a positive learning environment because the same rules apply to everyone so no one can be discriminated against or favored.
2. Enhances behavior management: Students will learn your rules and what you do to enforce them. Enforcing your rules will increase your students' respect for you and decrease behavioral problems.
3. Reduces classroom distractions: An established routine will lessen student movement in the classroom or direct it where you want it to go. When the students know what they're supposed to be doing, it will also reduce distractions. If someone comes to class late, they can easily catch up without disrupting the class because they know the class structure.
4. Boosts focus and engagement: Students will become familiar with the classroom flow and what comes next, making it easier for them to be focused and engaged.
5. Creates an effective classroom management plan: The only way for your classroom management plan to work is if you are consistent and enforce the rules. If you don't, students will think they can get away with things, which leads to behavioral problems.
6. Makes lesson planning easier: Once you have a routine, it serves as an outline for lesson planning. It makes lesson planning easier because all you have to do is fill in the blanks based on the times you set for various subjects or activities.

\section*{Sample School Routine:}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}

\section*{Office Routines}

Office routine is a planned sequence of operations for handling recurring school official activities and procedures uniformly. Office routine occupies a significant part of office system and it consists of a number of steps involved in doing a piece of work.

Employers may not feel responsible for a productive routine within the office but it is important to remember that the first few hours of the day can affect productivity for the rest of the work day. A routine at the office involving all your employees is the easiest way to keep them motivated and productive.

Employees may be resistant to having too much structure at work so keep the routine simple and straightforward. Try to encourage your employees to do the following:
1. Be punctual in the morning. If they arrive a little early, they have the opportunity to review the day ahead while it will also make them feel accomplished.
2. Have a cup of tea or coffee. Before they get into their work, encourage them to take five minutes to take a breather and settle in. They should use this time to let go of their stressful commute and anything else not work-related.
3. Avoid being the morning grump. Everyone has their off days but they should not bring their bad attitudes to work. A single moody employee can affect the entire office's morale.
4. Outline their priorities. Hold a quick meeting for everyone to outline their goals for the day and decide what their priority is, as the first few hours are the best for dealing with the most important issues. Encourage them to keep to-do lists and update them daily by ticking off their accomplishments and adding new actions. This time will also allow you as a leader to connect with your team members and set the day's tone.
5. Make important calls or answer urgent emails first. Emails and calls are more likely to be answered within the first few hours of the day, so do not allow projects to remain incomplete because answers were not found.
6. Take a break! Try to get your employees to have at least two breaks during the day: midmorning and lunch. These breaks will revitalize them for the rest of the day.
7. Clean up their space. Designate someone to clean up the workspace at the end of the day, tidying up, moving away stray coffee cups, clearing papers... Rotate this role between all employees: not only will the employees become aware of the mess they make but the office will be spick-and-span for the next working day.

\title{
Different types of administrative records in a learning institution
}

\section*{Types of Administrative Records in a School}

Different Types of Administrative Records a School Must Maintain:

\section*{1. Log Book}

The Log Book is specifically designed for the purpose of containing remarks of the school inspector or other important officers of the education department, who pay an official visit to the school. But it should not be confined to the remarks of the inspecting officers only. It should contain a complete record of the important events that occur during the session. It should also contain the history of the school of a particular year.

Information like the introduction of new text books or apparatus, visits of the inspecting officers, changes in the school routine, absence or illness of any of the official staff etc., should be written in the Log Book. The headmaster is the only authority to make entries in this book.

\section*{2. Admission Register/General Register}

It is a record of all the pupils who arc admitted to a school. According to departmental rules, the admission register is to be preserved permanently in the school. Therefore, it is essential that it should be got specially bound and kept in safe custody. It is to be free from mistakes because this register is at times required by superior authorities in a court of law as an evidence for the date of birth of the pupils. The admission register should contain the following items.
(i) The enrolmentlregistration number of the student.
(ii) Name of the student in full.
(iii) Dais of admission/re-admission and withdrawal/leaving.
(iv) Date of birth of the student. Great care should be taken to ensure that there are no mistakes in entering the date of birth of the student as it is often required as evidence of a child's exact age.

\section*{TEACHING AS A PROFESSION}

In its broadest sense, teaching is a process that facilitates learning. Teaching is the specialized application of knowledge, skills and attributes designed to provide unique service to meet the educational needs of the individual and of society. The choice of learning activities whereby the goals of education are realized in the school is the responsibility of the teaching profession.

In addition to providing students with learning opportunities to meet curriculum outcomes, teaching emphasizes the development of values and guides students in their social relationships. Teachers employ practices that develop positive self-concept in students.

The first thing that you must know about teaching as a profession is that teaching is about inspiring and motivating students to realize and exceed their potential. The greatest teachers of all time have devoted their lives to inspiring and empowering their students to achieve great things and be good human beings.

\section*{Basic Characteristics of Teaching Profession}

Following are the basic characteristics of the teaching profession:
1. Teaching is an interaction between teacher and students.
2. Providing guidance and training to the students.
3. Increases the knowledge, skills, and creativity of students.
4. Helps in the self-development of the students.
5. Teachers are a source of motivation and inspiration to the students.
6. Teachers build confidence and increase the self-esteem of the students.
7. Teachers cultivate obedience and discipline in the students.
8. Helping the students to achieve their goals.
9. Develop communication skills in the students.
10. Teachers help in building future leaders with their guidance.
11. The continued professionalization of teaching is a long-standing goal of the all teachers. Teaching Associations continue to work to advance teaching as a profession. Professionalism is a complex and elusive concept; it is dynamic and fluid.
12. . It serves a great social purpose. Teachers carry responsibilities weighted with social purpose. Through a rigid and self-imposed adherence to the Code of Professional Conduct, which sets out their duties and responsibilities, teachers pass on their accumulated culture and assist each student under their care in achieving self-realization.
13. There is cooperation achieved through a professional organization. Cooperation plays an important role in the development of the teaching profession because it represents a banding together to achieve commonly desired purposes. The teaching profession has won its well-deserved place in the social order through continuous cooperation in research, professional preparation and strict adherence to the Code of Professional Conduct, which obligates every teacher to treat each student within a sacred trust. Teachers have control or influence over their own governance, socialization into teaching and research connected with their profession.
14. There is a formal period of preparation and a requirement for continuous growth and development. Teachers are required to complete a defined teacher preparation program followed by a period of induction or internship prior to being granted permanent certification. This period includes support for the formative growth of teachers and judgments about their competence. Teachers are devoted to continuous development of their ability to deliver their service.
15. There is a degree of autonomy accorded the professional. Teachers have opportunities to make decisions about important aspects of their work. Teachers apply reasoned
judgment and professional decision making daily in diagnosing educational needs, prescribing and implementing instructional programs, and evaluating the progress of students. Teacher judgment unleashes learning and creates the basis for experience.
16. The profession has control or influence over education standards, admissions, licensing, professional development, ethical and performance standards, and professional discipline. As professionals, teachers are governed in their professional relationships with other members, school boards, students and the general public by rules of conduct set out in the Association's Code of Professional Conduct. The code stipulates minimum standards of professional conduct for teachers, but it is not an exhaustive list of such standards.

\section*{Qualities of a Good Teacher}

\section*{1. Good Teachers Are Strong Communicators.}

When it comes to effective teaching, strong communication skills are a must,
By communicating with students at the beginning of the year about how math applies to their favorite hobbies, sports and future careers, the teacher and his students are able to approach the subject in a more enjoyable way that better supported their learning.

\section*{2. Good Teachers Listen Well.}

Great communication doesn't stop when the teacher is done talking. Listening well is one of the most important skills needed to be a teacher.

Teachers that are skilled in listening and observing often pick up on what isn't being said, such as any anxieties a student may have, and can then help the student build their skills and confidence levels.

\section*{3. Good Teachers Focus on Collaboration.}

Working in education means you're never truly working alone. From paraprofessionals and teaching assistants to other classroom teachers and school leaders, working as a teacher often means working effectively in a group. It's also important to keep an open mind and learn from other educators.

The key to success in this kind of environment, is the ability to collaborate. You really need to be able to fill various roles in order to collaborate effectively. If you already have someone on your team who is going to be the one to critique all of the suggestions made, then you don't need to join in on that. Instead, maybe you need to be the person who is going to come up with creative ideas. You need to have that flexibility.

\section*{4. Good Teachers Are Adaptable.}

Effective teachers need to be able to work in a constantly evolving environment and adjust their teaching methods based on the age of their students, the resources available and changing curriculum, practices and requirements.
"Change is a constant," she said. "Learning how to adapt and adjust, that's been one of the skills that's been most helpful in my career. It's about keeping my finger on the pulse of who my students are over time and all the trends, standards and new research, and being able to continually improve."

Adaptability is also one of the key skills needed to be a teacher who may be educating students of varying grade levels or different learning styles.
"You have to be able to adapt based upon your audience,"

\section*{5. Good Teachers Are Engaging.}

Being able to engage students with humor, creative lessons and a strong classroom presence is an important part of what makes someone a good teacher. If you were to envision that teacher that
you would want in your life, even now, you're going to want someone who is very engaging in front of the classroom.

A good teacher will perform for their students to keep them going... It's not about sitting back and just lecturing, it's about engaging in the work. What an engaging teacher looks like will vary depending on grade level and subject matter.

In kindergarten, an engaging teacher might be one who gets down on the floor to do activities with their students on their level. In high school, an engaging teacher may be one who thinks outside the box, adds humor to their lessons and finds creative ways to bring learning into the real world.

\section*{6. Good Teachers Show Empathy.}

Another key to engaging students and improving their learning is to treat each student as an individual, by being empathetic and understanding to what may be going on in their lives. "We need to take a moment to think back and think about what could be going on in this student's life," he said. "It's so important to be observant, attentive, and empathetic and always have a positive attitude."

Something that may be easy for one student may not be so easy for someone else. Everyone learns differently, whether it be faster or slower than normal, learns better by writing, reading or hands-on. Teachers need to always keep this in mind and always pay close attention to ensure each student is on the track they need to be.

\section*{7. Good Teachers Have Patience.}

No matter what grade level you're teaching, your patience will be tested while working as an educator. Whether you're managing classroom behavior, working with colleagues with different views, or communicating student issues or progress with parents, patience is one of the most important skills to practice as a teacher.

More often than not you actually have to have more patience with the parents than you do with the students. Parents are coming in with their perceptions of what happened to them when they were students or previous experiences that may have been detrimental to their child... You have to be patient and understanding of them

\section*{8. Good Teachers Value Real-World Learning.}

Teachers who bring their students' learning into the real world are often some of the most engaging. But it's important for teachers to bring their own learning into the real world, too.

One of the best preparations for effective teaching is to ensure that education students get plenty of classroom experience. They spend time at a local school once a week to collaborate with teacher partners and apply their learning to the classroom. A year-long student teaching experience is also a powerful way to ensure soon-to-be teachers have the time to hone their teaching skills.
"Our students have that benefit of seeing the practical application (of) what they're learning in the moment they're learning it," she said.

\section*{9. Good Teachers Share Best Practices.}

A willingness to share knowledge and experiences with others is one of the most important qualities of a good teacher.

Education is a hands-on field and often requires experimentation within the classroom to discover which methods of communicating with students work best. Part of being an effective teacher is sharing your findings and best practices with others in the field.

\section*{10. Good Teachers Are Lifelong Learners.}

One of the key skills needed to be a good teacher is a dedication to continued education and a love of learning. Whether you're learning more about your subject area, learning new methods of communication or even exploring how to bring more technology into your classroom, continuing to expand your own knowledge is key to expanding that of your students.
"No matter your education level, you can learn something from everyone you encounter, including fellow educators as well as students," she said. "Being willing to continually add tools to your toolbox - even unconventional ones at times - will keep things new and exciting, as well as giving you excellent skills."

\section*{Reasons for Choosing Teaching Career: Benefits/Importance Teaching as a Profession}

\section*{3. Work Satisfaction}

The joy of making a difference and making a change in the right direction is like no other. Teaching provides job satisfaction that is like no other.

\section*{8. A lifelong learner itself}

As learning has no boundaries, one can never stop learning. In the teaching profession also, the teacher can learn at any stage and age too. Even R.N. Tagore has said that
"Lamp can never light another lamp unless if continues to burn its own flame same as a teacher can never teach unless he/ she is a learner".

\section*{9. Fun and learning together}

Among all careers and professions, I found teaching much better. The Importance of the Teaching Profession is that one can experience fun and learn together. Besides instructing students, teachers can involve in other curriculum activities.

\section*{10. Experience To Handle Different Children}

School or college is a place where different students with different mindsets reach. The teacher must have the ability to handle all children normal, intelligent, or physically disabled.

One characteristic of the teaching profession involves ethics and discipline. Teachers teach ethical values which make students more disciplined. Ethical behavior encourages students to know what is bad or good for them.

\section*{13. Setting up Role Model For Others}

Being a teacher isn't much complex but being a favorite of all is what matters. Teachers should inspire students to found their hidden talents and achieve their aim. An inspired teacher can make students motivated by setting up Role models.

\section*{TEACHERS' TRADE UNIONS}

A teachers' union is a special type of labor union designed to fight for the rights of educators. These organizations play critical roles not only in securing benefits for teachers but also shaping the way education works.

The teachers' unions' purpose is to help them; they aim to achieve proper functioning of the education system. These unions are made up of people interested in and passionate about education. Teachers have limited opportunities to develop and little influence to change this, so they need a meaningful and independent voice at the level of policy and practice, labor carried out by unions, to make a significant change and solve your working conditions and professional learning needs.

\section*{IMPORTANCE/PURPOSE OF FORMING TRADE UNIONS: Influence of the Trade}

\section*{Unions on the Teaching Profession}
1. Developing a negotiation plan focused on social dialogue so that the voice of teachers is heard.
2. Ensure access to professional development is provided to meet the need to train educators.
3. Help build the narrative about public education, which supports changing how people view investment in education resources.
4. Developing an extended bargaining agenda: the importance of social dialogue. Building professional issues into social dialogue processes ensures that teachers have a genuine independent voice to represent them and that contractual safeguards embed and protect teachers' rights to professional development.
5. Meeting teachers' professional needs: educating the educators. Education trade unions play a key role in ensuring teachers' access to professional development by providing professional learning opportunities independently or in partnership with others.
6. Facilitating self-organising. Engagement in teachers' professional needs opens up opportunities for self-organising in which union members work together to identify and address their own professional needs. Such approaches support individual teachers but also help build the collective capacity of the union organisation.
7. Shaping the discourse about quality education and support for the teaching profession. Education trade unions act as advocates for quality education and investment in education as a public good. This work performs a vital role in framing the narrative about public education and can help shift popular thinking about investment in the resources required to address the problems identified in this report.
8. Building alliances and developing partnerships. Education trade unions work with a wide range of governmental and non-governmental bodies to ensure teachers' professional needs are addressed
9. Supporting teachers' career and professional development. Professional development is vital to career progression and therefore a central trade union concern.
10. Unions as the teachers' voice at work. Union members expect the union to be their voice on all the key issues that impact them in their daily work as teachers. There is no simple separation between 'industrial' and 'professional' issues - a teacher's experience of work is invariably a mixture of both. Unions exist to give voice to employees in relation to the totality of their experience as workers.
11. Building and strengthening the union. A focus on professional issues enables unions to engage members who otherwise might not participate in union activity. Developing member engagement and connections builds union identity amongst the membership and strengthens the organisation. Such work develops the activist base of the union.
12. Enhanced teachers' good working conditions help in enhancing service delivery and hence good performance.
13. Satisfaction with the working conditions
14. Positive association between union membership and teachers' and principals' satisfaction with working conditions.

\section*{TOPIC 6. FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT IN LEARNING INSTITUTIONS}

Finance management is the strategic planning and managing of an individual or organization's finances to better align their financial status to their goals and objectives. Depending on the size of a school, finance management seeks to optimize shareholder value, generate profit, mitigate risk, and safeguard the organization's financial health in the short and long term. When working with individuals, finance management may entail planning for retirement, college savings, and other personal investments.

\section*{Cycle of Financial Management}

The financial management cycle is a financial planning process critical to a company's growth and development. It includes:
- Planning and budgeting
- Resource allocation
- Operations and monitoring
- Evaluation and reporting

Effective financial management aligned with an organization's goals and objectives can lead to greater efficiency and stability. These parts of the financial management cycle must work together to be the most effective.

\section*{1. Planning and budgeting}

During this analytical phase in the financial management cycle, a company uses past and current financial data to set financial targets, modify objectives, and make changes to the current budget. This phase will typically involve detailed planning as well as a big picture one, meaning a company will look at day-to-day operations, long-term financial plans, and try to link financial targets to these activities.

The goal is to create a strategic financial plan for the company that aligns with objectives for the next three to five years. When setting specific budgets, a company may budget for one fiscal year at a time. A big reason for this is that a budget involves many moving parts that are subject to change by market fluctuations.

\section*{2. Resource allocation}

Financial managers assign value to capital resources (anything a company uses to manufacture/produce goods/services) and offer advice on allocating these resources based on criteria like projected company growth and financial goals. Resource allocation is important because it allows a company to have a long-term financial plan focused on its business objectives. Financial management professionals help companies by providing a framework for using capital resources and creating a portfolio that will generate the most revenue, given the company's financial status.

\section*{3. Operations and monitoring}

This phase is critical to protect against fraudulent activity, errors, compliance issues, or other variances in the allocation of funds, etc. Financial management professionals should run regular financial reviews of business operations and cash flow. These periodic reviews can help mitigate fraud and identify other issues. It is a preventative step that ensures the continuity of business operations by securing the validity and accuracy of a company's financial processes.

\section*{4. Evaluation and reporting}

Financial management professionals should evaluate a company's current financial management system and propose changes when necessary. Financial reports and financial data can be helpful when assessing the efficiency and success of an existing system.

Some criteria a financial management professional may consider when evaluating a financial management system include security, compliance, company data needs, and level of support
needed. These criteria vary by the company's size, industry, current financial situation, and longterm goals.

Financial management professionals should be able to offer research-based suggestions that can help a company securely store and manage financial data in compliance with relevant laws and harness that data when needed.

\section*{Basic financial management practices in a learning institution.}
- Budgeting: A school budget is a financial plan that reflects the educational goals and needs of a school.
- Book keeping: Bookkeeping is the recording of financial transactions of a business or an individual. It is part of the process of accounting and involves organizing, classifying and maintaining financial records and documents. Bookkeeping helps to track and manage the financial health and performance of an organization. There are different methods of bookkeeping, such as single-entry and double-entry systems. Bookkeepers are the people who handle the bookkeeping tasks for companies.
- Accounting: Accounting is the recording of financial transactions along with storing, sorting, retrieving, summarizing, and presenting the results in various reports and analyses. Accounting is also a field of study and profession dedicated to carrying out those tasks.
- Auditing of finances: Financial auditing is the process of examining an organization's (or individual's) financial records to determine if they are accurate and in accordance with any applicable rules, regulations, and laws. It is an accounting process used in business to present an accurate account of a company's financial business transactions. A financial audit is usually conducted on an annual basis by an independent body to provide credibility to an organization's financial statements.

\section*{PURPOSE OF FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT}

Financial management involves analyzing money and investments to make the right decisions for the long and short term. The goals differ depending on whether you are working with an organization or an individual. Here are some goals of financial management in an institution:
1. Profit maximization: When marginal cost equals marginal revenue, the institution has achieved profit maximization. This is one of the main objectives of financial management.
2. Wealth maximization: Once an organization has achieved profit maximization, the next goal is growing wealth for stakeholders. A successful investment plan contributes significantly to the business.

\section*{BUDGETING}

\section*{Meaning of Budgeting}

Budgeting is the process of designing, implementing and operating financial plan. It is the managerial process of budget planning and preparation, budgetary control and the related procedures. Budgeting is the highest level of accounting in terms of future which indicates a definite course of action and not merely reporting.

It is an integral part of such managerial policies as long-range planning, cash flow, capital expenditure and project management.

\section*{Purpose and Objectives of Budgeting}

The overall purpose of budgeting is to plan different phases of business operations, coordinate activities of different departments of the firm and to ensure effective control over it.

To accomplish this purpose, a budget aims at attaining the following objectives:
1. To prognosticate the firm's future sales, production cost and other expenses in order to earn desired amount of income and minimise the possibility of business losses.
2. To anticipate the firm's future financial condition and future need for funds to be employed in the business with a view to keeping the firm solvent.
3. To decide the composition of capitalisation in order to ensure availability of funds at reasonable cost.
4. To coordinate the efforts of different departments of the firm toward the common objectives.
5. To accelerate efficiency of operations of different departments, divisions and cost centres of the firm.
6. To fix responsibilities of different departmental heads.
7. To ensure effective control over the firm's cash, inventory and sales, and
8. To facilitate centralised control over the firm through the budgetary system.

\section*{Procedures of Estimating and Approving a School Budget.}

Budgeting involves precise financial planning to ensure funds get disbursed to the right programs in order to support a rich, high-quality learning environment for every pupil.

Understandably, the task of drafting a school budget can seem daunting at first, but it's all a matter of strategic planning through considering past experiences and future expectations.

Here is a brief guide to school budgeting, highlighting five critical steps in the process:

\section*{Step 1: Review spending from the past year}

Begin by analyzing the previous year's budget and performance to gain insights into the school's spending.

The point of this is not to copy exactly what you did last year but to increase the next budget's accuracy by identifying underspends and overspends. It's an opportunity to make improvements on resource allocation.

A thorough review of the last school budget will also help you form a base template or benchmark for the new draft.

\section*{Step 2: Create a list of goals and objectives}

Make educated forecasts of your school's financial needs for the upcoming fiscal year and create a prioritized list of measurable goals.

Be sure to consider and account for the impacts that external and internal factors, such as school development aspirations, legal compliance, economic stability, and curriculum changes, may have on the school budget.

In short, every financial goal must be realistic, achievable, and in line with the school's core mission.

\section*{Step 3: Calculate existing expenditures}

Evaluate the actual costs of various expenses within the school to work out its spending capacity. Sum up all the direct expenditures, recurring expenses, technology service providers, and indirect costs, and pit them against the available funds to gauge the school's fiscal fitness.

Doing this should tell you how much wiggle room there is in the school's budget and the areas to prioritize when working with limited funds.

\section*{Step 4: Implement a strategic plan of action}

You need to understand three things when creating a financial plan: the funds available spending opportunities or expenses the budget's objectives

A plan of action brings all these variables together and translates the school budget into manageable and immediately actionable procedures.

The action plan should highlight the steps for acquiring, disbursing, and spending funds earmarked for various opportunities. It should also include operations plans and key performance indicators for all expenditures.

\section*{Step 5: Follow up}

The final step in school budgeting is evaluation.
Follow up on the budget's implementation to make sure everything goes as planned. Check in regularly with the institution's finance department for progress reports and audits to maintain accountability for funds utilization and visibility into the financial pipelines.

The ongoing evaluation also helps you identify efficiency or accuracy improvements for the next annual budget or supplementary funding.

\section*{School Budget}

A school budget is a financial plan that reflects the educational goals and needs of a school or a school district. It is based on a detailed analysis of the income and expenses of the past, present, and future. A school budget helps to allocate the necessary resources to carry out the educational program and to monitor the financial performance of the school or the district.

A budget translated the vision and missions of school to annual plans by mapping the resources against the yearly goals and comparing the income and expense trends of past, present and future.

\section*{Supplementary Budget}

A supplemental budget is a budget that provides additional funding for activities or expenditures that were not adequately covered or anticipated in the original budget. A supplemental budget may be requested by state departments, agencies, or the Governor in the course of a fiscal year. The funding for a supplemental budget needs to be available from other sources, such as revenue surplus or savings.

A supplementary budget is a request by state departments and agencies for additional funding in the course of a financial year. It is meant to take care of expenditure that was not factored in during budget-making.

\section*{Importance of Observing the Value of Integrity when Preparing a Budget in a Learning Institution}

The Recommendation on Budgetary Governance sets out ten principles which provide concise overview of good practices across the full spectrum of budget activity and aim to give practical guidance for designing, implementing and improving budget systems to make a positive impact on citizens' lives.
1. Manage budgets within clear, credible and predictable limits for fiscal policy.
2. Closely align budgets with the medium-term strategic priorities of government.
3. Design the capital budgeting framework in order to meet national development needs in a cost-effective and coherent manner.
4. Ensure that budget documents and data are open, transparent and accessible.
5. Provide for an inclusive, participative and realistic debate on budgetary choices.
6. Present a comprehensive, accurate and reliable account of the public finances.
7. Actively plan, manage and monitor budget execution.
8. Ensure that performance, evaluation and value for money are integral to the budget process.
9. Identify, assess and manage prudently longer-term sustainability and other fiscal risks.
10. Promote the integrity and quality of budgetary forecasts, fiscal plans and budgetary implementation through rigorous quality assurance including independent audit.

\section*{SOURCES OF SCHOOL FUNDS}

Today in Kenya, there are numerous ways students can fund for their higher Education programmes. We explore some of the common and most popular ways students fund for their college or university education in Kenya

\section*{1. Parallel Program}

If you are rich and you can pay for your own education program, then this is the best way to go. This one also guarantees you to take the best course you want, place of study and time to study. It is also less stressing and causes minimal interruptions during study

\section*{2. HELB}

Kenya's government body HELB aka Higher Loans Education board, is the best option if you fail the one above.

\section*{3. Grants}

A grant is a way the government funds your ideas and projects to provide public services and stimulate the economy. Grants support critical recovery initiatives, innovative research,
and many other programs listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA). A grant is one of many different forms of federal financial assistance.

However, this one picks students according to their KCSE results and may not favor average or low grade students. One big advantage of this loan is that is it easy to get and allows payment after employment of the graduate.

However, learners don't get $100 \%$ chance to pick their places of study, course and even the course to take

\section*{4. NGAAF- National Government Affirmative Action Fund}

The National Government Affirmative Action Fund (NGAAF) which falls under the Ministry of Public Service, Youth and Gender Affairs is here to finance the students who miss on the two above.

NGAAF works as the CDF - Constituency Development Fund, including the mode of financing One big advantage of this method is that it does to allocate funds based on the KCSE score, but rather more partial and considerate.

However, the disadvantage is that one has to be already in school before can qualify to apply. Due to high competition, the allocation is not as big as the HELB or any other loan since it is based on equity for all.

\section*{5. CDF- Constituencies Development Fund}

It is better known as National Government Constituencies Development Fund. CDF is more like the NGAAF, however it is only accessible to constituency level. It is easier to get this allocation than NGAAF, however the amount is rather small. CDF is sometimes dominated by political affiliations and members from other constituencies could likely miss out.

\section*{6. Talent Scholarship}

We have those students who are exceptionally talented in sports or other areas such as music or scouts. Such students could land an independent sponsor or even the college they want to study from with the aim of exploiting their talents.

The downside is that this method is purely based on luck, and it should not discourage you from seeking sponsorship from your talent as long as your sponsor can benefit from the talent

\section*{7. Banking Scholarship}

Most of top leading banks in Kenya have university programmes for students in Kenya. The advantage of this fund is that is very lucrative and can guarantee employment in the same bank However, these banks look only for the top cream in the KCSE results, making it virtually inaccessible for average students. Popular bank scholarships include Equity Bank's Wings to Fly and KCB Bank scholarships.

\section*{8. NGOs}

Famous NGOs in Kenya such as UKAID and USAID are a very good source for higher education funding.

One big hit is that the funding takes care of students needs even during holidays.
It does not choose students based on top marks, but rather best and average
However, the pitfall of this fund comes in hand with levels of wealth, if you are in a well off family, it is not easy to get such a funding.

It needs destitute and orphaned students on many occasions
A big hit of this fund comes in handy due to availability of thousands of NGOs ready to fund for students.

\section*{9. Government Institutes}

Government parastatals such as KYEOP, Ajiri, NYS, TVET, and Polytechnics are a good source of funding. These comes in handy for all average students who can have their shot to excel in their career.

They are holistic and does not choose based on grades. This kind of funding is also among the top best since it teaches hand on skill courses and students can graduate within months of training and receive employment.

Some are so good that they directly employ their graduates such as NYS graduates joining police force or the army.

\section*{10. Self -Student Funding}

Though it looks unrealistic, this kind of funding is gradually gain popularity. Many Kenyan students whose funding sources suddenly collapsed mid their career have chosen to be fighter rather than losers.

Many will open small business or do manual works on part time basis, enough to pay for their school fees. However, it is the best kind of funding since it so stressing

\section*{10. Religious Funds}

Even though it is not popular, it is so common in today world of funding in Kenya. Churches, mosques and temples are all good sources of funding for students. This kind of funding can be accessed via the information office within the church compound. The big hit of this is that it is more on equity and has high chances of getting the funds However, is very religious biased and it discriminates members who don't follow their believes, Anglican and Catholic are the leading religious groups on student funding.

\section*{TAKING OVER AND HANDING OVER PROCESS}

\section*{The Process:}

When are you leaving a position, it is likely that your manager or supervisor will ask you to help in the handover period to your successor. Being organized and proactive will help to ensure that your company has a smooth transition and you leave with an excellent professional reputation.

\section*{1. Organizing Your Handover}

Discuss the handover with your manager. You should start by having a detailed discussion with your manager to determine exactly how they want you to handle the handover. Depending on your job and how your manager likes to work, you may be asked to contribute extensively to the handover. This could include the new person shadowing you for a few days or longer.

In most instances you will have to at least prepare a formal handover document.
Discuss this with your manager and find out how much you are expected to contribute, and what the focus of your handover should be.

Draw up an early outline of your handover document. Once you have a clear idea of your manager's expectations, you can start by drawing up a draft handover document. This will help you to organize yourself, and catalogue all the various tasks and pieces of information that you will need to pass on during the handover period. This document should include:
- Detailed information on your day-to-day activities, tasks and priorities.
- An outline of the key points of the role.
- A clear outline of what is expected of your successor.
- A list of any essential files that will be handed over. This might include a particular contract, or work programme.

Tie up loose ends. If you know you will be leaving your post soon, it can be helpful to put in a little extra work to make sure that you tie up any loose ends. You will get a sense of satisfaction
at achieving this, and you will also be helping your successor start off with a clean slate. Doing this will also help ensure that you leave on excellent terms and with a good reputation.
- This won't always be possible, but if you have something that is nearly over the line, put in a little extra work to get it done.
- A new person coming into a deal right when it is near the line may struggle to get it closed, because they are unfamiliar with all its intricacies.
- Let your manager and/or colleagues know what deliverables and milestones you will have completed before your last day.

Communicate with your colleagues. Before your successor is due to start, try to make some time to talk to your colleagues about the handover and ask if there is anything your colleagues think you should highlight. If there is a developing issue that you are unaware of, this is a good opportunity to touch base and find out.
- Developing issues are not likely to affect your final days, but if you are aware of them then you can flag them up to your successor.
- This is also a chance to make sure everyone knows you're leaving and when. Let your colleagues know about the handover period, so that they can take it into consideration.
- Your productivity is likely to slow during the handover, so its good practice to give your colleagues some advance warning.

Write up a formal handover document. The final step of your handover preparation is to complete a formal handover document. You can build on the draft document, but try to elaborate and include all the important information. You will need to run through the document with your manager and any other key staff it will affect. Try to have this completed and sent to your successor at least a few days before they are set to start. The content will vary from job to job, but it may include some of the following:
- A list and timetable of actions.
- A briefing of ongoing issues.
- A calendar of forthcoming events and deadlines.
- Passwords and login information.
- A list of useful contacts.
- A guide to navigating files and folders on the computer system.

\section*{2. Managing the Handover Period}

Allow as much time as possible. When your successor begins in the office, you may still be around and be asked to do a more complete handover. The length of this will vary, but in some instances you will be given a few days or longer to help the new person get to grips with the job. Generally the more time you have available for a full handover, the more information you will be able to pass on.

There are bound to be things that you forgot about, and having someone shadow you is a good way to expose them to the variety of day-to-day activity.

Hand over key documents personally. During the handover, it is good practice to ensure that all the key pieces of data and documentation and handed over personally. This will help you to make sure that the most important things are dealt with appropriately and priorities are clearly set out. Handing over documents face-to-face means that complex information can be discussed fully before you leave.
- This opportunity to explain key information, and for your successor to ask you direct questions is vital for a good handover.
- This will also give you an opportunity to provide nuance and context in a discussion that might have been overlooked otherwise.

Make the effort to help. If you are in the office with your successor, you should always be attentive and proactive. Make the effort to identify and help resolve any occurring issues. Your successor may be a little shy or intimidated in their first few days, and may not want to hassle you with questions.
- Make sure you make it clear that you are there to help, and you welcome queries.
- By doing this, you will be helping to foster a situation in which the responsibility for the handover is shared between you and your successor

Have a final handover meeting. The last thing to do before you leave and complete the handover, is to do full handover meeting with your successor. Ask your successor to bring along any outstanding questions they have, and the notes they have made. This meeting is a great opportunity for the new person to ensure that they understand their role and responsibilities.
- Any uncertainties can be cleared up in the meeting.
- Depending on where you work, it might be prudent to invite your manager or supervisor to attend the meeting.
- You should certainly inform your manager of when and where it is taking place, and ask them if there is anything they would like to add

\section*{3. Thinking of Long-Term Development}

Highlight available support and training. Try to think of the handover as an opportunity for you to really contribute to giving someone the best possible chance to succeed. You are not just trying to hand off tasks and jobs, but are trying to help your successor's professional development and your former employer's long term-health.
- Do this by pointing out any relevant training opportunities that you know of
- Perhaps when you started the job, you received a suite of training to help you adapt and develop.
- Be sure you mention this to your successor, and encourage them to explore the possibilities.

Don't neglect the working culture. If you are spending time with the person who will be filling your position, it's important not to focus solely on technical aspects of the job. Each place has a unique working environment and culture that can be intimidating or confusing for a newcomer. Be sure to set some time aside to give the new person the lowdown on how the office functions.
- Make the effort to take them around the office and introduce them to everyone.
- Be sure you clearly define the role of the new employee as well as existing employees.
- If the job description of the new arrival is slightly different to yours, or their responsibilities and priorities are focused elsewhere, make sure existing staff recognize this.

Provide your contact details. If you really want to go the extra mile, you could provide the new employee with your contact details. You might say that they can contact you if there is a major issue or they need a little guidance. Not everyone will be happy to do this, and it is likely to depend on your relationship with your former employer.
- Often a problem can be resolved with a simple email.
- Offering to help out after you leave will make a good impression and help boost your reputation.

\section*{CHANGE MANAGEMENT}

Change management refers to any adjustments to company operations; it can be as simple as employee promotions or major as a merger.

Change management can occur circumstantially or planned and introduced slowly. The goal is to transition smoothly and efficiently. It's best if changes can be planned to avoid disruptions and employee resistance.
