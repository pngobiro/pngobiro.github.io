                            <li>Many teachers would think of awarding a grade to a learner to show their progress in learning,</li>
                            <li>However, it is important to first answer the following Question, What's in a grade?</li>
                            <li>This is a question with a simple answer -nothing. It's meaningless.</li>
                            <li>Grades don't tell a student anything.</li>
                            <li>Here's a logical example:</li>

                        <p>Both learners have an average grade of 8. But what does it really say？If you just show your learner this grade，it means nothing. If you dig deeper and take a look at the process，you can see that one learner actually did better than the other. James shows progress and improvement in the learning. Peter has the same average grade as James，but he's stuck. He doesn't get a complete grip on the learning material，and only masters some parts of it. This proves that a grade doesn't show the real value：the process of improvement or the learning progress</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Competency based learning utilizes more of formative assessment as opposed to summative assessment.</li>
                            <li>A teacher uses different ways to record information about learner performance in various concepts that they teach.</li>
                            <li>They may use tools such as: Anecdotal Records, Profiling, Checklists, Rating Scales ,Journaling, Portfolio:</li>
                            <li>Progress records are then developed using information from these tools, and such a record would show progress with standards in a detailed manner and ensure that grading is fair and consistent for all learners.</li>
