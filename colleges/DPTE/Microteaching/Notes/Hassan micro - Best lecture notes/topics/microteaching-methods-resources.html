                            <li>Take a facilitative role in the discussion</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The Learner Should:</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">7. Field Trip method/ educational trips/excursion</h4>
                        <p>Field trip involves taking students outside the classroom setting to have first hand experiences of what happens in our environment or real life situations.</p>
                        <p>The method enables the students to make useful observations and collect information, which cannot be obtained within the classroom.</p>
                        <p>Experiences acquired during field trip are usually long lasting and cannot easily be forgotten by the students.</p>
                        <p>Examples of areas where students can undertake field trip include erosion sites, industries, oil spillage sites, mountains or hills, rivers, hospitals etc. A study of these phenomena will be more meaningful when students visit the affected sites than when discussed under the classroom setting.</p>
                        <h5>Suggestions for the Effective Use of Field Trip</h5>
                        <ol>
                            <li>The teacher should first discuss the idea of taking students on a field trip with the school authority for approval.</li>
                            <li>Subsequently, she should write to the authority of the area to be visited for permission to visit, time of the visit as well as the date of the visit. Finally request for any written rules guiding the place.</li>
                            <li>Before the trip the teacher should then discuss with the students concerning the trip, the aim of the visit, materials to take along ego pen, pencil, exercise book, ruler etc.</li>
                            <li>Furthermore, the teacher should inform the students about the rules guiding the place, possible dangers, things to look out for as well as method of reporting their observations.</li>
                            <li>The teacher should make sure that the field experience fits properly into the instructional sequence.</li>
                            <li>The teacher should carry first aid kit along in case of any accidents involving students</li>
                            <li>Ensure adequate arrangement for transportation in the case of trips involving long distances.</li>
                            <li>After the trip, examine the students on the specimens and information collected from the trip. This has to be in connection with the report of the trip in order to facilitate retention of the experiences from the trip.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <h5>Advantages of Field Trip</h5>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Field trip provides the students with the opportunity of having first hand knowledge of certain phenomena that occur in our environment.</li>
                            <li>It helps to generate and sustain students' interest in the subject.</li>
                            <li>With field trip, motivation to work is usually very high.</li>
                            <li>It aids retention of information since the experiences are long lasting.</li>
                            <li>Field trip can help students to develop interest in certain professions e.g. engineering, medicine etc.</li>
                            <li>It helps to channel student's experiences towards one direction.</li>
                            <li>Field trip helps students to understand man's relationship with his environment</li>
                        </ol>
                        <h5>Disadvantages of Field Trip</h5>
                        <ol>
                            <li>If it is not well planned, it becomes a waste of time and resources.</li>
                            <li>It is extremely tedious to carry out field trip especially when it involves long distance trip.</li>
                            <li>In some situations, accident may occur in the course of a field trip.</li>
                            <li>In most cases, field trip time encroaches into other lesson periods. This would likely result in conflict between the teachers involved if it is not properly handled.</li>
                            <li>Field trip results in extra financial expenditure on the part of the school and students.</li>

                        <p>Experimentation is a method of learning concepts through been involved in the process of investigation by doing practical activities.</p>
                        <p>Experimentation involves activity-oriented learning that helps learners to acquire important skills such as; observation, measuring, classifying objects or things, defining variable operationally, designing experiments, interpreting data, hypothesizing, predicting etc.</p>
                        <img src="../assets/images/2025_06_19_46598a250aabfc9c621cg-156-1.jpg" alt="Two young students wearing safety goggles and lab coats are conducting a science experiment with beakers and chemicals in a laboratory setting." class="content-image">
                        <p>The process of experimentation takes place in three steps:</p>

                        </ol>
                        <h6>a)Phase One: Pre-experimentation Session</h6>
                        <p>This involves:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Assembling in advance all the equipment andmaterials for the exercise.</li>
                            <li>Checking if the materials are in good working condition.</li>
                            <li>The experiment is trial tested by carrying it out first to ensure that it's achievable-This reduces errors which the teacher may have committed in the actual laboratory session.</li>
                            <li>Arranging The sitting arrangements of students</li>
                            <li>Setting The time to spend in carrying out the investigation</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h6>b)Phase Two: Experimentation Session</h6>
                        <ul>
                            <li>During this session, the teacher will first of all interact with the students by telling them what to do, the purpose of the experiment, the procedure to be followed in carrying out the investigation as well as safety measures to be taken to avoid incidence of accident.</li>
                            <li>While the students are now working with their equipment and materials, the teacher's duty is to be an overseer.</li>
                            <li>He works round the class to make sure that all the students are following the procedure carefully.</li>
                            <li>The teacher clarifies any doubt or problem arising from the students and by so doing gives them adequate encouragement and support in the learning process.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h6>c)Phase Three: Post experimention session</h6>
                        <ul>
                            <li>In this session, the teacher discusses the result of the investigation in order to clarify students who may be in doubt.</li>
                            <li>He can assign marks to the work done by the students.</li>
                            <li>The teacher can also summarize the process as well as the result of the investigation in the form of backboard summary.</li>
                            <li>The students are allowed to clean up their tables and wash off equipment before leaving the laboratory.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h5>Suggestions for the Effective Use of Experimentation</h5>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Experiments should be based on students' background and availability of materials.</li>
                            <li>The teacher should ensure that the time frame for the experimentation will be such that students will be able to achieve results at the end of the time.</li>
                            <li>The language of instruction for any investigation should be very clear and within the child's chronological age.</li>
                            <li>The teacher should make sure that the equipment for students are in good working condition and enough materials are available for all the students.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <h5>Advantages of Experimentation</h5>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Experimentation enables students to have direct sensory experience</li>
                            <li>Experimentation fosters opportunities for the acquisition of science process skills e.g. manipulation, measuring, classifying etc.</li>
                            <li>It helps in the retention of information as the students interact with the scientific process.</li>
                            <li>The uses of experiments help students to develop scientific attitude such as enquiry, curiosity, carefulness, objectivity, honesty etc.</li>
                            <li>Experimental works help to stimulate and sustain student's interest in learning</li>
                            <li>It aids students in problem solving and arriving at conclusions.</li>
                            <li>It helps to increase student's ability towards critical thinking and acquisition of better understanding of knowledge</li>
                        </ol>
                        <h5>Disadvantages of Experimentation</h5>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Experimentation in biology teaching is wasteful in terms ofresources to be used in carrying out the investigation unlike demonstration</li>
                            <li>It is also time consuming in carrying out a single experiment. What the teacher can say in five minutes may take one hour to investigate</li>
                            <li>It also exposes the teacher's ignorance on those areas he is not competent enough to handle.</li>
                            <li>In experimentation, lack of background knowledge about the activities may make students to dislike the subject.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">9.Role Playing</h4>
                        <p>This is the process of assuming the nature, manner, behaviour, attitude, responsibility or authority of a post, persons or objects in a given situation.</p>
                        <p>Role playing is used in a variety of ways and for various purposes, it is used to resolve conflicts and settle problems as well as teach certain feelings of emotions which might be difficult for a teacher to express or demonstrate by himself.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">10. Dramatization</h4>
                        <p>This method is used by children in schools to convert facts or skills to be learnt into drama in order to make the learning of such facts or skills more interesting and realistic.</p>
                        <p>Dramatization enables the teachers to learn about the various maturity levels of the pupils in terms of their emotional, physical, intellectual and social development.</p>

                            <li>It affords pupils the opportunity to express themselves freely and happily</li>
                            <li>It develops in them a sense of respect for the opinion of others</li>
                            <li>It develops in them the attitude of cooperation in a groups</li>
                        </ol>
                        <h5>Disadvantages</h5>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">11. Discovery Method</h4>
                        <p>Discovery method is a teaching strategy which enables students to find the answers themselves. It is a learner centred approach hence it is called a heuristic method.</p>
                        <p>It is of two types;</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>The guided discovery -teacher guides the students to discover for themselves solutions to given problems by providing them with general principles, but not the solution to the scientific problem.</li>
                            <li>The unguided discovery-involves the students discovering for themselves both the general principles and solution to a scientific problem. It is sometimes called the pure discovery.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <img src="../assets/images/2025_06_19_46598a250aabfc9c621cg-160-1.jpg" alt="A child looking through a magnifying glass at a plant, embodying the spirit of the discovery method of learning." class="content-image">
                        <h5>Advantages of Discovery Method</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Makes the student an active participant rather than a mere passive recipient.</li>
                            <li>There is high retention of any information or knowledge so discovered will be increased.</li>
                            <li>The training acquired in finding out things for oneself independently can be applied to new learning and problem solving.</li>
                            <li>The joy in discovering something provides the students with intrinsic motivation</li>
                            <li>Helps learning through real life situations</li>
                            <li>Helps students develop manipulative skills and attitudes which constitute one of the fundamental objectives of science teaching.</li>
                            <li>It encourages analytical and synthetic thought as well as intuitive thinking.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h5>Disadvantages of Discovery Method</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>It is time consuming and progress is comparatively slow. Apparatus have to be set up and result(s) of the investigation awaited.</li>
                            <li>The method leaves open the possibility of not discovering anything. Students may end up discovering things other than what was intended to be discovered. This could be highly demoralizing to them particularly if great effort has been expended.</li>
                            <li>The method is expensive considering the equipment and materials needed.</li>
                            <li>It is only good for a small class where effective teacher supervision is possible.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">12. Inductive and the Deductive Methods(concept mapping)</h4>
                        <h5>The Inductive Method</h5>
                        <p>The inductive method of teaching begins with particular examples and from the examination of the examples, definition are established. The teacher tries to draw out from the student the already acquired knowledge. This is done through questioning.</p>
                        <p>Also the teacher tries to relate the knowledge gained is one subject area to another through description of similaries.</p>
                        <h5>Characteristics of the Inductive Method</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>It proceeds from the known to the unknown.</li>
                            <li>It proceeds from the particular to the general.</li>
                            <li>It proceeds from the concrete to the abstract.</li>
                            <li>It is an analytic method or process.</li>
                            <li>It is a method of discovery.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h5>The Deductive Method</h5>
                        <p>In deductive method a statement or a rule or formula is given. From this rule or formula, the teacher begins to work back to a particular case. For example a formula in mathematics. That is the whole is given and the students are made to see the parts that build it up.</p>

                                <h5>Improvisation of Teaching/Learning</h5>
                                <p>This refers to making T/L resources from locally available materials to represent the real thing. It is the act of using local resources in the immediate environment to build, construct, mold or make instructional T/L materials that can assist in a smooth T/L process.</p>
                                <p>It can also be defined as the act of designing a replica of standard equipment to play the role it is designated for.</p>
                                <p>An act of using alternative resources to facilitate instructions for teaching wherever there is lack of specific first hand teaching aids.</p>
                                <p><strong>Characteristics Of Improvised Resources</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Simple</li>
                                    <li>Cheap</li>
                                    <li>Safe for use by learners e. g. not made from materials that are toxic.</li>
                                    <li>Suitable for the content under consideration</li>
                                    <li>Conform as much as possible to the real equipment or resources in terms of weight, shape and size.</li>
                                    <li>Functional</li>
                                    <li>Merit social and scientific recognition, operation and function</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p><strong>Reasons for Improvisation</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Insufficiency of facilities and equipment.</li>
