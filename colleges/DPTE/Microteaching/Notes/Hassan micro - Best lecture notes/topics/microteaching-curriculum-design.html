                        <p>An effective education system is guided by set goals and objectives. The success of such a system relies on the interrelationship between the National goals of education, Level outcomes, general and specific outcomes of a subject.</p>
                        <p>The National goals of education are the general principles and statements which spell out the aspiration of a nation to be realised through education.</p>
                        <p>They give directions to a set of detailed intentions for the present and the future. From the National goals of education, objectives for the different levels are drawn. The level outcomes are used to determine the desired knowledge, skills and attitude that should be acquired at the end of the course program. The education system of Kenya at all levels is guided by the following goals;</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Foster nationalism, patriotism, and promote national unity</strong>-Kenya's people belong to different communities, races and religions and should be able to live and interact as one people. Education should enable the learner acquire a sense of nationhood and patriotism. It should also promote peace and mutual respect for harmonious co-existence.</li>
                            <li><strong>Promote social, economic, technological and industrial needs for national development</strong>
                                <p>Education should prepare the learner to play an effective and productive role in the nation through realization of the following needs;</p>
                                <ol type="a">
                                    <li><strong>Social Needs</strong>-Education should instil social and adaptive skills in the learner for effective participation in community and national development.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Economic Needs</strong>-Education should prepare a learner with requisite competences that support a modern and independent growing economy. This should translate into high standards of living for every individual.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Technological and Industrial Needs</strong>-Education should provide the learner with necessary competences for technological and industrial development in tandem with changing global trends.</li>

                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Promote individual development and self-fulfilment</strong>-Education should provide opportunities for the learner to develop to the fullest potential. This includes development of one's interests, talents and character for positive contribution to the society.</li>
                            <li><strong>Promote sound moral and religious value</strong>-Education should promote acquisition of national values as enshrined in the Constitution. It should be geared towards developing a selfdisciplined and ethical citizen with sound moral and religious values.</li>
                            <li><strong>Promote social equity and responsibility</strong>-Education should promote social equity and responsibility. It should provide inclusive and equitable access to quality and differentiated education; including learners with special educational needs and disabilities. Education should also provide the learner with opportunities for shared responsibility and accountability through service learning.</li>
                            <li><strong>Promote respect for and development of Kenya's rich and varied cultures</strong>-Education should instil in the learner appreciation of Kenya's rich and diverse cultural heritage. The learner should value own and respect other people's culture as well as embrace positive cultural practices in a dynamic society.</li>
                            <li><strong>Promote international consciousness and foster positive attitudes towards other nations</strong>-Kenya is part of the interdependent network of diverse peoples and nations. Education should therefore enable the learner to respect, appreciate and participate in the opportunities within the international community. Education should also facilitate the learner to operate within the international community with full knowledge of the obligations, responsibilities, rights and benefits that this membership entails.</li>
                            <li><strong>Good health and environmental protection</strong>-Education should inculcate in the learner the value of physical and psychological well-being for self and others.

                        <p>An essence statement gives a general overview of a learning area. It summarizes the fundamental ideas of each learning area. It also explains the rationale and justification of inclusion of the learning area in the curriculum.</p>
                        <p>The essence statement for a specific subject in different levels of learning is stated in a general way i.e it cuts across all grades within the same level for the given subject.</p>
                        <p>For example : For Middle school in English subject for Grades 4,5 and 6.The Essence statement is as follows;</p>
                        <p>English is a major language of education, information, trade, diplomacy and social networking. It is the international common tongue and the most common foreign language. Moreover, English is the dominant language in science and technology, the internet and travel. Additionally, English is an official language in Kenya and the medium of instruction from Grade Four. Therefore, a firm foundation in the language will enable the learner communicate appropriately in the national and international arena. This foundation will also enhance learning in lower secondary school.</p>
                        <p>Hence, proficiency in English is key to the realisation of the National Goals of Education, the link to the global community and the door to the worldwide information network. For this reason, the learner must be equiped with adequate oral, reading and writing competencies in English language. This will enable the learner to function competently in varied national and global communicative contexts.</p>
                        <p>During middle school, English is learnt as a second language. The learner will be engaged in tasks that enhance the acquisition and progressive application of English language skills. The emphasis in the presentation of the four language skills and grammar is to ensure they are functional. The learner will also experience the interdependence of the competences across the skills, and find the relevance of what they learn in their day- to-day contexts. Varied English language activities in Grades 4, 5, and 6 will enrich learning and empower the learner to apply acquired language competences with a lot of ease</p>

                        <p>Values are standards that guide an individual on how to respond or behave in each circumstance.</p>
                        <p>Thus, avalues influence how we feel, act and make choices in life. Today, there is a noticeable values and behavioural crisis among the general population and young people.</p>
                        <p>Many youngsters are growing up without the desired values, positive attitudes and psychosocial competencies needed to function as responsible citizens.</p>
                        <p>The primary responsibility for nurturing values rests with parents and the community, but education too has a key role to play in this regard.</p>
                        <p>The teaching of values will facilitate the achievement of the curriculum reforms' vision, particularly with respect to moulding ethical citizens'.</p>
                        <p>The Core Values in the BECF are: love, responsibility, respect, unity, peace, patriotism, social justice and integrity.</p>
                        <p>For every strand and substrand the relevant core values are given.</p>

                        <p>Community Service Learning (CSL) is an experiential learning strategy that integrates classroom learning to learning from the community to enable learners to reflect, experience and learn from the community.</p>
                        <p>It is a process where learners link personal and social development with academic and cognitive development.</p>
                        <p>The reformed curriculum has consequently introduced Community Service Learning as a component of learning that will be compulsory to all learners.</p>
                        <p>Community Service Learning will create opportunities for learners to apply the knowledge and skills acquired through the formal dimension in their community while at the same time learning from the community.</p>
                        <p>This will develop in the learner not only employability skills but also promote personal growth by strong and productive relationships with the community.</p>
                        <p>Learners will utilize the acquired knowledge, skills, values and attitudes to improve the welfare of the community.</p>
                        <p>Community Service Learning covers aspects of Citizenship, Entrepreneurship, Financial Literacy, Life Skills, Communication Skills and Research. These are given for every strand and substrand</p>

                        <p>These are given for each strand and substrand. The main purpose of Competency Based Assessment is to:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Inform teaching and learning decisions</li>
                            <li>Establish the level of learner's competence</li>
                            <li>Ascertain progress against the learning outcomes</li>
                            <li>Encourage learners to make judgments about their performance</li>
                            <li>Enhance learner motivation</li>
                            <li>Identify where intervention, focused support or referral is required</li>
                            <li>Make decisions regarding choice of subject, course and careers pathways.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Formative assessment or Assessment for learning (AFL) is an investigative tool to monitor the progress of an individual learner in meeting the learning outcomes in a subject or learning area. It involves gathering data during the learning process, and provides feedback to both the learner and you to help improve learning.</p>
                        <p>This approach helps build an accurate and detailed profile of your understanding of the curriculum and inform teaching so that you can provide appropriate assistance to the learner.</p>
                        <p>During assessment during a lesson a learner is assisted to develop a capacity to be independent, self-directed to set individual goals, monitor own progress/ self-assess, and reflect on his/her learning.</p>
                        <p>A learner can self-assess when you provide the learner with a clear picture of steps required to reach proficiency, a set criterion that have a variety of examples or models of decent work for comparison.</p>
                        <p>The summative assessment is carried at the end of a unit or task. It is designed to provide information on the achievement of a learner to parents, educators and learners themselves.</p>
                        <p>Some methods for assessing learner's different strands and substrands include;</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Observations</li>
                            <li>Written tests/assignments</li>
                            <li>Checklists: assist the teacher to determine areas of focus to enable the learner to develop relevant knowledge and skills</li>
                            <li>Rating Scales: Use of descriptive words, such as always, usually, sometimes and never</li>
                            <li>Questionnaires: A list of questions on various aspects of a person's situation</li>
                            <li>Project Method: a set of activities implemented within a set timeframe</li>
                            <li>Learners identify a need in their community where they can provide services based on what they have learned.</li>
                            <li>Journaling: the learner keeps a record of their personal feelings, thoughts and experiences daily.</li>
                            <li>Portifolio: a purposeful collection of work samples, self-assessments and goal statements that reflect a learner's progress.</li>
                            <li>Assessment rubrics</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>They provide feedback to educators, parents and learners, about a learner's achievement to make decisions for appropriate placements or further studies.</p>
                        <p><strong>Task 3.20:</strong> In groups or pairs study the Mathematics curriculum designs for grade 4 to identify one strand and one substrand and give the suggested assessment methods given.

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">UNIT 3.21: ASSESSMENT RUBRICS</h3>
                        <p>A rubric is an assessment tool that clearly indicates achievement criteria across all the components of any kind of student work, from written to oral to visual.</p>
                        <p>It can be used for marking assignments, class participation etc. The CBC rubrics identify the creteria for assessment(performance indicator) and rating scale as follows;</p>
                        <p>For formative assessment the ratings are given below;</p>
                        <p>Level 1. E.E - Exceeds Expectations<br>
                           Level 2. M.E - Meet Expectations<br>
                           Level 3. A.E - Approaching Expectation<br>
                           Level 4. B.E - Below Expectation</p>
                        <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> The teacher allocates marks for each strand,substrand or class activity and structures the ratings into the given above creterion.</p>
                        <p>The summative assessment rating is calculated based on the average of the formative assessment ratings and is structured under the following aspects:</p>
                        <p>Level 1. E.E - Exceeds Expectations (80-100%)<br>
                           Level 2. M.E - Meet Expectations (65-79%)<br>
                           Level 3. A.E - Approaching Expectation (50-64%)<br>
                           Level 4. B.E - Below Expectation (0-49%)</p>
                        <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> For every substrand there is a preidentified assessment creterion given as assessment rubrics for the instructor to use when assessing the learners.</p>
                        <p>The assessment creterion given are drawn from the learning outcomes and experiences for the given substrand.</p>
                        <p>Assessment rubrics will be indicated at the end of every substrand.</p>
                        <p><strong>Task 3.21:</strong> In groups or pairs study the Homescience and kiswahili curriculum design for grade 4 to identify one strand and one substrand and give the assessment rubric given for each subject.
