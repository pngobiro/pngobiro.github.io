                        <ol type="a">
                            <li><strong>Communication and Collaboration</strong>
                                <p>Communication is the act of transferring information from one place to another, whether vocally, visually, or non-verbally.</p>
                                <p>The discipline of communication focuses on how people use messages to generate meanings within and across various contexts, cultures and channels, Communication competence as the ability to interact well with others interms of accuracy, clarity, comprehensibility, coherence, expertise, effectiveness and appropriateness.</p>
                                <p>Collaboration is the process of two or more people or organizations working together to realize shared goals.</p>
                                <p>Collaboration may require leadership, although this can be social within decentralized or egalitarian groups or teams that work collaboratively in relation to gaining greater resources, recognition and motivation.</p>
                                <p>Strategies for effective communication enhance the attainment of greater collaboration among groups that ultimately increase the success of teams as they engage in collaborative problem solving.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Self-efficacy</strong>
                                <p>Self-efficacy is a person's belief about his or her capabilities to perform tasks or assignments that can change and transform his or her life.</p>
                                <p>It determines how the person feels, thinks, behaves and motivates themselves.</p>
                                <p>Self-efficacy has the potential to determine four major processes namely cognitive, motivational, affective and selection processes.</p>
                                <p>A strong sense of self-efficacy enhances a learner's accomplishment and personal wellbeing in many ways.</p>
                                <p>Learners with high assurance in their capabilities approach difficult tasks as challenges to be mastered, rather than as threats to be avoided.</p>
                                <p>Self-efficacy fosters intrinsic interest and deep engrossment in activities.</p>
                                <p>Learners set themselves challenging goals and maintain a strong commitment to them. Self-efficacy as a competence will enable learners to develop and nurture intra-personal skills and values such as self-awareness, self-esteem, confidence and personal integrity.</p>
                                <p>These competencies will enhance the learner's ability to heighten and sustain efforts in the face of failure and effectively manage stressful situations.</p>
                                <p>A learner with a strong sense of self-efficacy will be courageous and bold enough to set and pursue personal educational, family, community, entrepreneurial, professional, and career goals in all forms of employment that will lead to personal accomplishment.</p>
                                <p>An efficacious learner will be aware of the resources at their disposal and will take personal responsibility for the use, care, management, protection and preservation of these resources.</p>
                                <p>A learner with strong self-efficacy will be internally motivated to establish and maintain healthy interpersonal relationships.</p>
                                <p>They will demonstrate interpersonal relationship skills such as assertiveness, empathy, effective communication, negotiation skills, non-violent conflict resolution skills and peer pressure resistance skills.</p>
                                <p>Creative and critical thinking that leads to effective decision making and problem solving is based on a strong sense of self-efficacy.</p>
                                <p>Capacity building of teachers and parental engagement are two crucial factors that would determine acquisition of self-efficacy.</p>
                                <p>The school will be expected to provide opportunities for parents to be empowered and engaged in the affairs and welfare of their children's education.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Critical Thinking and Problem Solving</strong>
                                <p>An important outcome of quality education is teaching learners how to think critically.</p>
                                <p>The are three types of thinking: reasoning, making judgements, and problem solving. It is possible for learners to reason in an uncritical way.</p>
                                <p>When learners are empowered with critical thinking, they avoid being subjective, and use logic and evidence to arrive at conclusions.</p>
                                <p>Critical thinking also facilitates exploring new ways of doing things and learner autonomy. Learners learn that for every issue there are multiple perspectives that they can explore, rather than a rigid recall and regurgitation of information.</p>
                                <p>It helps learners to have an open mind and be ready to listen and appreciate information and opinions that may sometimes conflict with their earlier held beliefs and positions.</p>
                                <p>Critical thinking and problem solving are useful for learners of all ages and in all the subjects and disciplines offered in the basic education curriculum.</p>
                                <p>For example, in the sciences learners need to think critically about observations and patterns to develop ideas on how to solve problems.</p>
                                <p>These competencies are also important for solving problems in their lives and communities, and will ultimately help them to fulfil their potential, which is the vision for the basic education curriculum.</p>
                                <p>This will contribute to addressing the unemployment challenge in Kenya.</p>
                                <p>Critical thinking and problem solving will be developed through age appropriate activities and programmes in the school curriculum.</p>
                                <p>For example, at pre-primary school level learners can be asked to come up with the best ways of using and keeping their books, stationery and other personal items safe.</p>
                                <p>At the other end of the basic education spectrum, learners can be asked to come up with the best ways of addressing the challenge of scarce resources such as water in the school and community.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Creativity and Imagination</strong>
                                <p>Creativity and imagination refers to the ability to form new images and sensations in the mind, and to turn them into reality.</p>
                                <p>It is the ability to imagine things that are not real, to form pictures in the mind of things that one has not seen or experienced, and turn those pictures into real things.</p>
                                <p>It also refers to the act or power of forming mental images of things that are not present to the senses, or that are never wholly perceived in reality, and creating physical representations of those images.</p>
                                <p>Imagination only exists or happens in the mind, and it remains in the mind.</p>
                                <p>Creativity and imagination on the other hand, is characterized by the ability to perceive the world in new ways, to find hidden patterns, to make connections between seemingly unrelated phenomena, and to generate solutions.</p>
                                <p>It is a phenomenon whereby something new and valuable is formed.</p>
                                <p>In educational terms, creativity and imagination refers to the ability of learners and their teachers to form images and ideas in their minds, and turn them into real, visible creations.</p>
                                <p>Learners who are imaginative and creative are able to make life interesting for themselves and others around them.</p>
                                <p>They are able to use the knowledge, skills and values acquired in the learning process to create new ideas that result in products that add value to their lives and to the lives of others around them.</p>
                                <p>The competence based curriculum recognizes this hidden ability in learners. It will therefore, inspire learners' imagination by presenting knowledge in ways that encourage learners to think as individuals.</p>
                                <p>It will create scenarios that help learners to engage in imagination and encourage them to develop creations steered by the imagination.</p>
                                <p>Their ability to imagine will be stretched through exposure to challenging situations that help to expand their thinking and creativity skills.</p>
                                <p>The curriculum will also create room for innovative ways of teaching as well as creating an environment conducive to learning that offers all learners opportunities to explore their full potential in and through creativity and imagination.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Citizenship</strong>
                                <p>Historically, human beings have always formed communities based on a shared identity.</p>
                                <p>Such identities are forged in response to a variety of human needs, which might be economic, political, religious or social.</p>
                                <p>As group identities grow stronger, those who hold them in commonality with others organize themselves into communities, articulate their shared values, and build governance structures to support their beliefs.</p>
                                <p>The individuals in these communities identifythemselves as citizens.</p>
                                <p>Citizenship is the state of being vested with the rights, privileges, and duties of a citizen.</p>
                                <p>It creates a sense of belonging and attachment to one"s nation.</p>
                                <p>The sense of citizenship helps to equip young people to deal with situations of conflict and controversy knowledgeably and tolerantly.</p>
                                <p>They are able to understand the consequences of their actions, and those of the adults around them.</p>
                                <p>Global citizenship is a way of living which recognizes that our world is an increasingly complex web of connections and interdependencies.</p>
                                <p>One in which our choices and actions may have repercussions for people and communities locally, nationally or internationally.</p>
                                <p>It nurtures personal respect and respect for others, wherever they live.</p>
                                <p>It encourages individuals to think deeply and critically about what is equitable and just, and what will minimize harm to our planet.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Digital Literacy</strong>
                                <p>Digital literacy can be described as having the knowledge, skills and behaviours which are necessary to effectively and safely use a wide range of digital content and devices.</p>
                                <p>Such devices include mobile phones, smart phones, tablets, laptops and desktops among others.</p>
                                <p>All these fall within the category of network enabled devices.</p>
                                <p>Digital literacy focuses mainly on network enabled devices and should not be confused with computer literacy skills.</p>
                                <p>However, traditional forms of literacy and computer literacy are enhancers in the acquisition of digital literacy skills.</p>
                                <p>Individuals are presumed to be digitally literate if they possess a broad range of digital skills and knowledge, and have a basic understanding of the potential uses of computing devices.</p>
                                <p>Digital literacy skills also include being able to use computer communication networks, being able to engage in online communication and social networks, being aware of and adhering to ethical behaviour protocols, being aware of societal issues raised through digital media, and being able to search, evaluate and use information channelled through digital platforms. Furthermore, the digital literate individual should also have the ability to safely and securely use technology while being able to assess the nature of the information acquired in order to support and enhance the environment.</p>
                                <p>Digital literacy as a competence therefore encompasses knowledge and skills concerning the appropriate application of a variety of hardware platforms such as computers, tablets and mobile devices, and their software including but not limited to web search or internet application software.</p>
                                <p>Digital literacy is a dynamic competence due to the fast-changing world of information communication technology and the ongoing development of technological devices as well as their related software.</p>
                                <p>This is an area in which there is constant innovation and development as the industry attempts to keep up with a globally increasing demand for efficient and effective communication technologies.</p>
                                <p>Currently, digital literacy is considered as one of the main core competencies for learning and life in the 21st century.</p>
                                <p>It challenges existing thinking and practice while leading to a more innovative, creative and often transformational learning.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Learning to Learn</strong>
                                <p>Learning is a continuous process that begins at birth and continues until death; it is the process through which we use our experience to deal with new situations and to develop relationships.</p>
                                <p>As a concept, it involves far more than thinking as it incorporates the whole personality - senses, feelings, intuition, beliefs, values and will.</p>
                                <p>If we do not have the will to learn, we will not learn and if we have learned, we are actually changed in some way.</p>
                                <p>If the learning makes no difference it can have very little significance beyond being random ideas that float through our consciousness.</p>
                                <p>Learning to learn is the ability to pursue and persist in learning, to organise one"s own learning by the effective management of time and information, both individually and in groups.</p>
                                <p>This competence includes awareness of one's learning process and needs, identifying available opportunities, and the ability to overcome obstacles in order to learn successfully.</p>
                                <p>This competence means gaining, processing and assimilating new knowledge and skills as well as seeking and making use of guidance. Learning to learn helps learners to build on prior learning and life experiences in order to use and apply knowledge and skills in a variety of contexts.</p>
                                <p>There are four pillars of learning: Learning to know, learning to do, learning to be and learning to live to live together.</p>
