Facilitator's Notes
Meaning of Competency Based Curriculum
The Competency Based Curriculum focuses on acquisition of competences to enable the learner to cope with life challenges.

Vision and mission of BECF
Vision statement
- The vision of the basic education curriculum reforms is to enable every Kenyan to become an Engaged, Empowered, and Ethical Citizen.
- Learners are facilitated to develop to be useful members of society.

Mission statement
- The mission is Nurturing Every Learner's Potential
- All learners have abilities that can be nurtured for success. Identifying every learner's potential and nurturing the potential is central to CBC.

The National goals of education in Kenya

National goals of education are statements that describe the aspirations of a country and the needs of the society that are to be met through education.

The Framework is anchored towards achieving the 8 National Goals of Education.
Education in Kenya should:

\section*{a)Foster nationalism, patriotism, and promote national unity}

Kenya's people belong to different communities, races and religions and should be able to live and interact as one people.

Education should enable the learner acquire a sense of nationhood and patriotism. It should also promote peace and harmonious co-existence.
b)Promote social, economic, technological and industrial needs for national development Education should prepare the learner to play an effective and productive role in the nation
i) Social Needs-Education should instil social and adaptive skills in the learner for effective participation in the family, community, national, regional and international development.
ii) Economic Needs-Education should prepare a learner with requisite competences that support a modern and independent growing economy. This should translate into high standards of living for every individual.
iii) Technological and Industrial Needs-Education should develop in the learner necessary competences for technological and industrial development for the nation in tandem with global trends.

\section*{c)Promote individual development and self-fulfilment}

Education should provide opportunities for the learner to develop to the fullest potential.This includes development of one's interests, talents and character for positive contribution to the society

\section*{d) Promote sound moral and religious values}

Education should promote acquisition of national values as enshrined in the Kenya Constitution. It should be geared towards developing a self-disciplined and ethical citizen with sound moral and religious values
e) Promote social equity and responsibility

Education should promote social equity and responsibility. It should provide inclusive and equitable access to quality and differentiated education; including for learners with special educational needs and disabilities.

Education should also provide the learner with opportunities to develop and practice shared responsibility and accountability through community service learning.

\section*{f)Promote respect for and development of Kenya's rich and varied cultures}

Education should instil in the learner appreciation of Kenya's rich and diverse cultural heritage. The learner should value own and respect other people's culture as well as embrace positive cultural practices in a dynamic society.

\section*{g)Promote international consciousness and foster positive attitudes towards other nations}

Kenya is part of the interdependent network of diverse peoples and nations. Education should empower the learner to respect, appreciate and participate in the opportunities within the international community.

Education should also enable the learner to operate within the international community with full knowledge of the obligations, responsibilities, rights and benefits that this membership entails.

\section*{)Promote positive attitudes towards good health and environmental protection}

Education should inculcate in the learner the value of physical and psycho-social well-being for self and others. It should promote environmental preservation and conservation, including animal welfare, for sustainable development.

\section*{Organization of the BECF}
- The education system in Kenya has changed from $8: 4: 4$ to $2: 6: 3: 3: 3$
- Basic Education is organized into three (3) levels: Early Years Education, Middle School Education and Senior School.
- Level 1-Early years comprise of pre primary 1 and 2 and lower primary ( grade 1,2 and 3.)
- Level 2-Middle school comprise of upper primary (grade 4,5 and 6) and junior secondary school (grade 7,8 and 9.)
- Level 3-Senior school comprise of senior secondary school(grade 10,11 and 12) and tertiary education of 3 years.

ORGANIZATION OF BASIC EDUCATION

Pillars of BECF
There are Three Pillars of CBC
- Values
- Guiding Principles
- Theoretical Approaches

\section*{Core values in BECF}

The values identified and integrated in the curriculum are;
- Love
- Responsibility
- Respect
- Unity
- Peace
- Patriotism
- Social justice
- Integrity

How Values are Integrated in the Curriculum:
- Mainly through infusion and selection of learning environment and suggested learning experiences
- Guidance and Counselling programmes
- VBE will be implemented through Whole-School Approach which will involve learners, teachers, support staff, Board of Management, family members, wider school community and relevant stakeholders

Pertinent and Contemporary Issues(PCIs)
-Pertinent - having a clear decisive relevance to thematter at hand
-Contemporary - marked by characteristics of the present period; thus being, MORDEN, CURRENT

Children are faced with a myriad of challenges and issues owing to the social-cultural and economic dynamics in the society.
- The Competence-Based-Curriculum calls them Pertinent and Contemporary Issues
- Previously being referred to as emerging issues and/or Cross-cutting issues.
- Learner-centered education goes beyond the subject content.
- It instills appropriate competencies the learner requires in order to effectively address the

PCIs of everyday life; thereby leading a fulfilled life as well as becoming a productive member of the society

\section*{Examples of PCIs}
1.Citizenship education - includes Peace education, Integrity, Ethnic and racial relations, social cohesion, Patriotism and good governance, child's rights, child care and protection
2.Health education - includes HIV and AIDS, Alcohol and Substance use, Life style diseases, personal hygiene, Communicable and chronic diseases e.g. COVID-19
3. Life Skills \& Human sexuality - includes Life skills education and human sexuality
4.Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) -includes Environmental Education, Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR), Safety and security Education (small arms, human trafficking, Poverty eradication, Countering terrorism, radicalization,) Gender and Animal Welfare Education

\section*{Mainstreaming PCIs in CBC}
- PCIs have been mainstreamed in the three dimensions of the curriculum, that is:
- The Formal;
- The Non-Formal
- The In-formal.

Note: The mainstreaming of PCIs has to be deliberate and based on a conscious effort.
PCIs become apart of the content being delivered.

\section*{Formal Dimension}
- A relevant and suitable sub strand or sub theme in a learning area/subject is identified where PCIs can appropriately be incorporated and taught alongside the subject matter .

\section*{Example:}

Learning area: Social Studies (Grade 4)
Strand: Natural and Built Environment
Sub strand: Physical features in the County
Learning Outcome: (c) adopt responsible behaviour to conserve the physical features.
PCIs: Promotion of environmental conservation as learners appreciate the natural and built
environment in the County.

\section*{Non-formal}
- These are organized, structured and systematic learning activities (NFPs) that take place in school. They support acquisition of knowledge, values and skills learnt in class.

\section*{Informal}
- This refers to the Knowledge, Attitudes and Skills or behaviour acquired by learners from the social interaction with members of the school community.

Exemplary behaviours and appropriate values can easily be emulated.
The Guiding principles in BECF
The Framework is based on the following guiding principles:
1.Opportunity
2.Excellence
3.Diversity and Inclusion
4.Parental Empowerment and Engagement
5.Community Service Learning
6.Differentiated Curriculum and Learning
1. Opportunity
- In order to achieve the reforms' vision and mission, the curriculum provides learners with a variety of opportunities to enable them to identify their needs, talents and potential.
- This will enable them to participate in the world of work and the development of the nation.
- The emphasis will be on equal access to education for all.
- This will enable learners to enjoy learning and reduce wastage in terms of learners leaving school because the curriculum is not relevant to their needs.

\section*{2. Excellence}
- Every learner will be nurtured to excel in their areas of greatest interest and ability.
- The Framework values excellence and competitiveness rather than raw competition for examination grades.
- This will play a role in helping to reduce the challenge of malpractice in examinations because each learner will be guided to excel in their area of interest and ability.

\section*{3. Diversity and Inclusion}
- There are two dimensions in the guiding principle of diversity and inclusion.
- First, the Framework will guide learners to appreciate Kenya's diversity in terms of race, ethnicity, gender, language, culture, and religion.
- The second dimension relates to the fact that learners are different in terms of their learning needs and abilities and these differences need to be respected and valued within an inclusive learning environment.
- Inclusion will entail ensuring that all learning institutions accommodate all learners regardless of their physical, emotional, intellectual, or any other need.
- It involves provision of reasonable accommodation characterized by flexibility, responsiveness and support.
- The Framework recognises that not all learners are academically gifted but considers every learner's social and cognitive capabilities, their needs and desires, and respects the differences in the way children learn.
- The ultimate aim is to guarantee basic education for every learner according to their abilities and needs.
- The curriculum reforms should address the needs of children and youth who are out of school, and adults, to increase their access to and participation in education, and hence, raise their literacy levels for personal and national social economic development.

\section*{4. Differentiated Curriculum and Learning}
- Differentiated curriculum and learning builds on the principle of diversity and inclusion.
- It ensures that the curriculum content and instructional approaches are appropriate for each learner.
- It provides space for teachers to adapt the curriculum to suit the learner.
- It does not demand that every learner learn the same content in the same way, in the same number of hours and at the same time.

\section*{5. Parental Empowerment and Engagement}
- Parents play a very important role in determining the success of a child's education.
- They have a shared responsibility with schools to provide an enabling environment that is conducive to learning and which motivates the child to achieve their full potential.
- The Framework provides opportunities for schools to empower parents to contribute to the learning outcomes for their children and to be engaged at all tiers and levels of basic education.

\section*{6. Community Service Learning}
- Involving students in community service is a form of experiential education that enables students to apply their knowledge and skills in a different setting.
- Teachers then support students to analyse what they have learned by taking part in this activity and how it might be applied to their academic and personal development.
- Community service learning entails a balanced emphasis on both students' learning and addressing real needs in the community.
- Learning outcomes are linked to meaningful human, safety, educational, and environmental needs that are co-determined with community partners and service recipients.
- The service experience is brought back to the classroom to enhance learning.
- Learners work on real problems that make academic learning relevant while simultaneously enhancing their social skills, analytical ability, civic and ethical responsibility, self-efficacy, and career development.

How the Principles have been applied in the curriculum:
1.Pathways open opportunity for different categories of learners
2.Stress on excellence in all teaching and learning
3.Parents are engaged through extended learner activities
4.Varied activities are suggested to cater for the different learning styles, Programmes on PEE, CSL
1) Contextual - PBL uses real everyday problems. Hence the learning material is more relevant and will be easier to apply on real situations1)
2) Constructive - PBL is a student centered approach in which learners construct their own knowledge and the teacher or tutor serves as a guide on the side
3) Collaborative - PBL stimulates students to co-construct knowledge, and to share ideas and knowledge
4) Self-directed - PBL promotes self- directed learning skills among students. Examples are planning, reflection, evaluation of understanding, and managing information and resources

Extended work
Task 1: Conduct research and compile a report on the organization of the 2:6:3:3:3 education system in Kenya and analyze the learning areas per each level.

Task 2: Critically analyze the justification of the inclusion of the following in the BECF
- Values
- PCIs
- Core competencies

Task 3: Analyze the reasons for inclusion of community service learning and parental engagement and participation in the current education framework.

SUBSTRAND 1.2: THEORITICAL FRAMEWORK IN BECF
Key areas covered
- Behavioral theories
- Cognitive theories
- Social theories

\section*{Facilitator's Notes}

A theory is an abstract general explanation of observations or a subject under study that can be relied upon to provide guidance for practice.

It attempts to predict behaviour or reach a reasonable and general set of explanations for an underlying issue.

The Basic Education Curriculum Framework is underpinned by several theories generally categorized as behavioral, cognitive and social theories.
a) Behavioral theories

\section*{1. Instructional Design Theory}
- This theory offers explicit guidance towards a new curriculum that explains how to help students learn and develop in the wake of emerging globalization.
- The theory is based on both intrinsic and extrinsic motivation towards learning by learners based on the opportunities they get.
- An instructional design model provides guidelines to organize appropriate pedagogical scenarios to achieve instructional goals.
- Instructional design can be defined as the practice of creating instructional experiences to help facilitate learning most effectively.
- The theory is more than a process; that process, and resulting product, represent a framework of thinking
- Instructional design models describe how to conduct the various steps.
- These steps involve instructional design process.
- The models help trainers and educators to guide and plan the overall process.
- It states that the instructional process should be intended to be an interactive process of planning outcomes, selecting effective strategies for teaching and learning, choosing relevant technologies, identifying educational media and measuring performance.
- Instructional design theory is design-oriented because it focuses on the means to attain
given goals for learning and offers guidelines on methods to use in different situations in curriculum implementation.
- Values play an important role in instructional design theory. They underlie both the goals the curriculum pursues and the methods it offers to attain the goals.
- All these are articulated in this BECF which takes cognizance of the place of values as an anchor for the pillars of the curriculum.
- The BECF also provides a vision for the reforms and engages critical stakeholders and policy makers to identify with it.
- This provides a strong momentum for change in achieving the reforms' vision.

\section*{2.Visible Learning Theory by John Hattie}
- He observes that globally, fundamental changes in education systems have important implications for curriculum reform.
- Learners need to be able to think about and solve problems, work in teams, communicate through discussions, take initiatives and bring diverse perspectives to their learning.
- In addition, students need to learn more, yet they have little time available to learn it.
- Learners also need to demonstrate the impact of the achievement of national goals of education.
- Visible learning means an enhanced role for teachers as they become evaluators of their own teaching.
- Hattie asserts that visible learning and teaching occurs when teachers see learning through the eyes of students and help them become their own teachers.
- It entails making student learning visible to teachers so that they can know whether they are having an impact on this learning, this is an important component of becoming a lifelong learner. This resonates with the Sustainable Development Goals.
- The 'learning' part of visible learning is the need to think of teaching with learning in the forefront and with the idea that we should consider teaching primarily in terms of its impact on student learning.
- When the teaching is visible the student knows what to do and how to do it. When the learning is visible the teacher knows if learning is occurring or not.
- Teaching and learning are visible when the learning goal is not only challenging but is
explicit. Furthermore, both the teacher and the student work together to attain the goal, provide feedback, and ascertain whether the student has attained the goal.
- Evidence shows that the greatest effects on student learning come when not only the students become their own teachers (through self-monitoring, and self-assessment), but when the teachers become learners of their own teaching.
- In successful classrooms, both the teaching and learning are visible.
- This theory is important in designing a competency based curriculum.
- It provides directions on the nature of engagement in the learning process between the teacher, the learner and the environment.
- It also provides a basis for designing a formative and criterion referenced assessment, which is the bedrock of a competency-based curriculum.

\section*{b) Cognitive/Constructivism Theories}

Constructivist theorists argue that human beings construct all knowledge while participating in different mental and physical experiences.

In constructivism, the learner builds a personal interpretation of the world based on experiences and interactions and learning is a process of constructing knowledge rather than acquiring or communicating it.

\section*{i) John Dewey's Social Constructivism}
- Dewey felt that the curriculum should ultimately produce students who would be able to deal effectively with the modern world.
- Therefore, curricula should not be presented as finished abstractions, but should include the child's preconceptions and should incorporate how the child views his or her own world.
- Dewey uses four instincts, or impulses, to describe how to characterize children's behaviour.
- The four instincts according to Dewey are social, constructive, expressive, and artistic. Curricula should build an orderly sense of the world where the child lives.
- He hoped to use occupations to connect miniature versions of fundamental activities of life with classroom activities.
- The way Dewey hoped to accomplish this goal was to combine subject areas and materials.
- By doing this, he made connections between subjects and the child's life.
- According to Dewey, education is growth and not an end in itself, and thus the curriculum should arise from students' interests and should be hands-on and experience based rather than abstract.
- This theory underscores the emphasis of continuous, participatory and experiential learning.
- This is an emphasis of the practical aspect of the basic education curriculum in the curriculum reforms.

\section*{ii)Vygotsky's Social-Cultural Development Theory}
- Vygotsky's social-cultural theory emphasized that teaching and learning are highly social activities and that interactions with teachers, peers and instructional materials influence the cognitive and affective developments of learners.
- The theory argues that learning takes place when learners interact with each other, or have other social contact.
- Learners negotiate meanings with people in the environment, and they achieve goals through interacting, both explicitly and implicitly, with the teacher, peers, materials, and atmosphere embedded in the context.
- This theory underpins the basic education curriculum framework in terms of conceptualising and designing the necessary paradigm shifts that will facilitate creating rich learning environments which will stimulate all learners and help them to fulfil their potential.
- Vygotsky's theory emphasizes that while adults may learn independently, children require mediation from others before they can learn on their own.
- He called this process of moving from being mediated by others to learning independently scaffolding.
- Within scaffolding, he identified an optimal point where learning takes place and called this the Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD).
- The concepts of scaffolding and ZPD will be useful in designing the pedagogical shifts that teachers will be trained in to facilitate adoption of a competency based curriculum
in basic education.
- Activities in the classroom will include journaling, experiential activities, and collaborative and cooperative learning.

\section*{iii)Gardner's Multiple Intelligence Theory}
- Gardner's theory states that learners possess different kinds of minds and therefore learn, remember, perform, and understand in different ways.
- He argues that we are all able to know the world through language, logicalmathematical analysis, spatial representation, musical thinking, use of the body to solve problems or to make things, an understanding of other individuals, and an understanding of ourselves.
- Recognising this enables learners to leverage their strengths and purposively target and develop their weaknesses.
- Pedagogical approaches under this theory emphasize the importance of a learner centred classroom, self-directed learning and delivery of instruction via multiple mediums. Where individuals differ is in the strength of these intelligences - the so-called profile of intelligences - and in the ways in which such intelligences are invoked and combined to carry out different tasks, solve diverse problems, and progress in various domains.
- Gardner says that these differences challenge an educational system which assumes that everyone can learn the same materials in the same way and that a uniform, universal measure suffices to test student learning.
- Given the need to identify, develop and nurture the talents of learners in the reformed curriculum, Gardner's argument that learners can leverage their strengths is more likely to be educationally effective since learners learn in ways that are identifiably distinctive.
- The broad spectrum of learners - and perhaps society as a whole - would be better served if disciplines could be presented in a number of ways and learning could be assessed through a variety of means.
- Criterion referenced assessment that is aligned to a learner's competencies can be situated within Gardner's multiple intelligences theory.
- This type of assessment is emphasized in the BECF.
- Piaget's theory deals with how humans gradually come to acquire, construct, and use knowledge.
- He looked at the impact a person's childhood had on their development, and the ways in which maturation affect a child's increasing capacity to understand their world.
- Piaget asserted that children cannot undertake certain tasks until they are psychologically mature enough to do so.
- According to this theory, there is progressive reorganization of mental processes resulting from biological maturation and environmental experience.
- It is important to note that children's thinking does not develop entirely smoothly, instead, there are certain points at which it "takes off" and moves into completely new areas and capabilities. These points are in four stages of cognitive development: sensory motor (02 years), language development and conceptual thought ( $2-7$ years), concrete operations (7-11 years) and formal operations (11 years and above).
- This has been taken to mean that before these ages children are not capable (no matter
- how bright) of understanding things in certain ways, and has been used as the basis for scheduling the school curriculum.
- Parents are encouraged to provide a rich, supportive environment for their child's natural propensity to grow and learn.
- Parent involvement in learning is an active element in reforming the basic education curriculum.

\section*{v. Bruner's Cognitive Development Theory}
- Bruner's constructionist theoretical framework is based on the theme that learners
- construct new ideas or concepts based upon existing knowledge.
- According to Brunner the facets of the learning process include selection and transformation of
- information, decision making, generating hypotheses, and making meaning from information and experiences.
- The theory emphasizes the significance of categorization in learning as "to perceive, to conceptualize, to learn, to make decisions."
- Interpreting information and experiences by similarities and differences is a key concept.

The theory identifies four key themes:
a) The role of structure in learning and how it may be made central in teaching.

Structure refers to relationships among factual elements and techniques.
b) Readiness for learning and spiral curriculum. Bruner believed that any subject could be taught at any stage of development in a way that fit the child's cognitive abilities. Spiral curriculum refers to the idea of revisiting basic ideas over and over, building upon them and elaborating to the level of full understanding and mastery.
c) Intuitive and analytical thinking should both be encouraged and rewarded. He believed the intuitive skills were under-emphasized and he reflected on the ability of experts in every field to make intuitive leaps.
d) Motivation for learning. He felt that ideally, interest in the subject matter is the best stimulus for learning. Bruner was against external competitive goals such as grades or class ranking.

Just like the other constructivists, Bruner placed emphasis on learning instruction that allows learners to discover principles for themselves and knowledge being structured in a way that is readily grasped by learners.
c) Social theory
i)Erik Erikson's Theory of Psychosocial Development
- This theory attempts to describe personality development throughout the entire lifespan of an individual in eight distinct stages.
- Erikson proposed a lifespan model of development that entails five stages in childhood (from birth to the age of 18 years) and three stages in adulthood.
- According to Erikson, there is plenty of room for continued growth and development throughout one's life.
- The theory is underpinned by the epigenic principle which presupposes that personality develops in a predetermined order, and builds upon each previous stage.
- Reference to this theory will be made to minimize frustration and ensure that education
tasks given to the child are in alignment with their stage of development.
- Erikson assumes that a crisis occurs at each stage of development.
- These crises are of a psychosocial nature because they involve the psychological needs of the individual (i.e. psycho) conflicting with the needs of society (i.e. social).
- Successful negotiation of each stage results in a healthy personality and the acquisition of basic virtues.
- Failure to successfully complete a stage can result in a reduced ability to complete further stages and therefore a more unhealthy personality and sense of self.
- To help each learner achieve the expected learning outcomes, a competence based curriculum will ensure that outcomes are commensurate with the learner's stage of development.
- The following table gives a summary of the tasks or crises a human being is expected to negotiate in order to move to the next stage of development.
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|}
\hline Stage & Psychosocial Crisis & Basic Virtue & Age \\
\hline 1 & Trust vs. mistrust & Hope & Infancy (0 to1 1/2) \\
\hline 2 & Autonomyvs. shame & Will & Early Childhood ( 1 r to 3 ) \\
\hline 3 & Initiative vs. guilt & Purpose & Play Age ( 3 to 5) \\
\hline 4 & Industry vs. inferiority & Competency & School Age ( 5 to 12) \\
\hline 5 & Ego identity vs. Role Confusion & Fidelity & Adolescence (12 to 18) \\
\hline 6 & Intimacy vs. isolation & Love & Young Adult ( 18 to 40) \\
\hline 7 & Generativity vs. stagnation & Care & Adult hood( 40 to 65) \\
\hline 8 & Ego integrity vs. despair & Wisdom & Maturity ( 65+) \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
- According to Erikson the curriculum aims at fostering both lower and high level skills concurrently where the teacher remains a guide or facilitator while the learner constructs their own knowledge through exploration and experiential learning.
- Learners as they grow are active participants in the learning process through collaborating with others in group projects, hands-on exploration, and aiming at authentic tasks and product development.
- Learning goals are stated in terms of growth and increased ability to work independently and collaboratively.
- Pedagogy and assessment therefore as discussed in these theories are inclined towards the 21 st century skills and competencies which the basic education curriculum aspires
to achieve in the curriculum reforms.
Extended work
Task 1: Analyze the educational implications of each theory and how the Kenyan education framework has adopted the reflections of each of the theories studied.

STRAND 2.0: BASIC EDUCATION FRAMEWORK
SUBSTRAND 2.1: CORE COMPETENCIES
Keys areas covered
- The 7 core competencies
- Assessment of the acquisition of the competencies

\section*{Facilitator's Notes}

What is a competency?
Competency is 'the ability to apply appropriate knowledge, skills, values and attitudes to successfully perform a function'.

The curriculum is designed to emphasize the importance of developing skills and knowledge, attitudes and values and also applying these to real life situations.

BECF seeks to develop these competencies so that all Kenyans can thrive in the 21 stcentury.
1. Communication and Collaboration
2. Self-efficacy
3. Critical Thinking and Problem Solving
4. Creativity and Imagination
5. Citizenship
6. Digital Literacy
7. Learning to Learn

The competencies will be mainstreamed in the appropriate strands and lessons.
The Framework seeks to develop these competencies so that all Kenyans can thrive in the 21stcentury.

\section*{a)Communication and Collaboration}
- Communication is the act of transferring information from one place to another, whether vocally, visually, or non-verbally.
- The discipline of communication focuses on how people use messages to generate meanings within and across various contexts, cultures and channels, Communication competence as the ability to interact well with others interms of accuracy, clarity, comprehensibility, coherence, expertise, effectiveness and appropriateness.
- Collaboration is the process of two or more people or organizations working together to realize shared goals.
- Collaboration may require leadership, although this can be social within decentralized or egalitarian groups or teams that work collaboratively in relation to gaining greater resources, recognition and motivation.
- Strategies for effective communication enhance the attainment of greater collaboration among groups that ultimately increase the success of teams as they engage in collaborative problem solving.

\section*{b)Self-efficacy}
- Self-efficacy is a person's belief about his or her capabilities to perform tasks or assignments that can change and transform his or her life.
- It determines how the person feels, thinks, behaves and motivates themselves.
- Self-efficacy has the potential to determine four major processes namely cognitive, motivational, affective and selection processes.
- A strong sense of self-efficacy enhances a learner's accomplishment and personal wellbeing in many ways.
- Learners with high assurance in their capabilities approach difficult tasks as challenges to be mastered, rather than as threats to be avoided.
- Self-efficacy fosters intrinsic interest and deep engrossment in activities.
- Learners set themselves challenging goals and maintain a strong commitment to them. Self-efficacy as a competence will enable learners to develop and nurture intra-personal skills and values such as self-awareness, self-esteem, confidence and personal integrity.
- These competencies will enhance the learner's ability to heighten and sustain efforts in the face of failure and effectively manage stressful situations.
- A learner with a strong sense of self-efficacy will be courageous and bold enough to set and pursue personal educational, family, community, entrepreneurial, professional, and career goals in all forms of employment that will lead to personal accomplishment.
- An efficacious learner will be aware of the resources at their disposal and will take personal responsibility for the use, care, management, protection and preservation of these resources.
- A learner with strong self-efficacy will be internally motivated to establish and maintain healthy interpersonal relationships.
- They will demonstrate interpersonal relationship skills such as assertiveness, empathy, effective communication, negotiation skills, non-violent conflict resolution skills and peer pressure resistance skills.
- Creative and critical thinking that leads to effective decision making and problem solving is based on a strong sense of self-efficacy.
- Capacity building of teachers and parental engagement are two crucial factors that would determine acquisition of self-efficacy.
- The school will be expected to provide opportunities for parents to be empowered and engaged in the affairs and welfare of their children's education.

\section*{c)Critical Thinking and Problem Solving}
- An important outcome of quality education is teaching learners how to think critically.
- The are three types of thinking: reasoning, making judgements, and problem solving. It is possible for learners to reason in an uncritical way.
- When learners are empowered with critical thinking, they avoid being subjective, and use logic and evidence to arrive at conclusions.
- Critical thinking also facilitates exploring new ways of doing things and learner autonomy. Learners learn that for every issue there are multiple perspectives that they can explore, rather than a rigid recall and regurgitation of information.
- It helps learners to have an open mind and be ready to listen and appreciate information and opinions that may sometimes conflict with their earlier held beliefs and positions.
- Critical thinking and problem solving are useful for learners of all ages and in all the subjects and disciplines offered in the basic education curriculum.
- For example, in the sciences learners need to think critically about observations and patterns to
- develop ideas on how to solve problems.
- These competencies are also important for solving problems in their lives and communities, and will ultimately help them to fulfil their potential, which is the vision for the basic education curriculum.
- This will contribute to addressing the unemployment challenge in Kenya.
- Critical thinking and problem solving will be developed through age appropriate activities and
- programmes in the school curriculum.
- For example, at pre-primary school level learners can be asked to come up with the best ways of using and keeping their books, stationery and other personal items safe.
- At the other end of the basic education spectrum, learners can be asked to come up with the best ways of addressing the challenge of scarce resources such as water in the school and community.

\section*{d)Creativity and Imagination}
- Creativity and imagination refers to the ability to form new images and sensations in the mind, and to turn them into reality.
- It is the ability to imagine things that are not real, to form pictures in the mind of things that one has not seen or experienced, and turn those pictures into real things.
- It also refers to the act or power of forming mental images of things that are not present to the senses, or that are never wholly perceived in reality, and creating physical representations of those images.
- Imagination only exists or happens in the mind, and it remains in the mind.
- Creativity and imagination on the other hand, is characterized by the ability to perceive the world in new ways, to find hidden patterns, to make connections between seemingly unrelated phenomena, and to generate solutions.
- It is a phenomenon whereby something new and valuable is formed.
- In educational terms, creativity and imagination refers to the ability of learners and their teachers to form images and ideas in their minds, and turn them into real, visible creations.
- Learners who are imaginative and creative are able to make life interesting for themselves and others around them.
- They are able to use the knowledge, skills and values acquired in the learning process to create new ideas that result in products that add value to their lives and to the lives of others around them.
- The competence based curriculum recognizes this hidden ability in learners. It will therefore, inspire learners' imagination by presenting knowledge in ways that encourage learners to think as individuals.
- It will create scenarios that help learners to engage in imagination and encourage them to develop creations steered by the imagination.
- Their ability to imagine will be stretched through exposure to challenging situations that help to expand their thinking and creativity skills.
- The curriculum will also create room for innovative ways of teaching as well as creating an environment conducive to learning that offers all learners opportunities to explore their full potential in and through creativity and imagination.

\section*{e)Citizenship}
- Historically, human beings have always formed communities based on a shared identity.
- Such identities are forged in response to a variety of human needs, which might be economic, political, religious or social.
- As group identities grow stronger, those who hold them in commonality with others organize themselves into communities, articulate their shared values, and build governance structures to support their beliefs.
- The individuals in these communities identifythemselves as citizens.
- Citizenship is the state of being vested with the rights, privileges, and duties of a citizen.
- It creates a sense of belonging and attachment to one"s nation.
- The sense of citizenship helps to equip young people to deal with situations of conflict and controversy knowledgeably and tolerantly.
- They are able to understand the consequences of their actions, and those of the adults around them.
- Global citizenship is a way of living which recognizes that our world is an increasingly complex web of connections and interdependencies.
- One in which our choices and actions may have repercussions for people and communities locally, nationally or internationally.
- It nurtures personal respect and respect for others, wherever they live.
- It encourages individuals to think deeply and critically about what is equitable and just, and what will minimize harm to our planet.

\section*{f)Digital Literacy}
- Digital literacy can be described as having the knowledge, skills and behaviours which are necessary to effectively and safely use a wide range of digital content and devices.
- Such devices include mobile phones, smart phones, tablets, laptops and desktops among others.
- All these fall within the category of network enabled devices.
- Digital literacy focuses mainly on network enabled devices and should not be confused with computer literacy skills.
- However, traditional forms of literacy and computer literacy are enhancers in the acquisition of digital literacy skills.
- Individuals are presumed to be digitally literate if they possess a broad range of digital skills and
- knowledge, and have a basic understanding of the potential uses of computing devices.
- Digital literacy skills also include being able to use computer communication networks, being able to engage in online communication and social networks, being aware of and adhering to ethical behaviour protocols, being aware of societal issues raised through digital media, and being able to search, evaluate and use information channelled through digital platforms. Furthermore, the digital literate individual should also have the ability to safely and securely use technology while being able to assess the nature of the information acquired in order to support and enhance the environment.
- Digital literacy as a competence therefore encompasses knowledge and skills concerning the appropriate application of a variety of hardware platforms such as computers, tablets and mobile devices, and their software including but not limited to web search or internet application software.
- Digital literacy is a dynamic competence due to the fast-changing world of information communication technology and the ongoing development of technological devices as well as their related software.
- This is an area in which there is constant innovation and development as the industry attempts to keep up with a globally increasing demand for efficient and effective communication technologies.
- Currently, digital literacy is considered as one of the main core competencies for learning and life in the 21st century.
- It challenges existing thinking and practice while leading to a more innovative, creative and often transformational learning.

\section*{g)Learning to Learn}
- Learning is a continuous process that begins at birth and continues until death; it is the process through which we use our experience to deal with new situations and to develop relationships.
- As a concept, it involves far more than thinking as it incorporates the whole personality - senses, feelings, intuition, beliefs, values and will.
- If we do not have the will to learn, we will not learn and if we have learned, we are actually changed in some way.
- If the learning makes no difference it can have very little significance beyond being random ideas that float through our consciousness.
- Learning to learn is the ability to pursue and persist in learning, to organise one"s own learning by the effective management of time and information, both individually and in groups.
- This competence includes awareness of one"s learning process and needs, identifying available opportunities, and the ability to overcome obstacles in order to learn successfully.
- This competence means gaining, processing and assimilating new knowledge and skills as well as seeking and making use of guidance. Learning to learn helps learners to build on prior learning and life experiences in order to use and apply knowledge and skills in a variety of contexts.
- There are four pillars of learning: Learning to know, learning to do, learning to be and learning to live to live together.

UNIT 3.1: NATIONAL GOALS OF EDUCATION IN KENYA
An effective education system is guided by set goals and objectives.
The success of such a system relies on the interrelationship between the National goals of education, Level outcomes, general and specific outcomes of a subject.

The National goals of education are the general principles and statements which spell out the aspiration of a nation to be realised through education.

They give directions to a set of detailed intentions for the present and the future.
From the National goals of education, objectives for the different levels are drawn.
The level outcomes are used to determine the desired knowledge, skills and attitude that should
be acquired at the end of the course program.
The education system of Kenya at all levels is guided by the following goals;
1. Foster nationalism, patriotism, and promote national unity-Kenya's people belong to different communities, races and religions and should be able to live and interact as one people. Education should enable the learner acquire a sense of nationhood and patriotism. It should also promote peace and mutual respect for harmonious co-existence.
2. Promote social, economic, technological and industrial needs for national development

Education should prepare the learner to play an effective and productive role in the nation through realization of the following needs;
a) Social Needs-Education should instil social and adaptive skills in the learner for effective participation in community and national development.
b) Economic Needs-Education should prepare a learner with requisite competences that support a modern and independent growing economy. This should translate into high standards of living for every individual.
c) Technological and Industrial Needs-Education should provide the learner with necessary competences for technological and industrial development in tandem with changing global trends.
3. Promote individual development and self-fulfilment-Education should provide opportunities for the learner to develop to the fullest potential. This includes development of one's interests, talents and character for positive contribution to the society.
4.Promote sound moral and religious value-Education should promote acquisition of national values as enshrined in the Constitution. It should be geared towards developing a selfdisciplined and ethical citizen with sound moral and religious values.
5. Promote social equity and responsibility-Education should promote social equity and responsibility. It should provide inclusive and equitable access to quality and differentiated education; including learners with special educational needs and disabilities. Education should also provide the learner with opportunities for shared responsibility and accountability through service learning.
6.Promote respect for and development of Kenya's rich and varied cultures-Education should instil in the learner appreciation of Kenya's rich and diverse cultural heritage. The learner should value own and respect other people's culture as well as embrace positive cultural practices in a dynamic society.
7.Promote international consciousness and foster positive attitudes towards other nationsKenya is part of the interdependent network of diverse peoples and nations. Education should
therefore enable the learner to respect, appreciate and participate in the opportunities within the international community. Education should also facilitate the learner to operate within the international community with full knowledge of the obligations, responsibilities, rights and benefits that this membership entails.
8.Good health and environmental protection-Education should inculcate in the learner the value of physical and psychological well-being for self and others. It should promote environmental preservation and conservation, including animal welfare for sustainable development.

\section*{UNIT 3.2: THE LEVEL LEARNING OUTCOMES}
* Learning outcomes Learning outcomes indicate the expected observable behavioural changes in the learner after a learning experience.
$\star$ They are drawn from the national goals of education.
$\star$ Outcomes are usually expressed through the application of knowledge, skills and attitudes.
* The 2:6:3:3:3 education system framework has been organized into 3 levels;
i)Early years( Pre- primary and lower primary-5 years)
ii)Middle school( upper primary and junior secondary education-6 years)
iii)Senior school ( senior secondary education and tertiary education- 6 years)
$\star$ The Level learning outcomes are the demonstrable end results expected in learners after having gone through a specific level of CBC education, stated in general terms.

\section*{The general Level Learning Outcomes for Early Years Education;}

Task 3.1: In groups Study the curriculum designs for Pre primary 1, Grade 2 and 4 and identify the level outcomes that will help in achievement of each of the national goal of education in Kenya.

\section*{UNIT 3.3: SUBJECTS}

The curriculum designs for basic education have been organized into 3 categories; Pre-primary (PP1 and PP2, Primary(grade 1,2,3 4,5 and 6) and secondary (grades 7,8,9,10,11 and 12)

\section*{1.Pre-Primary subjects}

This has been organized into to levels; PP1 and PP2.

\section*{i)PP1 level design}

The learning areas include; Language activities Mathematics activities, Environmental activities, Psychomotor activities,CRE,IRE and HRE activities.

\section*{ii)PP2 level design}

The learning areas include; Language activities Mathematics activities, Environmental activities, Psychomotor activities,CRE,IRE and HRE activities.
2. Primary education

It has two levels; lower primary(grade 1,2 and 3) and Upper primary level (grades 4,5 and 6)

\section*{i)Lower primary level subjects}

The curriculum designs are organized in four volumes:
- Volume 1:Kiswahili Activities,Literacy Activities and English Activities
- Volume 2: Mathematics Activities, Environmental Activities and Hygiene and Nutrition Activities
- Volume 3:Christian Religious Education, Religious Education and Islamic Religious Education
- Volume 4: Movement and Creative Activities

\section*{ii)Upper primary level subjects}

The subjects are grouped into four volumes;
- Volume 1: Kiswahili,English and sign languages
- Volume 2: indigenous languages, French,German,Chinese and Arabic languages
- Volume 3: Mathematics, Science, Agriculture, Home Science and Psychomotor and Health Education.
- Volume 4: Social studies, Art and Craft,music, CRE,IRE and HRE.

NOTE: In each volume one subject is presented for all grades e.g In lower primary curriculum designs in volume 1, English subject is presented for grade 1,2 and 3 before moving to the next subject.

Task 3.3: In groups Study the curriculum designs for Pre primary level,lower primary and upper primary to identify time allocation per subject at each level.

\section*{UNIT 3.4: ESSENCE STATEMENT}

An essence statement gives a general overview of a learning area. It summarizes the fundamental ideas of each learning area. It also explains the rationale and justification of inclusion of the learning area in the curriculum.

The essence statement for a specific subject in different levels of learning is stated in a general way i.e it cuts across all grades within the same level for the given subject.

For example : For Middle school in English subject for Grades 4,5 and 6.The Essence
statement is as follows;
English is a major language of education, information, trade, diplomacy and social networking. It is the international common tongue and the most common foreign language. Moreover, English is the dominant language in science and technology, the internet and travel. Additionally,

English is an official language in Kenya and the medium of instruction from Grade Four. Therefore, a firm foundation in the language will enable the learner communicate appropriately in the national and international arena. This foundation will also enhance learning in lower secondary school.

Hence, proficiency in English is key to the realisation of the National Goals of Education, the link to the global community and the door to the worldwide information network. For this reason, the learner must be equiped with adequate oral, reading and writing competencies in English language. This will enable the learner to function competently in varied national and global communicative contexts.

During middle school, English is learnt as a second language. The learner will be engaged in tasks that enhance the acquisition and progressive application of English language skills. The emphasis in the presentation of the four language skills and grammar is to ensure they are functional. The learner will also experience the interdependence of the competences across the skills, and find the relevance of what they learn in their day- to-day contexts. Varied English language activities in Grades 4, 5, and 6 will enrich learning and empower the learner to apply acquired language competences with a lot of ease

Task 3.4: In groups Study the curriculum designs for Pre primary level,lower primary and upper primary and identify the essence statements for Mathematics and Psychomotor

UNIT 3.5: GENERAL LEARNING OUTCOMES
These learning outcomes indicate what the learner is expected to achieve in a given learning area across a given level.

For example: In English for upper primary the General Learning Outcomes are;
By the end of the Upper Primary Level, the learner should be able to:
1. Listen and respond appropriately to relevant information in a variety of contexts.
2. Read a variety of texts fluently, accurately and interpretively for lifelong learning.
3. Use grammatical forms to communicate ideas, opinions and emotions appropriately in different settings.
4. Write texts for various purposes legibly, accurately, creatively and cohesively for selfexpression.

\section*{5. Apply digital literacy skills to enhance their language competency}

Task 3.5: In groups study the mathematics and pychomotor curriculum designs for grade 1 and 5 and identify the general outcomes for each subjects.

UNIT 3.6: STRAND
A strand is a broad area of study within a specific learning area. It is a consistent phenomenological idea or concept, that runs through the learning area.

A strand also cuts across all levels of education. For example in English across all levels the strands are namely;
1. Listening and speaking
2. Reading
3. Grammar in use
4. Writing

Task 3.6: In groups study the mathematics curriculum designs for grade 3 and 4 and identify the strands given.

UNIT 3.7: THEMES
A theme is a topic or subject matter for discussion which help in presenting the strands and Sunday strands in a given subject i.e it will help draw context of learning experiences for each strand and substrand in in grade 4 English under the Theme of Family the learning context for listening and speaking,reading and writing will revolve around the topic of the family.

The Themes provide the learners with diverse knowledge on real life experiences
In each grade in a given subject the themes are different depending on the levels e.g in English subjects for different grades the themes are shown below;

Grade 4 English

Task 3.7: In groups study the Kiswahili curriculum designs for grade 3 and 4 and identify the themes given for each level.

UNIT 3.8: SUBSTRAND AND TIME ALLOCATION
A sub-strand represents smaller concepts within the strand
Each substrand is allocated number of lessons to be taught.
E.g in English grade 4, strand: Listening and speaking , substrand: Vocabulary and pronunciation is given 2 lessons.

Task 3.8: In groups study the psychomotor curriculum designs for grade 4 to identify one strand and the substrands.

UNIT 3.9: SPECIFIC LEARNING OUTCOMES
Specific learning outcomes are lesson based
Each strand/sub strand/theme in the curriculum designs has specific learning outcomes which are geared towards achieving the general learning outcomes.

Specific learning outcome should have:
- The action verb

It shows which action the learner will perform during the learning process
The action verb represent the 3 levels of learning; knowledge,skill and attitude.
i) Knowledge outcomes

These Measure the learner's ability to recognize or recall learned information.

They measure acquisition of facts, ideas, concepts; their application, synthesis to get new ideas and evaluation of the information.

They are stated using action verbs like;
Name,identify,list,record,underline,state,define,arrange,name,relate,describe,tell,recall,memorize, recall,repeat,recognize,label,select,reproduce etc

\section*{ii) Skill outcomes}

These measure the ability of the learner to using the knowledge acquired, a learner is able to apply it to perform certain tasks against a given standard. The standard to which a learner should perform the task is referred to as a competence.

Verbs to state these outcomes include; order,compare, contrast, Discuss, Explain, calculate,dramatize, role-play, distinguish,demonstrate,solve,prepare etc.

\section*{iii) Attitudinal outcomes}

Measure desirable beliefs and personal attributes that a learner acquires through knowledge and skill that influence performance.

They are stated using action verbs like; include;propose,suggest,follow,emulate,model,share,work,tell,answer,practice,recite,compose,a ct,organize,initiate, Influence, display,serve, appreciate, demonstrate etc.

\section*{Examples}
a) Knowledge: Identify commonly used punctuation marks in written texts for effective communication
b) Skill: Use commas and question marks correctly in written texts for clarity of writing
c) Attitudinal : Appreciate the role of punctuation marks for clarity in writing
- The object

The learning outcome also has an OBJECT, which answers the question "what" or the target of the action performed by the learner By the end of the sub strand, the learner should be able to:
a)Identify commonly used punctuation marks in written texts for effective communication
b)Use commas and question marks correctly in written texts for clarity of writing
c)Appreciate the role of punctuation marks for clarity in writing
- The context

Shows the place,reason or way the action will be performed by the learner.
It answers the question "why", "where", "how" and "when"

\section*{Example;}

By the end of the sub strand, the learner should be able to:
a)Identify commonly used punctuation marks in written texts for effective communication
b)Use commas and question marks correctly in written texts for clarity of writing.
c)Appreciate the role of punctuation marks for clarity in writing.

\section*{What characterizes a good learning outcome?}
- A good learning outcome begins with an action verb, followed by the object of the verb and a phrase that gives the context.
- Preferably only one verb is used in a learning outcome.
- Learning outcomes should be observable.
- Capable of being assessed.
- Does NOT use vague terms such as; know, understand, learn, be familiar with, be exposed to, be acquainted with, and be aware of.

NOTE: For every substrand the relevant specific learning outcomes are given.
Task 3.9: In groups study the science and technology curriculum designs for grade 4 to identify one strand and one substrand and give learning outcomes clearly showing the knowledge,skills and Attitudinal outcomes given

\section*{UNIT 3.10: KEY INQUIRY QUESTIONS}

Key Inquiry Questions (KIQ) is an approach where the teacher uses question to probe learners thinking to allow them to create information using their own words and understanding.

They:
- Help to focus the learning
- Probe for deeper meaning and set the stage for further questioning
- Foster the development of critical thinking skills and higher order capabilities such as problem solving
- Allow learners to explore ideas in an open-ended, non-judgmental, meaningful and purposeful way
- Encourage collaboration amongst learners, teachers, and the community and integrates technology to support the learning process.

When writing KIQ:
- Consider the focus of your learning outcome and the topic as given in the curriculum design.
- Examine the theme or concept in the curriculum that must be addressed and brainstorm on questions that would enable learners to think about the concept without dictating the direction or outcome of their thinking
- Utilise the six typical question words: Who? What? Where? When? Why? How?

NOTE: For every substrand there are specific key inquiry questions given in the designs.
Task 3.10: In groups study the social studies curriculum designs for grade 5 to identify one strand and one substrand and give the key inquiry questions given

UNIT 3.11: LEARNING EXPERIENCES
Learning experiences comprise of activities that the learner is engaged in during the lesson.
The activities may be carried out by an individual learner or as a group work activity.
However, they should ultimately, enable the learner to achieve the intended specific learning outcomes of the lesson.

A learning experience is the interaction between the learner and the external conditions in the environment to which he can react.

Learning experiences enable the learner to:
- Acquire knowledge, skills and develop attitudes
- Acquire the intended competences
- Learn from one another
- Self-regulate and evaluate
- Engage deeply in the subject matter
- Reflect on the learning process
- Interact with others during the learning process

Characteristics of good learning experiences
1. Problem Based Learning
a. Learning activities include applied portions/projects that are directly applicable to later life/work.
b. The learning activities include applied learning and problem solving.
c. The teacher uses an apprentice/mentor model: the teacher provides the tools / framework and presents students with a problem, then provides guidance as needed while they work through it.
2. Collaborative Learning
i. The activities include interactive, small group learning experiences.
ii. The teacher fosters a shared sense of responsibility amongst the learners; the group gains strength through working together to learn.
3. Small Group Discussion
a. Learning activities include small group discussion, which encouragescritical thinking and allows interaction with peers who may have relevant knowledge or expertise.
4. Authentic Tasks and Events
a. Students complete real world tasks as teaching examples (e.g., determine the guilt or innocence of a suspect).
b. Learning activities or projects are tied in to current events and/or include real life examples.
5. Interdisciplinary Learning
a. The learning activity mixes disciplines and allows students to apply one to the other.
6. Team Teaching
a. Teachers work together to incorporate related content in multiple courses to give students a sense of the wider context of the material.
7. Class Structure
a. The teacher provides good structure and guidance/instructions .
8. Emotion and Engagement
a. Learning activities engage the students' emotions.
b. The teacher is committed to and pays attention to the individuals - understanding where they are and helping them to get to where they should be.
c. The teacher incorporates the content into a clear narrative or story.
d. The teacher provides creative assignments (e.g., create a documentary about a topic rather than writing a research report about it).
e. The teacher demonstrates enthusiasm about teaching; he or she comes to class prepared (e.g., has case studies or good real-life examples).
9. Incorporates Reflective Teaching Strategies
a. Thinking about how to teach (e.g., watching yourself teach on video, practicing an activity before trying it in the classroom, gathering relevant real world stories to use) can help you provide more effective learning experiences for your students.

Selection of learning experiences
Principles of selecting Learning experiences;
- Learning is an active process in which the learner must be involved.
- Learning is affected considerably by individual goals, values and motives.
- Frequent repetition of response to a class of situations is important in learning skills.
- The wider the range of experiences presented to the learner, the more likely are the generalizations and discrimination to occur.

Factors to consider when/creteria of selecting learning experiences
The criteria for selecting learning experiences are derived from the principles of learning;
1.Validity;

Learning experiences must be closely connected with the educational goals and result in changed behavior with respect to the stipulated outcomes.

They should be in line with the knowledge/skills you want the students to have at the end of the course
2.Comprehensiveness;

Comprehensiveness demands that all the objectives which are stated should have corresponding experiences.
3.Variety;

Variable learning experiences should be presented.
4. Suitability;

The learning experiences must be closely related to the learner's needs, capacities, interests end ail other factors which condition learning.
5.Balance and continuity;

Involves balancing experiences from outside with others from the learning process itself.
6. Relevance

The learning experiences should have maximal relation to life.
7. Number of activities

Determine how many activities are achievable within the given timeframe.
8. Sequence of the activities

This involves Before Class Activities,in-class Activities and Out-of-class Activities
Before Class Activities- Help students prepare for class by giving them assignments such as readings, article reviews, problems, etc.

In-Class Activities-Give students opportunities to practice the skills and knowledge learned within class discussion and give prompt feedback.

Out-of-class Activities-Allow students to reflect on what they have learned by activities.
9. Environmentally safe and sustainable.

Activities should be culturally relevant and acceptable
Note: A variety of learning experiences are shown in the curriculum designs for each strand and
substrand.
Task 3.11: In groups study the agriculture curriculum designs for grade 4 to identify one strand and one substrand and identify the culturally suitable learning experiences from the list.

\subsection*{3.12: VALUES}

Values are standards that guide an individual on how to respond or behave in each circumstance.

Thus, values influence how we feel, act and make choices in life.
Today, there is a noticeable values and behavioural crisis among the general population and young people.

Many youngsters are growing up without the desired values, positive attitudes and psychosocial competencies needed to function as responsible citizens.

The primary responsibility for nurturing values rests with parents and the community, but education too has a key role to play in this regard.

The teaching of values will facilitate the achievement of the curriculum reforms' vision, particularly with respect to moulding ethical citizens'.

The Core Values in the BECF are: love, responsibility, respect, unity, peace, patriotism, social justice and integrity.

For every strand and substrand the relevant core values are given.
Task 3.12: In groups study the health and nutrition curriculum designs for grade 1 to identify one strand and one substrand and give the values given and describe how you will impart them to your learners during a lesson.

UNIT 3.13: CORE COMPETENCIES
The Core Competencies are sets of intellectual, personal, and social and emotional proficiencies that all students need in order to engage in deep, lifelong learning and apply them to fit in the 21st century world.

There are 7 Core competencies identified in CBC by KICD namely;
- Communication and collaboration.
- Critical thinking and problem solving.
- Imagination and creativity.
- Citizenship.
- Learning to learn.
- Self-efficacy.
- Digital literacy.

For every substrand there is a list of the identified core competencies
Task 3.13: In groups study the social studies curriculum designs for grade 5 to identify one strand and one substrand and give the core competencies given. Identify the achievable competencies from the list and describe how you can help learners achieve them in your lesson.

\section*{UNIT 3.14: PERTINENT AND CONTEMPORARY ISSUES (PCIs)}

Children like adults are faced with a myriad of challenges owing to the legal, technological, social, cultural and economic dynamics in society.

It is important that these challenges are addressed as the overall wellbeing of a child is critical for the survival of any society.

These Areas in the Competence Based Curriculum (CBC) are referred to as Pertinent and Contemporary Areas (PCIs) formerly known as emerging/Cross-cutting Areas.

Areas that have been identified as Pertinent and Contemporary have been put into six broad categories.
- Citizenship
- Health Education
- Life Skills and Values Education
- Education for Sustainable Development (ESD)
- Learner Support programmes
- Community Service learning
- Parental Empowerment and Engagement

For every strand and substrand the relevant PCIs are given.

Task 3.14: In groups study the environmental curriculum designs for grade 1 to identify one strand and one substrand and give the PCIs given and justify the need for their inclusion in the selected strand and substrand. Describe how you will infuse them to help learners achieve them.

\section*{UNIT 3.15: COMMUNITY SERVICE LEARNING(CSL)}

Community Service Learning (CSL) is an experiential learning strategy that integrates classroom learning to learning from the community to enable learners to reflect, experience and learn from the community.

It is a process where learners link personal and social development with academic and cognitive development.

The reformed curriculum has consequently introduced Community Service Learning as a component of learning that will be compulsory to all learners.

Community Service Learning will create opportunities for learners to apply the knowledge and skills acquired through the formal dimension in their community while at the same time learning from the community.

This will develop in the learner not only employability skills but also promote personal growth by strong and productive relationships with the community.

Learners will utilize the acquired knowledge, skills, values and attitudes to improve the welfare of the community.

Community Service Learning covers aspects of Citizenship, Entrepreneurship, Financial Literacy,
Life Skills, Communication Skills and Research.
These are given for every strand and substrand
Task 3.15: In groups study the agriculture curriculum designs for grade 5 to identify one strand and one substrand and give the CSL project given and describe how you can organize it.

\section*{UNIT 3.16: PARENTAL EMPOWERMENT AND ENGAGEMENT (PEE)}

Parents, family and care-givers are a child's first and most important educator and can be a positive influence and help their child do well at school.

Parents need to be empowered and provided with useful information to assist them to better engage with their child's learning.

Parents also require to get involved in their child's learning throughout schooling.

This engagement will enable them to participate in identifying the learner's potential and contribute to nurturing it.

When parents are involved in their children's learning, it can have very positive impact on education outcomes.

Teachers should create strong partnerships with parents to ensure they get engaged in learning.
They are given for every strand and substrand
Task 3.16: In groups study the environmental curriculum designs for grade 3 to identify one strand and one substrand and give the PEE activities given and describe how you can infuse them.

\section*{UNIT 3.17: NON-FORMAL LEARNING}

Non-formal activities are structured learning activities that are geared towards development of affective and psychomotor dimensions of learning. Some of the non-formal activities may include: singing, dancing, reciting poems, club activities, games and debates.

These are given for every strand and substrand
Task 3.17: In groups study the environmental curriculum designs for grade 1 to identify one strand and one substrand and give the non formal learning activities given and describe how you can integrate them for learning.

UNIT 3.18: SUGGESTED LEARNING RESOURCES
Learning resources are any materials that help to facilitate the teaching and learning process. Such materials include charts, realia, models and the immediate environment.

Learning resources prompts the learners' reasoning and facilitates the development of competences such as critical thinking and problem solving, creativity and imagination, collaboration, self-efficacy among others.

They make images to last longer in the mind. When a learner correctly sees, hears, smells and touches then, he or she can put the pieces together and get the picture even without you having to explain.

These are given for every strand and substrand
Task 3.18: In groups study the science curriculum designs for grade 4 to identify one strand and one substrand and give the suggested learning resources given. From the list identify the
locally available resources and how you can acquire them. Avail the resources and take photos of them in your classroom.

\section*{UNIT 3.19: LINKS TO OTHER LEARNING AREAS}

Some of the competencies that are developed in one learning area can be reinforced through other learning areas for example when you teach the concept of the flag in environmental activities, it could be enhanced in the learning area of movement and creative activities where learners are expected to draw and color the national flag.

These are given for every strand and substrand
Task 3.19: In groups or pairs study the English curriculum designs for grade 4 to identify one strand and one substrand and give the link to other learning areas given and describe how you can integrate in a lesson.

UNIT 3.20: SUGGESTED ASSESSMENT METHODS
These are given for each strand and substrand
The main purpose of Competency Based Assessment is to:
- Inform teaching and learning decisions
- Establish the level of learner's competence
- Ascertain progress against the learning outcomes
- Encourage learners to make judgments about their performance
- Enhance learner motivation
- Identify where intervention, focused support or referral is required
- Make decisions regarding choice of subject, course and careers pathways.

Formative assessment or Assessment for learning (AFL) is an investigative tool to monitor the progress of an individual learner in meeting the learning outcomes in a subject or learning area. It involves gathering data during the learning process, and provides feedback to both the learner and you to help improve learning.

This approach helps build an accurate and detailed profile of your understanding of the curriculum and inform teaching so that you can provide appropriate assistance to the learner.

During assessment during a lesson a learner is assisted to develop a capacity to be independent, self-directed to set individual goals, monitor own progress/ self-assess, and reflect on his/her learning.

A learner can self-assess when you provide the learner with a clear picture of steps required to reach proficiency, a set criterion that have a variety of examples or models of decent work for comparison.

The summative assessment is carried at the end of a unit or task. It is designed to provide information on the achievement of a learner to parents, educators and learners themselves.

Some methods for assessing learner's different strands and substrands include;
- Observations
- Written tests/assignments
- Checklists: assist the teacher to determine areas of focus to enable the learner to develop relevant knowledge and skills
- Rating Scales: Use of descriptive words, such as always, usually, sometimes and never
- Questionnaires: A list of questions on various aspects of a person's situation
- Project Method: a set of activities implemented within a set timeframe
- Learners identify a need in their community where they can provide services based on what they have learned.
- Journaling: the learner keeps a record of their personal feelings, thoughts and experiences daily.
- Portifolio: a purposeful collection of work samples, self-assessments and goal statements that reflect a learner's progress.
- Assessment rubrics

They provide feedback to educators, parents and learners, about a learner's achievement to make decisions for appropriate placements or further studies.

Task 3.20: In groups or pairs study the Mathematics curriculum designs for grade 4 to identify one strand and one substrand and give the suggested assessment methods given. Identify the most suitable method for your lesson and describe how you will use it by developing an assessment tool.

\section*{UNIT 3.21: ASSESSMENT RUBRICS}

A rubric is an assessment tool that clearly indicates achievement criteria across all the components of any kind of student work, from written to oral to visual.

It can be used for marking assignments, class participation etc.
The CBC rubrics identify the creteria for assessment(performance indicator) and rating scale as follows;

For formative assessment the ratings are given below;
Level 1. E.E - Exceeds Expectations
Level 2. M.E - Meet Expectations
Level 3. A.E - Approaching Expectation
Level 4. B.E - Below Expectation
NOTE: The teacher allocates marks for each strand,substrand or class activity and structures the ratings into the given above creterion.

The summative assessment rating is calculated based on the average of the formative assessment ratings and is structured under the following aspects:

Level 1. E.E - Exceeds Expectations (80-100\%)
Level 2. M.E - Meet Expectations (65-79\%)
Level 3. A.E - Approaching Expectation (50-64\%)
Level 4. B.E - Below Expectation (0-49\%)
NOTE: For every substrand there is a preidentified assessment creterion given as assessment rubrics for the instructor to use when assessing the learners.

The assessment creterion given are drawn from the learning outcomes and experiences for the given substrand.

Assessment rubrics will be indicated at the end of every substrand.
Task 3.21: In groups or pairs study the Homescience and kiswahili curriculum design for grade 4 to identify one strand and one substrand and give the assessment rubric given for each subject. Prepare an assessment progress record for your learners for the strand and compile a report for the given substrand in the given subjects.

Facilitator's Notes
UNIT 4.1: INTRODUCTION TO MICRO TEACHING

\section*{What is teaching?}

A process of imparting knowledge,skills and values from one person( teacher) to another(learner)

Teaching is the activity of facilitating learning.
Effectiveness in teaching does not relate to teacher's age, sex, and teaching experience.
Teaching is enhanced by the following best teacher qualities;
- Good planning and organizational skills
- Effective communication skills
- Good listening skills
- Collaboration-engaging classroom presence, value in real-world learning and exchange of best practices
- Adaptability(flexibility)
- Empathy
- Patience
- Expertize( mastery of content
- . Other characteristics of effective teaching include an
- Good researcher(Lifelong love of learning)

\section*{The concept of micro teaching}

\section*{Dr. Allen and his group evolved Microteaching in 1963 in America.}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_19_46598a250aabfc9c621cg-064.jpg?height=1544&width=1470&top_left_y=697&top_left_x=249)

\section*{What is Micro-teaching?}
- Micro-teaching is a teacher training technique, which helps the teacher trainee to master the teaching skills, requiring him/her to teach a single concept using a specified teaching skill for a short period to a very small member of pupils.
- The teacher trainee continues to teach the concept over and over until he/she masters the skill involved in imparting it to the students.
- He/she is expected to make the lesson observable, measurable and controllable.
- Micro teaching can also be defined as a scaled down lesson demonstration by a trainee to a group of peers which is aimed at developing competence in application of a specific teaching skill by a trainee.

\section*{Characteristics/features of Microteaching}

\section*{What are the main features of a micro teaching lesson?}
- Duration of teaching as well as number of students are less-Teaching of a small unit of content to the small group of students (6-10) in a small amount of time (5-10 min.)
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_19_46598a250aabfc9c621cg-065.jpg?height=814&width=1159&top_left_y=1368&top_left_x=369)
- Content is divided into smaller units.
- Only one teaching skill is considered at a time.
- Provision of immediate feedback.
- In micro teaching cycle, there is facility of re-planning, re-teaching and re-evaluation.

\section*{Phases of micro teaching}

Micro-teaching emphasizes three things/phases:
a) Knowledge Acquisition Phase :
- In this phase the teacher trainee learns about the skill and its components through discussion, illustrations and demonstration of the skill given by the expert.
- He/she learns about the purpose of the skill and the condition under which it proves useful in the teaching/learning process.
- His/Her analysis of the skill into components leading to various types of behaviours which is to be practised.
- The teacher trainee tries to gain a lot about the skill from the demonstration given by the expert.
- He discusses and clarifies each and every aspect of the skill.
b)Skill Acquisition Phase :
- On the basis of the demonstration presented by the expert, the teacher trainee plans a micro-lesson, lesson for practising the demonstrated skill.
- He practices the teaching skill through the Micro-teaching cycle and continues his efforts till he attains mastery level.
- The feed-back component of micro-teaching contributes significantly towards the mastery level acquisition of the skill.
- On the basis of the performance of teacher trainee in teaching, the feed back is provided for the purpose of change in behaviour of the teacher trainee in the desired direction.
c) Transfer to learners Phase:
- After attaining mastery level and command over each of the skills, the teacher trainee integrates all these skills and transfer to actual classroom teaching is done during this transfer phase.

\section*{Micro Teaching Steps}
1. ORIENTATION
2. DISCUSSION OF TEACHING SKILL
3. SELECTION OF A PARTICULAR TEACHING

4. THE PRACTICE OF THE SKILL
5. PROVING THE FEEDBACK
6.RE-PLANNING
7. RE-TEACHING
8. RE-FEEDBACK
9. REPETITION OF THE MICROTEACHING

CYCLE

The Micro-teaching programme involves the following steps :
Step 1. Orientation: A Particular skill to be practised is explained to the teacher trainees in terms of the purpose and components of the skill with suitable examples.

Step 2: Discussion of the teaching skill: The teacher trainer gives the demonstration of the skill in Micro-teaching in simulated conditions to the teacher trainees.

Step 3: Lesson Planning: The teacher trainee plans a short lesson plan on the basis of the demonstrated skill for his/her practice.

Step 4: Skill practice: The teacher trainee teaches the lesson to a small group of pupils. His lesson is supervised by the supervisor and peers.

Step 5: Feedback: On the basis of the observation of a lesson, the supervisor and peers give feedback to the teacher trainee.

The supervisor reinforces the instances of effective use of the skill and draws attention of the teacher trainee to the points where he could not do well.

Suggestions for improvement are given by the supervisor and peers.
Step 6: Re-planning: In the light of the feed-back given by the supervisor, the teacher trainee replans the lesson plan in order to use the skill in more effective manner in the second trial.

Step 7: Re- Teaching: The revised lesson is taught to another comparable group of pupils by
incorporating the suggested strategies.
Step 8: Re-feedback: The supervisor observes the re-teach lesson and gives re-feed back to the teacher trainee with convincing arguments and reasons.

Step 9: Repetition of the micro Teaching cycle:The 'teach - re-teach' cycle may be repeated several times till adequate skill mastery level is achieved.

UNIT 4.2: PURPOSE OF MICRO TEACHING
Why is micro teaching important?
Micro teaching;
- Enables the trainee to learn and assimilate a new teaching skill.
- Helps the trainee to develop and apply a number of teaching skills
- Enhances communication development; problem-solving and critical thinking skills.
- Enhances confidence in teaching
- Helps individual trainees to compare effectiveness of variations of different presentations thus improving experience to the trainee.
- Helps the trainees to learn from one another.
- Exposes the trainees to real life classroom setups
- Prepares teacher trainees on how to deal with real classroom settings effectively.
- Acts as an induction exercise for trained teachers to improve the skills of experienced teachers.

\section*{UNIT 4.3: MICRO TEACHING SKILLS}

\section*{What are micro teaching skills?}
- These are the skills that are utilized to deliver the lesson in a more logical and systematic manner.
- The teacher requires mastery of the art of bringing the learners to focus, from the beginning to the end of the lesson and acquire learning effectively.
- A teacher trainee in the process of micro-teaching should be able to know how to do lesson preparation and planning, lesson introduction,presentations and explanation, effective questioning, illustration with examples, blackboard utilization, reinforcement, stimulus variation, classroom management,use of audio-visual aids and lesson conclusion.

\section*{1. PLANNING/PREPARATION}

This involves the selection,organization and planning of related content amd learning experiences in which the teaching skill under practice will be executed and practiced.

\section*{Planning for a micro teaching lesson}

In preparing for micro-teaching, there are some basic steps that need to be taken to ensure a successful outing. These steps are briefly outlined below:
- Choice of a topic/concept: Here, the skill to be taught in the micro-teaching class is picked based on the curriculum and the scheme of work intended to achieve the curriculum contents specified. Efforts should be made to establish a link of previous knowledge with present topic.
- Outlining the Outcomes: This is the step where the teacher trainee thinks of the outcomes of his/her lesson/presentation to be achieved based on the topic of his/her lesson.
- Mapping out the lesson plan: This step incorporates the first two steps. This is a guide to the teacher trainee, which the teacher trainee will handle in order to present his/her lesson.
- Selection of learning experiences: This is where the teacher trainee thinks of both overt and covert activities which the learners should perform to achieve the lesson objectives.
- Development of lesson content: Here, the teacher trainee thinks of what should form the
content of what the learners should learn based on the topic and the behavioural outcomes set out to achieve the desired goal of the lesson
- Division of content into smaller units: The teacher trainee here is expected to think of dividing the content into smaller units to make teaching or presentation easier. Here, he/she aligns the goals, aims and objectives of the lesson to be taught in line with the curriculum and simplifies the concept through different components.
- Selection of teaching methods: At this level of preparation, an appropriate method of presenting or teaching the content is selected. Such methods may include lecture method, discussion method, project method, play method, guided inquiry method, etc. The choice of any of these methods depends on the topic to be presented. At this point, he/she thinks of organizing the learning experiences, content selection and selection of methods sequentially.
- Selection of Materials to use in teaching: In order to be well prepared for micro-teaching, the teacher should think of how to acquire and present the appropriate teaching aids or materials to use in teaching his/her lesson. This is usually done in line with the strand and substrand,availability of the materials, source of financing the materials, usability of the materials, skills in using the materials and relevance of the materials to be acquired.
- Sequencing the steps to be taken in lesson presentation: At this level of preparation for micro teaching, the teacher trainee should be able to map out how he/she should present his/her lesson logically and rehearse the steps to achieve a huge success during presentation. He/she maps out preliminary questions and introduction. Class control or management mechanism is also considered here while preparing for micro-teaching
- Assessment procedures: This is another area that a teacher trainee should be prepared for before embarking on micro-teaching. Here, he/she thinks of the evaluation procedure that will be used in assessing learners in his/her lesson. He/she writes down some questions that should be asked either in-between lesson or at the end of the lesson to ascertain if the outcomes of the lesson would be achieved

\section*{A sample of a 10 minutes micro teaching plan of activities}

\section*{2) SET INDUCTION SKILL}
- Set induction is pre-instructional skill employed by the teacher to arouse and sustain learners' interest and attention in readiness for transition from one lesson to another,from one lesson activity to another etc.
- In simple terms it involves getting learners set/ready for the lesson concepts for proper instructional delivery and understanding and mastery.
- Its a training technique that involves all the activities carried out by the trainee teacher to capture the attention of the learners, while preparing their minds and motivating them to receive the new content.
- A good set induction should be short, stimulating and directed towards sustaining the learners' interest.
- It Ensures the teachers achieves their pre-planned action by arousing the interest of their learners, create an atmosphere of curiosity and motivation in the classroom, thereby energizing, directing and sustaining the learners through the lesson.

It is a technique that;
- Help in Establishing rapports with the learners
- Help in Linking with past experiences
- Enhance the link between introduction and main parts

\section*{Strategies for set induction}
i) Asking learners Key Inquiry Questions(question and answer) This is aimed at understanding what learners know and what they don't know or learners preconceptions and misconceptions before delivery for them to form new conceptions
ii) Displaying learning resources and asking learners to reflect what may be the purpose of the lesson.
iii) Exploring the connections between lessons(reviewing previous lessons and linking it to the current)
iv) Stimulus variations e.g use of songs,poem,stories,tonal variations,roleplays and dramatization etc.
v)Explaining the purpose of the lesson for learners to reflect on what to expect.
vi)The use of Silence; in the class, the teacher is expected to speak to the learners for direction.

But a strange situation where the teacher simply gazes at the whole learners without any comment calls for attention and keen observation for any line of action from teacher.

This way, you can sustain the attention of the learners before introducing your new lesson.
vii)The use of Voice/tonal variations--- The interest of the learners can also be sustained by the teacher's voice.

It is therefore important for you as a teacher to modulate your voice - from low to high tones depending on the quietness or otherwise of the class.
viii)The use of movement; it is also important for you to know that the teacher's pattern of movement in the class could be used to set induce the learners.

Your gesture and posture constitute this class movement, and you should adhere to acceptable pattern of movement

\section*{Application of the skill}

It can be used in classroom during;

\section*{1. Introduction of a lesson;}
- At the level of lesson introduction, there should be a purposeful process of gaining learners attention and assisting them to key into the lesson delivery.
- This makes sure all learners start at the same note i.e this invariably balances the problems that may be created by the level of individual differences and the learners' perception.

\section*{2. Initiating a discussion session;}
- In this section, the learners' interest should be raised to a situation where they can conveniently and enthusiastically participate in the lesson discussion.
- This part ensures pooling together of ideas from the learners, which elicit confidence and tolerance on their part.

\section*{3. Introducing an assignment;}
- Introducing an assignment should be a technique for teachers to use particularly, to stimulate the learners thought process when response to instruction is required.
- It is pertinent to make the learners appreciate the essence of any assignment given to them.
- This could be done through guidelines and providing some examples to help them accomplish the task.

\section*{4. Preparing for a field trip/Nature walk etc}
- Since the field trip or nature walks are excursions outside the classroom, the teacher should set induce the learners by explaining to them the purpose of the trip
- This pre-information will arouse the learners' interest and expectation.
- It is necessary to note that every learning situation requires a unique type of set in consideration to the content of the lesson to be taught and the characteristics of the learners.
5. Preparation of practical session in Laboratory/workshop/library etc.
- Since the activities involved in these laboratories will require safety measures, it becomes very necessary that you set induce your learners in the cares and uses of equipment.

\section*{6. Preparing your learners for viewing an educational programme;}
- The utilization of audio or visual programmes require some complex activities, hence the need to explain the need for viewing the educational programmes to the learners before the actual viewing.
7. In between the different stages of lesson plan;
- The lesson plan components emphasized as stages of the lesson areintroduction,development/presentation, application and evaluation.
- Hence, you should plan adequately for transition activities/strategies that will facilitate the linking up of the different stages and furthermore enhance the smooth and logical flow of the whole lesson.
- You should at this stage avoid the use of general remarks and statements, instead, use specific 'prompts' that expose the students' level of understanding of the lesson.
- The prompts you use might be specific questions setting learners up and leading them to the next level of presentation

\section*{Functions of set induction;}
- Set induction gives actual meaning to new concepts and content, hence stimulate retention and recall of learnt information.
- Set induction is also useful in helping learners to establish interest and deep involvement in the intending lesson.
- Set induction generally leads to the realization of set objectives of the lesson.
- A true application of set induction normally enhances the effective management of the classroom.
- Set induction makes the learners to be more dedicated to learn every bit of information presented to them by their teacher.
- Application of set induction makes the use of instructional materials more economical.

\section*{Task 2:}

Describe how you would introduce the above lesson.

\section*{3)REINFORCEMENT SKILL}
- Reinforcement is an event which enhances the possibilities of recurrence of the response when a stimulus is produced in the similar situations.
- It is an evidence-based practice used toteach target skills and increase desired behavior. Reinforcement means the use of such stimuli or their presentation or their removal so that the possibilibility of recurrence of some responses may increase.
- For example, few words of appreciation increase the possibility or reoccurring the same behaviour of the pupils.
- In such a situation, the words of appreciation function as stimuli and the resultant behaviour of the pupils is termed as the response.
- There are two types of reinforcement these include positive and negative reinforcement.
- If the event increases the possibility of the response, it is said to be "Positive Reinforcement".
- If the event decreases the possibility of the response, it is said to be "Negative Reinforcement".

\section*{Positive reinforcement:}
- Giving a positive response when an individual shows positive and required behavior.
- The most common types of positive reinforcement are praise and rewards.
- For example, praising a student for coming early to school or for doing a good job or for submitting an assignment on time.
- This will increase probability of outstanding behavior occurring again.
- It is the delivery of a reinforcer (primary such as food and comfort or secondary such as verbal praise, toys, or preferred activities) after the toddler does the target skill or behavior.

\section*{Negative reinforcement:}
- Taking something negative away in order to increase a response.

Negative reinforcement encourages students to perform better so they can have an unpleasant condition removed from them.
- It is the removal of an object or activity that the toddler does not like (e.g., staying at the table at dinner) when the toddler does the identified behavior or skill.

\section*{Purpose of using reinforcement skill}

The main purposes of using the skill are to:
1. Increase students' attention
2. Motivate students
3. Facilitate students' behavior
4. Control and notify disruptive students' behavior
5. Help students to develop self management learning
6. Enable students to evaluate their own learning
7. Recognize students' achievement and efforts
8. Improve classroom discipline
9. Increase participants' confidence
10. Encourage persistence which help learners to achieve more

Components of reinforcement
The components include:
1. Positive verbal reinforcement e.g. Oh!!, well done, Good, Excellent, right.
2. Gestural reinforcement e.g. hand movement, head movement, nodding, eye contact, smiling, patting, writing the correct answer on the board.
3. Proximity reinforcement e.g. sitting/standing besides students, come closer to students to listen to something, moving around students.
4. Contact reinforcement e.g. touching on head, patting on back.
5. Token reinforcement e.g. offering small token gift.

Techniques of Reinforcement in Microteacing
There are several techniques of reinforcement available for use in the classroom
i) Positive Verbal Reinforcement:

There are positive comments given by the teacher on the correct response of the pupils. They are manifested in form of:
a. Using words or phrases like „good" excellent", „you have tried", „keep it up" etc.

Downloaded by Patrick Ngobifo (pngôbiro@gmail.com)
b. Using pupils idea to develop the lesson
c. Using extra-verbal cues like „um", „aha", to encourage the pupils.
d. Using prompts like „carry on", „okay", „think again"
ii)Negative Verbal reinforcement
- This occurs when the teacher gives comments on the incorrect response of the pupils by saying that the pupils response is wrong or by making sarcastic comments like; fool,idiot, stupid. Etc. Such comments discourage students.
iii)Positive Non-Verbal Reinforcement.
- In this case, the teacher makes comments on a correct response from the pupils without using words.
- He may do this by nodding, smiling, patting, writing the pupils answer on the chalkboard.
- By so doing, the teacher is encouraging the pupils to participate maximally in the development of the lesson.
iv) Negative Non-Verbal Reinforcement
- This is when the teacher shows his disapproval without talking. He does so by frowning, staring, looking angrily at the responding pupil.
- This behavior may create fear in the pupils and he will not be bold enough to make any attempt of responding in future.
v)Delayed Reinforcement:
- This is done to reinforce a student later based on some earlier action.
- Through delayed reinforcement you show that action and contributions are not forgotten and that they have continuing importance. For Example Directing a question to a student who has shown prior knowledge in the subject area.
- This is referred to as delayed reinforcement.
vi)Vicarious Reinforcement:
- This relates to learning through what happens to others. In the classroom if a student's action is reinforced, others tend to act in the same way.
- Usually, it is effective because the desired behaviour had already been modeled and consequently need not be taught.
- For example If Jane is praised for a certain action, Ann desires the same teacher's praise so she acts to satisfy the teachers condition.
vii)Qualified Reinforcement:
- In this approach students' actions are only partially acceptable, and you may want to reinforce the student in way that will motivate them continued attempt at the desired action.
- For example: If Juma gets a problem wrong on the board, you could reinforce him that the procedure is correct or reinforce his good efforts.

\section*{Types of Reinforcers / Reinforcement Systems}

\section*{1) Natural and Direct Reinforcer:}
- This type of reinforcement results directly from the appropriate behavior.
- example, interacting appropriately with peers in group activities will lead to more invitations to join such activities.
- The natural reinforcement for appropriate bids for attention, help, participation, etc. is providing the attention, help and opportunity to participate.
- The goal should always be to move the student to natural and intrinsic reinforcement.

\section*{2) Social Reinforcers:}

These are reinforcers socially mediated by teachers, parents, other adults, and peers which express approval and praise for appropriate behaviour.
$90 \%$ are more effective than concrete ones.
They can be;
a) Verbal: Good job, Well done, I can tell, you are working really hard, You're nice, etc.
b)Written: Super write, Excellent essay, Keep it up, etc.
c) Expressions: nodding your head, smiling, clapping, a pat on the back

\section*{3)Activity Reinforcers:}
- Activity reinforcers are very effective and positive for students because it appeals to their interest.

\section*{Examples;}
- Allowing students to participate in preferred activities (such as games, computer time, etc.).
- Participate in choosing a classmate with whom to participate in activities. This also provides social reinforcement from the partner. Being giving responsibility to lead a team

\section*{4)Tangible Reinforcers:}
- Reinforcers are tangible things like edibles, toys, balloons, stickers, and awards. Edibles and toys: However, they should be used with caution.
- Parents/teachers may have reason to object to edibles as reinforcement for student with weight problem e.g toys and others can make other students envious, Certificates, displaying work, and letters home to parents commending the students" progress and sponsorship

\section*{5)Token Reinforcers:}
- Token reinforcement involves awarding points or tokens for appropriate behavior.
- These rewards have little value in themselves but can be exchanged for something of value.

\section*{Reinforcement Schedule (Timing and frequency of reinforcement)}

Students are likely to repeat an action if they are reinforced immediately.
It can be in continuous or intermittent form.
i) Continuous:

Students are reinforced after each correct response. However, it should be used in early stage
of learning.
ii)Intermittent:

Reinforce often but not following every occurrence of desirable behaviour. Can be either on ratio or interval.

In Fixed Ratio, the Students are reinforced after a CERTAIN NUMBER OF DESIRED ACTION. E.g. Praising a student after every third/fourth question is answered.

In Variable Ratio the Students are reinforced after a NUMBER OF UNPREDICTABLE RESPONSES. E.g. Praising a student not every time after a question is answered, but not fixed number.

\section*{Guidelines for using Reinforcement}
- Show genuine warmth and enthusiasm to show that you really mean to say "good"
- Teacher should try to vary the style or type of reinforcement they use. A constant repetition will render the reinforcement monotonous and meaningless.
- Try to avoid using negative reinforcement. If you must use it, be tactful about it. For example, if a student is way off the subject and you desperately need to get the class back on track, do not say "ship up" but rather say "that's interesting, but may be we can discuss it some other time and get back to our main topic for today".
- using reinforcement, consider the learners' age, sex, social group etc. there must be a relationship between the reinforcement and the behavior being reinforced.
- should be for all the pupils and not for those only who answer the questions or meritorious pupils.

\section*{Misuse of Reinforcement}

Teachers must use reinforcement with care. Misuse of it affect the learning process.
A teacher misuses reinforcement if he/she;
a. Offers a reinforcement that is bigger than the action performed by the learner. For example when a student gets an answer correct and the teacher says, "good", from today I make you the prefect of this school. The reinforcement is too big for the action being reinforced.
b. Depends wholly on one or two favourite types. The over-used reinforcers soon lose their effectiveness.
c. Fails to be objective or is partial in the award of reinforcement. The moment the students notice partiality in teacher, he loses credibility and confidence of the students.
d. Gives reinforcement before a task is accomplished. Succh reinforcement is capable of interfering with the complete development of student. One must take care that the student has finished exhibiting the desired behaviour before providing reinforcement for the action performed.
e. Takes reinforcement to mean over indulgence of his students. In-correct responses should not be reinforced, monetary reward should be avoided. These should be noted otherwise they turn out to yield negative counter effect.

\section*{Task}

Discuss five techniques a teacher can use to reinforcing his students.

\section*{4) SKILL OF EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATION}

Communication involves passing of information from the source to the audience.
In teaching It helps into processes; Explantation and questioning

\section*{I) Explanation}

It involves the ability of a teacher to describe Logically 'How', 'Why' and 'What' of concept through verbal and non verbal communication.

Communication process in the classroom situation takes two ways namely: verbal and nonverbal communication. While verbal communication is frequently and consciously used by the teacher, nonverbal communication is seldomly and in fact, unconsciously used in the classroom.
a) Verbal communication skill

\section*{Techniques of verbal Communication skill}
a)Ensure Content Relevance- Never speak above the level of your audience. Use the vocabulary level they understand.

There is nothing good in bombarding the students with big words, which they find difficult to comprehend. You would have succeeded in proving that you are familiar with

English dictionary but you would have failed to communicate to your students.
b) Use simple language- Do not attempt to be complex. Otherwise you may use wrong words unknowingly. Instead of using "amalgamation" why not say "merger". Why don't you say "join" instead of "synthesize"?

It is advisable not to go into use of idioms and proverbs when you are not sure of the proper application of such types of speech. You may end up confusing or misleading the students.
c) Should be audible- consider the size of your audience and let the volume of your voice be regulated along with the size of your audience.
d)Ideas Should be in a sequence from simple to complex for better understanding.
e) The language Should be according to the age, experience and mental level of the pupils
f) Use of Non verbal cues- In order to make verbal communication achieve its purpose some gestures are often introduced e.g A shaking of the head, a nodding, a wave of the hand or a stroking of the finger etc. This will make a long-lasting impact on the audience.
g) Good command/mastery of language- A teacher should be proficient in whichever language he wants to sue in the class. He should be well informed as regards the pronunciation of the words as the meaning and usage of the word.
h) Avoid distractions- e.g "Noise" is the factor that inhibits the flow of information from sender to the receiver. A teacher should identify as much as possible the noise factor in the classroom communication process and ensure that the noise is eliminated or reduced (Afolabi,

\section*{Possible Defects of Verbal Communication}
1. Poor Mannerism: The habit of making useless, unnecessary and meaningless statements without correcting oneself. Some people punctuate their speeches without such phrases as "you know" or "I mean" or such words as "em" eh-hen" etc. these unwanted introductions render our speech sour in the cars.
2. Stammering: this is a natural speech defect where a speaker repeats one or two syllables in a speech uncontrollably for some time before he could later proceed in his speech.
3. Abnormally slow/fast speech: sometimes, a speaker speaks so fast that he virtually swallows a substantial portion of his speech. On the other hand, some other people pick their words with such wide intervals that make listeners feel that are short of words and are only trying to search
for the appropriate vocabulary to sue in-between speeches.
4. Wrong Pronunciation: some speakers fail to pronounce the consonant and vowel
sounds correctly thereby misleading their listeners into reading unintended meanings to this speech. Some people wrongly pronounce the sound /p/ as /f/ /, sh as /s/ , /v/ as /f/ etc. Imaging the kind of misleading codes a speaker may be sending when he pronounces /sit/ when he means /cheat/, /ferry/ when he means /very/, /sop/ when he means /shop/ etc.
5. Inadequate Audibility: It is natural for some people to speak to themselves and thereby compel the listeners to strain their ears before they could be heard. Other people address a small group of listeners as if they are addressing a large crowd or talking to somebody very far away. Such yellers irritate the ears of their listeners.

Task:
Describe any 2 common speech defects among teachers and How can the teacher overcome the speech defects.
b)Non-Verbal Communication Skill

Non-verbal communication skill can be either natural or accidental or it may be planned.
However, either of the two (planned or accidental) can be expressed through different ways as follows.

\section*{1. The Language of the Face}

The face is a powerful medium of communication. Through facial expression by the encoder or sender, a lot of interpretations can be deduced. For instance, a facial expression with winsome
smile, connotes satisfaction and happiness, while, a stern look means unsatifaction and disappointment to the speaker or sender (teacher) from the receivers (learners).

However, learners should be trained on how they can interpret facial expressions of their teachers particularly during the instructional process.

There are two types of facial expression:readily visible or fleeting and involuntary or voluntary.
(i) Readily Visible or Fleeting: They are facial expression that are intentionally generated such as wrinkling of the forehead, upward movement of the eyebrows, jutting the chin, putting in a smile during the instructional process.

All these kinds of facial expression have different connotations. For instance, an ephemeral winsome smile may express satisfaction or happiness or pleasure, while a poker faced
expression may indicate dissatisfaction or displeasure.
(ii) Deliberate or Spontaneous Facial Expression: Voluntary facial expressions take place usually under emotional circumstances, such as angry, happiness, fearfulness among others.

Whereas, involuntary facial expressions come in-form of fleeting facial expression such as, anger.

Meanwhile, voluntary facial expressions can be expressed to indicate likeness, hatred, love, fear, confidence, surprise, support, approval, disapproval and so on.

\section*{2. Body Language}

Through the body movement, many expressions can be communicated to the people. In fact, body language is communicated through gesticulations.

Gestures through arms, hand, head, fingers and legs can provide learners with a lot of messages. Though in the classroom situation, teacher should be very careful not to over-utilise gestures so as not to become a jester or clown at the presence of the learners.

\section*{3. The Space and Motion Language}

The space in the learning environment for the teacher's and learners' movement connotes a lot of messages.

For instance, if the seating arrangement is properly done, that is, learners are well arranged with tall ones at the back and short ones at the front of the class with roomy spaces for their movement, it indicates enabling and conducive environment for the learning to take place.

Moreover, teacher's movement among the learners, touching, cuddling and patting them means a lot to them such as feeling of love, empathy, passion and in fact, they will feel happy and joyful, for their learning.

\section*{4. The Language of Time}

The teacher and the learners must be time conscious, because a precious time lost can never be regained.

Therefore, teacher should make sure he/she allocates time to his/her lesson.
That is, a lesson or topic that should be treated for forty minutes should not be treated just for twenty minutes.

To the learners, it may connote unpreparedness or unseriousness in the teacher. The teacher must get to the classroom in time.

If the lesson is to start at 10a.m. he/she must be there on or before the time and not 10:30 a.m.

The students also must be in the classroom before the time.
This indicates the level of seriousness of the teachers and even the students.

\section*{5. Dressing Pattern}
- The mode of dressing usually suggests a lot of things about you.
- In the bible, the daughters of Jethro reported to their father that "an Egyptian helped us ....." simply because Moses dressed in an Egyptian attire whereas he was an Israelite.
- pattern can be used to identify certain professions such as Police, Nurse, Soldier, Navy, Air force and so on.
- It can be used too to identify religious group such as pastor with a collar, a muslim with a turban and so on.
- A teacher should dress smarty, neatly and simply to show his sense of duty. Students" too should dress according to the specification of the school.
- Wrong dressing pattern could suggest that one is advertising for a suitor.
- Bad dressing can lead to sexual harassment. Bad dressing can also lead to mistake of identity. If a decent, obedient and serious minded student dresses like cultists and roughians, he could be mistaken to be a cultist.
- Our dressing pattern speaks volumes about our life though it does it silently.

\section*{6. Personality Display}

A teacher who walks with one shoulder raised up and his hands in the pocket, cold be wrongly considered to be proud.

A smile on the face towards another could suggest immoral attraction or genuine interest in that person.

Teachers should watch out for the personality display that could say wrong things about them because this may dictate how the teacher will relate with such students.

Displays that could suggest pride, laziness, anger, uncooperative attitude selfishness, immorality and other vices should be avoided as much as possible

\section*{Task:}

At the inception of a lesson, describe vividly the teaching skill to be employed by apedagogically trained teacher.
ii) Questioning skill(probing)

Probing questions are those which help the pupils to think in depth about the various aspects of the problem.

By asking such questions again, the teacher makes the pupils more thoughtful.
Enable the pupils to understand the subject deeply.
The skill of Probing Questioning involves going deep into a pupil's response by asking a series of subsequent questions. It helps the pupils to give a correct and complete answer.

This skill requires the teacher to put a series of questions about the answer given to the first question.

The skill of Probing Questioning involves going deep into a pupil's response by asking a series of subsequent questions.

It helps the pupils to give a correct and complete answer. This skill requires the teacher to put a series of questions about the answer given to the first question.

Probing is going deep into the pupils' responses by asking a number of questions about what they already know and to lead them to the correct response or to remove any ambiguity or misconception, which has led to such responses. Probing is to be done if there is no response or incorrect response or partially right response.

Components of the Probing Questioning:
The components of the skill of probing questioning are -
- Prompting
- Redirecting
- Refocusing
- Seeking further information
- Questions aimed at critical awareness \& evaluation

\section*{1)Prompting:}

Prompting involves the teacher giving clues or hints to the pupil and ask leading questions.
Here, the teacher neither supplies answers to the pupil nor does he/she redirect the answer to some other pupils, but helps the pupil to answer the question himself.

This technique allows the teacher to probe by prompting the pupil, even though at first instance
it appears that the pupil cannot answer the question.
Prompting can be used by a teacher when the pupil gives
(a) 'I do not know' or 'I am not sure' response,
(b) very weak or wrong response. Sometimes, it can also be used when the response is partially correct or incorrect.

While using this technique, a teacher keeps the following two things in mind.
Firstly, the teacher does not discourage the pupil for his/her no or wrong response.
Secondly, the teacher helps the pupil to arrive at the criterion response by means of a systematic and step-by-step questioning process.

Sample questions for prompting:
Teacher: Who looks after the local administration of a city? Prakash?
Prakash: (No response)
Teacher: Alright, who makes provisions for clean water, street lighting, and construction and respires of roads in our city? (The teacher gives hints which helps Prakash to respond.)

Prakash: Municipality
Teacher: Very good. What are the functions of the municipality?
Prakash: Opening of schools.
Teacher: (Teacher deals with an incomplete response) tell some other functions.
Prakash: Looking after the health of people?
Teacher: Any more functions?
Prakash: Beautifying the city.

\section*{2)Redirecting:}

Redirecting techniques involve putting or directing the same question to several pupils for a response.

This can be used for the purposes of probing and for increasing pupil participation.
Even after using the prompting technique when there is a 'no response' or 'wrong response' or
'incomplete response' teacher may redirect the same question to other pupils.
Model Questions for Redirecting:
Teacher: Any more functions? Prakash
Prakash: (No response.)
Teacher: Sunita (redirection)
Sunita: Beautifying the city.
Teacher: Yes, any other? Reena?
Reena: Reply....
3)Refocusing:

This technique is generally used when the pupil gives a correct response.
The teacher relates the present answer with the topic already covered in the class.
When a pupil gives a correct response or gives a high-quality response, the teacher refocuses his/her or class attention to related issues.

This technique consists of enabling the pupil to view his/her response in relation to othersimilar situations.

This technique requires the pupil to relate a completely acceptable answer to other topics already studied by them. Here, the teacher wants that the pupil should consider the implications of a given response.

In this instance, the teacher asks the pupils to complete his/her response by asking questions like,-

In what way this different from....?
How does it relate to......?
In what way is it similar to.....?
Sample questions for Refocusing:
Teacher: What is the central idea of the poem, 'Patriotism'?
Pupil: Reply
Teacher: In what way it is different from the poem, 'Where the mind is without Fear' by Rabindranath Tagore?

\section*{4)Seeking Further Information:}

This technique is used when the initial response of a pupil is either incomplete or partially correct, then the teacher helps the pupil to clarify, elaborate, or explain his/her initial response. Here, the teacher elites more information and meaning or seek further clarification from the pupil by asking questions.

Seeking further information consists of asking the pupil to apply the additional information to bring the initial response to the criterion level or the expected level.

The teacher may ask for more information when he/she suspects that the pupil has guessed and does not know the answer.

The teacher can ask the pupil to give a rationale for his/her answer by asking to give reasons for his/her answer or asking him/her even to relate the answer in different words.

If the pupil is answering by guessing, he/she will not be able to respond to the teacher's subsequent questions about the response.

This technique helps to remove any faulty assumptions underlying the pupil's answer.

In this instance the teacher asks the pupils to complete his/her response by asking questions like,-

What do you mean by the term 'Education' used by you in this statement?
Can you put it, in other words, to make it clearer what you mean?
Can you clarify your answer?
What else you add to your response?
Is there any other answer?
Please state bit any other words.
How can you make your answer clearer?
Sample Questions For Seeking Further Information Component:
Teacher: How can we say that the food habits of people are largely controlled by the climate where they live?

Pupil: Man accepts those items for his diet which are easily available or found in abundance.
Teacher: Can you make your answer clearer by giving an example?

Pupil: Yes, for example, the Eskimos consume fish and meat because they are easily available for them.
5)Questions Aimed at Critical Awareness \& Evaluation:

This technique of probing questioning skill mainly involves asking 'how' and 'why' of a completely correct or expected response. The purpose is to seek increased critical awareness in the pupil.

The teacher asks the pupil to justify his response rationally.
Therefore, this technique elicits a rationale for his/her initial response.
Some examples of the questions for increasing pupil's critical awareness are as follows, How do you say so?

What are you assuming here?
How would someone who takes the opposite viewpoint respond to this? etc.
Example Questions For Critical Awareness and Evaluation:
Teacher: How is municipality different from gram panchayat?
Pupil: Municipality is the administrative body that looks after smaller towns, whereas ward administration looks after wards.

Teacher: Very good. Do you think that there is any special reason why the municipality is different from ward administration?

NOTE:
- Questions should be directed towards the whole class not at individual learner.
- The teacher should point and call the learner's name who he wishes to give the opportunity to answer the question.
- The teacher should not ridicue learners based on their poor responses
- The teacher should ask a question and pause to give learners time to brainstorm the answers
- When asking questions consider give all learners equal opportunities and more so been gender sensitive
5)STIMULUS VARIATION SKILL

Stimulus simply means something which can increase or cause reaction in human beings.
Therefore, teacher needs to stimulate the learners by adopting eclectic and multimedia approaches to the instructional process.

That is, they should combine two or more teaching methods and two or more instructional media in their teaching.

Thus by doing these, various stimuli will be introduced to the learners hence, their focusing attention and interest will be maintained and sustained throughout the lesson.

Techniques of stimulus variation.
There are six simple behavioural patterns that can be utilised in the variation of stimuli to the learners.
(1) The Use of Gestures:

These are the actions which the teacher put up in the course of his/her
lesson presentation to arouse the learners" attention and even maintain and sustain their interest.

Moreover, gestures utilisation involves all the body movement such as the head, hands, legs and the whole body system in explaining his/her points vividly to the learners.

Such actions are used to arrest, maintain and sustain learners" attention and interest throughout the lesson. Meanwhile, the following actions can be adopted to address and arrest learners" inattentiveness; Movement of the eyes: sideways, front and backways. A knock at the chalk or tempo board or table or desk, Tilting of the head upright, downward and sideways, Changing of facial expression, such as serious look, deep thought look, stern look and winsome smile when the learners" attention has been arrested and focused.
(2) Focusing Attention:

This can be employed in two ways : verbal statements and gestures cum verbal statements:
a. Verbal Statements:

These are the statements made by the teacher on certain essential and important points during the lesson. There are different ways this can be done viz:
(i)"Pay special attention to this point"
(ii) "This point is important, students"
(iii) "Put these points at your finger tips"
(iv) "Let these statements be registered deeply in your memory"
(v) "Take special note of this point"
(vi) "Add this word to your vocabulary"
b. Gestures cum Verbal Statements:

As afore mentioned, gestures can be used independently as stimulus variation strategy. However, when verbal focusing statement is employed togetherwith gestures, the effects produced are more positive and effective than using it alone.

The following are some of the verbal focusing statements which can simultaneously go along with gestures.

Make sure you put these into practice so as to assist you tremendously in your pedagogical tasks and practices.
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline Gestures & Verbal focusing statement \\
\hline Teacher claps and raises up his/her head & Mark you, this point should be noted \\
\hline Teacher puts on a stern look and shakes his head & I am not satisfied with this performance \\
\hline Teacher puts his left hand on the chalkboard and points the right one to a student & React, good you are right \\
\hline Teacher taps statement on chalkboard & Remember this statement \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
(3) Varying Interaction Styles:

In the teaching/learning environment, teacher needs to interact with his/her learners. In fact, the more cordial and congenial the interaction is, the more conducive and comfortable the learning environment is to the learners.

Therefore, the following four basic interaction styles can be adopted by the teacher during the instructional process.
a. Teacher-Students (Class):

This is a situation whereby the teacher is addressing a group of students or students in their class, particularly during the teaching/learning process.

This is the most common interaction style in most of our learning environment.
This type of interaction is always "teacher-centred" and therefore, little or no consideration is given to the learners during the instructional process.

This is typical of lecture method of teaching. This style should be seldomly used in primary and secondary institutions though in tertiary institutions it should be frequently used, because of their high level of maturity and cognition, and in fact, teeming populations.
b. Teacher-Student:

This interaction occurs when the teacher is focusing attention on a particular student or the students individually. That is, teacher's teaching is more "studentcentred".

Individual student is being treated based on his/her differences.
This interaction encourages individualism in learning.
That is, the learner is able to learning at his/her own rate and pace. In fact, the style also allows the teacher to show empathy to the learners since there is a good rapport with individual learner.

\section*{c. Student-Student:}

This interaction happens when a student is responding to an issue raised by the teacher, though the response is not encouraging, then, another student is called to modify theresponse given by the former student.

This may continue among other students, until all the students are involved in the discussion one by one.

The interaction encourages students' participation and also attention focusing is maintained and sustained.

\section*{d. Student-Students (class):}

This situation occurs when the teacher puts a particular student in a position of leadership roles expected of the teacher to handle in the instructional process.

However, the following points should be considered before the adoption of this style of interaction.

Teacher"s responsibilities should be placed on a matured student who has the charisma and leadership acumen to control the whole class.

The student to be assigned the role should be properly prepared before the lesson or discussion. Monitoring of the assigned student should be done by the teacher during the lesson or discussion. In fact, the students should not be left alone in the class to completely take over the teacher"s roles.

The teacher should guide against giving assigned role of the teacher to a particular student perpetually so as to give room for favoritism or hatred.

By and large, in the classroom situation, interaction styles should be varied so as to encourage conducive and comfortable learning environment, thus, effective learning will take place.

More so, two or more of these interaction styles should be employed during the instructional process so as not to be monotonous in your interaction. This will also encourage good rapport between the teacher and the students and even among the students.

\section*{(4) Pausing :}

This is a stimulus that can be strategised in the classroom to arrest attention of the learners.
During the instructional process, a teacher can just stop his/her communication suddenly to refocus or arrest students" attention.

However, in order to adopt this strategy properly; the following points should be carefully studied and can be put into practice;
- Let the lesson content be broken into smaller units.
- The delivery system should also be broken into small units.
- Time consciousness should be observed. Do not be too fast in your delivery or too slow.
- Be moderate in delivery.
- During the delivery, watch the reaction of the learners on their faces.
- Avoid dominating the instructional process.
- Take the "pause time" to quickly eye-search round the class so as to watch or observe what the people are doing for attention focusing.

\section*{(5) Shifting Sensory Channels:}

During the teaching/learning process, it is advisable to make use all the five sensory organs or modalities namely, visual, auditory, olfactory, tactile and gustatory

As much as possible, shifting from one sensory modality or combination of two or more should be adopted during the instructional process.

Take note of the following points in order to develop shifting sensory channels properly.
-Make sure different instructional media are produced by you for a particular lesson (visual, audio and audio-visual).
-Adopt multimedia approach to your instructional process. That is a combination of two or more media (regalia, models, audio etc.).
-Syncronise visual with audio while producing your instructional media and make sure they are appropriate and suitable for the topic to be taught.
(6) Teacher's Movement:

Teachers should make sure he/she moves to the different directions in the classroom during the lesson so as to watch what the learners are doing thus making them to focus their attention to the teacher.

In fact, teacher"s movement round the classroom will curb unwanted and distracting learners" behaviours or activities such as catnapping, dozing, side talks etc.

However, the following possible movements can be employed by the teacher during the instructional process.
-Move round the class among the learners.
-Move to the left and right of the classroom among the learners.
-Move to the back and front of the classroom among the learners.

\section*{Task:}

Describe vividly stimulus variation skill and its application to the pedagogical practices

\section*{6)SKILL OF CHALKBOARD WRITING}

Components of the skill of chalkboard writing are:
i. Legibility
ii. Size and alignment
iii. Highlighting main points
iv. Utilization of the space
v. Blackboard summary
vi. Correctness
vii. Position of the teacher and
viii. Contact with the pupils.

\section*{Legibility:}

The handwriting of the teacher on the blackboard should be legible so that it can draw the attention of the learners and encourages them to improve their own handwriting.

Illegible handwriting irritates the learner and results in maximum mistakes.
There should be a clear distinction between every letter as well as adequate space should be maintained between individual letters and words.

Descenders and ascenders should be correctly presented on the board.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_19_46598a250aabfc9c621cg-101.jpg?height=958&width=1029&top_left_y=784&top_left_x=239)

\section*{Size and Alignment :}

While writing on the blackboard the teacher should be conscious enough of the fact that the size of the letters written on the blackboard should be uniform and large enough to be read by the students in the last row.

The size of the capital letters should be larger than that of the small letters and the handwriting should be as nearly vertical as possible without being diverged from a line.

\section*{Highlight the main points:}

The main points or words are written on the blackboard should be highlighted by underlying them.

Colored chalk should be used suitably for the purpose of drawing the learners' attention to those main points that need to be highlighted too.

However, too much use of colored chalk should be avoided.
Utilizing the Space:
Utilization of the space matters a lot for efficient use of the blackboard.
For the proper utilization of the space on the blackboard, impotent words or statements should be written on it.

Overwriting the letters should be avoided as it makes the blackboard word untidy. Look at the picture below;
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_19_46598a250aabfc9c621cg-102.jpg?height=793&width=1503&top_left_y=937&top_left_x=243)

It should be taken care of that only essential materials should be retained on the blackboard and unnecessary words should be rubbed off.

\section*{Blackboard summary:}

The teacher should take much care and attention to develop a blackboard summary at the end of the lesson.

It makes teaching meaningful and interesting.
The blackboard summary should be so brief that the learners can recollect the whole lesson at a glance.

It should include only the salient important points of the lesson.

\section*{Correctness:}

The teacher should be careful about correct spelling, punctuation, grammar, etc. while constructing sentences on the blackboard.

While writing on the blackboard, inadequate English grammar or mistakes are done by the teacher to reduce the attentiveness of the learner in the classroom.

\section*{Position Of the Teacher:}

Position of the teacher at the time of writing on the blackboard matters a lot for efficient use of the skill of blackboard writing during a lesson.

The teacher at the time of blackboard writing should stand on one side of the blackboard in order to make writings on the blackboard visible to the learners.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_19_46598a250aabfc9c621cg-103.jpg?height=719&width=1351&top_left_y=985&top_left_x=262)

His position should never be in between the blackboard and the learner like in the picture below;
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_19_46598a250aabfc9c621cg-104.jpg?height=809&width=1332&top_left_y=422&top_left_x=242)

Contact with the pupils:
The teacher, at the time of I'll station, writing on the blackboard, or explanation should maintain eye contact with his learner.

This necessary for controlling interactions, maintaining discipline, sustaining the attention of the learners, etc.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_19_46598a250aabfc9c621cg-104.jpg?height=560&width=1250&top_left_y=1731&top_left_x=248)

\section*{7)CLASS MANAGEMENT SKILL}

To ensure class discipline and control the teacher can employ the following strategies;
- Call students by name,
- Make norms of classroom behavior(rules and regulations)

Attending behavior reinforced,
- Clarity of directions or instructions
- Check non-attending behavior
- Keep Eye conduct.
- Check inappropriate behavior immediately
- Response management.
- Effective classroom seating arrangements for easy movements and facilitation of class learning Activities.

7) SKILL OF USE OF MEDIA
- The resources used in a lesson need to be used with respect to their purpose.
- Materials for reference like wall charts should be hanged on the wall where the teacher and learner can see.
- Hanged materials should be at learner's level
- When demonstrating an experiment the materials should be placed on a table in front of the class at a level where all learner's can see
- A sketch chart should be displayed on the right side of the blackboard and the teacher should use a pointer during explanations.
- When materials are not adequate for the whole class the teacher should group learners and give them materials share.
- After teaching a sketch chart or any improvised materials should be placed on the learning corners in the classroom.
- Electronic materials after use should be kept in a lockable cupboard or laboratory for
$\square$ Pat
safety
- When explaining a concept refer to a Realia or model within the class for easy understanding.

\section*{8)SKILL OF CLOSURE}

In closure, you pull together th main points and concepts, which are organized and integrated within the frame work of the learners' understanding

A well ended lesson enhances students' learning and retention. It is therefore very pertinent that you recapitulate and evaluate your lesson, which should be dependent on the specific objective and expected outcome, resulting from the learning exposure.

Lesson closure involves;
Questions and statements by the teacher related to the consolidation of the major points covered during the lesson

Opportunities provided by the teacher to the pupils for linking the present knowledge with the past knowledge.

Opportunities provided by the teacher to the pupils for applying the knowledge gained during the lesson to the new situations.

There are three types of closure that can be used by the teacher in their instructional delivery process;
1) Instructional closure;

In this type of closure, you should indicate the link between the previous knowledge and the new knowledge.

This you can do through summarizing the major points covered in the lesson. In this process, you should arrange the points in logical order and should be teacher centered closure.
2) Cognitive closure;

Unlike the instructional closure, the cognitive closure is attained when your learners make a link between what they have learned and the previous knowledge.

This could be achieved when you lead the learners to summarize the by themselves the major points of the lesson in a logical order.

\section*{3)Social closure;}

This is another form of teacher centered approach in ending the lesson. In this type of closure, you use reward, praise and encouragement on the learners.

This means that you give the learners a word of encouragement and praise when they accomplish a task.

This social closure builds motivation on the learners and gives them a sense of fulfillment.

\section*{Techniques/methods to be used for closure;}
- The teacher can end the lesson by giving the students chalk board summary or key concepts, selected points for them to form their notes
- They could also be given full notes to be copied. (However, giving of full notes to be copied by the students stiffens the bright students' initiatives and breed rote learning, which promotes examination malpractices).
- The student could be called upon to give oral recapitulation of the days' lesson to test their understanding and retention of what was taught.
- They could be invited to demonstrate any new skill taught or dramatize the content if appropriate.
- Games and simulation could be used for lesson closure.
- The students could simulate various roles depicted in the lesson they have been taught.
- For learner friendly approaches ie(field/study trip, independent/individualized learning techniques, etc) the teacher could close the lesson by;
- Inviting the leaders of each discussion groups to summarize their points. This means that a class debate could ensue from such discussion session.
- Individual students could be called to introduce and defend their projects.
- The lesson could be ended by arranging what was learnt in class around a central idea or figure and displayed.
- The students could be assisted to mount a display of artifacts and specimens collected from their field study trips.
- They could write reports of the study trips they made.
- They could be guided on how to produce the lesson on various instructional materials like posters, bulletin boards and charts.

The importance of closure in the instructional process
- To consolidate what the learners have learnt.
- To establish a sense of achievement and mastery in the learners, especially, in the application of social and cognitive closure.
- To draw attention to the end of a learning process which may provide a quality control mechanism for effective instructional delivery.
- To focus attention on what has been learnt, this enhances achievement and retention of learned concepts.

\section*{Task:}

\section*{Review Questions}
1. What is lesson closure?
2. Give a summary of the first lesson you taught during your teaching practice.
3. List the most challenging periods of the lesson taught for the day.
4. Describe how you would close a particular lesson in your subject areas

\section*{IMPORTANCE OF RECORDS OF WORK}
$\square$ Good recordkeeping can help to find the information that the teacher may need.
$\square$ lt promotes the creation of full and accurate records
$\square$ lt also involves storing and managing records appropriately so that the information will be available when needed.

Olt helps the authorities to know what is being taught in school, and shows how and when work is done.
$\square$ Ensures: accountability and transparency of work covered by the teacher.

\section*{IMPORTANCE OF RECORDS OF WORK}
$\square$ Provides continuity of teaching of a particular class. that a new teacher traces where to start teaching a class.
alt allows both teacher and the student to reassess the teaching-learning relationship.
$\square$ Helps to identify the learner who needs more help, guidance and support and helps them understand what they need to do next to improve their work.
$\square$ Effectively monitor the progress of the teacher and the learners, for planning and decision making

\section*{Learner's progress record}
$\square$ Record the learner progress over time
$\square$ An analysis of this will show what progress the learner is making
$\square$ Takes different formats depending on the type of assessment

\section*{Learner's progress record Cont,d}
$\square$ A Learner progress record is made up of a learner's academic achievements, skills and abilities and school reports.
$\square$ Any other relevant information could also be included.
$\square$ The progress record documents the learner's academic performance on a weekly, monthly or termly basis. It helps to monitor learners' progress and performance.
$\square$ In addition to providing teachers with a tool to record learner assessment data or observations, the Learner Progress
$\square$ Record may be used to form groups for differentiated small group instruction, and other Instructional Plans.

\section*{Learner's progress record Cont,d}
$\square$ Accurate, factual, up to date Record keeping is a very important part of a teacher's role.
$\square$ Progress records allow both the teacher and the learner to reassess the teaching-learning relationship
$\square$ Helps them to understand what they need to do to improve
$\square$ Enables the teacher to base the lesson plans on a detailed knowledge and understanding of each learner.
$\square$ Records of school report cards and/or end of term results should be kept by schools should parents wish to review or discuss past student performance.

Key Ratings: Exceeds expectation (4); Meets expectation (3); Approaches expectations (2); Below expectations (1)

\section*{Importance of progress records}
$\square$ Plan appropriate learning experiences that will meet their learner's needs;
$\square$ ldentify learners who are progressing slowly, so that action may be taken to support them;
$\square$ Provides the school leadership team with information about the progress learners are making across the school
$\square$ Provides information about whether learners are meeting age-related expectations and are 'on track' to meet expected outcomes used for accountability in schools and national assessment institutions
$\square$ A source of information for parental engagement with schools on how their children perform.
$\square$ Enables teachers to track the continuous learning progress of a learner;
$\square$ Provides information on accurate production of enriched certificates.

\section*{Qualities of effective Progress Record}

A good and effective Progress Record should:
$\square$. Be simple and easily understood by internal and external users
$\square$. Relate to key indicators about attainment and progress
$\square$. Use language that is sensitive to those whose attainment is currently below the age related expectation.

\section*{Learner's Progress Records}
$\square$ Many teachers would think of awarding a grade to a learner to show their progress in learning,
$\square$ However, it is important to first answer the following Question, What's in a grade?
$\square$ This is a question with a simple answer -nothing. It's meaningless.
$\square$ Grades don't tell a student anything.
$\square$ Here's a logical example:
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|l|}
\hline Sturedent & Test 1 & Twit 2 & Test 3 & Average \\
\hline ｜Pether & 繁 & 悆 & 灙 & 盘 \\
\hline Jannsom & 6 & \％ & 10 & 3 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
Both learners have an average grade of 8 ．
But what does it really say？If you just show your learner this grade，it means nothing．
$\square$ If you dig deeper and take a look at the process，you can see that one learner actually did better than the other．
James shows progress and improvement in the learning．
Peter has the same average grade as James，but he＇s stuck．
He doesn＇t get a complete grip on the learning material，and only masters some parts of it．
$\square$ This proves that a grade doesn＇t show the real value：the process of improvement or the learning progress

\section*{Important to note!}
$\square$ Competency based learning utilizes more of formative assessment as opposed to summative assessment.
$\square$ A teacher uses different ways to record information about learner performance in various concepts that they teach.
$\square$ They may use tools such as: Anecdotal Records, Profiling, Checklists, Rating Scales ,Journaling, Portfolio:
$\square$ Progress records are then developed using information from these tools, and such a record would show progress with standards in a detailed manner and ensure that grading is fair and consistent for all

STRAND 6: TEACHING METHODS
Facilitator's Notes
Introduction to teaching
Teaching -it is the social process which is aimed at influencing changing the behaviour of another person positively.

Teaching methods-These are the techniques employed by a teacher to facilitate the instructional process.

Forms / dimensions of Teaching
1. Formal: is systematic deliberate direct and consciously imparted by a specialist.
2. Informal: Is the teaching one gets outside the classroom. Here success occurs when opportunity and preparation meet.

Principles of teaching
1. Active involvement of the learner
2. Motivation to enhance learning
3. Concreteness to enhance understanding of concepts and ideas
4. Focusing attention on individual learner's needs
5. Cooperation in the teaching learning process in the classroom
6. Acquiring relevant knowledge about the learners and using it to inform on cause design and classroom teaching
7. Aligning the 3 major components of instruction i.e. the learning objectives, assessments and instructional activities
8. Articulating explicit explanations regarding leaning objectives and policies
9. Prioritizing the knowledge and skills one chooses to focus on
10. Progressively refining the course/subject based on reflection and feeding

Qualities of an Effective Teacher
-Has good knowledge of the subject matter
-Has patience with students of different categories e.g. backgrounds discipline, maturity
-Intellectually curios i.e. naturally driven by the interest in keeping abreast of changes in his/her field
-Confident in his/her abilities
-Achievement oriented i.e has clear thoughts on the objectives to be achieved and what has to be done to realize them.
- Plans and sticks to the plans. This goes deeper than just rigidly following a course syllabus
- Awareness of what happens in the dawn and in adjacent hallways e.g. being able to stop nonsense before it starts and keeps students on track
-Mentorship i.e. teachers often serve as mentors to their learners. The desire to influence learners positively is a core motivation of many teachers.
-Maturity i.e. insightful teachers are able to sense emotional changes in learners and respond to them appropriately
-Community Involvement i.e. through contact with parents, administrators, and community leaders
-Organization i.e. able to manage learners' multiple personalities and organize his/her subject matter for maximum benefit of the learners
-Visionary i.e. should be their learners illuminators to provide them not only with interesting and useful materiel, useful materials, but also with visions of where they might end up if they learn well

Approaches to Teaching
1. Teacher Centered Approach e.g. Lecture, Demonstration, Story telling, Educational Broadcast and Practical.
2. Learner centered Approach e.g. Discussion, Field Trip, Question \& Answer, Role play, Problemsolving.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_19_46598a250aabfc9c621cg-140.jpg?height=823&width=806&top_left_y=624&top_left_x=443)

\section*{Choice of Teaching Methodology}

The choice of given teaching methodology is guided by:
1. Set instructional objective
2. Size of the Class
3. Level of the learners
4. Available teaching \& learning resources
5. Nature of subject content
6. Time available
7. Ability of the learner
8. Readiness and maturity of the leaner

NOTE: The teaching methodology adopted should be able to:
- Arouse develop and sustain leaners interest
- Develop a positive attitude in the leaner towards the subject
-Enhance creativity and active leaner participation
- Stimulate learner's curiosity for further learning
-Promote comprehension and retention of content

\section*{COMMON METHODS OF TEACHING}

\section*{1.Lecture Method/chalk and talk method}

This involves a teacher delivering verbally the lesson's content to the learners. It involves explaining, developing and evaluating idea and concepts and then summarizing the main points. It is largely teacher-centred
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_19_46598a250aabfc9c621cg-141.jpg?height=538&width=822&top_left_y=1238&top_left_x=245)

It is appropriate when used to:
-Introduce a topic
- Focus attention
-Give instructions
-Help learners to synthesize important information
-Summarize a discussion lesson
- Explain activity
- Develop listening skills in the learner

Effective use of the Lecture Method
-Have an introduction that captures the learner's attention and interest
-Take into account the instructional objectives to be achieved
-Use the appropriate language
-Avoid lecturing directly from text books
-Use appropriate voice projection, modulation and pace
-Ensure adequate grasp of the lesson content

Advantages/Merits of Lecture method
1. Efficient, cheap way of conveying a topic to a large audience/group
2. Factual material is conveyed in a direct logical manner
3. Large amount of content is covered in a short time.

Disadvantages/Limitation of Lecture method
1. One-way communication with no active learner participation (passive)
2. Difficult to maintain leaners' interest
3. Does not appear to be effective in changing the teacher's performance
4. Requires proficient oral skills
5. Learning is difficult to gauge
6. Not appropriate for very young children e.g those in primary school
7. Its effectiveness is highly related to time and scope of content

\section*{2. Discussion Method}

This is a verbal interaction among learner with the teacher as the facilitator.
It involves exchange and sharing of ideas, experiences, facts and opinion on given topics. Discussions may be:
-Whole class or Small group
-Formal or informal
Discussion method is suitable for:
-Clarifying concepts and ideas
-Building consensus
-Gathering opinion and ideas from other
-Clarifying attitudes and values
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_19_46598a250aabfc9c621cg-143.jpg?height=527&width=825&top_left_y=1181&top_left_x=243)

Principles of Effective Discussion
An effective discussion requires sufficient preparation by both the teacher and the learner Before the Discussion

The Teacher should:
- Identify the topic of discussion
-Form the desired Groups
-Provide adequate information on the topic and assign specific tasks

During the discussion
The Teacher should:
-Guide the discussion by asking leading questions
-Direct the discussion, clarify any Misconceptions and verify facts
-Encourage active learner participation
-Maintain order among the leaners
-Take a facilitative role in the discussion

The Learner Should:
-Observe the rules of the discussion
- Keep to the topic of discussion
- Participate in the discussion without monopolizing it
-Support or object arguments and opinions with facts
-Listen actively and reflectively
-Take notes from the discussion

After the Discussion
- The group leaders should report findings to the whole class
-The teacher and learner to correct misconceptions
-The teacher to summarize the views from the learners to arrive at a logical conclusion

\section*{Advantages/Merits of Discussion}
1. Emphasis is on learning/leaner activity thus more effective than lecture
2. All learners participate hence a sure way of learning
3. Leads to development of democratic way of thinking i.e. everybody cooperates in the discussion and the ideas \& opinions of other:
4. Trains leaners in reflective thinking hence leads to deeper understanding of the problem under discussion
5. Trains learners in self-expression
6. Inculcate spirit of tolerance in the learners. i.e. they learn to discuss and differ and tolerate the views of others even if they are unpleasant or contradictory to each other
7. Discussion makes learning interesting

Disadvantages/Limitations of Discussion
1. All types of topics cannot be taught by discussion method
2. The method cannot be used for teaching small children
3. Some learners may not take part while other may try to dominate
4. Some learners may not follow the discussion rules
5. The teacher may not be able to guide and provide true leadership in the discussion

\section*{3. Question \& Answer Method (Questioning Technique or Socratic Method)}

The teacher asks questions to elicit answers from the learners on a specific topic to determine what needs to be taught

It aims at determining the knowledge and perception of a learner on a given topic at the beginning during and at the end of a lesson
-It enables teachers to assess the leaning process
-It is used to reinforce other methods and techniques of teaching. and should therefore not be used in isolation
- It enables the learner to develop skills in questioning, answering questions, taking and making notes, synthesizing ideas from the teacher end thinking critically and creatively

Principles of Effective Questioning
1. Questions should be well prepared prior to the lesson
2. Ask clear and relevant question
3. Distribute the questions evenly among the learners
4. Ask the question first pause and name the respondent
5. Provide appropriate reinforcement to the respondent i.e. acknowledge the learners attempts to answer the questions, whether the response is correct or incorrect
6. Encourage learners to ask questions
7. Avoid asking leading questions e.g. "Nairobi is the capital city of Kenya. Isn't it?"
8. Focus on open-ended question where possible

Characteristics of Good Questions
-Clear precise, brief and direct
-Formulated to challenge and stimulate the learner's thoughts
-Suitable for the age, abilities and interests of the learners
-Within the learners' experiences and language they can understand

\section*{Points to Consider When Formulating Questions}
-Start questions with interrogative words e.g. "Who, Why,What, When and How. Avoid the interrogative words being at the end
-Avoid asking leading questions e.g. "Nairobi is the capital city of Kenya Isn't it?"
-Avoid double-bowled questions e.g. "How big is Webuye and how far is it from Bungoma?"
- Avoid questions that encourage guessing e.g. "Is mercury a solid or a fluid?"
- Avoid YES or NO questions

Points to Consider When Asking Questions
-Call the respondent's name
-Listen to the answer comment and give the learner a feedback
- Distribute the questions as widely as possible among the learners giving chance to all.
-Prepare key questions in advance
- Ask questions in a natural, friendly and conversational manner
- Allow learners to complete their answers without interruptions
-Encourage learners to ask questions and respond to them with logical reasons, tact and patience.

2. Discourages slow learners from participating in the lesson for fear of making mistakes
3. May cause some learners to lose self esteem and self-confidence
4. Some teachers may not be skillful at probing questions to get desired responses
5. Increases the possibility of poor class control due to chorus answers
6. Teachers with poor communication skills any out use it effectively

\section*{4. Project Method / assignment method}

A project is an activity carried out by an individual learner or group of learners in a more naturallike manner and in an environment that is freer than that of am everyday classroom

A project is usually under the guidance and supervision of a teacher who ensures that the project accomplishes a definite and attainable goal. Learners are given freedom to investigate and gather information for their project.

A project is based on objectives which require some time to be achieved. It requires skills, effort and careful planning. It permits learners to identify a problem, gather information, analyze it and draw conclusion. It supplements the normal classroom interactions and offers an Opportunity for individual learning and self-fulfillment

\section*{Qualities of a Good Project}
-Relevant and focused on instructional objectives or topic
-Challenging, interesting and appealing to learners
-Enhances application of knowledge and skills learned theoretically in class
-Provides an opportunity to demonstrate originality, creativity and critical thinking

\section*{Preparation of a Project}
-Organize learners into non-ability or mixed ability groups
-Assist learners to identify and define the project to be studied
-Organize and plan the study project in a manner that will enable learners to collect relevant information
-Encourage the use of a variety of research methods such as interview, questionnaires and library study
-Provide reference books and other materials for learners to work with where necessary
- Seek authority of resource person to be interviewed and book the necessary appointment
-Lay emphasis on the form of presentation of the information gathered or solution developed
-Check the progress of each group to provide guidance, particularly to non starters

\section*{Advantages/Merits of the Project Method}
1. Leaners develop skills on how to organize and any out individual or group work without the teacher's constant supervision
2. Promote cooperation and team spirit among learners
3. Provides a natural approach to learning as it relates the curriculum to real life situations
4. Gives the teacher an opportunity to show the learner the interrelationships between subjects
5. It captures the leaners' enthusiasm by stimulating their initiative end spirit of inquiry
6. Fosters good teacher-learner and learner-teacher relationships
7. Enhances the development of leadership politics in learner's
8. Encourages creativity and sustains motivation
9. Encourages freedom of expression
10. Applies the philosophy of 'Learning by Doing', thus making learning learner-centred
11. Give learners experience in planning and organizing and a sense of achievement.

Disadvantages of the Project Method
1. It is time-consuming as it takes long to complete and interfere with other lessons
2. Not all leaners in a group participate and contribute to the attainment of the project objectives
3. It is difficult to evaluate the learners' individual performance
4. It is not easy to maintain order and discipline among learners while they are carrying out their project
5. Requires material and other rem which may be costly to acquire
6. Scheduling a project can present problems if a teacher has only a few lessons per week e.g. 2 or 3
7. Fails to transmit knowledge to the learners in a systematic way. Instead it is gotten through sheer coincidence.

\section*{5. Demonstration Method}

This involves the teacher showing and explaining a concept or a skill (how something is done) in a given topic.

It may be used for the whole class or part of the class depending on size of the class, available resources and space.

It is a more effective way of teaching than mere describing.
The emphasis is on learning by observation followed by doing; hence drills and practice exercises are required. It enable the learners eventually be able to perform the activities on their own.

Demonstration may be used in various situations:
- To Show techniques-skills that are too difficult/complex for the learner to carry out.
-When resource: (materials a equipment) are inadequate, expensive or difficult to produce for
individual use e.g. skills on administering first aid, baking bread or wine knot
-To Introduce the use of various teaching and learning resources
-When time for content coverage is limited
-To Amuse interest for further learning
- When it is dangerous for the learners carry out the activity
- To Introduce a topic or lesson
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_19_46598a250aabfc9c621cg-151.jpg?height=779&width=825&top_left_y=776&top_left_x=243)

\section*{Guidelines for effective demonstration}

The teacher should ensure that:
-Determine and analyze the lesson objectives
- All the required learning resource available, in writing and within reach
-He/she tries out/rehearse the demonstration before the lesson to determine the amount of time required and ensure familiarity with all the aspects of the demonstration
- Arrange the learners appropriately to ensure a clear view
- An appropriate pace is adopted depending on the level and ability of the learner and complexity of the content
- Learners with special needs such as the visually, the hearing and the physically challenged are well catered for during the demonstration.
- Prepare charts or chalkboard summary which learners can refer to during and after the demonstration
-Subdivide the demonstration into logical steps or stages
- Keep the demonstration simple and easy to understand
-Check learners understanding by being sensitive to their reactions

\section*{Advantages of Demonstration}
1. Trains learners to be good observers
2. Enhances the formation of concepts and generalizations
3. Has a high interest value when it involves the use of equipment a materials which may be new to the learners
4. Economical in terms of time and money
5. Effective fro introducing skills and concepts in learning
6. Appropriate when learners need to learn how to use a piece of equipment

\section*{Disadvantage of demonstration}
1. Provides less opportunities for learners to discover concepts on their own
2. Reduces active participation of learners
3. Poses a problem of audibility and Visibility when large groups are involved
4. It's difficult to evaluate the learners' understanding during a demonstration

\section*{6.Case Study Method / imaginary visits/ story telling}

This is a true or imaginary/fictional excerpt that a teacher uses to describe a problem, a situation or character to a learner on a given lesson or topic.

A case study may present a Dilemma/puzzle that a learner is expected to resolve.
If the case study is based on a true story, then it should be disclosed in the course of the study or at some point in the lesson.

It should be relevant to the subject or topic being taught.

Guidelines for the teacher in developing a case study
-Focus on the instructional objectives
-Provoke the learners' ability to solve questions
-Appeal to the learners' emotions
-Help learners to identify and internalize the concepts raised
-Help learners to apply the skills learnt to solve similar problems they may encounter
Advantages/merits of case study
1. It develops the learners' skills, communication and critical drinking. It makes the subject relevant to real life situations
2. Allows for the exploration of solutions to complex issues
3. Encourages or simulates discussions
4. Creates an existing atmosphere in the class which motivates the lumen to participate actively
5. It facilitates development of analytical and problem solving skills.
6. Promotes higher mention of what has been learned

Disadvantages/limitations of case study
1. Learners may not see the relevance of the case study to their own situation
2. Insufficient information can lead to inappropriate results
3. It is not appropriate for young learners
4. Sometimes it is not easy to identify a suitable one study.
5. Time consuming especially during preparation and execution
6. Expensive as it demands a lot of sources in addition to other related costs
7. Learners may collect irrelevant information of various facts thus making valid generalization be rather limited.

\section*{7. Field Trip method/ educational trips/excursion}

Field trip involves taking students outside the classroom setting to have first hand experiences of what happens in our environment or real life situations.

The method enables the students to make useful observations and collect information, which cannot be obtained within the classroom.

Experiences acquired during field trip are usually long lasting and cannot easily be forgotten by the students.

Examples of areas where students can undertake field trip include erosion sites, industries, oil spillage sites, mountains or hills, rivers, hospitals etc. A study of these phenomena will be more meaningful when students visit the affected sites than when discussed under the classroom setting.

Suggestions for the Effective Use of Field Trip
1. The teacher should first discuss the idea of taking students on a field trip with the school authority for approval.
2. Subsequently, she should write to the authority of the area to be visited for permission to visit, time of the visit as well as the date of the visit. Finally request for any written rules guiding the place.
3. Before the trip the teacher should then discuss with the students concerning the trip, the aim of the visit, materials to take along ego pen, pencil, exercise book, ruler etc.
4. Furthermore, the teacher should inform the students about the rules guiding the place, possible dangers, things to look out for as well as method of reporting their observations.
5. The teacher should make sure that the field experience fits properly into the instructional sequence.
6. The teacher should carry first aid kit along in case of any accidents involving students
7. Ensure adequate arrangement for transportation in the case of trips involving long distances.
8. After the trip, examine the students on the specimens and information collected from the trip. This has to be in connection with the report of the trip in order to facilitate retention of the experiences from the trip.

\section*{Advantages of Field Trip}
1. Field trip provides the students with the opportunity of having first hand knowledge of certain phenomena that occur in our environment.
2. It helps to generate and sustain students' interest in the subject.
3. With field trip, motivation to work is usually very high.
4. It aids retention of information since the experiences are long lasting.
5. Field trip can help students to develop interest in certain professions e.g. engineering, medicine etc.
6. It helps to channel student's experiences towards one direction.
7.Field trip helps students to understand man's relationship with his environment Disadvantages of Field Trip
(1) If it is not well planned, it becomes a waste of time and resources.
(2) It is extremely tedious to carry out field trip especially when it involves long distance trip.
(3) In some situations, accident may occur in the course of a field trip.
(4) In most cases, field trip time encroaches into other lesson periods.

This would likely result in conflict between the teachers involved if it is not properly handled.
(5) Field trip results in extra financial expenditure on the part of the school and students.

\section*{8. Experimentation method}

Experimentation is a method of learning concepts through been involved in the process of investigation by doing practical activities.

Experimentation involves activity-oriented learning that helps learners to acquire important skills such as; observation, measuring, classifying objects or things, defining variable operationally, designing experiments, interpreting data, hypothesizing, predicting etc.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_19_46598a250aabfc9c621cg-156.jpg?height=508&width=830&top_left_y=245&top_left_x=241)

The process of experimentation takes place in three steps:
a)Phase One: Pre- experimentation Session
b)Phase Two: Experimentation Session
c)Phase Three -Post experimentation session
a)Phase One: Pre-experimentation Session

This involves:
- Assembling in advance all the equipment andmaterials for the exercise.
- Checking if the materials are in good working condition.
- The experiment is trial tested by carrying it out first to ensure that it's achievable-This reduces errors which the teacher may have committed in the actual laboratory session.
- Arranging The sitting arrangements of students
- Setting The time to spend in carrying out the investigation
b)Phase Two: Experimentation Session
- During this session, the teacher will first of all interact with the students by telling them what to do, the purpose of the experiment, the procedure to be followed in carrying out the investigation as well as safety measures to be taken to avoid incidence of accident.
- While the students are now working with their equipment and materials, the
- teacher's duty is to be an overseer.
- He works round the class to make sure that all the students are following the procedure carefully.
- The teacher clarifies any doubt or problem arising from the students and by so doing
gives them adequate encouragement and support in the learning process.
c)Phase Three: Post experimention session
- In this session, the teacher discusses the result of the investigation in order to clarify students who may be in doubt.
- He can assign marks to the work done by the students.
- The teacher can also summarize the process as well as the result of the investigation in the form of backboard summary.
- The students are allowed to clean up their tables and wash off equipment before leaving the laboratory.

\section*{Suggestions for the Effective Use of Experimentation}
1. Experiments should be based on students' background and availability of materials.
2. The teacher should ensure that the time frame for the experimentation will be such that students will be able to achieve results at the end of the time.
3. The language of instruction for any investigation should be very clear and within the child's chronological age.
4. The teacher should make sure that the equipment for students are in good working condition and enough materials are available for all the students.

\section*{Advantages of Experimentation}
1. Experimentation enables students to have direct sensory experience
2. Experimentation fosters opportunities for the acquisition of science process skills e.g. manipulation, measuring, classifying etc.
3. It helps in the retention of information as the students interact with the scientific process.
4.The uses of experiments help students to develop scientific attitude such as enquiry, curiosity, carefulness, objectivity, honesty etc.
5. Experimental works help to stimulate and sustain student's interest in learning
$\square$
6. It aids students in problem solving and arriving at conclusions.
7. It helps to increase student's ability towards critical thinking and acquisition of better understanding of knowledge

\section*{Disadvantages of Experimentation}
1. Experimentation in biology teaching is wasteful in terms ofresources to be used in carrying out the investigation unlike demonstration
2. It is also time consuming in carrying out a single experiment. What the teacher can say in five minutes may take one hour to investigate
3. It also exposes the teacher's ignorance on those areas he is not competent enough to handle.
4. In experimentation, lack of background knowledge about the activities may make students to dislike the subject.

\section*{9.Role Playing}

This is the process of assuming the nature, manner, behaviour, attitude, responsibility or authority of a post, persons or objects in a given situation.

Role playing is used in a variety of ways and for various purposes, it is used to resolve conflicts and settle problems as well as teach certain feelings of emotions which might be difficult for a teacher to express or demonstrate by himself.

\section*{10. Dramatization}

This method is used by children in schools to convert facts or skills to be learnt into drama in order to make the learning of such facts or skills more interesting and realistic.

Dramatization enables the teachers to learn about the various maturity levels of the pupils in terms of their emotional, physical, intellectual and social development.

\section*{Advantages}
(i)It affords pupils the opportunity to express themselves freely and happily
ii)It develops in them a sense of respect for the opinion of others
(iii) It develops in them the attitude of cooperation in a groups

\section*{Disadvantages}
- Requires alot of planning
- It's time consuming
- The costumes and relevant materials needed to enrich the play may be expensive to acquire.

\section*{11. Discovery Method}

Discovery method is a teaching strategy which enables students to find the answers themselves. It is a learner centred approach hence it is called a heuristic method.

It is of two types;
1. The guided discovery -teacher guides the students to discover for themselves solutions to given problems by providing them with general principles, but not the solution to the scientific problem.
2.The unguided discovery-involves the students discovering for themselves both the general principles and solution to a scientific problem. It is sometimes called the pure discovery.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_19_46598a250aabfc9c621cg-160.jpg?height=882&width=828&top_left_y=242&top_left_x=242)

\section*{Advantages of Discovery Method}
-Makes the student an active participant rather than a mere passive recipient.
- There is high retention of any information or knowledge so discovered will be increased.
-The training acquired in finding out things for oneself independently can be applied to new learning and problem solving.
-The joy in discovering something provides the students with intrinsic motivation
- Helps learning through real life situations
-Helps students develop manipulative skills and attitudes which constitute one of the fundamental objectives of science teaching.
-It encourages analytical and synthetic thought as well as intuitive thinking.

\section*{Disadvantages of Discovery Method}
-It is time consuming and progress is comparatively slow. Apparatus have to be set up and result(s) of the investigation awaited.
-The method leaves open the possibility of not discovering anything. Students may end up discovering things other than what was intended to be discovered. This could be highly demoralizing to them particularly if great effort has been expended.
-The method is expensive considering the equipment and materials needed.
- It is only good for a small class where effective teacher supervision is possible.

\section*{12. Inductive and the Deductive Methods(concept mapping)}

\section*{The Inductive Method}

The inductive method of teaching begins with particular examples and from the examination of the examples, definition are established. The teacher tries to draw out from the student the already acquired knowledge. This is done through questioning.

Also the teacher tries to relate the knowledge gained is one subject area to another through description of similaries.

\section*{Characteristics of the Inductive Method}
-It proceeds from the known to the unknown.
-It proceeds from the particular to the general.
-It proceeds from the concrete to the abstract.
-It is an analytic method or process.
-It is a method of discovery.

\section*{The Deductive Method}

In deductive method a statement or a rule or formula is given. From this rule or formula, the teacher begins to work back to a particular case. For example a formula in mathematics. That is the whole is given and the students are made to see the parts that build it up.

Characteristics of the Deductive Method
-It starts from the general rule and proceeds to the particular.
-It involves memorization e.g learning the apostles creed
-It is a method of instruction whereby the general rule is at first vague to the pupils, but it becomes clearer after the teacher has skillfully and fully expressed it.
-It proceeds from indefinite to definite.

\section*{Improvisation of Teaching/Learning}

This refers to making T/L resources from locally available materials to represent the real thing. It is the act of using local resources in the immediate environment to build, construct, mold or make instructional T/L materials that can assist in a smooth T/L process.

It can also be defined as the act of designing a replica of standard equipment to play the role it is designated for.

An act of using alternative resources to facilitate instructions for teaching wherever there is lack of specific first hand teaching aids.

\section*{Characteristics Of Improvised Resources}

Simple
Cheap
Safe for use by learners e. g. not made from materials that are toxic.
Suitable for the content under consideration
Conform as much as possible to the real equipment or resources in terms of weight, shape and size.

Functional
Merit social and scientific recognition, operation and function

\section*{Reasons for Improvisation}

Insufficiency of facilities and equipment.
High cost of facilities and equipment
Problems of storage, repair and replacement.
Helps to minimize loss of equipment and materials.

\section*{Importance}

It's a meaningful attempt towards finding suitable or alternative conventional science materials.

It will develop in students and teachers adequate skill thus generating interest and motivation for indigenous technology.

Learner participation in improvisation exposes them to creativity, innovation and curiosity.
Eliminates the menace of inadequate instructional material.
Is a link between theory and practice.
Science students will realize that science has to do with ordinary things and this may motivate
them to carry out experiments and learning activities by themselves using such improvised materials.

Factors to Consider when improvising
Availability of required materials
Skill of the teacher
Degree of accuracy and precision that is possible with the improvised equipment
Quality of the materials used they should not be toxic or inflict injury on the user
Should meet the specific teaching learning YCQUirsments/situation,

The Process of improvisation
1. School administration should offer financial assistance
2. Solicit support of parents to procure materials for improvisation
3. Solicit support of experts Within the community to assist in the improvisation exercise

Weaknesses of improvised materials
May not achieve the level of accuracy and precision required
May not be attractive to look at.
If not well made can cause harm or injury to users.
