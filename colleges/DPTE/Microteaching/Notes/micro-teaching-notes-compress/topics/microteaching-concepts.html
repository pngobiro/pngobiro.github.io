                        <p><strong>Assessment tool.</strong> The techniques used to measure learners' academic abilities and skills/to measure ones' progress towards academic proficiency in a learning area. They are used to make informed decisions regarding strategies to enhance learners' learning.</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Is a written plan that describes what the teacher and other professionals will do to meet special needs of a learner.</li>
                            <li>It focuses on individual learner's needs, thereby allowing him/her to acquire knowledge, skills, attitudes and values athis/her own pace.</li>
                            <li>Is developed by multidisciplinary team composed of the learner, special education teacher, assessment officer, psychologist, speech therapist,occupational therapist, physiotherapist, social worker and parents.</li>
                            <li>IEP therefore is a plan whereby teachers, support personnel and parents work together as a team to meet the needs of individual learners who require individualized support.</li>
                            <li>It provides a description and action plan for the services and supports necessary to meet unique learning needs of the learner.</li>

                            <li><strong>Learner's present level of performance.</strong> The current level is assessed to identify the academic skills in which the learner has strengths and those that he/she has challenges. Assess also communication, behavior and social skills. This can be done through observation, oral, written or interviews.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Implementation strategy.</strong></p>

                            <li><strong>Initial and termination dates</strong>-the program should start after the entry behavior assessment has been done. Implementation duration will depend on the achievement of the stated outcomes. Review should be carried out continuously and adjustment of the termination date should be made accordingly. If the learner achieved all the outcomes specified, the IEP ends. If the learner achieves some of the outcomes, then the IEP period is extended/reviewed to acquire the remaining outcomes..</li>
                            <li><strong>Adaptation</strong>-these are changes to the curriculum, learning resources and physical environment that may be required to accommodate learners with special needs in the learning environment.</li>
