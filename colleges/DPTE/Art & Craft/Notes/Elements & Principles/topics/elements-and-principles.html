                        <p>The secondary source of colour is pigment. Pigment is the colouring mater which gives colour to an object. In order to see colou, light has to fall on a surface which has pigment. The pigment reflects rays of colour of a specific type and absorbs the others. E.g. A red flower appears red because its pigments reflect the red colour and absorbs all the other colours of the spectrum.</p>

                        <p>Colour has 3 basic properties</p>
                        <ol type="i">
                            <li>Hue</li>

                            <li>Intensity</li>
                        </ol>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">i) Hue</h4>
                        <p>Is the property of colour that makes it appear different from another. Hue is the name of a colour. E.g. Red is a hue (Red Hue)</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">ii) Value</h4>
                        <p>Is the lightness or darkness of a colou. The value of a colour can be changed by adding white or a lighter colour (Tinting) or a darker colour (Shading)</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">iii) Intensity</h4>
                        <p>Is the brightness or dullness of a colour. Colour of high intensity is pure, clean and saturated.</p>

                                <p>~ Is used to describe the appearance of an object. Example the sky is blue, grass is green. This way of using colour is referred to as objective use of colour.</p>

                                <p>Colour attracts attention and directs the viewer to the important part of a picture. The focal point / centre of interest can therefore be painted in brighter or contrasting colours.</p>

                        <p>Form is an object that is three-dimensional and has volume. A form should have or appear to have length, width, and height.
