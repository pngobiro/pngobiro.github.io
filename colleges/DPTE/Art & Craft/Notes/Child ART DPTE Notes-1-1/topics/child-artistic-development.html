                        <p>At this stage, some children create artworks that are detailed and show awareness of proportion, balance, harmony, space relation and tonal variation. Some children also become aware of how to overlap forms and create 3D effects in a drawing. However some are unable to develop this visual awareness naturally. To some this marks an end to their natural artistic development. Very often when adults are asked to draw their work is typical of 13 yr old children.</p>
                        <p>At 13years or later, is the stage at which a child can make a conscious decision to continue creating artworks (Artistic revival). To some extent the natural development of art stops here and there and has to be followed consciously.</p>
