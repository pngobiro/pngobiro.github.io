ATP 106 LPMWEEK 2 Historical Background of Legal Practice ManagementLaw Firms date back to 19th Century.Management of Firms was propelled by management theory that developed in the US before the civil war.In western world bar associations have played a major role in historically to support law firms with the aspects of management by setting standards for the running of the business of law.In the UK, law firms were organized as sole proprietorship, partnerships and Limited Liability Partnerships(LLPs).Legal profession and management thereof as evolved from the introduction of English law and practice in Kenya. History…contIn the beginning Firms were established and run by Europeans and Asians only because Africans did not have the education and qualifications to practice lawFor those who had education, there were not allowed to establish and run law firms.When Africans were finally allowed to practice law, they popularly preferred two-man partnership which also had financial challenges(could not access loans)So sole proprietorship was another form of law firm practice allowed.Many African lawyers could not afford decent offices and most were tempted to violate client’s account.

Given the demand for legal services, we determined it would be best to locate our offices in an urban setting, particularly one that was near to our city's commercial areas.A town or urban office also provides greater accessibility to the office and access to client, amenities and security. For these reasons we have strategically chosen our office to be located in the Upper Hill area. UPPERHILL IS HOME TO:● Major foreign embassies, such as; the British High Commission in Kenya, the Embassy of Japan, the Embassy of Indonesia; and the Embassy of Israel● Headquarters for Banks, such as the African Development Bank, Citibank and Equity Group Holdings and Kenya Commercial Bank● Courts- Milimani Law Courts - which is a high court of Kenya and has several divisions such as civil division, family division, criminal division, constitutional and human rights division, judicial review division.

ATP 106 LEGAL PRACTICE MANAGEMENT (ACCOUNTING) Subtopic: BANK RECONCILIATION STATEMENT The cashbook for cash at bank records all the transactions taking place at the bank i.e. the movements of the account held with the bank. The bank will send information relating to this account using a bank statement for the firm to compare. Ideally, the records as per the bank and the cashbook should be the same and therefore the balance carried down in the cashbook should be the same as the balance carried down by the bank in the bank statement. In practice however, this is not the case and the two (balance as per the bank and firm) are different. A bank reconciliation statement explains the difference between the balance at the bank as per the cashbook and balance at bank as per the bank statement. Items Appearing In the Cashbook and Not Reflected In the Bank Statement 1) Unpresented Cheques: Cheques issued by the firm for payment to the creditors or to other supplies but have not been presented to the firm's bank for payment. 2) Uncredited deposits/cheques: These are cheques received from customers and other sources for which the firm has banked but the bank has not yet availed the funds by crediting the firm's account. 3) Errors made in the cashbook. These include: • Payments over/understated • Deposits over/understated • Deposits and payments misposted • Overcasting and under casting the Balance c/d in the cashbook.

LESSON ONE INTRODUCTION TO BOOK KEEPING AND ACCOUNTING INTRODUCTION In all activities (whether business activities or non-business activities) and in all organizations (whether business organizations like a manufacturing entity or trading entity or non-business organizations like schools, colleges, hospitals, libraries, clubs, churches, political parties, etc) which require money and other economic resources, accounting is required to account for these resources. In other words, wherever money is involved, accounting is required to account for it. Accounting is often called the language of business. The basic function of any language is to serve as a means of communication. Accounting also serves this function. Meaning and Definition of Book- Keeping Meaning Book- keeping includes recording of journal, posting in ledgers and balancing of accounts. All the records before the preparation of trail balance is the whole subject matter of book- keeping. Thus, book- keeping many be defined as the science and art of recording transactions in money or money’s worth so accurately and systematically, in a certain set of books, regularly that the true state of businessman’s affairs can be correctly ascertained. Here it is important to note that only those transactions related to business are recorded which can be expressed in terms of money.

ICTLESSON FOUR cWith the advent of ICT note taking is effected through the use of computers and other ICT devices.According to Mureithi, office automation enables people to perform their own work with relative ease. Tasks such as letter writing and report writing, data storage and processing are but some of the many tasks that one can accomplish by harnessing ICT tools such as spreadsheets, word processors and desktop publishing tools, presentation packages and database systems. ICT and Legal EductaionLecturers and law students can access law books, journals, scholarly articles, and judicial precedents online. Libraries of certain institutions have gone electronic. Moreover, some libraries have merged into one electronic library such as Jstor. cAmong the useful websites, there is Google books, Law Africa, Halsbury’s law, Kenya law reports (eKLR), Lexis/Nexis,Halsbury’s law, Westlaw, and Balii. Websites like YouTube are vital in conveying recorded lectures on certain topics such as humanitarian law. A law student may find such a website useful as it hosts recorded lectures from different universities around the world.

Automation works best only in certain areas in legal practice such as client intake, marketing, communications and document review.However, there are potential risks that automation technology will ultimately subjugate rather than serve. The risks include the possibility that workers in law firms will become slaves to automated machines, and that the privacy of the firm and its clients will be invaded by the overreliance on the vast computerization. This endangers the workflow in a firm as it increases laziness in employees. For instance, legal work requires vast research which often requires field work. Due to the availability of most of the resources online, most lawyers avoid such tasks. 5. OVERRELIANCE ON TECHNOLOGY Despite these pitfalls, automation technology, if used wisely and effectively, can yield substantial opportunities for the future. There is an opportunity to relieve lawyers from repetitive, hazardous, and unpleasant labor in all forms. We also note that more and more legal roles are being automated and replaced by artificial intelligence systems. Law firms have no choice but to accept this new technology. However, some people believe that manual reviewing is more accurate and better for lawyers. But, artificial intelligence systems can do work in much less time, and thus it is favorable when the main concern is performing a job in as little time as possible. CONCLUSION THE ENDTHANKYOU Initial costs used in setting up the office automation may be expensive. Fo

Thomas Hobbes’ theory of social contract puts into perspective the significance of security in human life. Security is the principle basis of state sovereignty and political legitimacy. People entered into a social contract with the state where they surrender some of their liberties in exchange for security and protection. Security is key to the survival of any living organism. Life is full of perils, which pose threats to both the physical, environmental, and social spheres of human life. Accordingly, it is important for organizations, including law firms, to put in place mechanisms that would

STANDARDS:  A standard is a written limit or rule that is approved and monitored by an agency as the minimum benchmark acceptable, or technical specifications contained in a document that lay down levels of quality, performance, safety, or dimensions of a product.  The Black’s Law Dictionary defines a standard as, stability, general recognition, and conformity to established practice. A type, model, or combination of elements accepted as correct or perfect.  Neither the Constitution of Kenya, 2010 [hereinafter referred to COK] nor the Interpretations and General Provisions Act, Cap 2, provides a definition for the word ‘Standard.’  Some statutes define it in relation to the purpose of the specific statute, for instance, the Standards Act, Cap 496 define “Standardization Mark” as a mark prescribed by the National Standards Council under Section 10 of the said Act. Sections 2 and 10 of the Weights and Measures Act, Cap 513 also define working standards of weights and measures in relation to inspection of the weights and measures equipment.  In an organization a standard is a document approved by a recognized authority that provide, for common and repeated use, rules, guidelines or characteristics for products and services, whose compliance is mandatory.  Features of standards: They: a) serve as targets; b) can be technical, procedural, or outcome oriented; c) vary from office to office; d) regulate virtually all spheres of life i.e.,

A NACADA analysis in May 2010; indicated that 68% of alcoholic drinks presented for analysis did not meet the set alcoholic drinks standards; there was need to amend the Law. CThe applicant relied on the KEBS Kenya Standard Code of Practice of Inspection of Road Vehicles (KS 1515:2000). The applicant’s was wrong on the standard and he sought to invoke constitutional rights to property. The learned judge’s interpretation of the rule resonated with the intent of the Standard: that is to prohibit importation of over-age vehicles into Kenya. Honourable Justice Majanja proceeded to state that standards limit the right to property since it is not absolute. In the circumstances it cannot be said that the applicant’s rights had been violated nor was there a necessity to invoke the Constitution in the circumstances, the applicant’s motion was thus denied.

IMARA ADVOCATES LLP QUESTION: WITH THE USE OF EXAMPLES, DISCUSS HOW STANDARDS, POLICIES AND PROCEDURES CAN IMPACT A LEGAL PRACTICE Standards, policies and procedures are crucial components of a legal practice. They help ensure consistency, efficiency and compliance with legal and ethical requirements. We shall proceed to look at each of the elements in depth. STANDARDS Definition A standard can be described as the general written limit, definition or rule approved and monitored by the authority as a minimum acceptable benchmark. Organizations have to abide by standards that are required by law. As a general rule, application of such standards is necessitated by intrinsic factors such as low or unsatisfying quality of legal services. The Black law Dictionary defines standards as the “Stability, general recognition and conformity to establish practice. A type, model or combination of elements accepted as correct or perfect.” Standards refer to a set of guidelines or benchmarks that are used to measure performance or quality. In a legal practice, standards can be used to establish expectations for lawyers, staff and clients. For example, a law firm may have a standard that requires lawyers to respond to client inquiries within 24 hours. This standard ensures that clients receive prompt and attentive service. Standards can be broken down to six categories: Glossaries or definition of terminology: The Standards and Regulations Glossary comprises a set of defined terms which are us
