                            4. The respondent opposed the application by a Replying Affidavit sworn on 15th August 2018.<br>

REPUBLIC OF KENYA
IN THE ENVIRONMENT AND LAND COURT AT NAIROBI
ELC NO. 33 OF 2018

BILLY ESTATE LTD .................................................... APPLICANT
VERSUS
TIMBER ................................................................. RESPONDENT

RULING

Background:
The applicant filed a Notice of Motion dated 10th July 2018, seeking an order restraining the defendant from closing an access road passing through Timber/Timber/70, which is the property of the respondent. The access road has been open since 2013 and now threatens to be closed. The respondent contends that the estate is not landlocked.

Issues:
1. Whether the estate is landlocked.
2. Whether the owners of Billy Estate are entitled to continue using the access road.
3. Whether the respondent can lawfully close the access road.

Determination:
1. Whether the estate is landlocked: This being an allegation raised by the respondent in the negative, the applicant ought to have examined if there are entitled to have a right of way. The access road blocked by the said private developer should be examined... To this extent, the case requires further information to be furnished.

2. Whether the owners of Billy Estate are entitled to continue using the access road: The owner began using it in 2013, and the question would be whether they have a crystallised right to keep using it in light of the time that has lapsed since.

3. Whether the respondent can lawfully close the access road: The question would be whether a proprietor's right to close an access road is limited.

Based on the foregoing, it is apparent that the case raises certain issues which ought to be examined before a final decision can be made.
It is hereby ruled that the case has merits and parties are hereby directed to file and serve their submissions.

Dated at NAIROBI...
Delivered by Judge... on 17th June 2021.

                            <p>Willy Willis sued Ken Kambo in the High Court seeking payment of Ksh. 35,280,000.

Being dissatisfied with the said decision, he instructed his advocates on 10th January 2019 to file an appeal against the judgement. The advocate filed the Notice of Appeal on 30th January 2019 and applied for typed proceedings on 11th February 2019. He served both the Notice of Appeal and the letter requesting for proceedings on the defendant's advocates on 14th February 2019.</p>

The application in this case is an application seeking to strike out the Notice of Appeal.
First, being new advocates, we will file and serve a notice of change of advocates in order to properly be put on record as Willy's new advocates.
Then we will oppose the application by way of a Replying Affidavit.
We shall be guided by the Civil Procedure Act, Civil Procedure Rules, Appellate Jurisdiction Act and Court of Appeal Rules.
We shall demonstrate to the court the following:
1. That our appeal is meritorious.
2. That you shall suffer injustice if it is struck out.
3. That you are ready to or have furnished security for execution of the decree.
Since the law allows for striking out of appeals pursuant to the Court of Appeal Rules, we will have to show the court that our appeal has merit and should not be struck out, and that if it is struck out it will not be in the interest of justice as guided by Sections 3A and 3B of the Appellate Jurisdiction Act on justice and fairness.

(b)(i) Anomalies in relation to execution of instructions to file appeal:
As indicated, the Civil Procedure Act (Section 75), Appellate Jurisdiction Act, Court of Appeal Rules govern the process.
1. Filing Notice of Appeal: The notice of appeal ought to have been filed 14 days after the judgment which was delivered on 14th December 2018. This was not done within the timelines.
2. Filing memorandum of appeal: This ought to be done within sixty days after filing a notice of appeal. Again, this was not done.
3. Certificate of delay: Knowing the appeal could not be filed in time because of lack of typed proceedings, the advocate ought to have obtained a certificate to justify the delay. Again, this was not done.
Conclusion: An appeal is considered as having been filed once a memorandum of appeal has been filed and within the set timelines. In this case, the appeal was not properly filed.

(b)(ii) Application to rectify the anomalies:
Because the appeal was filed without adherence to the set timelines, an application ought to be made asking the court to allow the appellant to appeal outside the time. In other words, an application extending the time required to file the appeal in order to accommodate late filing.
This shall be done in form of a notice of motion.
Willy shall satisfy the following conditions:
1) Demonstrate that the delay was not deliberate.
2) Demonstrate that he has a meritorious appeal.
3) Deposit security for satisfaction of the decree.
4) Demonstrate that there will be no prejudice occasioned to the respondent.
5) Demonstrate that he has approached the court with clean hands and promptly, in light of the circumstances.

RE: LEGAL ADVISE
Subject to your visit to our chamber we state the issues as follows:

ISSUES
The question revealed is what B Auctioneers needs to do with the money in its possession, the same being claimed by different parties.
This brings to light the concept of inter-pleader proceedings.

RULING / APPLICATION
Inter-pleader proceedings:
Provided for under Order 34 of the Civil Procedure Rules, these are proceedings initiated by a party in possession of certain property which is claimed by two or more people. The purpose is to present the matter to court so that the court is able to determine the person entitled to the property in contention.

If brought in an ongoing suit, the application is by way of chambers summons. If there is no suit in place, then it is brought by way of originating summons.
In this case, B Auctioneers will be an interpleader, guided by Order 34 of the Civil Procedure Rules.

To successfully prosecute the application, B Auctioneers will have to fulfill certain conditions:
B Auctioneers will be required to establish:
1. That it is a neutral party with no interest in the proceeds, save for its costs and charges.
2. That it is not in collusion with any of the parties claiming the money.
3. That it is ready to deal with the money as the court shall direct, including depositing it with the court.

Upon demonstrating this, the court shall admit B Auctioneers' application and discharge it from any liability from any of the parties claiming the money.

The treatment receipts are in the amount of Kshs 40,000 and you wish to recover this amount.

ISSUE
The issue revealed from the facts stated is whether you will be able to recover the amount by having it added to the damages earlier awarded to you.

RULE
Your situation involves discovery of new fact or evidence after judgment, which evidence is material and capable of altering the judgment. The avenue to be pursued is application for review, with you being an aggrieved party under Section 80, CPA. The rules on applying for a review are provided in Section 80 of the Civil Procedure Act and Order 45 of the Civil Procedure Rules.

ANALYSIS
Section 80 of the Civil Procedure Act and Order 45 of the said Rules are aimed at allowing a party to request a court that has rendered a judgment to examine it again and alter it. This can be done on the basis of three grounds:
1) Discovery of new evidence
2) Mistake or error apparent on the face of the record
3) Any other justifiable reason.

In your case, you have come across treatment receipts. These amount to new evidence. You will therefore rely on this ground to apply for a review.
To succeed, you will need to demonstrate the following grounds:
1. You will demonstrate to the court that you have come across material evidence (the receipts).
2. That you were not able to discover the existence of these receipts earlier, despite due diligence. The fact that Patrick was not aware that they were needed can help support this ground.
3. That the new evidence is capable of altering the initial judgment materially or substantially. Here you will consider the amount of Kshs 40,000 evidenced by the receipts and which is indeed substantial.
4. You will also inform the court that you have approached it promptly upon discovering the existence of the receipts.
5. Finally, you can demonstrate the loss you will suffer if your application is denied, and the fact that the defendant will suffer no prejudice, your application being in the interest of justice.

Conclusion
In conclusion, you will pursue a review to address your situation. Upon demonstrating the grounds outlined, the Court shall consider the case again in light of the evidence and give a fresh judgment taking into account the amount of Kshs 40,000.

Yours sincerely,
