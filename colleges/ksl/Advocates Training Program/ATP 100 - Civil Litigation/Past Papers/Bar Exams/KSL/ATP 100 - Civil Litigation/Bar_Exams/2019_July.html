                            <p>1. An application has been filed in court by the plaintiffs, Joseph and Others who are officials of Kibos Forest Association.</p>
                            <p>2. The orders sought are that the respondents who are also defendants in the case, Kibos Forest Service and Kibos Sawmillers Association be restrained by themselves and/or their agents from harvesting timber and fuel materials in Kibos Forest within Bot County pending hearing and determination of the suit.</p>
                            <p>3. The grounds upon which the application is based are that:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>The respondents are not qualified to harvest timber.</li>
                                <li>The forest rules have not been adhered to.</li>
                                <li>That the allocated sawmillers are overharvesting the trees.</li>
                                <li>That Kibos Forest Association was not involved when allocation for cutting trees was being done and this is contrary to the forest rules.</li>
                                <li>That there is no harvesting licence issued and no environmental impact assessment has been done.</li>

                            <p>4. The Plaintiffs aver that they stand to suffer untold loss as they also depend on the forest for their livelihood.</p>
                            <p>5. The Plaintiffs further state that the environment stands to suffer irreversible loss if the harvesting of trees is not stopped.</p>
                            
                            <p>You have been retained by the plaintiffs in this case. Draft the submissions that will be used to argue the application stating clearly the orders sought by the applicants. <strong>(10 marks)</strong></p>

                            <p>Mary has a child and is struggling for upkeep. Mary needs help in catering for medical expenses, school fees and food. The alleged father, James, the defendant is a man of means who can comfortably provide for his estranged family. Jayden, the son, is in school and is about to do the final examination. His evidence is needed in this case and is necessary for a just determination of the case. Jayden's school is in Mombasa and the child's school programme to be disrupted by going to court to give evidence and this is a fact he will make known to the court.</p>
                            
                            <p>The person who signed the birth certificate, George is required to give the evidence in court. He has indicated that he cannot be available but he has availed a certified copy of the birth certificate. The advocate for the defendant has no problem in dispensing the presence of George. The plaintiff has availed the following original documents which will be used as evidence in the hearing, namely school fees invoices as evidence of arrears, birth certificate and paternity test report. According to the defendant's advocate, they will not object to their use if they get an opportunity to see the documents and confirm their authenticity. His client is also anxious to have the matter expeditiously disposed. Apparently the defendant had lodged a notice for inspection but the plaintiff had not responded. A case conference date has been set.</p>
                            
                            <p>(a) Advise Mary on the directions that are likely to be given by the Magistrate presiding over the matter. <strong>(8 marks)</strong></p>

                            <p>Mirriam Sammy is the legal representative of Joseph Sammy (her husband) who was the 2nd defendant in Kajiado ELC No.89 of 2007. Following his death on 23rd August 2007, Mirriam filed an application seeking to be substituted as a party in place of her late husband on 10th February 2009. The application was heard and allowed on 14th May 2009. The suit proceeded for hearing and a judgement decreeing the cancellation of her late husband's title was delivered on 6th March 2015 in favour of the plaintiff, William Labana.</p>
                            
                            <p>On 8th May 2015, Mirriam filed an application seeking a plethora of orders among them leave to substitute her advocate, abridgement of time to enable her file a Notice of Appeal out of time, review of the judgement, directions regarding the mode of service of the application and an order for maintenance of the status quo pending the hearing of the application and the intended appeal.</p>
                            
                            <p>The grounds upon which she made the application are that the suit had abated by the time she was joined as a party, the pleadings were not thereafter amended to reflect those changes, she was not given a chance to be heard and that the delay in filing the Notice of Appeal was occasioned by the failure by her advocate to inform her that judgement had been delivered and only learnt about it from the 3rd defendant. Further that the delay was occasioned by the hardship she faced in retrieving the file from her advocate to enable her instruct another advocate.</p>
                            
                            <p>Upon being served with the application, William has instructed you to represent him and oppose the application.</p>

                                <p>4. The respondent is a stranger to paragraph 4 of the claim and cannot meaningfully respond.</p>
                                <p>5. In response to paragraph 5 of the claim the respondent states as follows:<br>
                                (a) Upon employment the claimant was placed on probation for a period of six (6) months in line with the terms of employment with the respondents.<br>
                                (b) After lapse of six (6) months' probation period, the respondent carried out an appraisal of the claimant's performance and the claimant was found to be underperforming.<br>
                                (c) Owing to the poor performance the claimant's probation was extended by a further three (3) months. He was required to develop an improvement plan to be reviewed monthly for the duration of extended probation period.</p>
                                <p>6. The response to paragraph 6 of the claim is that the respondent lawfully issued the claimant with a show cause letter due to continued poor performance.</p>
                                <p>7. Paragraph 7 of the claim is admitted only to the extent that the claimant resigned from employment vide his letter dated 25th April 2016. The allegation of duress is denied in toto and claimant put to strict proof.</p>
                                <p>8. In response to paragraphs 8 and 9 of the claim, the respondent avers that the claimant having resigned from employment on 25th April 2016 the summary dismissal of 27th April 2016 is superfluous.</p>
                                <p>9. In the alternative and without prejudice to 8 above, the respondent avers that the claimant was lawfully terminated on valid grounds of poor performance.</p>
                                <p>10. The response to paragraph 10 of the claim and without prejudice to paragraphs 8 and 9 hereinabove, the respondent avers that the claimant's termination was procedurally fair because:<br>
                                (a) Poor performance constitutes a valid reason for termination of employment.<br>
                                (b) The respondent invited the claimant for an oral hearing that was to take place on 26th April 2016. The claimant opted to resign on 25th April 2016 and reported that he did not find it necessary to attend hearing slated for 26th April 2016.</p>
                                <p>11. Without prejudice to paragraph 10 hereinabove the respondent avers that the claimant is denied the benefit of section 41 by virtue of section 42 of the Employment Act 2007 since he was still on probation.</p>
                                <p>12. Save for a Certificate of Service, the respondent avers that the claimant is not entitled to any and all of the reliefs suggested.</p>
