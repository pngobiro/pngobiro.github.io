Fumo Liyongo, a client, has come into the office and you were assigned to take instructions from him. He gives you the following information:</p>
                            
                            <p>On 9/8/2022 he was going to vote in the general election at Westlands Primary School. Having alighted from a matatu that he had boarded from Kangemi to Westlands, he had to cross Waiyaki Way to get to the polling centre... While crossing at a duly designated and marked pedestrian crossing point, motor vehicle registration number UBA 007M that is registered in the neighbouring Republic of Uganda drove so fast "as if from nowhere" and knocked him down causing him multiple injuries.</p>
                            
                            <p>The police abstract... shows that the owner and driver of the motor vehicle was one Kyadundu Ssempebwa, a Ugandan national who was visiting Kenya for a conference... Fumo Liyongo shows that he had already spent Ksh. 2,500,000 on medical treatment. The doctor projects that post-discharge medical reviews will cost another Ksh. 500,000. Expected compensation for pain and suffering is in the range of Ksh. 3,000,000 to Ksh. 3,500,000.</p>
                            
                            <p>Fumo's greatest concern is that... the exhibit Motor vehicle... will be released to the accused after 14 days from the date of judgment in the criminal traffic case. Mr Ssempebwa will certainly drive the said vehicle back to Uganda. Mr Ssempebwa has no other proprietary interests in Kenya...</p>

REPUBLIC OF KENYA
IN THE ENVIRONMENT AND LAND COURT AT NAIROBI
ELC CASE NO. 123 OF 2023

DAVID MUNGALA ......................................... APPLICANT/DEFENDANT
VERSUS
PETER DOE (suing as the executor of the late John Doe) ........ RESPONDENT/PLAINTIFF

RULING

The background of this matter can be traced to March 2019 when the Applicant sued the late John Doe claiming adverse possession over all that parcel of land known as Ngong/Ngong Block 1/47577. In March 2019, the Applicant obtained judgment and the court ordered John Doe to transfer the parcel of land to him. However, the Applicant never followed up on the matter to have land transferred to him.

Unfortunately, John Doe passed away in June 2020. On return from the United States of America, his eldest son, the Respondent obtained letters of administration and filed a suit against David seeking to have him evicted from the suit land.

Vide a Notice of Preliminary Objection, the Applicant applied to this court on the ground that it is an abuse of the court process.

Having considered the parties rival submissions on the preliminary objection, the main issue is whether the Applicant has met the conditions of raising a preliminary objection.

Under Order 2 of the Civil Procedure Rules, a party may raise a preliminary objection as a way of responding to a suit. 

In the locus classicus of Mukisa Biscuits v West End Distributors, the court defined a preliminary objection as one which when raised, is capable of disposing off the suit as a whole. The court laid down the conditions for a preliminary objection to succeed. First, it must be on points of law. It cannot be successfully raised where there are controversial or conflicting facts.

In the matter before me, I note that judgment was already entered in favor of the Applicant against the late John Doe on his claim for adverse possession. The Respondent has not disputed that fact. This leads me to establish whether there are points of law raised.

Under Section 7 of the Civil Procedure Act, the bar of res judicata prevents parties from re-litigating a matter which has been finally decided/resolved by a court of competent jurisdiction. While the Respondent was not a party to the initial proceedings, they sued as the executor of the deceased. Essentially, it is the same parties over the same subject matter (piece of land).

I agree with the Applicant that the matter was already determined by the court and re-opening the same matter is res judicata.

It is my finding that the Applicant has successfully met the conditions for grant of a preliminary objection. In view of the above, the Applicant's preliminary objection is hereby allowed. The Respondent shall bear the costs of the application.

Dated at NAIROBI on this 16th day of March 2023.

Entry Points in Constitutional Litigation in Kenya

The Constitution of Kenya 2010 has been commended for being a transformative document... In this presentation, I extensively discuss the avenues in the Constitution that provide a basis for litigating constitutional questions.

1. Article 22 and 23 of the Constitution:
These provisions provide that any person alleging that their fundamental rights and freedoms have been violated or are likely to be violated can petition the High Court. The High Court can grant orders such as declarations, injunctions, judicial review orders, and compensation among others. As a Constitutional Court, the High Court is the primary forum where violation of rights are heard and determined. One can bring the claim on their behalf or on behalf of another person.

2. Article 165 of the Constitution (Supremacy Clause Article 2):
Any law which is inconsistent with the Constitution is invalid taking into account the level of inconsistency. Under Article 165, the High Court has original jurisdiction to determine any claim that a provision of a law or entirely of a law is contrary or inconsistent with the Constitution. Any person can bring such a petition because Article 258 of the Constitution empowers any person to defend the Constitution. In David Ndii v Attorney General, the High Court observed that it is the gatekeeper of the Constitution.

3. Article 163 (Presidential Election Petition):
The Constitution of Kenya gives the Supreme Court original and exclusive jurisdiction in determining questions as to the validity of a presidential election under Article 163. This means that only the Supreme Court can determine a presidential election petition. The constitution obligates the court to render itself on the petition within 14 days.

4. Article 163(6) (Advisory Opinion):
The Constitution empowers the Supreme Court to give an advisory opinion on request by a State organ, county government. In Re Matter of the Speaker of the Senate, the Supreme Court held that its advisory opinions are binding and not mere recommendations.

5. Article 162(2) (Specialised Courts):
This provision establishes specialised courts with equal status of the High Court. In Karisa Chengo v Republic, the Supreme Court was categorical that the specialised courts namely Environment and Land Court (ELC) and Employment and Labour Relations Court (ELRC) are superior courts. They are not subject to the supervision of the High Court. The ELC determines claims relating to title, occupation of land, climate change issues. The ELRC has original jurisdiction to hear and determine claims arising between employer and employee, trade unions, disputes arising from collective bargaining agreements. These courts can also determine questions and claims of violation of fundamental rights that are incidental to the matters they are constitutionally empowered to determine. This position has been affirmed by Court of Appeal in Daniel Mugendi v Kenyatta University.
