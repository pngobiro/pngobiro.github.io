                            <p>Peter Wilkins and a group of 95 people have approached you with the following complaint:</p>
                            
                            <p>That they have been residents of Molo Sub-county for the last 15 years. During the 2007-2008 post-election violence, they were displaced from their homes and settled at a camp near Mau Forest. Sometimes in the year 2008, the Government of Kenya through the then Ministry of Special Programmes established the Department of Mitigation and Settlement. The National Humanitarian Fund Board was established under the said Department with the objective of resettling the internally displaced persons by giving each person a sum of Kshs. 35,000 and a parcel of land measuring 2½ acres.</p>
                            
                            <p>They are accusing the Government of selectively and indiscriminately extending assistance to 309 people at the camp to the exclusion of the 96 people who are still at the camp. They have information that the money which was supposed to be used for their resettlement has been misapplied and as such they have remained internally displaced. It is their contention that their right to non-discrimination, dignity, freedom and security, their social and economic rights have been violated.</p>
                            
                            <p>The functions of the Ministry of Special Programmes have now been taken over by the Ministry of Devolution and Planning of P.O. Box 350100 Nairobi. They have made efforts to follow up on their resettlement but the Government has failed to respond to their plea. They have requested you to study the matter with a view of filing appropriate pleadings seeking redress for the alleged violation of their rights. The group has appointed Peter Wilkins of P.O. Box 200 Mau Narok to be their representative.</p>

                            <p>Several plaintiffs have sued Bwanamali separately in a personal accident claim for injuries suffered. The plaintiffs were travelling as passengers in a bus owned by Bwanamali. The bus driver was blamed for the accident as the accident occurred while overtaking at a bend as a result of which it collided with an oncoming truck.</p>
                            
                            <p>As an advocate you have been informed by your clerk that a case conference has been convened. You hurriedly peruse the subject file and note a number of things. You discover that you have several case files for claims arising out of the same accident. This is because you received instructions at different times. You also get a call from another advocate, Juma who informs you that he represents 5 plaintiffs in the same accident and alerts you that he is representing other 5 plaintiffs against your client Bwanamali. You also get information that the bus was not insured and therefore any amount to be recovered should be recovered from the plaintiff himself.</p>
                            
                            <p>Some of the plaintiffs alert you that Bwanamali is in the process of selling his other buses and two prime properties in an attempt to defeat the ends of justice. In the present case, you hurriedly file an application for sale of the properties a day prior to the case conference day. You also realize that the Defense has not had an opportunity to peruse medical reports in respect of injuries suffered by the Plaintiffs you are representing. The advocate representing Bwanamali is considering an out of court settlement for the claims.</p>
                            
                            <p>Your clients are anxious about the case conference proceedings and do not understand the nature of these proceedings. Write a brief advising them on the nature of these proceedings and the directions that the court is likely to give. <strong>(10 marks)</strong></p>

                            <p>"Mugo informs you that he is a medical doctor and has just been dismissed by his employer the Medical Practitioners and Service Commission. He has several complaints concerning the manner in which he was dismissed. Dr. Mugo was not given notice of his disciplinary hearing. The alleged misconduct that was subject at the hearing was that he always preached to the patients at the hospital which conduct is prohibited by statute. Your client also states that he was not provided with any documentation relied upon by the Commission at the hearing.</p>
                            
                            <p>Another reason that was given for his dismissal was that 'he is a bachelor' hence his conduct as a doctor was questionable as he could not be trusted with 'some' patients. Further, Dr. Mugo was not given an opportunity to defend himself as the Commission felt that the evidence at hand was overwhelming to him dismissed. Finally, the Commission had made it clear that as a public body it had powers to hire and fire and for his case it had decided to 'fire' him."</p>
                            
                            <p>Dr. Mugo believes that he was dismissed unfairly and wants his job back. He believes the Commission is in the process of processing his final dues and documentation so as to complete the process of his dismissal.</p>
