                            <p>David Cleveland and Isaac Joseph are both Advocates of the High Court of Kenya. David acted for the purchaser and Isaac acted for the vendor in a land sale transaction. David conducted due diligence and after being satisfied about the status of the parcel of land, the parties signed a sale agreement. The purchaser paid a sum of Kshs. 100,000,000/- out of the agreed purchase price.</p>
                            
                            <p>A transfer was prepared and registered in favour of the purchaser. It was a term of the agreement that the balance of the purchase price would be paid upon the purchaser taking possession of the land. When the purchaser attempted to take possession, his entry was resisted by a person claiming ownership of the property. The parties exchanged several correspondences but the matter was not resolved.</p>
                            
                            <p>Having realized that he would not be able to take possession, the purchaser filed a complaint at the Advocates Disciplinary Tribunal against the two advocates involved in the transaction, praying that they both be found guilty of professional misconduct for negligent and fraudulent conduct, withholding a sum of Kshs. 100,000,000/- paid through the purchaser's advocates and breach of trust.</p>
                            
                            <p>The matter came up for plea on 12th April 2021 and the Tribunal recorded a plea of not guilty in the absence of the two respondent advocates. Subsequently, the matter came up for hearing several occasions but the complainant and his advocate (newly appointed to represent him at the tribunal) were always absent. The two respondent advocates applied that the matter be heard by way of viva voce evidence so that they cross-examine the complainant. The tribunal ordered that the issue of a viva voce evidence shall be determined when the complainant or his advocate appear before the tribunal.</p>
                            
                            <p>When the matter came up for hearing on 15th July 2021, the Tribunal ignored its earlier Order on viva voce hearing and instead directed that the cause proceeds on the basis of the filed affidavits before setting down the date for delivery of judgement.</p>
                            
                            <p>On 21st October 2021 when the matter came up for judgement, instead of delivering its decision, the Tribunal read a Notice to produce better and further particulars to the two respondent advocates, requiring each of them to supply the Tribunal with certain particulars within 14 days thereof.</p>
                            
                            <p>The vendor's advocate, whose address is PO Box 12478-00100 Nairobi, contends that the Tribunal's decision and proceedings violate his rights protected by Articles 10, 47, 50(1) and 50(2)(k) of the Constitution of Kenya (2010) and intends to seek legal redress. The Tribunal's address is P.O. Box 19877-0200 Nairobi.</p>

The appellant contends that she has made every effort to secure half of decretal sum as ordered by the court but all efforts have borne no fruits and that the present application is filed without any unreasonable delay.</p>
                            
                            <p>The respondent opposed the application, arguing that there is no sufficient reason given for the order sought and that the court in the exercise of its jurisdiction is not dependent upon what the applicant is willing to offer as security. In addition, the respondent notes that courts make decisions based on law and not pity.</p>
                            
                            <p>The orders sought to be reviewed were pursuant to an application seeking stay of execution of a decree awarding the respondents a sum of Kshs. 1,800,000.</p>
