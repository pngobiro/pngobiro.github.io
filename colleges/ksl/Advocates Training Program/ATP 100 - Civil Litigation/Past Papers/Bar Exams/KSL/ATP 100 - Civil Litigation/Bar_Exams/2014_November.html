                            <p>Rosemary Oldish Netondo travelled to Eldoret by air using Rapid Airways Ltd. She paid for, and received her air travel ticket at the airline's officers on Conspicuous Emporium, Sixth Floor along Restoration Avenue, Nairobi. The airline was also to carry Netondo's brief-case containing her wearing apparel, rare reading materials, and share-holder certificates. The airline received and took charge of the said brief-case and placed it in their luggage chamber of the aircraft in which Netondo was about to travel, for the purpose of its being carried to Eldoret on the travel day, June 8, 2014.</p>
                            
                            <p>Netondo travelled by the said aircraft to Eldoret, but her brief-case did not arrive, apparently Rapid Airways Ltd had not carried it to Eldoret, nor delivered it to her on her arrival there, or at all. It seems that the airline has either lost or retained the said brief-case, thereby depriving the lady of her brief-case and all its contents. She has gone through and suffered tremendous inconvenience, and has incurred expense in endeavoring to recover possession of her brief-case, without success.</p>

                            <p>Double Nine Kamau sued Moka Moka Omwene, and in his plaint there were the following allegations, among others:</p>
                            
                            <div style="background-color: #f8f9fa; padding: 1rem; border: 1px dashed #cbd5e0; margin: 1rem 0; font-family: monospace;">
                                <p>"3. On May 22, 2014, the parties entered a written agreement signed by them, whereby the plaintiff sold to the defendant gemstones for Kshs.200,000,000.</p>
                                <p>4. Upon delivery, the defendant was to pay for the goods within 60 days.</p>
                                <p>5. The plaintiff delivered the goods promptly in accordance with the agreement.</p>
                                <p>6. Four months after the said delivery of the gemstones to the defendant, the said defendant has not made any payment of the purchase price, despite demand made for payment and notice of intention to sue in default given the defendant has refused, failed or neglected to pay for the gemstones"</p>
                            </div>
                            
                            <p>The plaint sought for judgment for the purchase price and costs. Upon being served with the plaint, Moka Moka Omwene brings it to a well-known civil litigation law firm where you are a pupil and instructs the firm to enter appearance and file a defence properly responding to the plaintiff's allegation.</p>
                            
                            <p>In the client-advocate interview, Moka Moka Omwene tells you that whilst there was the signed written agreement between him and Double Nine Kamau, payment was to be made only after Moka Moka Omwene had received from abroad the proceeds of the gemstones, either on sale or from advance bonus from an overseas importer. He instructs you that he has never yet received any such proceeds or bonus. He explains that this has not happened because, contrary to the said agreement, Double Nine Kamau made a short delivery, and what was delivered was of very poor quality and he is incurring a loss trying to sell the goods delivered. He wishes to be compensated by Double Nine Kamau.</p>
                            
                            <p>He further adds that due to representations made by Double Nine, Moka Moka Omwene had signed the agreement in the belief that, and on the faith of, that representation that no money would become payable by him to Double Nine Kamau if the goods were not sold abroad, and that instead, Kamau would pay him a liquidated amount of Kshs.300,000,000, as per the verbal agreement. Omwene asks you to consider a rectification of the written agreement.</p>
                            
                            <p>On these instructions, draft appropriate responses pleading to the plaint, including Omwene's concerns set out above. Assume that appearance has already been entered, and that the pleading you draft is to be filed later. Your draft need not include the court and the parties. Simply have the right title of the pleading and the relevant paragraphs of the pleading dealing with the above instructions received from Moka Moka Omwene. <strong>(15 Marks)</strong></p>

                            <p>Gillian Mapasi has frantically approached the firm Khumalo & Dingu Advocates where you are a pupil. The cause of her distress is in a judgment that has been declared against her husband Fred Mapasi for the debt owed by him to Fedlink Bank of an amount of Kshs.6,000,000. The advocates representing the bank have extracted a decree for attachment and sale of the Mapasi residence in Juja just off the Thika Super Highway.</p>
                            
                            <p>Gillian feels that it would be very unfair to her if the house was sold as she put up half the cost of the construction of the house, which amounted to Kshs. 7,000,000. Moreover, that is the house they reside in with their two children, as a family. She is seeking advice from the firm on how she may be able to get a remedy against this judgment and impending execution.</p>

Rashid is very aggrieved by Patel's action. So he comes to your pupil-master's office and relates how things have gone on. Patel is a financial mogul in the Republic.
