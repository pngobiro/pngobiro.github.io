                            <p>You are a newly admitted advocate who has been employed by the firm of Wakili and Company Advocates of Gorofa House, 3rd floor, Moi Avenue, P.O. Box 34031 - 00100 Nairobi. On 31st January, 2017, the Senior Partner in charge of litigation referred Esther Kanunka to you with a request that you take instructions from her.</p>
                            
                            <p>Esther told you that on the 15th day of January 2015, her late husband Peter Kanunka was driving his motor vehicle registration number KCB 300V along the Kiambu-Nairobi Road. He was with their son John Kanunka who was seated on the front passenger seat. As Peter was approaching the Thika-Nairobi highway, Llyod Musonda, a resident of Nyeri County who was driving motor vehicle registration number KTF 324 from the opposite direction started overtaking the vehicles that were moving to Thika without first ascertaining whether it was safe to do so.</p>
                            
                            <p>As a result, the two vehicles collided head-on and both Peter and John sustained serious injuries. John sustained the following injuries: multiple soft tissue injuries, a fracture of the right upper arm, a fracture of the distal right thigh bone, fracture of the pelvis and a fracture of the distal right wrist. He was admitted at the Nairobi Hospital for three weeks and was discharged after his condition improved. Peter was pronounced dead on arrival at the hospital.</p>
                            
                            <p>Esther gave you the following documents:</p>
                            <p>A death certificate, a police abstract, a Grant of Letters of Administration in her name, receipts for medical expenses in the sum of Kshs. 2,785,459/-, a receipt for fees paid for a medical report in the sum of Kshs. 5,000/-, a receipt for fees paid for a police abstract in the sum of Kshs. 100/-, a pay-slip indicating that Peter used to earn a net monthly salary of Kshs. 560,000/, receipts for burial expenses in the sum of Kshs. 540,000/-, a medical report, a birth certificate for John indicating that
