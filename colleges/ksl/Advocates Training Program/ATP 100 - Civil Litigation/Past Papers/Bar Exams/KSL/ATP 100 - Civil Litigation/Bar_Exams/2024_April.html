                            <p>On 14th March 2023, Gifted Spirits General Services Limited and Happy Bank Limited (the Bank) executed two Debenture Agreements in respect of various machineries owned by Gifted Spirits General Services Limited. The Bank extended credit facilities to the company for a collective sum of KSh. 61,000,000/=.</p>
                            
                            <p>One Debenture Agreement was specific in respect of a refinery machine known as Grand Mortar, Serial Number 111wi976 valued at KSh. 45,000,000/=. The other Debenture Agreement was general for any other property/machinery owned by the company but not specifically mentioned in the Specific Debenture Agreement. Save for the difference in the type of properties covered in each of the Agreements, most clauses of the two Agreements were strikingly identical. Clause 7 of both agreements stipulated that the principal sum was repayable within one year plus profits with a monthly installment of KSh. 10,000,000/= to cover for both profits and interest.</p>
                            
                            <p>The two Debenture Agreements were subject to the provisions of <em>the Movable Property Security Rights Act</em>. The sole director/shareholder of the company also signed a separate agreement as the grantor to be personally bound within the meaning of <em>the Movable Property Security Rights Act</em>.</p>
                            
                            <p>The company defaulted but instead sued the Bank on the pretext that the Bank was in the process of selling all the company assets through public auction scheduled in the next two weeks. To the contrary, the company had defaulted by not remitting any periodic sums and also clandestinely sold the refinery machine known as Grand Mortar, Serial Number 111wi976 valued at KSh. 45,000,000/= without the knowledge of the Bank. The Bank had intended to exercise its right to sue as a secured creditor under section 68 of <em>the Movable Property Security Rights Act</em> for the Plaintiff's wrongful act of selling the property without the knowledge and concurrence of the Bank and default by the Plaintiff.</p>
                            
                            <p>All the company's assets which are subject of both Agreements are in Nairobi but the Agreements were signed in Mombasa. The company's place of business is Kisumu whereas the Bank plies its trade in Machakos town.</p>
                            
                            <p>The Plaint filed by the company reads as follows:</p>

                                    <li>The Plaintiff is a limited liability company duly incorporated under the relevant provisions of <em>the Companies Act</em>, No.17 of 2015 currently carrying out its business within Kisumu County. The Plaintiff's address for service for purposes of this suit is care of Messrs Wakili Advocates LLP, Mawakili Centre, 5th Floor, New Wing, P.O. Box 304 - 00100, Nairobi; email info@wakilillp.com.</li>
                                    <li>The Defendant is a limited liability company currently providing banking services within the meaning of <em>the Banking Act</em>, Cap 488 of the Laws of Kenya.</li>
                                    <li>The Plaintiff avers that on 14.3.2023 it executed two Debenture Agreements with the Defendant in respect of various machineries owned by the Plaintiff.</li>
                                    <li>The Plaintiff further avers that pursuant to the Debenture Agreements the Defendant Bank extended credit facilities to the Plaintiff for a collective sum of KSh. 61,000,000/=.</li>
                                    <li>The Plaintiff hastens to add that one Debenture Agreement was specific in respect of a refinery machine known as Grand Mortar, Serial Number 111wi976 valued at KSh. 45,000,000/= owned by the Plaintiff whereas the other Debenture Agreement was general for any other property/machinery owned by the Plaintiff but not specifically mentioned in the Specific Debenture Agreement.</li>
                                    <li>Clause 7 of both agreements stipulated that the principal sum was repayable within one year plus profits with a monthly installment of KSh. 10,000,000/= to cover for both profits and interest.</li>
                                    <li>It was also understanding of the parties that the two Debenture Agreements be subject to the provisions of <em>the Movable Property Security Rights Act</em>.</li>
                                    <li>The Plaintiff states that it has honored its obligation under the Debenture Agreements and it does not owe the Defendant any sums under the Agreements.</li>
                                    <li>To the Plaintiff's utter dismay, the Defendant has without any justification whatsoever purported to schedule a public auction of the Plaintiff's assets on 20.2.2024.</li>
                                    <li>The Plaintiff is apprehensive that the Defendant will proceed with the impugned auction unless the Honorable court intervenes.</li>
                                    <li>The Plaintiff served the Defendant with a letter of demand prior to this action but the Defendant ignored thereby rendering this suit necessary.</li>
                                    <li>There is no suit pending between the Plaintiff and the Defendant over the subject matter and there has never been such civil action determined between the two parties.</li>
                                    <li>This court has jurisdiction to entertain the suit.</li>

                                <p>a) A declaration that the Plaintiff is not indebted to the Defendant under the two Debenture Agreements executed on 14.3.2023.</p>
                                <p>b) An order of permanent injunction restraining the Defendant from selling the Plaintiff's assets on 20.2.2024 or any other subsequent public auction.</p>

                            <p>Hassan Mjanja sought the services of Alpha & Omega Advocates LLP to represent him in a breach of contract claim against Mpyaro Moses. The matter was filed in court on January 1, 2016. The hearing of the case was concluded on April 23, 2023. The damages sought in the claim were Ksh. 10 million. Soon after the close of the defence case and the filing of the closing submissions as directed by the court, Hassan Mjanja got his son Wakili Kurutu, a lawyer in his own right, to file a notice of change of advocates taking over the conduct of the matter from Alpha & Omega Advocates LLP. Alpha & Omega Advocates LLP filed a Bill of Costs against Hassan Mjanja. The same has been taxed at Ksh. 5.2 million out of which Ksh. 5 million is in respect of instruction fees. Hassan Mjanja has filed a reference from the decision of the taxing master challenging only one aspect of the taxation, that is, the instruction fees awarded.</p>

                            <p>The University Statutes provide that no student can be expelled or suspended for any reason without a disciplinary hearing in writing of any allegations made against him or her. The statutes further provide that the reasons for the intended suspension or expulsion against the student and that the student must be given an opportunity to show cause in writing before any disciplinary hearing can take place. The Statutes also provide for a procedure of appeal against the decision of the Disciplinary Committee to the University Senate.</p>
                            
                            <p>David has written to the University Senate complaining that his suspension is against the University Statutes and has requested the Senate to intervene and follow the due process but he has not received any response. The Vice-Chancellor who is the Chair of the Senate has refused to call for an urgent Senate meeting to deliberate on the matter in view of the fact that David will miss his end of semester examinations. David is frustrated because he seems to have no option within the University administration in which his grievances will be handled. He has approached a firm of advocates who have filed an application seeking leave to commence judicial review proceedings in the nature of certiorari against the University to bring to the court for purposes of quashing the decision contained in the letter dated 15th December and an order that the leave sought do operate as a stay of the said decision in order to enable him to sit for his end of semester examinations.</p>

In 2020, a dispute arose concerning the amount due for the services rendered. Top Security PLC is claiming a sum of Kshs 39,509,610/=. After exchange of several correspondences over the matter Top Security PLC withdrew its services and filed a suit claiming the sum of Kshs 39,509,610/=.</p>
                            
                            <p>Ubora Bank PLC filed a defence and denied owing the amount due on the ground inter alia that there is in existence wrangles and disputes amongst the Plaintiff's directors and as such the defendant should not be held liable for the payment of any money. The court has held the case management conference and has certified the matter ready for hearing. The parties are not able to take a hearing date for hearing of the main suit because the court's diary for the year is full. One of the Plaintiff's directors has come across a letter written by the Defendant's legal officer admitting that the amount claimed in the plaint is indeed due to the Plaintiff. The Plaintiff is desirous of obtaining judgment without waiting for the matter to go for full trial.</p>

                            <p>Hon. Hakimu Matata was recently seized of a civil dispute at Kato Chief Magistrate's Court. The subject matter was a material damage claim pitting Konda Koko as the Plaintiff (the suit was brought on his behalf by his insurers, Good Premiums Insurance Limited under the doctrine of subrogation) and Dereva Mlevi as the Defendant. Through the Plaintiff, the insurance company had sought KSh. 2,500,000/= in the plaint as recompense for costs of replacing their insured's motor vehicle registration number KDP 111X which had been completely damaged due to a road accident that occurred on 2nd February, 2023 along Nyeri Nairobi Highway.</p>
                            
                            <p>At the end of the trial, the magistrate rendered himself on 5th February 2024, thus:</p>
                            
                            <p><em>"JUDGMENT<br>This matter is rather straightforward and is as clear as the sun.<br>The Plaintiff did not prove the case beyond reasonable doubt.<br>suit is dismissed with costs.<br>That's all for now. Bye everyone."</em></p>
                            
                            <p>The insurance company is aggrieved by the decision. They fault the judgment for being so casual and not reasoned at all. They also contend that Dereva Mlevi, the driver of motor vehicle registration number KTH 356G was at the time of the accident negligent and extremely drunk in a manner that he could not control the vehicle and there is the infamous <em>alco blow</em> evidence as well as the conclusion on Dereva Mlevi's state at the material time to that effect in the police abstract filed in court.</p>
                            
                            <p>Your law firm was recently enlisted in the panel of lawyers of the insurance company owing to your prowess and unrivaled success in road accident claims. The file containing the judgment and the pleadings has been handed over to you from the insurance's previous Advocates so that you proceed and challenge the judgment.</p>
                            
                            <p>(a) Write a concise legal opinion to the insurance company on the timelines to be observed for the envisaged appeal to succeed, the relevant pleading to be filed, and how the judgment may be challenged based on the structure of the <em>Civil Procedure Act</em> and the appurtenant <em>Rules</em>. <strong>(6 Marks)</strong></p>
