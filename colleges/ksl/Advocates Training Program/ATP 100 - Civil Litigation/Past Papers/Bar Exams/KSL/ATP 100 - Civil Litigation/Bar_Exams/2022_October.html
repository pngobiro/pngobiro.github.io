One of the associates in the firm has instructed you to take instructions from Joseph Ngolu of P.O. Box 39-90100 Machakos. On 16th August 2018, Joseph gave you the following instructions:</p>
                            
                            <div style="background-color: #f8f9fa; padding: 1.5rem; border-left: 4px solid #4a5568; margin: 1rem 0;">
                                <p>"In July 1987, Joseph purchased all that parcel of land known as <u>Nairobi Block 17/68</u> from Samuel Joe of P.O. Box 389-00100 Thika at a purchase price of Kshs. 20,950,000/=. By then, Samuel did not have title to the land but was in possession of a letter of allotment. The total purchase price was deposited with Ndimo & Company Advocates in terms of an agreement dated 26th July 1987. The advocates paid Samuel a sum of Kshs. 15,445,000/= on the same day. The balance of the purchase price was to be released to Samuel upon him procuring the title and consent to transfer the land from the Commissioner of Lands within a period of six months from the date of the agreement.</p>
                                
                                <p>Joseph took possession immediately upon execution of the agreement, fenced the property and deposited building materials worth Kshs. 5,000,000/= and has since been in occupation. Joseph never got title to the land. Ndimo & Co. Advocates paid the balance of the purchase price to Samuel despite the fact that no consent had been obtained. Joseph followed up the matter and found that a sum of Kshs. 29,000/= being arrears of land rent, had not been paid. Joseph paid the said amount and the Title was prepared and forwarded to Ndimo & Co. Advocates. The advocate prepared a Transfer of the land but Samuel refused to sign it.</p>
                                
                                <p>On 2nd May 1995, Joseph placed a caution on the property to safeguard his interest. Samuel passed away in May 2000. His wife Lucy Joe obtained a Grant of Letters of Administration in January 2004. She has now threatened to forcefully evict Joseph from the parcel of land."</p>

                            <p>Peter Bowen filed a suit against David Brown in the Environment and Land Court in Nairobi claiming a beneficial interest in all that parcel of land known as L.R. no 87745. Before filing the suit, he had conducted a search which revealed that David Brown was the <u>registered proprietor</u>. David filed a defence denying that he was the registered proprietor of the said parcel of land. Peter conducted another search at the Lands Registry which revealed that the earlier search he obtained had a typographical error in that the property was described as L.R no 87745 instead of L.R no 87754. Upon inquiring from the Land Registrar why there was a discrepancy in the two searches, the Registrar confirmed that the earlier search had a mistake because of misfiling of the green cards. The new search also revealed that all that parcel of land known as L.R no 87754 is registered in the name of David Brown and Jane Brown.</p>
                            
                            <p>Peter has filed an application seeking to amend his plaint to reflect the correct position. His application is based on the ground that the search he had obtained earlier made him believe that the correct property was L.R no 87745 which was registered in the name of David Brown. After being served with the defence, he did another search which revealed that the correct number was L.R no 87754 and the land was registered in the name of David Brown and Jane Brown.</p>
                            
                            <p>David has opposed the application on the ground that the application is as an abuse of the process of the court and that Peter has never occupied the suit land. He stated that Peter is a land grabber who has filed many cases claiming adverse possession, hence his application should be disallowed.</p>

                            <p>On 26th June 2022, the taxing master heard the objection, dismissed it and proceeded to tax the bill in the sum of Kshs. 350,000/=.

                            <p>Maurice Williamson of P.O. Box 95657-00200 Nairobi and 17 others were employed by Carole Limited of P.O. Box 28877-00100, a government parastatal, in various capacities. The initial employment was on casual terms for diverse periods, of two or three months. In 2008, upon lapsing of the term the 18 workers continued in the employment of the company without any interruption. The workers were members of the National Social Security Fund as <u>permanent staff</u> and the company made deductions from their pay and remitted the contributions to the Fund on their behalf.</p>
                            
                            <p>The Company required the workers, who had acquired permanent status, to convert their status to casual status by demanding that they sign letters of employment on casual terms of service. In September, 2022 after long periods of non-payment, the Company offered to pay the workers part of their <u>unpaid salaries as full and final</u> payment up to the date of the payment. Upon acknowledging the payment, the Company would offer the workers contracts converting their employment status from permanent to casual. The conversion would be subject to the following conditions: that the conversion would be for an <u>unspecified period not exceeding three months</u> from the date of commencement; the wages would be determined at a <u>daily rate</u>; the workers which their services <u>would be terminated</u>; the workers would not have any other claims against the company apart from wages and that the employment on casual basis did not guarantee confirmation to employment on permanent basis. The workers, who considered themselves permanent employees, rejected the conversion of their employment contracts.</p>
                            
                            <p>The Company involved Police Officers to force the workers to sign and accept the conversion contracts or get evicted from the houses provided by the company. Subsequently, the Company locked out the workers from 1.10.2022.</p>
                            
                            <p>The workers contend that their rights protected by Articles 10, 41, and 232 of the Constitution have been violated and are keen in seeking legal redress against the said violation.</p>

                            <p>On 17th June 2022, the Employment and Labour Relations Court awarded Jane Marsi a sum of Kshs. 1,974,531/= against Tapso PLC. On 30th June 2022, her advocates presented a decree to court <u>without notice to the respondent's advocate</u>. The Deputy Registrar of the Court signed the decree as drawn since it was in agreement with the judgement. On 20th July 2022, her advocates having received the signed and sealed decree applied for execution <u>without ascertaining the costs payable to her</u>. The warrants of attachment and sale were issued to Chota Auctioneers who attached the respondent's properties on 30th July 2022.</p>
                            
                            <p>On 5th August 2022, the respondent's advocates filed an application under certificate of urgency seeking <u>stay of execution</u> of the decree and review of the judgement and decree. The respondents relied on the grounds that they were not given any notice before the decree was extracted and that they have discovered that the claimant had <u>been advanced a loan</u> while she was an employee of the respondent and an amount of Kshs. 356,200/= was still outstanding among other grounds. The application was placed before the judge who declined to grant any interim orders but certified it as urgent and directed that it be served forthwith for hearing <em>Inter Partes</em> on 20th August 2022.</p>

                            <p>In 1980, Peter Happiness was registered as the <u>absolute proprietor</u> of all that parcel of land known as <u>Kajiado Block 4/30120</u>. John Hopkin instituted LDT Case No. 20 of 2008 at the Kajiado Land Disputes Tribunal claiming ownership of the said parcel of land. On 27th November 2009, the decision of the Kajiado Land Dispute Tribunal in LDT Case No. 20 of 2008 which was read on 18th March 2009 was adopted as a judgment of the court in Kajiado Chief Magistrate Court Misc Civil Application No. 45 of 2009 and a decree was issued. In May 2010, John wrote to Peter and enclosed transfer forms which he requested Peter to sign in default of which he would make an application seeking to have an officer of the court to sign on his behalf.</p>
                            
                            <p>Peter did not sign the forms, instead, having been granted leave on 15th July 2010, he filed an application in the <u>High Court at Kajiado</u> on 19th July 2010 seeking an order of <em>certiorari</em> to <u>remove into this court for purposes of quashing the proceedings</u> and decision of the Kajiado Land Dispute Tribunal in LDT Case No. 20 of 2008 read on 18th March 2009 and adopted as a judgement of the Court on 27th November 2009 in Kajiado Chief Magistrate Court Misc Civil Application No. 45 of 2009.</p>
                            
                            <p>The grounds in support of the application are that the Tribunal exceeded its jurisdiction in ordering Peter to transfer the suit property to John and that there was no decision capable of being adopted by the Court.</p>
                            
                            <p>The application is opposed on the grounds that the <em>ex-parte</em> applicant submitted himself to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal and never raised any objection; that leave to commence these proceedings was obtained outside the statutory period; and that the claim before the Tribunal was that of working and occupying land.</p>
                            
                            <p>You have been instructed by the <em>ex-parte</em> applicant to act for him. With the aid of decided cases and statutory provisions, prepare submissions on the orders sought and the legal issues raised that will be used to argue the application. <strong>(10 marks)</strong></p>
