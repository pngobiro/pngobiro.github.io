                            <p>There is an application that has been filed by the plaintiff for an order to compel the defendant to produce for inspection by the plaintiff. This is for the purpose of proving that the defendant obtained a valid title of LR.No.1/2019 Umoja before transferring the same to the Plaintiff failure to which the defence filed be dismissed and judgement be entered for plaintiff against defendant.</p>
                            
                            <p>The reasons for the application is that the defendant failed to respond to a notice to produce documents for inspection whilst the documents are essential for determination of crucial issues in dispute between parties.</p>
                            
                            <p>The plaintiff argued that the defendant did not have good title to the suit property and did not therefore pass a good title to the plaintiff. There is a consent to transfer that had purportedly been issued and according to the plaintiff the consent had irregularly been issued since the suit property had already been declared a national monument. Therefore, it was necessary for the plaintiff to inspect any document the defendant could be holding.</p>
                            
                            <p>The notice served upon the defendant requiring production of documents described the documents to be:</p>
                            <p><em>"the documents to prove the valid title of LR No.1/2019 acquired by the Defendant."</em></p>
                            
                            <p>(a) As an advocate retained by the defendant/respondent, write a brief showing your argument before court requiring the notice for inspection to be dismissed. <strong>(6 marks)</strong></p>

                            <p>As an associate in the firm of Y & Co. Advocates which has been retained by Jane listed as a plaintiff, the following are case notes you have made from a file you are handling:</p>
                            
                            <ol>
                                <li>It is a divorce case. A plaint has already been filed. The plaintiffs listed are namely, Jane, the wife and Jane's mother, Elizabeth. The defendants are listed as Joseph, the husband and Mary the one who is allegedly 'destroying' the marriage.</li>
                                <li>There is also a verifying affidavit which was filed together with the plaint.</li>
                                <li>The plaint contained a brief narration of romantic escapades the defendant had with his lover.</li>
                                <li>There is a paragraph in the plaint that contains a text message that details an arrangement of one of the escapades.</li>
                                <li>The affidavit of service shows that the plaint had been served on the watchman of the residence of the defendant. The defendant had nonetheless entered appearance.</li>
                                <li>The plaint was amended long after the defence had been filed thus after 2 months, there being no pleading filed after the defence. You do not see any court attendance for the period the pleadings were amended.</li>
                            </ol>
                            
                            <p>After the filing of the plaint in Court you learn that you have made fatal mistakes in the process of drafting which would eventually compromise your client's suit.</p>
                            
                            <p>You therefore decide to take corrective measures to cure the anomalies and file the amended plaint before close of pleadings.</p>
                            
                            <p>Proceed and amend the plaint. <strong>(10 marks)</strong></p>
