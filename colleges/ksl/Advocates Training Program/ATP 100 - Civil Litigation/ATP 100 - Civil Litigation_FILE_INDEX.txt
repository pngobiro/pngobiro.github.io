Impacts of the Overriding Objective Principle The just determination of proceedings The overriding objective principle seeks to ensure that justice is served to both parties. Where there is a conflict of the Overriding Objective Principle with the substantive law, the law ought to be interpreted in such a manner as to ensure justice is administered. The application of the overriding objective principle does not operate to uproot established principles and procedures of law but to embolden the court to be guided by a broader sense of justice and fairness In the case of Harit Sheth T/A Harit Sheth Advocate vs. Shamas Charania [2010] eklr the Court of Appeal held inter alia that the principal aims of the provisions of sections 1A and 1B of the Civil Procedure Act and sections 3A and 3B of the Appellate Jurisdiction Act include “the need to act justly in every situation; the need to have regard to the principle of proportionality and the need to create a level playing ground for all the parties coming before the courts by ensuring that the principle of equality of arms is maintained and that as far as it is practicable to place the parties on equal footing”. The efficient disposal of the business of the Court As stated in the case of Caltex Oil Limited Vs Evanson Wanjihia, the principal aim of the overriding objective principle is to give the court greater latitude to overcome any past technicalities which might hinder the attainment of the overriding objective.

As rule 1.1 makes clear the (rules) is a new procedural code with the overriding objective of enabling the court to deal with cases justly. The problem with the position prior to the introduction of the (rules) was that often the court had to take draconian steps such as striking out the proceedings….” Introduction • 2010 Civil Procedure Act and Rules Amendments. • COA in Judicial Review 2 of 2017 Republic –vs- National Government Constituency Development Fund Board & another (2017) eKLR, “The double O’s in the phrase Overriding Objectives are what coined what is today famously known as the term Oxygen P

Overview of the Civil Litigation Process This guidebook gives you an overview of the different levels of courts in BC, as well as an overview of the civil litigation process. You should also read the guidebook, Alternatives to Going to Court, because it may be possible for you to resolve your legal dispute without going to court. Courts in British Columbia The court system in British Columbia has three levels: Provincial Court: The lower level trial court, which deals with Small Claims up to $35,000, family, youth criminal offenders, criminal, and traffic matters. Supreme Court: The higher level trial court. The Supreme Court also hears appeals from the Provincial Court, and sometimes reviews the decisions of certain provincial tribunals and public decision-making bodies. Court of Appeal: The province’s highest court. This court hears appeals from the Supreme Court. Appeals from the BC Court of Appeal go to the Supreme Court of Canada. For example, the Federal Court can hear cases about disputes between provinces and territories, taxation issues, or cases involving federal Crown corporations (e.g., the Post Office). Appeals from the Federal Court go to the Federal Court of Appeal, then to the Supreme Court of Canada. The Supreme Court of Canada, located in Ottawa, is the highest-level court in Canada. It hears appeals from every court of appeal in the provinces and territories across Canada, the Federal Court of Appeal, and the Court Martial Appeal Court. There is no appeal f

It is advisable to file a formal notice of objection on a point of law, file it and serve it on the opponent, this is meant to notify them on the point of law you intend to raise….‘Take notice that the defendant intends to raise an objection on a point of law’Where matters touch on jurisdiction they must be heard as a preliminary matter before anything elseObjections could be validity of a custom, questions of jurisdiction of a court, whether a conversation was privileged, etc. Raising an objection on law is a preliminary issue and where sustained it should have the effect of having the suit struck out or dismissed at that point. Confession and AvoidanceWhere the defendant decides to confess and avoid, this means that he admits the facts subject to some facts, which adversely affect the claim. Traverse or DenyTraversing is an express contradiction of an allegation of fact in an opponent’s pleadings. One uses words which have been used in the opponent’s pleadings but turn them into the negative. When one is traversing one should not attack the prayers or the reliefs that the opponent is seeking. One should also not plead to matters that have not been alleged. One should not attempt a pre-emptive attack, confine your traverse to matters which have been alleged against you. Traversing must only be on matters that have been alleged and every allegation of fact unless it is traversed is deemed to be admitted.

KWANZA We refer to the above matter and the demand letter by yourselves dated 16th February 2023. We act for the respondent in this matter – Mr. Kwanza (hereinafter referred to as our client) under whose instructions we address you hereunder and state as follows: That your client was a woman known unto our client for sometime but whose questionable character and seedy history led to a falling out between the two. That your client was involved in an amorous and sexual relationship with a party called Brian, a fact she meticulously hid from our client and apparently from you. This relationship began after our client fell out with her and coincided with the birth of her child. The stated Mr. Brian is the father of your client’s child, a matter well known to your client and which can be easily ascertained by having a DNA test. She trapped our client and falsefully led him to believe the child was his. Our client bears no responsibility whatsoever for your client’s child or present woes and is therefore aggrieved by the demands sent to him. Furthermore, he is aggrieved by the cantankerous and crude manner to which your c

Trial Advocacy Assignment, Firm 9D, 2010 Client Interview & Counseling Client Interview 1. The purposes and scope of client interviews (a) To form an advocate-client relationship. (b) To learn the client’s goals. (c) To learn as much as the client knows about the facts of the issue. (d) To reduce the client’s anxiety without being unrealistic. 2. How to conduct a client interview 2.1 Preparation • It is advisable that there be some form of communication before the interview between the client and the advocate to enable the advocate form an idea of what the case is about. Granted, there will be instances where this is not possible, say in a criminal case where the client is already in custody or even in a civil case where the client is in need of an immediate remedy to safeguard their interest such as an injunction. • This communication can take the form of a phone-call or even a short visit with the client. The idea here is to get a rough outline of what the case involves and help the advocate prepare for the substantive interview. It will help the advocate identify the relevant law that applies to the client’s case and get any other information that may be necessary to present to the client at the interview. • At this stage, it is important for the advocate to remember that people generally do not like advocates and that the only reason why they do approach advocates is that they cannot help themselves. He must thus make a conscious decision to be as forthcoming, honest and

CLIENT INTERVIEWING How to interview your clients so they’ll keep coming back for more J. Melissa Woods Assistant Public Defender Mecklenburg County (704) 365-4767 woodsjm@co.mecklenburg.nc.us There are FOUR basic components of a good client interview A. Information Gathering Information gathering is the most important aspect of the client interview, but it’s the type of information you get and how you go about gathering it that counts. This includes more than work information and family support. 1. The information you get could be the difference between your client being found guilty and not guilty. a. Ask open-ended questions. Instead of: do you have children? Why not: tell me about your family.) b. Ask the same questions in different ways (and more than once) c. Give your client some opportunity to tell you his/her story in their own way. 2. Go into each interview knowing the basic information you have to get from your client a. have in interview sheet or checklist (see attachment A) b. don’t be afraid to deviate from the “script.” 3. Present the information in a way that is helpful to your client. And even though you could sum up your client’s life in 30 seconds, doesn’t mean you should. B. Forming relationship with client Whether you it’s for fifteen minutes or over several months, at soon as that case is assigned to you a relationship has begun. How successful that relationship will be is largely up to you. 1. Talk to your client not at him/her 1 2. Establishing trust a

Bogus Crankshaft is an expatriate in the motor vehicle engineering sector in the Republic of Kenya having served in such reputable companies as Gari Fake Enterprises Ltd, Kichwa Tembo Tele Motor Clinic Ltd and now Gari Mutumba Motors Ltd. His country of origin is Germany. He is reputable to be particularly savvy with German models of motor vehicles. He is therefore known among many of the country’s political and economic elite who are the popular market of these brands of motor vehicles. His employers have historically regarded him highly and his current salary is Ksh. 2,450,000.00 per month. Over Christmas vacation he was driving his top of the range vehicle registration number KCZ 001A for the festivities. This time round, his family and him had been booked for a two week vacation at an exclusive resort known as Munyonyo in Eastern Uganda. As they approached Gilgil, a lorry loaded with construction material suffered a brake failure. It, therefore, rolled back into the car he was driving causing it such damage that the car was only described in the reports of motor vehicle assessment specialists as a write off. Due to what Crackshaft describes to you as modern wonders on the road, his wife and children suffered no harm whatsoever. Crankshaft himself lost both his lower limps and all the fingers on both of his hands. He was flown to Germany for ultra modern medical care and within one month he had recovered albeit with the disabuility of lack of limps and fingers. Such medica

DEMAND LETTERFIRM 13 Subsequent to the original letter of demand, the debtor requests to be allowed to make payment of the demanded sum by installments and these are accepted, then it is permissible to add the advocates costs to the principal sum owing and to make the total sum payable by those installments.However, this must be done at the time of accepting the proposal of payment by installments. The Law Society of Kenya Digest of Professional Conduct and Etiquette in Paragraph 19(b) provides:FIRM 13 “ There is no objection to requiring a debtor to pay the creditor’s advocate’s costs of collection in consideration of an agreement to accept payment of the debt by installments if that condition is imposed at the time of the acceptance of the proposals.”The fact that the creditor’s solicitor’s remuneration is brought up in the agreement subsequent to the demand letter for the debtor to pay in installment is permissible because fresh consideration is being given by the creditor for adding those costs to the principal amount.Debtors disregarding demand letters or seeking to delay by offering installments will find the they have assumed an unexpectedly heavy burden, through the addition of the creditor’s advocates costs.FIRM 13 WHAT IS THE SITUATION IF THE DEBTOR DOES PAY THE CREDITOR BEFORE THE HEARING?Rule 53 of the Advocates (Remuneration) Order provides that if the plaintiff in any action has not given the defendant notice of his intention to sue and the defendant pays the am

LECTURE 1CLIENT INTERVIEW Another example would be where there is a legal problem such as a landlord tenant or debt problem that can be easily addressed legally, but it is apparent that the underlying issue for the client is substance abuse or dependence. In both of these situations, the advocate would be wise to address any legal problem in the usual manner, and then to address the underlying problem. (d) What if the real problem is not legal?On occasion, an advocate will encounter a client who either does not have a true “legal” problem or who has other overwhelming non-legal problems that must be addressed. The stereotypical situation is where a client has a minor legal problem such as a traffic ticket, or a dispute with a neighbor, and it is apparent to the advocate that the “real” underlying problem is that the client needs professional counseling or therapy. Before obtaining crucial information from a client, it is sometimes imperative that an advocate deals with some underlying issues that may be related to or isolated from the issue in question. The question that weighs on the advocate’s mind is how far one can go in dealing with these underlying issues. How far can one counsel?To understand the scope of counseling, on needs to look at the common and practical problems and challenges in practice. (c) The scope of counselingAn experienced legal counselor uses different counseling styles as appropriate and sets up a relaxing and trusting environment early on. A good leg

KENYA SCHOOL OF LAW 2023/24 ACADEMIC YEAR CIVIL LITIGATION ATP 100 TOPIC: JURISDICTION CLASS B FIRM 14 ASSIGNMENT DATED ….. 27TH ……. DAY OF ……….. FEBRUARY …… 2023 While a court may be clothed with jurisdiction, the extent of that jurisdiction may be limited in various ways. Discuss. Introduction Jurisdiction is simply the competence of a court of law to adjudicate over a claim. The term is derived from the Latin phrase ‘jus dicere’ which means to declare the law. Jurisdiction is the legal right to exercise lawful authority in decision making on questions of law and fact. Nyarangi JA (as he then was) in the landmark Court of Appeal case of the Owners of the Motor Vessel “Lillian S” Vs Caltex Oil (Kenya) Ltd [1989] eKLR equated jurisdiction to everything and cautioned courts of law to down their tools on any matter, which in their wisdom they are without jurisdiction. Limitation on Jurisdiction In this section, it is our averment that while a court may be clothed with jurisdiction, the extent of that jurisdiction may be limited in various ways. We shall define limitation on jurisdiction as the statutory, doctrinal and/or constitutional limitations which may render a court incompetent to resolve a dispute. The High Court in Samuel Kamau Macharia & another v Kenya Commercial Bank Ltd & 2 Others (2012) eKLR conceded with the definition of jurisdictional limitation, by finding that its authority only flows from the constitution or legislation. Consequently, a court of law cannot pu

ATP- 100 JURISDICTION Caroline Oduor 28TH FEB. 2023 Definition Owners of the Motor Vessel “Lillian S” vs. Caltex Oil (Kenya) Ltd [1989] eKLR: • “By jurisdiction is meant the authority which a court has to decide matters that are litigated before it or to take cognisance of matters presented in a formal way for its decision. The limits of this authority are imposed by the statute, charter, or commission under which the court is constituted, and may be extended or restricted by the like means. Definition • Black's Law Dictionary, 8th Edition defines jurisdiction as: • “… the power of the court to decide a matter in controversy and presupposes the existence of a duly constituted court with control over the subject matter and the parties … the power of courts to inquire into facts, apply the law, make decisions and declare judgment; The legal rights by which judges exercise their authority.” Scope and source of Jurisdiction • A five-Judge bench of this Court in the case of Law Society of Kenya v Centre for Human Rights and Democracy & 13 others [2013] eKLR also stated of jurisdiction thus: • "The scope of the exercise of any court’s jurisdiction in Kenya is dictated by Section 3 of the Judicature Act which provides that: Judicature Act 3. Mode of exercise of jurisdiction (1)The jurisdiction of the Supreme Court, the Court of Appeal, the High Court, the Environment and Land Court, the Employment and Labour Relations Court and of all subordinate courts shall be exercised in conform

While a court may be clothed with jurisdiction, the extent of that jurisdiction may be limited in various ways. Discuss. Introduction Jurisdiction is simply the competence of a court of law to adjudicate over a claim. The term is derived from the Latin phrase ‘jus dicere’ which means to declare the law. Jurisdiction is the legal right to exercise lawful authority in decision making on questions of law and fact. Nyarangi JA (as he then was) in the landmark Court of Appeal case of the Owners of the Motor Vessel “Lillian S” Vs Caltex Oil (Kenya) Ltd [1989] eKLR equated jurisdiction to everything and cautioned courts of law to down their tools on any matter, which in their wisdom they are without jurisdiction. Limitation on Jurisdiction In this section, it is our averment that while a court may be clothed with jurisdiction, the extent of that jurisdiction may be limited in various ways. We shall define limitation on jurisdiction as the statutory, doctrinal and/or constitutional limitations which may render a court incompetent to resolve a dispute.

CapacityYou also need to make certain that the parties named in the plaint have capacity, or the legal right, to sue, or be sued. Children and incompetents do not have the capacity to pursue their own lawsuits. Unless a general guardian has been appointed, the court will appoint a special person, referred to as a guardian ad litem, to pursue the case on behalf of the minor or incompetent. Self reflectionThe Constitution guarantees the right to institute court proceedings claiming that a right or fundamental freedom in the Bill of Rights has been denied, violated or infringed, or is threatened. (Art.22(1))Further, it guarantees the right to institute those proceedings on behalf of a group or class of persons(Art.22(2)(b)) and in the interest of the public. (Art.22(2)(c)) Generally, the court also orders that all class members who can be identified should get individual notice, where practicable. Included in the notice to all potential members of the class is usually an explanation that any potential class member can request in writing that he or she be excluded from the class. If a member does not request exclusion, that class member will be bound by any judgment in the case.(Order 1, rule 8(2)) To maintain a representative suit, the party filing the lawsuit must usually get permission from the court to proceed with the action.If the court grants permission, it will also direct that all members of that class being represented get notice of the action.

Even though the plaintiff was the first person to commence the litigation, it may happen that the defendant also has some claim against the plaintiffUsually the option is that the defendant will have a choice either to institute a separate suit or set up their claim in the defenceIf the court finds that the defendant’s claim can be determined within the same suit without delay, inconvenience or prejudice to justice, then the court will allow it E.g., Suppose the bank sues you over a debt, the bank will be the plaintiff over you. Suppose the Bank overcharged in calculations? You can counterclaim on the overchargingWhere a party, not a party to the suit, is included in a counter claim they shall be summoned to appear by being served with a copy of the defence as under the rules of service of summons (O7, r9)The party shall enter an appearanc

It is only to be used for the reasonable protection of the interests of the defendant.If you fail to furnish security to the satisfaction of court and the other party, then your case will be dismissed. Arrest before judgmentGenerally, the rule is that a creditor having a claim against the debtor has first to obtain a decree before they can execute against the debtor. But there are other special circumstances one may be able to apply for arrest of the person before judgment. For e.g. if a person is planning to leave the jurisdiction of the court with the intent to abscond liability and defeat justice. Temporary InjunctionAn injunction is an auxiliary relief whereby a party is required to

Trial StageLECTURE 17: THE PARTIES’ DAY IN COURT Under Order 11, Rule 5(2), parties to a suit are required to prepare and exchange a Settlement Conference Brief which should include and is not limited to expert reports and the relevant portions of documents relied upon.It therefore means that either party can introduce their individual experts, but if there is a dispute as to the reliability of an expert witness, the court will settle for a neutral expert to testify in court.Under Section 48 of the Evidence Act, where the court has to form its opinion on a particular matter, the court may seek the opinion of persons specially skilled in that area known as “experts”. In the case of Nyaribo Nyankomba v. Mary Bonarere Munge [2010] eKLR, it was held that in customary law cases, it is necessary for experts versed in the particular customs be summoned to testify so as to assist the court in reaching a fair verdict, since the court itself is not well versed in those customs and traditions. In the absence of such expert testimony, there can only be one conclusion: such claim remains unproved. The Kenyan justice system greatly encourages parties to address themselves to the principle of settling matters out of court because doing so will deliver justice in the shortest time possible so allowing parties to move on with their lives there after.It also becomes expensive when parties decide to litigate, as this attracts court fees as well as advocates’ charges.

The taxation thereof and the taxation of costs as between party and party in contentious matters both in the High Court and the subordinate court (other than Islamic courts) falls here. The taxation of costs in the High Court is undertaken by the Taxing Officer defined under Paragraph 10 of the ARO, while in the subordinate courts it is the duty of the magistrate. Scope of the assessment of Bill of Costs at the Magistrates’ courtsThe Black’s Law Dictionary defines “Taxation of Costs” as follows:“The process of fixing the amount of litigation-related expenses that a prevailing party is entitled to be awarded.” On the other hand, the same dictionary defines assessment of costs as follows:“To evaluate or estimate the nature, value or quality…….to set the value of a tax, fine etc for a person at a specified level.” “Determination of the rate or amount of something (costs in this instance) – imposition of something (costs) e.g. fines…….” The Oxford English Dictionary defines “taxation of costs” as follows:“To examine and assess the costs of a case.” The same dictionary (Oxford) defines ‘assessment’ as follows:“To evaluate or estimate the nature, value or quality…….to set the value of a tax, fine etc for a person at a specified level.” In the High Court’s determination of costs payable has always been referred to as taxa

Attachment O.22 r.36-50Attachment of immovable propertyWhere the property to be attached is agricultural produce, you attach the property by affixing a warrant of attachment in the field where the property is growing or where it is stored or where the JD resides or works for gain. If it involves share of dividend in a company issue a prohibitory order against the person in whose name the share is registered. The Order prohibits the transfer of the share or receipt of any dividend on that share. If the property is moveable in possession of a 3rd Party, attachment is with prohibition order against 3rd party. What about immovable property? Usually you can execute by removing the judgment debtor from that property and putting the decree holder in possession. Sometimes delivery of property can be symbolic. It does not always have to be physical and actual possession.For both movable and immovable property, you can attach and sell, where the execution order empowers the decree holder the power to attach and sell the property.

The principle of avoidance entails that a Court will not determine a constitutional issue, when a matter may properly be decided on another basis”. Determining Constitutional issue for litigation In Uhuru Muigai Kenyatta vs Nairobi Star (2013)eKLR) petitioner alleged that the respondent had published statements that defamed his character. A preliminary objection was raised, inter alia, that the remedy of the petitioner lay in the tort of defamation which could be canvassed in an ordinary civil suit. The court upheld the objection and dismissed the petition. Lenaola J (as he then was) stated as follows :“Turning now to the second issue, it is obvious that princ

WHAT CONSTITUTES A SUBSTANTIAL QUESTION OF LAW UNDER ARTICLE 165(4) OF THE CONSTITUTION? Article 165(4) of the Constitution provides that the High Court shall have jurisdiction to hear and determine any matter certified by the court as raising a substantial question of law under clauses 3(b) and (d). The Chief Justice is mandated to empanel an uneven number of judges, being not less than three, to hear and determine the matter. Neither does the constitution provide an interpretation of what precisely constitutes a ‘substantial question of law’ nor does it enumerate the specific circumstances where the court should certify a matter as such. It is incumbent upon the individual judge to satisfy themselves that the matter is substantial to warrant its reference to the Chief Justice for empanelment of a bench to determine the matter. The earliest authority on what constitutes a substantial question of law is to be found in the Indian Supreme Court decision in the case of Chunilal V. Mehta vs Century Spinning and Manufacturing Co. AIR 1962 SC 1314. The court held that A substantial question of law is one which is of general public importance or which directly and substantially affects the rights of the parties and which have not been finally settled by the Supreme Court, the Privy Council or the Federal Court or which is not free from difficulty or which calls for discussion of alternative views.

JUDICIAL REVIEW Objectives  Analyze the procedures for judicial review  Establish the remedies available under judicial review process  Critique the documents in the process  Investigate the procedure of service of the process  Execute the judicial review application What is judicial review? • Process where Courts have powers to control or review functions and procedures of administrative authorities & bodies discharging their functions Joyce Cherop Kaspandoy & 609 others v Kenya Power and Lighting Company [2019] eKLR, Justice Mativo described Justice review as; “Judicial Review in this sense means the power to scrutinize laws and executive acts, the power to test their conformity with the Constitution and the power to strike them down if they are found to be inconsistent with the Constitution…” JR literally means revision of the decree or decision of an inferior court or tribunal or other quasi judicial administrative body by a superior court. Courts of law have the power to test the validity of legislative as well as other action by public or private bodies. Theory of Judicial Review • Judicial review is a way in which courts enforce the rule of law. Ensuring that functions of public authorities are undertaken within the law. That public authorities operate within and not above the law. • Ultra viles. Courts ensure that public bodies do not exceed powers given to them by the legislature. • The Court as the guardian of the law. Theory Of Judicial Review Cont • Can court

Discuss. INTRODUCTION Jurisdiction is defined in Halsbury’s Laws of England as “…the authority which a Court has to decide matters that are litigated before it or to take cognizance of matters presented in a formal way for decision.”. Black’s Law Dictionary, defines jurisdiction as the Court’s power to entertain, hear and determine a dispute before it. John Beecroft Saunders defines jurisdiction as follows: By jurisdiction is meant the authority which a Court has to decide matters that are litigated before it or to take cognisance of matters presented in a formal way for its decision. The limits of this authority are imposed by the statute, charter or commission under which the Court is constituted, and may be extended or restricted by like means. If no restriction or limit is imposed, the jurisdiction is said to be unlimited. A limitation may be either as to the kind and nature of the actions and matters of which the particular Court has cognisance or

CIVIL PROCEDURE PROCEDURE AND RULES THAT GOVERN PROCEEDING Assuming the defendant has been served and opted not to defend the plaintiff may apply for judgment in default of defence. One has to find out whether they are entitled to final or interlocutory judgment both of which have different procedures. Assuming Defendant chooses to defend the action – a defence is filed. If the defence is filed and served one has to decide whether to make an application. Decision depends on cause of action if it is in the sphere of Order 36 one can apply for summary judgment which applies in only some cases. This is a short cut – the court has right to make orders. If not under Order 36 if one thinks what is filed does not constitute a defence one may want to terminate the proceedings under Order 2 Rule 15 in favor of their client i.e. if the suit is frivolous. These are two ways of bringing to an end the proceedings without a trial. When one wants to demand for information to help them make their mind, or wants matters clarified to determine the next step to take. To preserve the subject matter of litigation pending trial, you don’t want judgment or to strike out the defence, for this purpose one requires an injunction to preserve the subject matter. Order 39 or 40. At this stage one has to make their minds which application to make these interlocutory proceedings. Fixing your suit for trial has another series of steps i.e. summoning witnesses, knowingwhether there is a procedure in adjournm

b) Whether Mpenda Kesi can appeal to the Supreme Court on the decision of the Court of Appeal? The Supreme Court Act states that appeals to the Supreme Court (SC) shall be heard only with the leave of the Court.However, an exception on seeking leave to appeal has been placed on appeals from the Court of Appeal in respect of matters relating to the interpretation or application of the Constitution. Mpenda Kesi was dissatisfied with the verdict delivered by the Court of Appeal upholding High Court decision on sale by the bank. He therefore sought to appeal the Court of Appeal’s decision to the Supreme Court which can either uphold or overturn the decision. Mpenda Kesi’s appeal is not in respect of matters relating to the interpretation or application of the constitution and therefore falls within the appeals stipulated under Section 15(1) of the Supreme Court Act No. 7 of 2011. Having sought leave to appeal from both the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court and denied by both courts, Mpenda Kesi has no further action. In conclusion, Mpenda Kesi cannot appeal to the Supreme Court. Whether Mpenda Kesi can file a Judicial Review Application before the High Court? The Constitution of Kenya establishes and vests jurisdiction to the High Court to hear and determine judicial review applications. This jurisdiction of the High Court is “supervisory jurisdiction over subordinate courts and over any person, body or authority exercising a judicial or quasi-judicial function but not over a

3(a) The Constitution of Kenya under Art. 165(3)(a) provides that the high court shall have unlimited original jurisdiction over civil and criminal matters. It also has jurisdiction in determining matters regarding the question as to whether a right or fundamental freedom stipulated in the Bill of Rights has been violated, denied or otherwise infringed upon. In Joyce Jerop Kaspandoy & 609 others vs Kenya power and lighting company [2019] eKLR, judicial review was described as “the power to scrutinize and executive aids, the power to test their conformity with the constitution and the power to strike them down if they are found to be inconsistent with the constitution…” In literal terms, judicial review refers to the revision of a decree or judgement of an inferior court, tribunal or other quasi-judicial administrative by a superior court. The Civil procedure rules Order 53, rule 3 provides that upon the granting of leave to apply for judicial review, the applicant has 21 days to motion the high court for the same. 3(b) The right to fair administrative action is provided for under article 47 of the constitution of Kenya. It stipulates that the process should be expeditious, efficient, lawful, reasonable and procedurally fair. It also provides that a person who is adversely affected by an administrative action has the right to be given reasons in writing for the actions The principles of natural justice requires that every party to a case be a reasonable time to present their c

Firm 1 Class G Civil Litigation General Public Importance This is a matter whose consequences have a bearing on the public interest. Black's Law Dictionary 'Anything with a public interest' is anything that is of concern to the general public or community. Essentials of Matters of General Public Importance The principles of matters of General Public Importance are set out in Hermanus Phillipus Steyn v Giovanni Gnecchi-Ruscone. Malcolm Bell v. Hon. Daniel Toroitich arap Moi and Another expounds the principles set out in the Hermanus case. The essential elements include: Essentials of Matters of General Public Importance The appellant must satisfy the court that the issue to be canvassed on appeal is one that its determination transcends the circumstances of the specific case and has a significant bearing on the public interest. The situation of seeking certification that raises a point of law, the intending appellants must demonstrate that such a point is substantial, and its determination will have significant ramification on the public interest. Essentials of Matters of General Public Importance Such questions of law must have arisen in the court or courts below, and must have been the subject of judicial determination. Where the application for certification has been occasioned by a state of uncertainty in the law arising from contradictory precedents, the Supreme Court may either resolve the uncertainty as it may determine, or refer the matter to the Court of Appeal for it
