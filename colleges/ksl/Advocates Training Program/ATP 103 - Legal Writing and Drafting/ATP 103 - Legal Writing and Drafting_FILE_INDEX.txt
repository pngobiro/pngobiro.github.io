CAB MEMO NO:……………………….. COPY NO:…………………….. CABINET MEMORANDUM ON THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE POLICE CIVILIAN OVERSIGHT BOARD. Purpose The purpose of this Memorandum is to brief the Cabinet on the need to encourage the development of a culture of human rights, integrity and accountability within the police force; promote good working relationship between the police and the public; promote good working conditions and policies in the police force and other disciplined forces; establish a police oversight agency and the encouragement of good policing in a democratic society through the establishment of a police civilian oversight body. The overall goal therefore is to— developing a legal framework that enhances internal and external police accountability in a democratic society; build a sense of confidence in the public that police work is fair, even-handed, and free of bias; and build a sense of confidence in the police force that complains against the police officers and their welfare will be treated fairly and without prejudice. Background and Justification Police Civilian Oversight Board Bill, 2008 put forward has been under consideration for some time. From 1997 there has been a desire to hold the Kenya Police and other disciplined forces accountable to the people. The Police have been viewed as an authority on itself with a deep seated culture of impunity among the police and other disciplined forces. The culture is not only in the police but even within the police force where

TO: THE HEAD OF LITIGATION DEPARTMENT FROM: THE LITIGATION PUPIL RE: LEGAL OPINION FOR COMPANY LIMITED DATE: 30TH MAY 2011 ISSUES Are the emissions being released by Mobil a visible atmospheric contaminant as envisaged by the Act? Does the smoke exceed the 20% opacity for more than 3 minutes in any 24hours as provided under the Act? Have the emissions diminished as claimed by Mobil? THE STATEMENT OF FACTS The opinion seeks to establish whether the emissions being released by Mobil are a visible atmospheric contaminant. We also seek to establish whether the emissions exceed that which is provided for under the Federal Clean Air Act. DISCUSSION ISSUE 1.1 Section 33 of the Federal Clean Air Act prohibits the discharge of visible atmospheric contaminants. The residents complained of intermittent but strong oduors from the plant’s emissions. This implies that the emissions were not visible. ISSUE 1.2 The section further provides that the emissions should have a density of more than 20% opacity for more than 3 minutes in any 24 hours. Determining density is a scientific and technological issue which cannot be determined merely by the strength of oduors. ISSUE 1.3 The residents claim that they suffered damages in excess of 10,000 dollars each. If they suffered damages at all, this is an allegation that needs to be specifically proved. ISSUE 1.4 Mobil claims that the emissions have diminished . This is also an issue that would need to be determined scientifically. The company has hir

Mr. Kerongo was contracted by our client as a Programme Co-ordinator from 1st January to 31st December 2007. Contracted as an employee, Mr. Kerongo’s contract was renewable by our client depending on how well Mr.Kerongo performed his responsibilities. On the 3oth of April 2008, our client wrote to Mr. Bwombwongi and duly informed him that his contract of employment was not up for renewal. Mr. Bwombongi through his lawyers, Wakili Mkali and Co. Advocates, then wrote to our client claiming compensation for wrongful termination of Mr. Bwombwongi’s contract of employment. The events that led up to non renewal of the contract are as follows: Mr. Bwombwongi was employed by our client to undertake certain responsibilities as the Programme Co-ordinator. These responsibilities included writing monthly project proposals for funding our client’s activities and preparation of regular reports on project activities and expenditure for submission to donors. Mr. Bwombwongi was also required to prepare monthly progress reports and submit the same to our client’s Executive Director. On the 18th of March 2008, the Executive Director wrote to Mr. Bwombwongi requesting him to submit the regular reports on project activities which were outstanding for three months. On the 28th of April 2008, Mr. Bwombongi replied and submitted the reports to the Executive Director.

FORMS OF BUSINESS ASSOCIATIONS Explain the distinction between societies, partnerships, companies registered under the Companies (Act Cap 486) and statutory corporations. What are unincorporated associations and why are they so called? The Governor of Moto County has recently reshuffled his County Executive Committee (Cashnet) after realizing that his County is not making good progress in attracting new investments. This follows the receipt of a report whose finding, among others, concluded that the people of Moto desire to take greater control of the market opportunities rather than have their Country Government try its hands in business. The report also identified the need for a better policy and regulatory environment for business and commercial transactions. In response, the Governor and his cabinet have decided to establish a business registration centre.

Introduction to Public Private Contracts Public Private Contracts are long term contractual arrangements involving the public and private sector. They are usually legally binding and the parties agree to share responsibilities relating to implementation, operation and management of a project. However, each partner brings in expertise that meets clearly defined public needs through appropriate allocation of resources, risks, rewards and responsibilities. This definition has been loosely adopted in the Kenyan context.Indeed, presently in Kenya there is no substantive legislation that deals with public-private agreements. There are however different kinds of legislations that loosely try to deal with these types of contracts key among them being the Public Procurement and disposal act, which provides for the procurement procedures and the Privatization Act which has a couple of sections that try to define these relationships and also details their benefits to the public at large. Purpose and Types of Public Private Contracts Public-private agreements are often entered into to cater for the provision of infrastructure in a country. This has been necessitated because of the shift to market based economies and thus governments prefer to enter into such contracts for strategic reasons such as to enhance: Availability of additional resources to meet the increasing needs of investment in infrastructure services. Increased efficiency in project delivery and operation. Access to advance

Some of these restraints are; hitherto cessation of movement into and out of some counties, quarantine, travel restrictions, business closures, lockouts, work stoppage and nationwide curfew. Many parties to contracts will need to find ways of mitigating loss and ensuring continuity of operations so as to meet their contractual obligations. Consequentially there is a possibility that contracts entered by parties may become impossible to perform resulting to breach of contracts. T
