ETHICS AND THE LEGAL PROFESSION – Mark Humphries (Mark Humphries has 25 years’ experience of contentious legal practice. Until recently a litigation partner and head of advocacy at Linklaters in London, he is now the director of his own commercial disputes firm Mark Humphries Ltd. He is a past chairman of the Solicitors Association of Higher Court Advocates) The origins of legal ethics An act of professional misconduct is committed by a lawyer who does something which is 'dishonourable to him as a man and dishonourable in his profession' – Re G Mayor Cooke [1889] 5 TLR 407. If the ethical principles to which a lawyer should adhere were capable of being encapsulated in this single notion, there would be little more to say about ethics and this course may not be necessary to conduct. Certain basic standards of professional behaviour do exist. These has been regarded as sacrosanct for so long that they may be as relevant in the 21st century as they were when they were first identified in medieval times. When the legal profession first emerged during the reign of Edward I in the late 13th century it may perhaps have been clear enough to say merely that a lawyer must behave with 'honour'; it may even have been clear enough in the 19th century. But those were times when honourable conduct was, to a greater or lesser degree, perhaps easier to identify than is the case when dealing with the complexities of the practice of law today. Such are the intricacies of the modern world that i

ATP 105 Professional Ethics - 2023 LECTURE 1 - INTRODUCTION Course Instructor – Stephen Mallowah LLB, LLM, MSc ETHICS, THE HEART AND SOUL OF THE LEGAL PROFESSION ▪ The public needs protection from the unqualified lawyer, the unethical lawyer, the incompetent lawyer, the irresponsible lawyer, the fraudulent lawyer – a lawyer of no character, of no repute: a deficient lawyer. ▪ Similarly, for the integrity and reputation of the Bar, the legal fraternity too needs to be distanced from such a lawyer. Do We Need to Teach/ Learn Ethics? ▪ Some scholars and jurists, for example the American judge and scholar Richard Posner have questioned the utility of teaching legal ethics. According to Judge Posner “as for the task of instilling ethics in law students […] I can think of few things more futile than teaching people to be good.” They argue that no course that teaches legal ethics will make law students good people or ethical lawyers. ▪ However, there is a need to develop an awareness of ethical issues and capacity to navigate ethical and professional challenges. ▪ An advocate’s capacity to meet these challenges is grounded in cognizance of the relevant ethical rules, awareness of broader moral and ethical concerns, and familiarity with functional techniques and strategies that enable advocates to avoid ethical pitfalls and work through inevitable ethical challenges. ▪ However, mere knowledge and techniques are not enough. An advocate must also have the character and integrity that w

1 Introduction: Values in Practice Introduction: Ethics and Lawyering C A S E S T U D Y 1.1 The Jewish QC and the Alleged Nazi War Criminal In early 2001, newspapers reported that a leading Melbourne criminal barrister and civil rights advocate had been asked to represent suspected war criminal Konrad Kalejs in a hearing to determine whether Kalejs should be extradited to Latvia to face charges over the deaths of tens of thousands of Jews and others during World War II. The relevant barrister was a Queens Counsel and was also prominent in the Jewish community, a former president of Liberty Victoria (a civil rights organisation) and well known for representing a variety of high-profile criminal accused including Julian Knight (in his trial for the Hoddle Street massacre), John Elliott (who was cleared of corporate fraud), and members of Hells Angels. The barrister was, reportedly, born in 1946 in Russia. His parents fled to Germany when he was six weeks old and later settled in Israel. They migrated from there to Australia in 1959. In 1997 he ‘was quoted as telling The Herald Sun that elderly Jews living in Melbourne would be having sleepless nights knowing Mr Kalejs was walking free in Melbourne’.1 Mr Kalejs was 87 at the time of the extradition proceedings. He denied the allegation that he had served as an officer in a death squad within a Latvian war camp where an estimated 20,000 to 30,000 Jews, Gypsies, Red Army soldiers and others were executed, or died of starvation or

The arrival of this book on the legal landscape, therefore, is a most welcome tool in the armoury of teaching the budding lawyers of this region 2; and instructing afresh the veteran practitioners of the law.  LLB University of East Africa, Dar es Salaam, Tanzania; LLM Columbia University, New York, USA; International Diploma in Restorative Justice, Queens University, Ontario, Canada; Principal Judge (Emeritus) of Uganda; Lord Justice, COMESA Court of Justice, Lusaka, Zambia; Justice of Appeal, East African Court of Justice, Arusha, Tanzania; Adjunct Professor of International Monetary & Banking Law, American University, Washington D.C., USA; Special Lecturer, International Law Institute-Centre, for Legal Excellence, Kampala, Uganda; Chairman Judicial Service Commission of Uganda Author: Songs of Paradise, an anthology of poetry [World Alive Publishers, Nairobi (2009)]. 2 Given the advanced integration effort in the East African Community (Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania, Rwanda and Burundi), cross-border legal practice ─ not to mention legal practice before the East African Court of Justice (temporarily hosted in Arusha, Tanz

CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF APPEALS OF WEST VIRGINIA No. 08–22. Argued March 3, 2009—Decided June 8, 2009 After a West Virginia jury found respondents, a coal company and its affiliates (hereinafter Massey), liable for fraudulent misrepresentation, concealment, and tortious interference with existing contractual relations and awarded petitioners (hereinafter Caperton) $50 million in damages, West Virginia held its 2004 judicial elections. Knowing the State Supreme Court of Appeals would consider the appeal, Don Blankenship, Massey’s chairman and principal officer, supported Brent Benjamin rather than the incumbent justice seeking reelection. His $3 million in contributions exceeded the total amount spent by all other Benjamin supporters and by Benjamin’s own committee. Benjamin won by fewer than 50,000 votes. Before Massey filed its appeal, Caperton moved to disqualify now-Justice Benjamin under the Due Process Clause and the State’s Code of Judicial Conduct, based o

Durish 1997 154 DLR 4th 158 it was observed:"The nature of a solicitor's general retaining lien has more than once been authoritatively stated. It is a right at common law depending on implied agreement.It has not the character of an encumbrance or equitable charge. It is merely passive and possessory, that is to say, the solicitor has no right of actively enforcing his demand. It confers on advocate merely the right to withhold possession of the documents or other personal property of his client or former client." 28I Richard v. Platel (1841) 5 Jur 835, as cited in HALSBURY’S LAWS OF ENGLAND Vol 44 (1), 4th edn.

ATP 105 PROFESSIONAL ETHICS AND PRACTICE COURSE INSTRUCTOR: Mr. Oriri Onyango Statement of Course Description, Objectives and Assessment Description A legal ecosystem (the Bar, Bench, Prosecution, State Law Office and the Academia) that is a stalwart of integrity is critical for the existence of a self-guarding democracy that is strongly rooted within the rule of law. Such a legal profession ensures that constitutionalism, justice, and the dignity of all citizens is respected and zealously upheld. This Course seeks to give students a practical perspective and understanding of the high ethical standards demanded and exercised in the legal profession. The course will expose students to the ethical and legal framework governing the conduct of legal professionals. Objectives At the end of the course, the students should be able to appreciate the theoretical and philosophical underpinnings of professional ethics. Additionally, the learners should exhibit a practical appreciation of professional ethics in the advancement of justice, the rule of law, and constitutionalism. It is expected that the students will also be well placed to trace the historical development and evolution of various laws, regulations, policies, and codes governing professional ethics. The course will also equip you with a concrete understanding of the modes of enforcement of the laws, regulations, and codes on professional ethics and practice. The students should also be able to assess the efficacy of profess
