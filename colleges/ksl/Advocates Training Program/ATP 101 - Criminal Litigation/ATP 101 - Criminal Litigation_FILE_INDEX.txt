CRIMINAL LITIGATION Course Instructor: Justice Benjamin Kubo MATERIAL; Penal Code Evidence Act Criminal Procedure Code The Constitution of Kenya Sexual Offences Act Anti-corruption INTRODUCTION What is criminal litigation? This is the process of enforcing substantive criminal law. Chapter IV of the Penal code This chapter, from s 7 to s 19 covers the general rules of criminal responsibility. Article 50 of the constitution contains the provision on the presumption of innocence. Basic elements of the criminal responsibility:Mensrea and actusreus. 1. Case Example: D accidentally discharges a gun and kills V. if D, not realizing that he has already killed V then decides to kill him, and shoots the corpse, can D be held criminally liable for murder of V? Thabo Meli v The Queen [1954] 1 ALL ER 373 [Contemporaneity of mensrea and actusreus applies to actions as a whole - coincidence of actusreus and mensrea actusreus 'continuing act principle'] D and accomplices took V to a hut and beat him over the head intending to kill him. They rolled his body over a cliff to make the death appear accidental. In fact, the victim survived both the beating and the fall from the cliff, but died from exposure shortly afterwards. Held: Actus and mens were present throughout; no need to separate them, there was a causal link. Where the actusreus consists of a series of linked acts, it is enough that the mensrea existed at some time during that series, even if not necessarily at the time of the particu

CRIMINAL PROCEDURE & PRACTICE Lecture 3 12.2.03 ARREST Arrest with a Warrant: Warrants of arrest are issued to secure the attendance of a person in court. Whether in criminal or civil cases it will be issued to compel attendance. In criminal procedure, the procedure is chiefly applied in cases where proceedings are commenced by first laying a charge in court or by the filing of a private complaint in court. In this case you start with a charge and then issue a warrant of arrest but in arrest without warrant you start with arrest and then file a complaint in court. The charge may be laid by a police officer or a private prosecutor. Under Section 90 of the CPC, upon receiving the charge or complaint the court may either issue summons or a warrant of arrest. That depends purely on the circumstances if it is a fairly serious charge the court should issue a warrant for the arrest. A proviso to Section 90 further provides that a warrant is not to be issued unless the complaint is made on oath. A complaint on oath is more authentic that one which is not on oath i.e. it has more force in law because if the statements contained on oath are false the swearer of the oath exposes himself to certain liabilities, severe consequences are likely to ensue coz that would amount to perjury or lying on oath. As a private prosecutor if you intend that the person named in the complaint is to be arrested, then the complaint must be under oath. A warrant may be even be issued to a person who has alr

ARREST. Question A What is an arrest? According to the Black’s Law dictionary, an arrest can be defined as follows; “ the taking or keeping of a person in custody by legal authority especially in response to a criminal charge; the apprehension of someone for the purpose of securing the administration of the law, especially of bringing that person before a court”. However, the Criminal Procedure Code doesn’t define what an arrest is. In the case of Hussein Vs Chang Fook Lord Devlin stated that an arrest occurs:- When a police officer states the terms that he is arresting, or When an officer uses force to restrain the individual concerned; or When by words or conduct the officer makes it clear that he will use force if necessary to restrain the individual from going where he wants to go. An arrest can be effected in either two ways. These are:- arrest with a warrant arrest without a warrant. Arrest with a warrant This occurs when criminal proceedings are commenced by a police officer or a public prosecutor first laying a charge in court or by private complaint, it becomes necessary to secure the appearance in court of an accused person by issuing a warrant for his arrest. The court may then issue a warrant for the arrest of the person against whom the charge has been preferred. Similarly, a warrant of arrest will be issued by the court for witnesses who have been bonded but fail to turn up to give evidence, and for accused persons who have jumped bail or absconded. It is mostly

ARRESTS WHAT IS AN ARREST, WHO MAY AFFECT IT AND HOW IS IT TO BE EFFECTED FOR IT TO BE CONSIDERED AS VALID? It is in the nature of persons who have committed or are suspected to have committed offences to seek to evade the criminal justice system where they can be tried and found guilty which consequently leads to an imprisonment or fine. It is with regards to the above that the concept of arrests came into existence so that such persons may be apprehended, restrained and brought before a Court in accordance with the law. An arrest is an actual, physical restraint on the liberty of a person who has or has been accused of committing a crime. The Criminal Procedure Code (CPC) does not define an arrest. Section 21 only explains how an arrest is conducted. We thus resort to case law as in Hussein v Chang Fook (1970) 2 WLR 441 where Lord Devlin stated that an arrest occurs: 1. When a police officer states in terms that he is arresting; or 2. When an officer uses force to restrain the individual concerned; or 3. When by words or conduct the officer makes it clear that he will use force if necessary to restrain the individual from going where he wants to go; but 4. It does not occur where he stops an individual to make inquiries. However, section 2 of The National Police Service Act defines “arrest” to mean ‘the act of apprehending a person for suspected commission of an offence or by the action of legal authority.’ In some circumstances it is not necessary to inform the arrested pe

Formatted: Font: Bold PREPARATION OF CASE FILES A file is a folder that holds loose papers together for organization and protection. File folders usually consist of a sheet of heavy paper stock or other thin, but stiff, material which is folded in half, and are used to keep paper documents. They are often used in conjunction with a filing cabinet for storage. Successful practitioners (prosecutors and counsels) need to have the ability to think on their feet, muster the art of persuasive talking and impress by their charisma. Mastery of these skills give practitioners confidence. However one has to effectively prepare for the task of representation for them to exude the kind of confidence expected of a practitioner. Preparation will entail knowing the facts of the case thoroughly, considering the potential relevance of all the facts in their legal context, considering possible responses to any point made, planning and thinking through arguments beforehand. Having gone through this, the practitioner can deliver a convincing address while addressing all the relevant questions that may arise. For effective preparation, the prosecution/defence has to maintain a file that must have basic documentation. PREPARATION AND CONTENTS OF THE POLICE/PROSECUTION FILE Preparation and compilation of police files is governed by The Force Standing Orders.

IDENTIFICATION PARADE Definition The Black’s Law dictionary defines an identification parade as; ‘A police identification procedure in which a criminal suspect and other physically similar persons are shown to the victim or a witness to determine whether the suspect can be identified as the perpetrator of the crime.’ The Concise Oxford dictionary defines an identification parade as; ‘An assembly of persons from whom a suspect is to be identified.’ The Collins English dictionary defines it as; ‘A group of persons including one suspect of having committed a crime assembled for the purpose of discovering whether a witness can identify the suspect.’ Importance of an identification parade It is carried out to test the veracity of a witness’s assertion that the accused was at the scene of a crime (Paul Thuo Mburu& another v Republic1) but this goes hand in hand with other evidence.2 An identification parade is usually carried out because visual identification has its difficulties. The court is mainly concerned with the accuracy of visual identification. This is because people at times mistakenly and honestly think they have seen a suspect at the crime scene. An example is identification by people of different racial groups of people from another racial group which poses a problem to the party with the burden of identifying. Its purpose is to enable eye witnesses to identify the suspect whom they allegedly saw. The failure to hold the identification parade weakens the evidential val

It was found that one count charged 3 separate offences i.e. shop breaking contrary to section 306(a) of the penal code, handling stolen goods contrary to section 322 of the penal code. It was forth held that each offence should be set out in a different count.The charge of handling stolen property is in the alternative.In Bhatt v R71, The appellant was charged with being in possession of obscene material, contrary to section 181(a) of the penal code. It was alleged that the appellant for the purpose of or by way of trade for the purpose of distribution or public exhibition had in his possession 37 photographs of an obscene nature which could tend to corrupt the morals of any person etc. Section 172 talks of alternative purposes.It was held that (on appeal) the particular motive why the appellant had the photos should have been averred to the purposes. It was wrong for the charge to refer to many purposes. The averment of several purposes made the charge barred for duplicity.

ONLINE INSTRUCTION COMPLAINT AND CHARGEDR. OMOSA MOGAMBI NTABOCLASS A, CLASS C AND CLASS E. INTRODUCTIONIn criminal cases, proceedings commence by way of indictment or charge being filed.The formal document is usually referred to as charge in the subordinate courts whereas indictment refers to the form of charge in the High court. The CPC refers to these as charge and information.WHAT IS A CHARGE?A charge refers to a formal written accusation or complaint against a person (the accused) for an offence known in law. The offence must be provided for in law . It is drawn by a magistrate or a police officer and signed as required by law. Since criminal cases are usually for and on behalf of the Republic, the state is the party to institute the case; namely through prosecutors or state counsels. Therefore, the title reads as Republic v.

By way of making a complaint; 2. by the production in magistrate court of a person who has been arrested without a warrant. COMPLAINT Any person affected by the conduct of another may make a complaint to a magistrate having jurisdiction. Under section 89(3) the complaint may either be oral or written. Oral – it should be reduced into writing by the magistrate. This helps illiterate people who cannot write an affidavit on oath. Thereafter the magistrate should sight the same. Under section 89(4) the magistrate upon receiving the complaint should draw up or cause to be drawn up a formal charge based n the information given by the complainant. Magistrate may refuse to admit the complaint or formal charge drawn up if the same does not disclose any offence, He must give reasons for refusing to admit a complaint. These proceedings are in chambers and are not in open court. The process of commencing proceedings is not commonly used in private prosecutions.

CRIMINAL LITIGATION COMPLAINT AND CHARGE Introduction In most criminal cases, proceedings commence at this stage i.e. by way of indictment or charge. The formal document is usually referred to as charge in the subordinate courts whereas information refers to the form of charge in the High court. The CPC refers to these as charge and information. What is a charge? A charge refers to a formal written accusation or complaint against a person (the accused) for an offence known in law. The offence must be provided for in law. It is drawn by a magistrate or a police officer and signed as required by law. Since criminal cases are usually for and on behalf of the Republic, the state is the party to institute the case; namely through prosecutors or state counsels. Therefore the title reads as REPUBLIC V. ACCUSED What is the purpose of the formal charge (rules?) The Golden Rule is that the charge sheet should inform the accused person in clear and unmistakable terms of the allegations against him; in order for him to be able to prepare his defense. This rule is part of the wider requirement of affording an accused person a fair trial. Therefore in Nashon Marenya V. Republic the court emphasized on the need for the charge to be clear and unequivocal as a way of avoiding confusion as to what the accused must meet. The court further was emphatic that such a confusion cannot be said not to lead to a miscarriage of justice. In the words of Todd J; “Charges and particulars should be clearly

FIRM 2A BAIL AND BOND BAIL Definition Bail is an agreement between the accused (and his sureties as the case may be) and the court that the accused will pay a certain sum of money fixed by the court should he fail to attend his trial. It is the release of a person from legal custody, therefore it presupposes (to require something if you are to do something) that the person is in custody. Objects of Bail To shield the individual from pre-trial incarceration. To minimize the interference with an accused person’s freedom. To avoid anticipatory punishment before conviction and sentence. To give force to the presumption of innocence i.e. an accused person should not be punished for an offence for which he has not yet been convicted. The Law relating to Bail in Kenya Bail is non-penal in character. Neither the amount determined for bail nor the refusal of bail may be influenced by punitive notions. The law relating to bail is founded on the Criminal Procedure Code (CPC), Cap 75 of the Laws of Kenya and the Constitution. In the Constitution, bail is provided for under section 72, i.e. the right to individual liberty. However, this right is not absolute. The fundamental principle is that a person should not be deprived of his liberty except for a distinct breach of law. If there is no substantial risk of the accused fleeing the course of justice, there is no reason why he should be imprisoned during the period of his trial. A person may be arrested and his liberty curtailed by a Poli

CRIMINAL LITIGATION ASSIGNMENT What is Bail/Bond, its general objective and contribution to criminal justice? According to the Black’s Law Dictionary, Bail is an action which results in the release of an accused person from custody with the undertaking that he shall appear at the time and place designed and submit himself to the jurisdiction and judgment of the Court. Douglas Brown defines Bail as an agreement between the accused (and his sureties as the case may be) and the court and that the accused will pay a certain sum of money fixed by the court should he fail to attend his trial. In the case of Uganda v Lawrence Luzinda Okello J as he then was noted: “Bail is an agreement between the Court and an applicant consisting of a bond, with or without a surety for a reason+able amounts as the circumstances of the case permit conditioned upon the applicant appearing before such a Court on the date and time as named in the bond to start his trial” . In Denis Obua Otima v Uganda, Hon Justice Remmy Kasule in his ruling defined bail as the essential security given to Court by another person, known as surety that the accused will attend trial on the day appointed for the trial. It also includes an amount of money or property which must be deposited by an accused with the Court in order to be released from custody, failure of which results in the forfeiture of the recognizance and the immediate arrest and committal to prison should the said accused person default in appearing.

Conditions to be fulfilled before plea negotiationsThe plea agreement shall be entered into after the accused person has been charged, or at any time before judgment. (s.137A(3))The prosecutor must consult the police officer investigating the case. (137D)Unless circumstances do not permit, the prosecutor must consult the victim/complainant or their representative. Bargaining phaseOne of the party makes an offer and the responds either by making a counter offer or acceptance.Consider the following:What are the objectives of the negotiation? What is agreed? What is in dispute? Negotiation doesn’t always yield results but just because it doesn’t, doesn’t mean it has been wasted. Its progress. What concessions can I make? What can’t I give up? Think of BATNA (Best Alternative To Negotiated Agreement). Don’t issue a threat unless you can act on it. As a strategy, its not a good thing to reveal your BATNA unless its absolutely necessary and only in measured levels. Planning phaseConsider the following:What are my client’s objectives?

Mr. Kauka explained to Mr. Kano that he was at the main factory gate and that there were about four visitors who included Mr. Atoti Supa the Honourable Minister for Labour and Manpower Development of the Republic of Kenya. The Minister’s personal assistant, a Mr. Kacheke, explained to Mr. Kauka that in fulfillment of their Political Party Leader’s election pledge to supervise factories and in readiness for the up coming Labour Day celebrations, the Minister had decided to visit their premises to assess their workers’ working conditions and examine their payroll to satisfy himself that Twit To Ltd complied with all their statutory obligations. Mr. Kano authorized the factory security to let the Minister and his entourage into the factory premises whereupon he would conduct them on a factory tour.

Ndubi (RM) prefers an appeal against the sentence and sets forth the following grounds of appeal. The learned magistrate erred in law and fact in convicting the appellant on a plea that was equivocal. The sentence was excessive considering all the circumstances of the case. The learned magistrate erred in law while exercising his discretion in sentencing for applying the wrong principle applicable to a first offender. The Learned Magistrate erred in law in convicting the accused on the unreliable evidence of the prosecution witnesses without evaluating it and making a finding on it. The Learned Magistrate erred in law in not considering the reasonable doubts available in the case against the appellant and erred in law in not giving the appellant the benefit of those doubts.

MARKING SCHEME NOVEMBER 2014 Question 1 i) ii) Procedure for Surrender under Extradition (Commonwealth Countries) Act Arrest of the fugitive First, the request for extradition shall be made to the Attorney General who shall forthwith give written authority to commence committal proceedings against the fugitive in writing. Apart from particulars of the fugitive and the facts and law relevant to the case, the requesting country must also attach to the request, an overseas warrant issued in that country or a certificate of conviction and sentence, and a statement of the amount, if any, of the sentence served, as the case may be. A magistrate may then proceed to issue a warrant for the arrest of the fugitive. However, a magistrate may also issue a provisional warrant of arrest without the authority to proceed from the Attorney General, where the fugitive is, or is believed to be in or on his way to Kenya, having been satisfied that the circumstances and evidence would merit issuance of the warrant in a similar offence against Kenyan law. In this case, the magistrate issuing the warrant is to give notice to the Attorney-General and transmit to him all evidence and information upon which the warrant was issued, and the Attorney-General may then issue an authority to proceed with committal proceedings or cancel the warrant and discharge the fugitive from custody if he has been arrested under the warrant. Proceedings for Committal Upon arrest, the fugitive shall be arraigned in a Res

CRIMINAL LITIGATION REVISION 2019/2020 CHAPTER 1: THE NATURE OF CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS 1. • • • • • INTRODUCTION Criminal Procedure and Practice concerns itself with the various stages and means by which persons who are alleged to have contravened the criminal law are dealt with or processed → concerned with the process rather than the substance of criminal law It defines the procedures and rules governing the judicial aspect of prevention, detection and punishment of crime Criminal procedure is public in nature as criminal law is a reflection of society’s attempts to deal with delicts, and so the process by which it does so is one in which the public generally have an interest It is also important to remember that the subjects of the criminal process (i.e. the alleged culprits or perpetrators of crime) are also members of the same society and are not bereft of rights The criminal procedure therefore gives rise to a competing interest: on one hand, there is the interest of the society, through the instrument of the state, to punish crime. On the other hand, there is the need to ensure the rights and inherent dignity of the offender are respected (the efficacy of our procedural law is determined by the manner in which it strikes a balance between them) 2. PLAYERS IN CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS 2.1 STATE AND THE ACCUSED • The main players to a criminal trial would be the State on one hand and the accused on the other – Republic v X • Therefore, even though individuals are often the wron

It is advisable to file a formal notice of objection on a point of law, file it and serve it on the opponent, this is meant to notify them on the point of law you intend to raise….‘Take notice that the defendant intends to raise an objection on a point of law’Where matters touch on jurisdiction they must be heard as a preliminary matter before anything elseObjections could be validity of a custom, questions of jurisdiction of a court, whether a conversation was privileged, etc. Raising an objection on law is a preliminary issue and where sustained it should have the effect of having the suit struck out or dismissed at that point. Confession and AvoidanceWhere the defendant decides to confess and avoid, this means that he admits the facts subject to some facts, which adversely affect the claim. Traverse or DenyTraversing is an express contradiction of an allegation of fact in an opponent’s pleadings. One uses words which have been used in the opponent’s pleadings but turn them into the negative. When one is traversing one should not attack the prayers or the reliefs that the opponent is seeking. One should also not plead to matters that have not been alleged. One should not attempt a pre-emptive attack, confine your traverse to matters which have been alleged against you. Traversing must only be on matters that have been alleged and every allegation of fact unless it is traversed is deemed to be admitted. Omnibus denial:…save as hereunder expressly admitted the defendant denie
