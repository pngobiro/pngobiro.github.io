The Council of Licensed Conveyancers in England and Wales on the other hand defines Conveyancing as “”. Both definitions may however be limiting as conveyancing involves more than just drafting and registering documents.Conveyancing may also involve a simple modification of title or even an involuntary transfer of an interest eg sale by a mortgagee. It may thus be more appropriate to define conveyancing as . The three critical ingredients are thus the process, the legal title and the transfer or modification. It is the generic term used to sum up the procedures used in disposal and/or acquisition of interest in real property. The process is what is basically referred to as Conveyancing practice or protocol – which refers to the branch of advocacy in real property transactions or the The legal title or interest to be transferred or modified must be legal in the strictest sense of the word. The transferee must be seized of a legal title. Consequently, protocol or process will demand that a Conveyancer investigates and ascertains that the title to be transferred or modified is legal. [Reflections: How expansive is the word “legal” in these respects?

CONVEYANCING by onguto INTRODUCTION - Conveyancing Rules - Reforms - Underlying Nature of Conveyancing o Is it jurisdictional? o Is it a private contract? The first theory is that it is a quasi-jurisdictional act. Section 23 of the Law of Contract Act. The second theory is that it is a private act (contractual) and the state has no law (right?) whatsoever to interfere. Conveyancing is a hybrid of both contracts and jurisdiction. It has everything to do with domestic law. There are mandatory rules that must be observed. Conveyancing is the transfer of an interest in property. Abbey & Richards definition – the process by which legal title to property is transferred. The word conveyancing derives its meaning from this very definition. It is basically to convey. Documents used to convey interest from one party to another. Conveyancing is the voluntary transfer of interest in property. However, there are instances where conveyances are compulsory. E.g. where a chargee or mortgagee is exercising its statutory power of sale, where by operation of the law, interest must be transferred to another party. Three critical elements of the definition:- 1. Process – All applications from the appointment of the estate agent to the time you actually get a duly registered title. 2. Legal Title interest being transferred – What is transferred must be legal. Qn: How do you ascertain legality of title in RLA documents? 3. Transfer – Voluntary transfer. You can also transfer title to yourself e.g i

COMPLETION WHAT IS COMPLETION? COMPLETION DATE AND PERIOD OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES/ADVOCATES POST COMPLETION Nature • Completion- the process where necessary documents of title are handed over in exchange for the price. • Sale agreement is an executory document and interest in the land has to be formally transferred by stamping and registering a transfer or conveyance • Prior to registration, the vendor expects to be paid consideration, while the purchaser expects to be given all the registrable documents. The process of exchange of consideration is called ‘completion’. Completion Date • Usually inserted in the contract • Both parties use this period to meet the their obligations in the contract – The purchaser puts together finances and further investigates the title. – Vendor obtains consents, clearances and removes encumbrances – Vendor holds the property in trust for the purchaser and must not allow it to waste • Completion takes place at the vendor’s advocates offices Completion Documents CLEARANCE CERTIFICATES • Types and their importance in Conveyancing • To which properties do they apply? • How to procure these clearances? • Challenges CONSENTS • Types and their importance in Conveyancing • To which properties do they apply? • How to procure these Consents? • Challenges Discussion What completion documents would you need in each of the assignment questions?

DOCUMENTS FOR: 1,2 AND 3 (AGREEMENTS FOR SALE) Introduction The LSK conditions for sale 2015 state that when a valid sale agreement has been prepared and executed, the step that follows is Completion (Condition 7). The sale agreement is merely executory and it gives no interest. It will only give you an interest when you are able to complete as the purchaser (Specific performance) and vendor (forfeiture). Openda v Khan – A sale agreement creates no interest over the property. For completion to take place the purchaser is to deliver the purchase price and the vendor is to deliver the completion documents. Completion documents mean the deeds and other documents that are necessary for the transfer of good title and as may be defined in the Agreement. Agreement 1 The following are the completion documents which will be required to complete the agreement for sale of agricultural land entered into between Sasha Banks (The “Vendor”) and Christopher Kamende (The “Purchaser”) Original title document for the property; Copies of the Vendor’s P.I.N. certificate and National Identity Card 3 coloured passport size photographs of the Vendor; Rent clearance certificate, if any; Rates clearance certificate, if any; Land Control Board Consent to Transfer; Spousal Consent Original title document for the property A land title document proves ownership and legal right over a piece of land.

Transfers Definition • Transfer? – See S2 LA- The passing of land, lease or a charge from one party to another by an act of the parties and not by operation of the law. It also includes the instrument that effects the passing • Conveyance/assignment? – Not defined by statute. Deed by which the owner of a freehold/leasehold property whose title is subject to the Deeds Registry transfers ownership. • What is a transmission? – S2 LA-the passing of land, lease or charge from one person to another by operation of law on death or insolvency or otherwise. Transfer • Use of prescribed forms – Sec 43 (2) of Land Act, Sec 37 LRA • Sec 37 LRA - If an Advocate chooses to use a form other than those prescribed, he must have them approved by the Registrar • Legal Notices No. 143-146 both parties to sign transfer • NB: a transfer does not operate as a transfer of land until the transferee is actually registered in the registry. Registration doesn’t merely record the instrument but passes rights of ownership to the Purchaser. • Upon registration: Land Registration Act – Certificate of Title (sec 26 (1) – Title Deed uses terminology of ‘absolute title’(applies to freeholds). – For long term leaseholds one is issued with a certificate of lease (sec 54 (5) • S43(2) LA- transfer to be effected by an instrument in the prescribed form • S43(3) LA- completion of transfer process only after registration • Land Registration (Gen) Regulations, 2017 No. 21 - Prescribed Form • S36 (1) LRA dealings in la

1. Sumantlal Chunilal Desai v Mrs. McFee and Mrs. Cooper t/a Rhobel (Desai v Cooper) (1950) 214 KLR 32 Civil case No. 85 of 1950 Summary of Facts The plaintiff’s brother was the lessee of the ground floor of the shop and he sub-let a portion of the shop to Mrs. Pearse in 1944. The front and back portion of the shop were separated by a wooden partition. By that agreement, Mrs. Pearse was authorised to have not more than six tailors at the back portion of the shop. The agreement provided the timelines when the front door would be open to allow them to access the back portion. In 1949, Mrs. Pearse sold her dress making business and assigned her interest in the portion of the shop to the defendants. However, at this point there were some alterations at the partitioning. The plaintiff also took over from his brother as the tenant for the whole shop. They entered into an agreement where the plaintiff took a small portion from the back portion of the shop occupied by the defendants and reduced the rent. The defendants use of their portion was restricted as there was only one way of getting into their portion of the shop (through the front door) which was occupied by the plaintiff. Issues for determination Whether the defendants are licensees or tenants or partly licensees and partly tenants of the portion of the premises they occupy. Analysis The court was of the view that it was the intention of the parties to create a lease in respect of the whole shop and a license in respect of
