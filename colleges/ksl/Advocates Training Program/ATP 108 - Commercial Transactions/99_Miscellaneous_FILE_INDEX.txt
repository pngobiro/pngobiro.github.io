(20 marks)This Photo by Unknown Author is licensed under CC BY-SA-NCThis Photo by Unknown Author is licensed under CC BY-SA IntroductionMergers in Kenya are regulated by various statutes and bodies. As such, there are legal requirements which the merging parties will have to consider in accordance with those statutes and regulator’s regulations. The structure of the merger deal is itself a great consideration since it may form part of the internal or economic determination of whether to merge in the first place. This group will therefore start by looking at the statutory provisions governing mergers and identify the legal and structural considerations arising from each. We will the conclude by discussing any other considerations particularly those touching on the structure of the deal itself.

Section 934 - the draft terms of the proposed merger to be prepared.Section 935 - a notice of the lodgement of the terms to the registrar be published in the Gazette at least a month before the shareholder’s a

Incorporation Companies (and limited liability partnerships) are formed via a formal process known as ‘incorporation’. The vast majority of companies are incorporated by registration, which involves registering certain documents with the Registrar of Companies at Sheria House. A company can do many things that a natural person can, including entering into contracts, owning property and commencing legal proceedings. In the vast majority of companies, the liability of the members will be limited. A company can be held liable for a civil wrong, or found guilty of committing a crime. A company has corporate personality, which means that, at law, it is a person. The courts can set aside a company’s corporate personality where statute so provides, or where a company is interposed in order to evade, or frustrate the enforcement of, a legal obligation. Introduction Sole proprietorships and ordinary partnerships can be brought into existence very easily and with minimal state involvement. Conversely, companies (and LLPs) are brought into existence at the discretion of the state via a formal process known as ‘incorporation’. The word ‘incorporation’ is used because successful incorporation brings into existence a ‘corporation’ (s 18-19 of the CA 2015 – effects of incorporation. Methods of incorporation There are three principal methods by which a company can be incorporated: incorporation by Act of Parliament incorporation by Executive Order incorporation by registration It should be n

New Approaches The decision of the Court of Appeal in Adams v Cape Industries plc clearly indicates that the courts are not quick to pierce the veil and the number of grounds upon which the veil can be pierced is limited. The Supreme Court case of Petrodel Resources Ltd v Prest [2013] has further limited the grounds on which the veil can be pierced by stating that there is only one instance in which the veil can be pierced and, even in that instance, the veil will only be pierced if it is necessary to do so. Prest must now be regarded as the leading case in this area and casts significant doubt on the validity of many of the cases discussed (at least in terms of them being regarded as instances of piercing the veil). Petrodel Resources Ltd v Prest [2013] UKSC 34 FACTS: The case involved a divorce settlement between Mr and Mrs Prest. The High Court had awarded Mrs Prest a divorce settlement totalling £17.5 million, but much of Mr Prest’s assets were (p. 39) tied up in companies that were solely controlled by him. Section 24(1)(a) of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 grants the court the power to ‘order that a party to the marriage shall transfer to the other party … property to which the first mentioned party is entitled’. The High Court utilized this power to pierce the corporate veils of these companies and order the relevant properties to be transferred to Mrs Prest. Mr Prest appealed, questioning whether the court had the power to do this given that the properties did not be

Directors Key facts Every private company must have at least one director and every public company must have at least two directors. The power to manage the company is initially vested in the members, but is usually delegated to the directors by the articles. Directors’ duties are now found in the Companies Act 2015, which provides for seven general duties that directors owe to the company. The general duties are based on prior common law duties, so pre-2015 case law will remain relevant. Certain types of transaction involving directors will only be valid if authorized by a resolution of the members. A director’s term of office can terminate in several ways including resignation, retirement, or removal. Additionally, the courts can disqualify a person from acting as director. The definition of ‘director’ A company may be run by persons who call themselves ‘governors’ or ‘managers’ and, increasingly, persons not involved in management at board level are called ‘directors’. Are such persons actually directors? The CA 2015 s3 defines a director as follows: in relation to a body corporate, includes— any person occupying the position of a director of the body (by whatever name the person is called); and any person in accordance with whose directions or instructions (not being advice given in a professional capacity) the directors of the body are accustomed to act; This broad definition will cover those who have been validly appointed to the office of director (known as de jure (‘i

Members Although the terms ‘member’ and ‘shareholder’ tend to be used interchangeably, there is a distinction (especially in companies that do not have a share capital). Members usually exercise their decision-making powers via the passing of resolutions. A resolution is simply a formal vote. The two forms of resolution are ordinary resolutions (which require a simple majority) and special resolutions (which require a majority of no less than 75 per cent). Public companies must pass resolutions at general meetings. Private companies must pass resolutions at general meetings, unless the written resolution procedure is used. Resolutions are only valid if sufficient notice of the meeting is provided and a quorum is present. A quorum is simply the minimum number of persons required to be present in order to conduct business. Members can appoint a proxy to attend, speak, and vote at general meetings on their behalf. Introduction The members of a company play two vital roles. First, through the purchase of shares, they contribute capital to the company. The nature of the share and share capital is discussed in the next class but our focus is on the second vital role that the members play, namely their ability to make decisions.

He inherited the business from his father and the reason for the success of his business has been the secret recipe for the crunchy chicken. This recipe is a well-guarded family secret, and over the years the family has ensured that only members of the immediate family have access to the recipe. In fact, all the branches in South Africa are headed by family members who are the only ones who have access to the recipe. Unfortunately, Zacchaeus and his immediate relatives are well over 70 years old and are considering retiring from the business soon, at least in the active sense. He has many grandchildren who may eventually take over but for the time being they are still quite young. Zacchaeus visited Kenya in June 2023, and he was very impressed by the vibrancy of Nairobi and the touristy nature of Mombasa as well as the level of business growth and population.

The business became especially lucrative when the government decided to remove all fuel subsidies and increase the rate of VAT on fuel from 8% to 16%. Consequently, the prices of petrol and diesel in the country became extremely high that some drivers opted to fuel in neighboring countries. Taxi drivers countrywide complained of reduced profits. They adopted several measures in order to cope. One measure was to plead with Customers to pay them extra than the amount stated in their apps. The other measure taken was to resort to hybrid cars, which could use both petrol and gas. In just five years, Kweli Co. Ltd has grown in leaps and bounds and has become one of the top blue-chip companies. Most of their operations however are still located in Mombasa, Nairobi, and Kisumu. The rural market is largely underserved and according to Kweli Co. Ltd market analysis, this segment of the market represents another goldmine. Having done its market survey, Kweli Co.

QUESTION FOUR (d) Busi Co. Ltd joined the Kenyan tourism market in 2020 at the height of the tourism boom. It invested heavily in tour vans that were to be used to transport tourists to various destinations of interest. The ﬁrst few months proved to be very lucrative since the company had managed to secure full booking throughout the year. In March 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic struck the world and many bookings were cancelled. The deposits that had been secured had to be refunded at short notice. The company found itself unable to pay its employees and had to let go many of them who were drivers. Gude Co. Ltd specializing in medical emergencies on the other hand witnessed a surge in demand for their services after securing a government contract to respond to critical cases in far ﬂung areas. Their vans were no longer adequate to respond to the medical emergencies throughout the country and they risked losing the contract if some urgent action was not taken. Gude Co. Ltd passed a resolution to acquire additional ﬂeet of vans from Busi Co. Ltd that could penetrate remote areas that they were expected to cover under the terms of the contract they signed with the government. The vans from Busi Co. Ltd ﬁtted the speciﬁcations. Although they were initially intended to transports tourist, with limited modiﬁcation, the vehicles could also be used to respond to medical emergencies in remote areas of the country.

Are there similarities of legal characteristics of companies/ corporations in all jurisdictions? There are five characteristics that it is possible to observe in every company doing business:Legal personality;Limited liability;Transferable shares;Delegated management;Investor ownership.2 The five core structural characteristics of a CompanyIn most economically active jurisdictions there is a basic statute that provides for the formation of firms with all of the above-mentioned characteristics.These characteristics respond to the economic exigencies of the large modern business enterprise.Even if there are other forms of business enterprise that lack one or more of these characteristics, in market economies, almost all companies adopt a legal form that possess all of them. These characteristics make the company attractive for organizing productive activity, but also generate tensions and trade-offs that lead to the the agency problems that corporate law must deal with.3 1. Legal PersonalityFirm as a “nexus of contracts”: this description is often used to emphasize the fact that most of the important relationships within a firm are essentially based on consent, rather than involving some form of extra-contractual command-and-control authority.

The constitution of the company A company’s constitution consists primarily of the articles of association, and agreements and resolutions affecting the company’s constitution. The Companies Act 2015 has significantly reduced the importance of the memorandum of association, and the articles now form the company’s principal constitutional document. The constitution forms a statutory contract between the company and its members, and between the members themselves, but only those provisions relating to membership rights will constitute terms of the statutory contract. A company that acts outside the scope of its objects clause will be acting ultra vires. Companies incorporated under the Companies Act 2015 have unrestricted objects by default – CA 2015 s28. A company can alter its articles by passing a special resolution, although statute and the common law restrict a company’s ability to alter its articles. Despite being the largest piece of legislation ever passed, the CA 2015 does not seek to exhaustively regulate the internal affairs of companies. Much is left to the companies themselves who will usually create their own internal rules via the company’s constitution. A company’s constitution largely fulfils the same function as the constitution of a country, namely, to set out the powers, rights and obligations of those who are subject to the constitution. Accordingly, a company’s constitution aims to set out the powers, rights and obligations of the company’s members and dir

2. Incorporation § Companies (and limited liability partnerships) are formed via a formal process known as ‘incorporation’. § The vast majority of companies are incorporated by registration, which involves registering certain documents with the Registrar of Companies at Sheria House. § A company can do many things that a natural person can, including entering into contracts, owning property and commencing legal proceedings. § In the vast majority of companies, the liability of the members will be limited. § A company can be held liable for a civil wrong, or found guilty of committing a crime. § A company has corporate personality, which means that, at law, it is a person. § The courts can set aside a company’s corporate personality where statute so provides, or where a company is interposed in order to evade, or frustrate the enforcement of, a legal obligation. Introduction Sole proprietorships and ordinary partnerships can be brought into existence very easily and with minimal state involvement. Conversely, companies (and LLPs) are brought into existence at the discretion of the state via a formal process known as ‘incorporation’. The word ‘incorporation’ is used because successful incorporation brings into existence a ‘corporation’ (s 18-19 of the CA 2015 – effects of incorporation. Methods of incorporation There are three principal methods by which a company can be incorporated: 1. incorporation by Act of Parliament 2. incorporation by Executive Order 3. incorporation by r

New Approaches The decision of the Court of Appeal in Adams v Cape Industries plc clearly indicates that the courts are not quick to pierce the veil and the number of grounds upon which the veil can be pierced is limited. The Supreme Court case of Petrodel Resources Ltd v Prest [2013] has further limited the grounds on which the veil can be pierced by stating that there is only one instance in which the veil can be pierced and, even in that instance, the veil will only be pierced if it is necessary to do so. Prest must now be regarded as the leading case in this area and casts significant doubt on the validity of many of the cases discussed (at least in terms of them being regarded as instances of piercing the veil). Petrodel Resources Ltd v Prest [2013] UKSC 34 FACTS: The case involved a divorce settlement between Mr and Mrs Prest. The High Court had awarded Mrs Prest a divorce settlement totalling £17.5 million, but much of Mr Prest’s assets were (p. 39) tied up in companies that were solely controlled by him. Section 24(1)(a) of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 grants the court the power to ‘order that a party to the marriage shall transfer to the other party … property to which the first mentioned party is entitled’. The High Court utilized this power to pierce the corporate veils of these companies and order the relevant properties to be transferred to Mrs Prest. Mr Prest appealed, questioning whether the court had the power to do this given that the properties did not be

Capital and capital maintenance The two principal types of capital that companies acquire are share capital (capital obtained by selling shares) and debt capital (capital borrowed from others). A new allotment of shares must usually first be offered to existing shareholders. Companies are prohibited from allotting shares for less than their nominal value. Companies can issue different classes of shares with different class rights, and the law regulates the ability to vary such class rights.

Capital and capital maintenance § The two principal types of capital that companies acquire are share capital (capital obtained by selling shares) and debt capital (capital borrowed from others). § A new allotment of shares must usually first be offered to existing shareholders. § Companies are prohibited from allotting shares for less than their nominal value. § Companies can issue different classes of shares with different class rights, and the law regulates the ability to vary such class rights. § Public companies are subject to minimum capital requirements when commencing business, whereas private companies are not. § A reduction of share capital is only valid if the strict procedures relating to a reduction of capital found in the Companies Act 2015 are complied with. § § Companies are generally prohibited from purchasing their own shares, but the 2015 Act does provide exceptions to this prohibition.

ATP 108 COMMERCIAL TRANSACTIONS MARCH 2023 QUESTION ONE A. Alfa Kenya Co. Ltd. (Alfa), is a large private non-listed company, incorporated in Kenya, with two main business operations i.e. mining and shipping and manufacturing of mining and shipping machinery and equipment. Alfa is in the process of considering whether or not to undertake a restructuring programme. Alfa's annual turnover is USD $12 million. Five Alfa members of the Board of Directors (who own 60% of the equity share capital in total) hold the view that the restructuring programme would not only simplify the company's structure, but also, and most importantly, become a tool for raising extra funds for expansion of mining and shipping business. According to these members, few years after the implementation of the proposed restructuring programme, a reverse takeover should be undertaken to obtain a listing on the Nairobi stock exchange in order to raise new ﬁnance. However, the other four members of Alfa's Board of Directors (who own 40% of the equity share capital in total), have raised doubts about the restructuring programme and the reverse takeover, and are of the opinion that the company should either join hands or purchase one of the two foreign corporate entities Indaba Mining Ltd., a Ugandan company that is the market leader in manufacturing equipment for mining sector in Uganda or Ethiopian Shipping Services Ltd, that holds 40% of the local market share in Ethiopian shipping industry.

Directors Key facts § Every private company must have at least one director and every public company must have at least two directors. § The power to manage the company is initially vested in the members, but is usually delegated to the directors by the articles. § Directors’ duties are now found in the Companies Act 2015, which provides for seven general duties that directors owe to the company. § The general duties are based on prior common law duties, so pre-2015 case law will remain relevant. § Certain types of transaction involving directors will only be valid if authorized by a resolution of the members. § A director’s term of office can terminate in several ways including resignation, retirement, or removal. Additionally, the courts can disqualify a person from acting as director. The definition of ‘director’ A company may be run by persons who call themselves ‘governors’ or ‘managers’ and, increasingly, persons not involved in management at board level are called ‘directors’. Are such persons actually directors? The CA 2015 s3 defines a director as follows: in relation to a body corporate, includes— (a) any person occupying the position of a director of the body (by whatever name the person is called); and (b) any person in accordance with whose directions or instructions (not being advice given in a professional capacity) the directors of the body are accustomed to act; This broad definition will cover those who have been validly appointed to the office of director (

Members § § § § § § Although the terms ‘member’ and ‘shareholder’ tend to be used interchangeably, there is a distinction (especially in companies that do not have a share capital). Members usually exercise their decision-making powers via the passing of resolutions. A resolution is simply a formal vote. The two forms of resolution are ordinary resolutions (which require a simple majority) and special resolutions (which require a majority of no less than 75 per cent). Public companies must pass resolutions at general meetings. Private companies must pass resolutions at general meetings, unless the written resolution procedure is used. Resolutions are only valid if sufficient notice of the meeting is provided and a quorum is present. A quorum is simply the minimum number of persons required to be present in order to conduct business. Members can appoint a proxy to attend, speak, and vote at general meetings on their behalf. Introduction The members of a company play two vital roles. First, through the purchase of shares, they contribute capital to the company. The nature of the share and share capital is discussed in the next class but our focus is on the second vital role that the members play, namely their ability to make decisions. As will be seen, a significant amount of power is placed into the hands of members and numerous key decisions are reserved for them alone. However, before the members’ ability to exercise this power can be discussed, it is important to note the d

In fact, agreement can be defined as a meeting of minds with the understanding and acceptance of reciprocal legal rights and duties as to particular actions or obligations, which the parties intend to exchange or a mutual assent to do or refrain from doing something. It is important to understand that if we enter into agreements with commercial organizations we will have important obligations to fulfil in return for any rewards that we might receive. So before any commercial agreement is finally signed all parties should invest considerable time and effort in the process which can take many months. This book’s extensive coverage of most of the types of business agreements that we are likely to encounter in the commercial sphere enables the readers to understand the mode of drafting agreements and contracts in a simple and understandable manner. We shall appreciate further questions from our readers and all concerned on various issues so that they can be inclu

Company Insolvency Options Receivership A receiver is appointed by a secured creditor to deal with the secured assets. A company can be in receivership and also in liquidation or voluntary administration. Voluntary administration An administrator is appointed to review and rearrange a business to avoid liquidation. Liquidation A liquidator is appointed to investigate and deal with all the business assets. The creditors can apply to the High Court for this to happen (Creditor Liquidation), or the shareholders can pass a special resolution (Voluntary Liquidation). The liquidator is usually a chartered accountant, or an insolvency expert. Note The Insolvency and Trustee Service only deals with liquidations, and generally only if appointed by the court. The Liquidation Process This process can be different depending on the circumstances, e.g. whether the company is trading, or depending on what assets it has. Company is unable to pay its creditors The company is unable to pay its creditors and the company or the shareholders have it placed into liquidation. A liquidator is appointed The liquidator notifies The BRS, and advertises the appointment. Creditors’ meeting A creditors’ meeting may be held to appoint a replacement liquidator.

TRAINING MODULE Table of Contents NAME SEARCH During the registering a new company, the first step is to get a name for the company. This involves making an application though e-citizen website, to reserve the name. Before conducting a name search the following should be observed: That there is an application for reservation of a company name. A receipt for payment/invoice of the prescribed fee. The Registrar may, on written application, reserve a name pending the registration of the company1, through online search at the Companies Registry. The name is reserved for a minimum of 30 days, as the registrar confirms whether the name is being used by another company. The period may be extended for another 30 days, for special reasons, to give the applicant time to register the name2. One is then required to pay a fee of Ksh 150 per name, which is broken down to Ksh1003 for the name and Ksh50 as the convenience fee. It should be noted that there is no requirement for a minimum or maximum number of names that an application can give.

Banks may also provide financial services, such as wealth management, currency exchange and safe deposit boxes. There are two types of banks: commercial/retail banks and investment banks. In this country, banks are regulated by the central bank. Commercial banks are typically concerned with managing withdrawals and receiving deposits as well as supplying short-term loans to individuals and small businesses. Consumers primarily use these banks for basic checking and savings accounts, certificates of deposit (CDs) and home mortgages. Examples of commercial banks include KCB Bank, Barclays Bank of Kenya and Cooperative Bank Investment banks focus on providing corporate clients with services such as underwriting and assisting with merger and acquisition (M&A) activity.

In re Abdallah Chitechi Munyendo [2022] eKLR REPUBLIC OF KENYA IN THE HIGH COURT OF KENYA AT KAKAMEGA BANKRUPTY CAUSE No. 1 OF 2018 IN THE MATTER OF THE MATTER OF THE INSOLVENCY ACT No 18 of 2015 AND IN THE MATTER OF ABDALLAH CHITECHI MUNYENDO RULING 1. The Petitioner before the Court petitioning for bankruptcy is the Debtor himself, Abdallah Chitechi Munyendo. Section 13 of the Insolvency Act No 18 of 2015 (hereinafter referred to as “the Act”) envisages such a petition. It is to be made in accordance with Section 32 of the Act. The only ground under which the Court can make an order for bankruptcy is that the debtor is unable to pay his/her debts. 2. Before the Court can exercise its jurisdiction, it must be satisfied that the Debtor has complied with Section 32(2) of the Act, in particular that the Application must be accompanied by a statement of the debtor’s financial position. The Statement of Financial Position must contain the following: (a) Such particulars of the debtor’s creditors and of the debtor’s debts and other liabilities and assets as may be prescribed by the insolvency regulations; and (b) Such other information as may be so prescribed. 3. The importance of the Statement of Financial Position can be seen by the fact that sub-section (3) provides that the Court may reject a statement of the debtor’s financial position if of the opinion that it is incorrect or incomplete. Further under Sub-Section 4 the debtor must publish the notice in a local newspaper and

Bowie Bonds: A Look at David Bowie's Innovative Estate Plan At the time of his tragic and unexpected (to the public, anyway) death, the iconic David Bowie had it all: family, fame, and fortune. Not so long ago, however, the artist found himself increasingly under pressure as financial obligations began to overcome a somewhat unpredictable music career. Eager to overcome his fiscal problems while retaining ultimate rights to his music, Bowie devised an ingenious plan that accomplished both goals, all while creating a lasting intellectual property dynasty that will benefit his surviving wife and children for years to come. Known as "Bowie Bonds", his innovative plan has transformed the transactional side of the music industry and helped to protect vulnerable artists from irrevocably signing away the rights to their creations during periods of financial uncertainty. The concept he pioneered has been embraced by elite artists and securities investors worldwide. Intellectual Property Bonds In 1997, amid growing concerns of physical and financial security, David Bowie met with a group of financial analysts to devise an investment vehicle that would both protect his artistic achievements and ensure regular income and protection from a somewhat volatile and unpredictable industry: show business. After meeting with several inventive financial professionals, Bowie opted to create an asset-backed security resting on the value of his pre-1990 portfolio of artistic works, which consisted

COMPANY LAW DEFINITION Section 2 of the Companies Act defines a company as an association of people for a common object or objects. Thus unlike a Partnership which is an association of persons who come together for business with a view of profit, the objects of a company extend beyond profit making. A company is different from a partnership in that in a partnership, each partner is liable for COMPANIES AND PARTNERSHIPS the debts and liabilities of the firm without limits, except for limited partnerships. Second, a partnership has no separate existence from the partners; third, a partnership has no perpetual succession unlike a company, so that the death, retirement or bankruptcy of a partner ends it. it. Section 389 of the Companies Act provides COMPANIES AND PARTNERHIPS that no association or partnership consisting of more than 20 persons may be formed for the purposes of carrying on any business for the acquisition of gains unless it is registered under the Companies Act, or is formed pursuant to some other statute. Section 2 of the Companies Act 2015 provides that a company is a company formed and registered under the Act or an existing company. It also provides that one natural person may incorporate a company. Companies may be statutory companies which are formed either by specific Acts of Parliament such as Kenya Ports Authority Act, Kenya Railways Corporation Act, etc, (statutory corporations), or State corporations (parastatals) which are formed TYPES OF COMPANIES und

CORPORATE INSOLVENCY: LIQUIDATION OF REGISTERED COMPANIES Class E: Firm 7 This topic will focus on the key corporate insolvency procedures of liquidation, administration and voluntary arrangements of companies under the Insolvency Act, 2015; highlighting the role of the government, regulators, the insolvency practitioner and other stakeholders including the duties and conduct of directors in relation to business in financial difficulty. Liquidation is a proceeding by means of which a company is dissolved and in the course of such dissolution its assets are collected and its debts are paid off out of the assets of the company or from contributions by its members, if necessary. If any surplus is left, it is distributed among the members in accordance with their rights. Section 384 of the Insolvency Act provides that a company is unable to pay its debts if- if a creditor (by assignment or otherwise) to whom the company is indebted for hundred thousand shillings or more has served on the company, by leaving it at the company's registered office, a written demand requiring the company to pay the debt and the company has for twenty-one days afterwards failed to pay the debt or to secure or compound for it to the reasonable satisfaction of the creditor; if execution or other process issued on a judgment, decree or order of any court in favour of a creditor of the company is returned unsatisfied in whole or in part; or if it is proved to the satisfaction of the Court that the company

CHAPTER 1 Conducting Due Diligence: An Overview Risk has always been a companion of reward, inherent in assessing opportunities against a company’s strengths and weaknesses. —Report of the NACD Blue Ribbon Commission on Risk Governance (2009) INTRODUCTION The due diligence phase of any acquisition—the study of the risks that the deal poses—can make the difference between success and failure. Many a deal that looks good on the back of an envelope looks bad in a spreadsheet. Acquirers must face all the facts—even worst-case scenarios. This is why due diligence must be considered in conjunction with other acquisition activities and goals, including strategic planning, valuation, financing, structuring, and—most important—charting the future of the combined company, with all its new risks and opportunities. To put due diligence in its proper perspective, we begin this chapter with the legal foundations of due diligence. Next, we discuss the “what, when, and who” of due diligence—that is, its scope, duration, and key participants. We then give some further background on the legal aspects of due diligence (focusing on “due diligence” in the securities law context). Finally, we close with suggestions for verification and risk prevention. Our goal is to build a strong platform of understanding for the more detailed work ahead. LEGAL FOUNDATIONS What are the legal origins of due diligence? The term due diligence originated in so-called common law, also known as case law—the law that h

CHAPTER 4 The Legal Compliance Review Are we disposed to be the number of those who, having eyes, see not, and having ears, hear not . . . ? For my part, whatever anguish of spirit it may cost, I am willing to know the whole truth; to know the worst, and to provide for it. —Patrick Henry, Speech at the Virginia Convention, Richmond, March 23, 1775 INTRODUCTION Legal compliance begins at home, with a responsible due diligence process that uncovers current and potential causes of financial, operational, and legal problems. This process itself can eliminate about a quarter of potential suits against directors and officers. According to past research by Tillinghast Insurance, a unit of Towers Watson, one out of every four lawsuits filed against officers and directors in any 10-year period stems from a merger that has gone bad.1 Plaintiffs allege that the buyer or seller committed errors in the purchase or sale of the company. A responsible due diligence process, well documented, can provide a strong defense against such legal actions. It is somewhat more difficult, however, to anticipate and manage the other causes of lawsuits against corporate officers and directors. These can come from anyone over any issue—and legal claims often come in clusters, involving multiple issues.2 This chapter is about that vast terrain of potential litigation, one that expands whenever an acquirer buys another company. Why? Because the seller’s legal vulnerabilities are usually transferred to the bu

KN LAW LLP LEGAL March 17, 2020 Changes in Competition Law in Kenya Introduction The Competition (Amendment) Act, 2019 (the “Act”) was assented to by the President on December 13, 2019 to commence on December 31, 2019. The Act introduced amendments to the Competition Act to regulate abuse of buyer power in the market. Additionally, the Competition (General) Rules, 2019 (“Rules”) made under Section 93 of the Act, were gazetted on December 06, 2019. The Rules consolidate the informal practice guidelines issued by Competition Authority of Kenya (CAK). We discuss the changes introduced by the Act and the Rules below. The Competition (Amendment) Act, 2019 The amendments reorganize the provisions of the Act on buyer power and abuse of buyer power. They increase CAK’s scope of powers in preventing abuse of buyer power by enabling it to monitor industries and sectors in which abuse of power is likely to occur. CAK may also require a sector or undertaking to develop a binding code of practice. The CAK is then required to publish the code of practice. The implication to businesses is that companies in ‘monitored’ sectors will be required to comply with reporting and prudential requirements. What is buyer power? It is the influence exerted by an undertaking in the position of purchaser to either obtain from a supplier more favourable terms or impose a long-term opportunity cost including harm or withheld benefit which would be significantly disproportionate to any resulting long-term co

ATP 108:COMMERCIAL TRANSACTIONSTOPIC:TAKEOVERS AND ACQUISITIONSFIRM 8 CLASS C MEANING AND SCOPE A takeover according to Section 584 of the Companies Act is the making of an offer by a company to buy shares, whether the offer is to buy all the shares, a class of shares or all classes of shares of a company.The Black’s Law Dictionary (9th edition) define takeover as ‘the acquisition of ownership or control of a corporation.' A takeover is typically accomplished by a purchase of shares or assets, a tender offer, or a merger. Takeovers are a common business strategy aimed at consolidating market position, diversifying operations or entering new markets. MEANING AND SCOPE CONT'DAn acquisition on the other hand refers to an agreed, strategic, operation where one company acquires another. Acquisitions involve buying more than 50% of the target company stock to enable the acquiring company to make decisions without the approval of the target company, an example is in 2016 Longhorn publishers acquired 74% stake in Law Africa publishers.The acquiring company will be entitled to all the assets, liabilities, properties and equipment of the target company. Once acquisition is complete, the target company ceases to exist as it is absorbed by the acquirer.Businesses may engage in takeovers or acquisitions to increase their consumer bases, get access to new markets, acquire innovative technology or goods, or oust rivals.

COMMERCIAL TRANSACTIONS PAST PAPERS PAST PAPER: DECEMBER 2016 1. Charles seeks your advice on the following matters: a. How can Ellen be removed from her position as director and what steps might she take to resist the removal or to assert her rights? Removal of Directors:              Section 139(1), CA 2015: a company may, by ordinary resolution at a meeting, remove a director before the expiration of his period of office, notwithstanding anything in any agreement between it and him This section can also be used to remove multiple directors The words ‘at a meeting’ indicate that the written resolution procedure cannot be used While the power granted to members under this section appears extremely substantial, Section 139(6)(a) mitigates its usefulness by stating that removal does not deprive a director of compensation payable as a result of the removal  if the directors’ remuneration is substantial or his service contract lengthy, this compensation may be extremely high In addition, Section 139 should not be construed as derogating from any power to remove a director that exists outside the section, e.g. the articles may contain a provision allowing removal of a Board member via a Board resolution, and the advantage of using a separate Board power is that it will not be subject to the procedural requirements of Section 139 Notice of Meetings: Section 284, CA 2015: resolutions passed at a general meeting are only valid if adequate notice of the meeting is provi

Members 8. Directors 9. Resolutions and meetings 10. Shares 1. Introduction Definition of a company: • Sec 3 of the Companies Act 2015 defines a company as a company formed and registered under the Act or an existing company. • The term existing company is defined in sec 3 of the Act as a company formed and registered under the repealed companies act or other repealed ordinances as defined by the repealed companies act. Introduction • Buckley J. in Re: Stanley (1906) noted that the word company has no strict legal meaning and further noted that a company may be defined as an association of persons who contribute money or money’s worth to common stock and who employ it to a common purpose. • The above definition in Re: Stanley (1906) does not distinguish a company from a partnership. • Under common law, a company is considered a legal person or legal entity separate from and with perpetual succession. Historical background of companies • The company as a form of business organization was first applied by English merchants trading cloth and other goods overseas. • The company emerged during the mercantile era due to two reasons: • The need for large scale investment, production and operation to satisfy the market demand, as a result of which, traders were in dire need of a commercial de

DEFINITION Section 2 of the Companies Act defines a company as an association of people for a common object or objects. Thus unlike a Partnership which is an association of persons who come together for business with a view of profit, the objects of a company extend beyond profit making. COMPANIES AND PARTNERSHIPS A company is different from a partnership in that in a partnership, each partner is liable for the debts and liabilities of the firm without limits, except for limited partnerships. Second, a partnership has no separate existence from the partners; third, a partnership has no perpetual succession unlike a company, so that the death, retirement or bankruptcy of a partner ends it. Section 389 of the Companies Act provides that no association or partnership consisting of more than 20 persons may be formed for the purposes of carrying on any business for the acquisition of gains unless it is registered under the Companies Act, or is formed pursuant to some other statute. Section 2 of the Companies Act 2015 provides that a company is a company formed and registered under the Act or an existing company. It also provides that one natural person may incorporate a company. TYPES OF COMPANIES Companies may be statutory companies which are formed either by specific Acts of Parliament such as Kenya Ports Authority Act, Kenya Railways Corporation Act, etc. (statutory corporations), or State corporations (parastatals) which are formed under the State Corporations Act which gives

The constitution of the company § A company’s constitution consists primarily of the articles of association, and agreements and resolutions affecting the company’s constitution. § The Companies Act 2015 has significantly reduced the importance of the memorandum of association, and the articles now form the company’s principal constitutional document. § The constitution forms a statutory contract between the company and its members, and between the members themselves, but only those provisions relating to membership rights will constitute terms of the statutory contract. § A company that acts outside the scope of its objects clause will be acting ultra vires. § Companies incorporated under the Companies Act 2015 have unrestricted objects by default – CA 2015 s28. § A company can alter its articles by passing a special resolution, although statute and the common law restrict a company’s ability to alter its articles. § Despite being the largest piece of legislation ever passed, the CA 2015 does not seek to exhaustively regulate the internal affairs of companies. Much is left to the companies themselves who will usually create their own internal rules via the company’s constitution. § A company’s constitution largely fulfils the same function as the constitution of a country, namely, to set out the powers, rights and obligations of those who are subject to the constitution. § Accordingly, a company’s constitution aims to set out the powers, rights and obligations of the company

Consumer Protection in the Financial Service Sector in Kenya An evaluation of the treatment of consumer protection in the financial services sector through the provisions of the Central Bank of Kenya Act, the Banking Act, the Insurance Act, the Capital Markets Act and the Retirement Benefits Act and the Subsidiary legislations made thereunder and suggested reforms, if any, that may improve the situation. Table of Contents INTRODUCTION Consumer protection is about ensuring fair exchange between goods and service providers on the one hand and consumers on the other hand. A deliberate legal framework is necessary to counter-balance the inherent disadvantage of a consumer vis-a-vis the power, information and resources of their goods and service providers. As a result, reforms in the financial sector regulations center on the concept of consumer protection.3 From the onset, the Kenya 2010 Constitution entrenches the right to consumer protection, that is, consumers should be protected from unfair market practices from services and goods providers.4 This constitutional entrenchment, in conjunction with the Consumer Protection Act 2012 and sector-specific statutes, place enormous obligations and responsibilities on providers of financial services and goods (both private and public) to be discussed hereunder. With regard to the foregoing observation this paper purposes to evaluate the treatment of consumer protection in the financial services sector through the provisions of the Centr

Regulated vs Unregulated Products, & Cytonn Weekly #25/2021 Focus of the Week Following ongoing discussions in the financial markets around regulated and unregulated offers, a member of parliament recently requested the Chairperson of the Department Committee on Finance and Planning to issue a statement on unregulated / private offers. Therefore, in this week’s topical, our Research Team seeks to build on a previous focus on the same topic covered in 2020 and educate the general public about these two types of markets/investment categories, which are complementary and important to well-functioning financial markets. As such, we shall discuss the following: i. Introduction to Regulated and Unregulated markets, ii. Regulated and Unregulated Investment Categories, iii. Pros and Cons of Each Investment Category, iv. Issues to Consider for Each Category, v. Myths About Each Category, and, vi. Conclusion. Section I: Introduction to Regulated and Unregulated Investment markets Investment markets from a regulatory point of view can be divided into two large categories, regulated and unregulated markets. Regulated markets, often referred to as public markets are controlled by a regulatory body whose key mandate is to protect the public interest. The products in the public markets tend to be standardized and easily accessible to the public. Common examples of regulated products include shares purchased at the securities exchange, Fixed Deposits offered by Banks, Collective Investment S

INTRODUCTION Prior to the development of digital credit, most Kenyans relied on informal lenders (shylocks), relatives and friends for short-term loans. The introduction of pioneer digital credit products such as M-Shwari has led to exponential growth of digital lending over the last couple of years.According to research conducted by Reek Analytics in 2021, out of every 100 Kenyans polled, 55 had acquired loans from digital credit providers at some point.Yet, despite the popularity, the digital credit market remained unregulated for a long time. As a result, the market was marred with unfair industry practices around unethical debt collection, abuse of personal information and high interest rates. “You are now attached by a serious defaulter by the Name: Alex Mpole who used your details as a referee begging for your contribution on the same. Being the last warning. Seek clearance from this rogue client who has refused to pay off the loan Kshs. 25,000.

The Facts B and L were directors of two companies, N and TPG. B and L indirectly held 35 per cent-of the issued ordinary shares in TPG, which in turn held 25.6 per cent of the issued ordinary shares in N. B and L induced the board of directors of N to purchase TPG's main assets, allegedly at an over-valuation. In accordance with Stock Exchange regulations, the consent of N's shareholders was obtained, but by an allegedly "tricky" circular. P, which held 3.2 per cent of N's issued ordinary shares, sued N, B, L and TPG claiming: (a) as representative of itselfand the other shareholders at the time of the action, equitable damages on behalf of the company for breach of the defendants' fiduciary duty to N ("the derivative claim"), and (b) on behalf of itself alone, common law damages for conspiracy against B and L ("the direct personal claim"). Later P sought to amend its originating process to claim: (c) on behalf of itself and the other shareholders at the time of the alleged conspiracy, (i) a declaration of entitlement to damages and (ii) damages ("the direct representative claim"). - 2.

CONDITIONS, DISCRETIONARY AUTHORITY, AND DECLARATIONS CONDITIONS TO OBLIGATIONS Let’s continue with the Susan Seller/John Buyer house purchase hypothetical that we discussed in the last class. After negotiating the purchase price, John tells Susan that he needs to obtain a mortgage and that the application process will take about six weeks. He also tells her that while he is quite conﬁdent that he will obtain the mortgage, he does not want to be obligated to buy the house if he cannot obtain it. Susan agrees. To establish the mortgage as a contractual prerequisite to John’s obligation to buy the house, the purchase contract will use a condition. A condition is a state of facts that must exist before a party is obligated to perform. If that state of facts does not exist, the obligation to perform is not triggered. Uncertainty is a hallmark of a condition. For a state of facts to be a condition, those facts cannot be certain to occur. Thus, the passage of time cannot be a condition because it will occur. Conditions may appear in any type of agreement. They are not limited to acquisition agreements. A condition is not a condition to the making of a covenant. Instead, a condition is a state of facts that must exist before a party must perform the obligation that ﬂows from a covenant. Many lawyers still refer to a condition as a condition precedent, although this usage is now no longer necessary. Previously, a condition was labeled either a condition precedent or a condition subse

ATP 108 COMMERCIAL TRANSACTIONS 2024 TOPIC: COMMERCIAL CONTRACTS PART 1 – INTRODUCTION TO ADVANCED CONTRACT DRAFTING 1.1 INTRODUCTION A well-drafted contract is elegant. Its language is clear and unambiguous, and its organization cohesive and thoughtful. But drafting a contract requires more than good writing and organizational skills. A drafter should have keen analytical skills; a superior ability to negotiate; a sophisticated understanding of business, the business deal, and the client’s business; a comprehensive knowledge of the law; and a discerning eye for details. 1.2 WHAT DOES A CONTRACT DO? A contract establishes the terms of the parties’ relationship. It reﬂects their agreement as to the rules that will govern their transaction. The rules generally include § § § § § § § the statements of facts that each party made that induced the other to enter the transaction; each party’s promises as to its future performance; each party’s rights; the events that must occur before each party is obligated to perform; each party’s discretionary authority; how the contract will end, including the events that constitute breach and the remedies for breach; and the general policies that govern the parties’ relationship. These rules are the parties’ private laws, which the courts will enforce, subject to public policy exceptions found in statutes and common law. Indeed, commentators speak of contracts as private law.

There is therefore urgent need to promote data security and protection by states and private entities.

Financial services handle a great deal of sensitive information belonging to consumers on a day to day basis in order to efficiently carry out their services.

Data Protection Act In Kenya The Data Protection Act No. 24 of2019 (the Act or DPA hereinafter) which was enacted on 8th November 2019 has a commencement date of 25th November 2019. Its preamble states that it is meant to give effect to Article 31 (c) and (d) of the Constitution. These provisions guarantee that every person has the right to privacy, including not to have information relating to their family or private affairs unnecessarily required or revealed and not to have the privacy of their communications infringed. The Act is a clean-up of several bills that were introduced previously then withdrawn for one reason or the other. The new law comes against the backdrop of the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulations (EUGDPR). Most companies operating in Kenya were still grappling with compliance. Notably, the provisions of the Act mimic those of the EUGDPR and therefore companies that had taken steps towards compliance with EUGDPR will be a step ahead. Who is affected by the Data Protection Act? The Act limits its scope to data controllers or processors who are established and ordinarily reside in Kenya and process personal data of natural persons while in Kenya OR If they are not established or resident in Kenya, they process personal data of data subjects located in Kenya. This scope captures anyone whose operations involve collection or processing of personal information pertaining to Kenyan residents. For instance, any person running an app that collects p

WWW.BRS.GO.KE GENERAL OVERVIEW OF THE DEBTOR’S BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS BY: JUDY MUGO, SENIOR ASSISTANT OFFICIAL RECEIVER What is bankruptcy? Bankruptcy is a legal proceeding initiated when a person is unable to repay their debts or obligations when they fall due. Bankruptcy offers an individual a chance to start afresh by pardoning debts that they declared at the time of entering into bankruptcy. In Kenya, bankruptcy proceedings are governed by the Insolvency Act 2015 and its Regulations. The High court is vested with the jurisdiction to hear and determine bankruptcy matters. The bankruptcy process Section 32 of the Act states that a debtor may make an application in court for a Bankruptcy Order adjudging him bankrupt. The legal process commences when the debtor files a Bankruptcy Petition in court. A Bankruptcy Petition can either be filed by the debtor in their own capacity or by the advocate representing the debtor. The debtor presents the following documents to the Official Receiver for approval and confirmation that he has complied with the requirements of the Act:Bankruptcy petition- Form No. 10 Supporting Affidavit- Form No.8 Application for bankruptcy trustee- Form No. 9 Statement of Affairs- Form 11 Once the Official Receiver confirms compliance, the debtor makes a statutory payment of Kshs. 30,000/= to the Official Receiver, who then issues a Certificate of Compliance in relation to the petition.

There are different forms of mergers like, statutory mergers, and triangular mergers; there are also consolidations.2 In general there is a common agreement that mergers are friendly, even in those occasions when a transaction indeed it was not a merger but an acquisition however due to reputational reasons both the companies agreed to name it as merger.3 One the other hand, acquisition4, also known as a takeover, it is a direct action by the acquiring company to buy the target company.5 Acquisition can take two forms.

It also examines the di=erences between the appointment of an agent and distributor. A. Distribution and agency Distinction between distributors, resellers and agents It is important for a supplier or manufacturer, when considering how best to market, sell or distribute its products, to be aware of the di=erence, in legal and practical terms, between appointing an agent and a distributor. Agency and distribution compared Agent promotes contract between principal and customer Essentially, an agent is appointed by the principal to negotiate and possibly conclude contracts with customers on the principal’s behalf. Agents are paid commission on the sales they make, usually on a percentage basis. The only contract for sale of the products is made between the principal and the customer. The agent generally has no contractual liability to the customer. Distributor is a reseller A distributor buys goods from manufacturers or other suppliers and resells them to others in the supply chain, such as resellers and end-users, adding a margin to cover its own costs and proﬁt.

INSOLVENCY PROCEDURES CONTINUED Insolvency Procedures Continued Administration It involves taking in control by the administrator the whole or substantially all of the company's business and assets to manage the company's business and if need be to realize its assets for the purpose of paying one or more of its creditors. The administrator may also be appointed by the court to collect the protect the property of an insolvent company until its fate is determined by the court and to utilize the property or manage the company's affairs in discharging debt. The primary objective of the administration of a company is a) To maintain a company as a going concern b) Achieve a more favorable outcome for the company's group of creditors which would likely not be the case if the company were liquidated without first being under administration c) To realize the property of the company in order to make a distribution to one or more secured or preferential creditors The general rule is that the debt which an administration order is founded is due and payable or is undisputed. If the subject is disputed a petition for an administration order or liquidation would amount to ordinary proceedings for debt collection. The administration must not be used as a means of bringing pressure using the courts for payment of debts In the case of Re The Standard Limited Ex Parte Tricom Paper International BV [2002] KLR 644 it was held that if a petition is intended to enforce payment of a disputed debt it

Nigel Foster: Revision and examination guidance Revision and examination guidance Nigel Foster, Professor of Law and Deputy Vice-Chancellor, The University of Buckingham General During the course of your studies and as you approach exam time you will no doubt be receiving advice, not all of which is the same, from many sources. Mine is based on my experience taking examinations at degree, post-graduate, and a number of other levels and from twenty-four years of experience of the problems, difficulties, and successes of students. This does not mean to say that this will coincide with the experience of others, or what may work for one person will necessarily work for another. I am loath, therefore, to give full and detailed advice of 'the best way' to learn and pass exams, merely to give some pointers on the way. Revision for examination Revision preparation The most important requirement for revision is a coherent set of notes from which to work. If you do not have a complete and reasonably comprehensive set, the first task will be to produce a set of concise notes prior to the revision period. You may find it necessary to rewrite parts of your notes in order to reduce them to a manageable size for revision purposes. What to revise Exam content An internally set and marked examination, which is the case in nearly all degree examinations, would usually reflect fairly accurately what has been taught during the year.

FINTECH REGULATION IN KENYA Introduction According to the Economic Survey Report of 2022[1], the value of output from the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) Sector rose by 6.9% from USD 4.03 billion in 2020 to USD 4.31 billion in 2021. Mobile money subscribers increased by 8.5% to 35.2 million in 2021 and the value of mobile commerce transactions increased by 63.2% to USD 116.4 billion in the same period. Essentially, the total mobile money transfers grew by 31.7% to USD 52.5 billion, a growth which is attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic. Within this period the Kenyan Government encouraged use of mobile money platforms with an aim to curb the spread of the virus through handling of cash. Financial technology (‘Fintech’) refers to the integration of technology by firms in delivering financial services to customers. Fintech is a rapidly growing industry in the East Africa region steered by a unique blend of mobile adoption, technology innovations and investor interests.[2] Some of the major Fintech activities carried out in Kenya include mobile payments, digital lending, asset and wealth management, insurance, and money remittance operations. The Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) is the primary regulator, responsible for ensuring that all financial institutions operate within the set standards. However, the dynamic nature of the Fintech industry and its overlap across different sectors, leads to a multiplicity in the regulatory framework. There are however sector-specific

DERIVATIVE ACTION INTRODUCTION AND DEFINITIONS A company is an artificial person capable of being injured and can, when wronged, institute court proceedings to protect its interests. Much as the law recognizes and appreciates the juristic personality of companies, one jurisprudential question that courts have to grapple with before proceeding to entertain suits seeking to remedy harm suffered by companies is: in whose name are such suits brought or rather, who is the proper plaintiff? In the case of Foss v Harbottle (discussed in detail later) it was held that the proper plaintiff in an action in respect of a wrong alleged to be done to a company is the company itself, which essentially mean the directors or majority shareholders must okay the lodging of such suits. The decision was termed oppressive as it denied members of a company, especially minority shareholders, the chance to prosecute matters where there is lethargy on the part of the directors or where the directors or majority shareholders themselves are the perpetrators of the injury suffered. Over time and in order to ensure proper management of companies and sustainability of their businesses, the law was changed to allow members of companies to initiate suits in their own names and on behalf of the company. This is known as derivative action. A derivative action has been variously defined. The Black’s Law Dictionary (8th edition) defines it as a suit brought by a beneficiary to enforce a right belonging to the fi

Forgery is the production of a replica to as close as possible to the actual object with the intention of deceiving people into accepting it as the original. Sec 345 of the Penal Code cap 63 defines forgery as the making of a false document with intent to defraud or to deceive Where the forgery consists of the drawer's signature and the banker pays such a cheque, he cannot normally debit his customer's account with the amount so paid out as he has not in actual fact received his customer's mandate to do so. Where the acceptor’s signature is forged, he incurs no liability, but all other persons whose signature are genuine are liable to the holder. Hence, the customer's signature on the cheque must be the same as the specimen. If it differs, the cheque should be returned "Drawer's signature differs". However, if the customer on discovering the forgery remains silent about it for an unreasonable time by the end of which the banker's ability to recover such payment becomes adversely affected, he is precluded from setting up the forgery and may have to suffer the loss himself: see Greenwood v. Martins Bank Ltd (1933). Similarly, In Kenya industrial Research and Development Institute v. National Bank of Kenya Civil Case No. 225 of 1995, it was held that a cheque on which a drawer’s signature is forged is a mere paper and is not a cheque at all unless it becomes valid by estoppel. An unauthorized signature is one not amounting to a forgery but one placed on an instrument by an agent

Structure of Kenya’s Financial Sector APRIL 2023 ⚫The financial market deals with the purchase and sale of money. It therefore involves obtaining money from those who have more than they need by attracting it either as: ⚪ deposits through commercial banks; ⚪ premiums through insurance companies; ⚪ units or shares through Mutual Funds ⚪ or shares or bonds through investment banks. ⚫The money drawn from the savers is then pooled and allocated throughout the economy by giving it out as loans, common or corporate bonds, treasury bills inter alia. ⚫The financial market in Kenya can be said to have two major functions: ⚪ it allocates money capital through identifying those with surplus funds, attracting the funds into a pool and then distributing them to those who need to spend more than they have. ⚪ The other function of the financial market is the distribution of the economic risk through the creation and distribution of securities. ⚫Principally, financial market in Kenya comprise: ⚪ commercial banks, ⚪ non-bank financial institutions, ⚪ mortgage companies, ⚪ forex bureaus, ⚪ development finance institutions, ⚪ pension schemes, ⚪ SACCOs ⚪ the insurance sector and the stock market. Structure of Kenya’s financial system ⚫In the current structure, the firm’s legal status (bank, broker or insurance company) determines which regulator is responsible for supervising its activities. ⚫There are five key agencies and regimes for prudential regulation: ⚪ Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) for ban

Chapter 29 KENYA John Syekei, Philip Coulson and Babette Märzheuser-Wood 1 I INTRODUCTION The international franchise market in Kenya has grown extensively. There are currently a considerable number of international franchisors with established operations in the Kenyan market, for example KFC, Nando’s, Subway, Papa John’s and Dubai-based Baby Shop or South African Mr Price. Local franchisors are few but well established within the Kenyan market, such as the livestock services offered by Sidai Africa to local farmers and Sasini Tea and Coffee or Dormans Coffee. The Kenyan franchise industry is not formally organised into a national body but there is a Kenya Franchise Association (KEFRA) which was called into life as part of a private local initiative. II MARKET ENTRY i Restrictions There are no specific restrictions or approvals for foreign franchisors entering the Kenyan market. There are, however, regulatory issues relating to establishing a business or operating a branch in Kenya. Typically, it would be best to structure the franchise so that the franchisor does not acquire a local presence. Most franchise agreements are structured in this way. Kenyan law is based on common law principles and very similar to English law so that English law agreements can be used without substantial amendments. The decisions of the English courts are often used as persuasive precedents. Certain franchise agreements or arrangements may fall within the ambit of the Competition Act, 2010 if the

General partnerships, LLPs and limited partnerships: comparison of key features This checklist sets out a comparison of the key features of general partnerships and limited partnerships under the Partnerships Act No. 16 of 2012, and limited liability partnerships (LLPs) incorporated under the Limited Liability Partnerships Act No. 42 of 2011 (Cap 30A). Scope of this checklist The table below provides a comparison of the key features of: General partnerships under the Partnerships Act 2012 (PA 2012). Many general partnerships (or ordinary partnerships as they are sometimes known) arise without the knowledge of the persons involved. Partnership is defined as the relation which exists between persons carrying on a business in common with a view to profit (section 3, PA 2012). It is a matter of fact whether a general partnership exists and the parties cannot simply determine this for themselves. Normally the relationship is governed by a contractual agreement but the essence of a partnership is the continuing relationship, personal as well as commercial, with the contractual agreement being only an indication of the relationship (Hurst v Bryk [2001] 1 AC 185). When the courts have to consider whether a general partnership exists, they look at the substance of the arrangements and not the stated intentions of the parties. One advantage a general partnership has over limited partnerships and LLPs is that they are simple and cheap to set up. No formal agreement is necessary as the t

NEWS ALERT ISSUE: 17 JUNE 2017 2.0 Nature of rights over moveable properties covered by the Act (Security rights) A property right in a movable asset that is created by an agreement to secure payment or other performance of an obligation is defined as a security right under the Act. It is important to note that the Act adopts a “substance over form” approach as the Act classifies any such right in any agreement as a security right regardless of whether the parties have denominated it as a security right. The Act also defines the right of the transferee in an outright transfer of a receivable as a security right. The Act applies to security rights in moveable assets, including: A BRIEF OUTLINE OF THE MOVABLE PROPERTY SECURITY RIGHTS ACT, 2017 1. Introduction The Moveable Property Security Rights Act, 2017 (the “Act”) came into operation on 16th May 2017. The Act aims at facilitating the use of movable property as security for credit facilities and enhancing the ability of individuals and entities to access credit using moveable assets. To this end, the Act creates the office of the Registrar of Security Rights and sets out provisions in respect of the registration of security rights in movable property, the realisation process and related matters. The Act repeals the Chattels Transfer Act and the Pawn Brokers Act and also amends or repeals certain provisions of the Agricultural Finance Corporation Act, the Stamp Duty Act, the Hire Purchase Act, the Business Registration Servic

Areas of Law: How to Become a Commercial Lawyer How to Become a Commercial Lawyer: What is Commercial Law? Commercial law involves legal problems that can occur in the running of businesses and commercial transactions. Its predominant concerns are contract and tort law.

Chapter One Sources of Law in Kenya 1.1 What is Law? The world of commerce and industry is founded on distinct pillars of social order. The establishment and regulation of the various institutions of society depend upon frameworks of rules to which they owe their existence and from which they draw their power and legitimacy. These rules are promulgated and enforced in accordance with a defined legal system. As has been rightly observed, “[i]n order to ensure good order and the smooth running of society, it is necessary to formulate general rules which work well enough in the majority of cases.”1 Accordingly, there is need in every society to promulgate normative rules, principles and doctrines to regulate social order. Such rules and principles must be effectively binding in the sense that derogation from them, or breach thereof, attracts penal or other remedial consequences. The assemblage of these doctrines, principles, rules, and regulations, may, in very loose terms, be collectively referred to as law. Glanville Williams defines law as “… the body of principles recognized and applied by the state in the administration of justice …” According to him, it consists of “… the rules recognized and acted on by courts of justice.”2 In this sense, law includes all rules of conduct enacted by Parliament or established by court decisions in conformity with fundamental principles and doctrines recognized as essential for the administration of justice. Their binding nature demands tha

INSIGHTS / EXPERTISE / PEOPLE / NEWS / CONTACTS SITEMAP DISCLAIMER The Insolvency Act, 2015: The impact on creditors and their right to realise securities Posted on: December 5, 2015 The Insolvency Act, 2015(the Insolvency Act) was enacted with the key objective of amending and consolidating the legislation relating to the insolvency of natural persons and incorporated and unincorporated bodies. It aims to provide for and regulate the bankruptcy or liquidation of natural persons, incorporated and unincorporated bodies to enable their affairs to be managed for the benefit of their creditors. The Act was assented on 11th September, 2015 and will come into operation on such date as the Cabinet Secretary may direct by notice in the Kenya Gazette, however, any provision that is not brought into force through gazettement within nine months after the publication of the Act shall automatically come into force on the expiry of that period. Prior to the enactment of the Insolvency Act, corporate insolvency was dealt with under the Winding-up provisions of the Companies Act(Cap 486 of the Laws of Kenya) (the Companies Act) while the insolvency of natural persons was covered in the Bankruptcy Act of Kenya(Cap 53 of the Laws of Kenya) (the Bankruptcy Act). Unlike the previous legislation, the Act seeks to redeem insolvent companies through administration as opposed to liquidation. The Act focuses more on assisting insolvent natural persons, unincorporated entities and insolvent corporate

INSOLVENCY IN KENYA Historical Background For a long period of time the law governing insolvency in respect to individuals and companies in Kenya was the Bankruptcy Act, Cap 53 Laws of Kenya. This piece of legislation was enacted in 1938, and upon Kenya attaining its independence, like many other legislations in operation at the time, we adopted it and thus became the guide with which matters insolvency would be undertaken. Like many of the statutes we inherited from our colonial masters, this piece of legislation was a carbon copy version of the British Bankruptcy Laws. We adopted it and continued in its use over time despite the changing tides in this very area of our law to a point this law became more or less a moribund and backward piece of legislation. Due to concerted efforts exerted by various interest groups for a change in laws that affected the conduct of business within our jurisdiction, the Bankruptcy Act among many others such as the Companies Act came under a microscope and those concerned began the process of formulating a new law to govern matters insolvency. This desire is demonstrable from the several bills that have been debated within the precincts of parliament from the Insolvency Bill 2008, 2010, 2012 and finally the Insolvency Bill 2014 that was then assented to by the president on 11th September 2015 and is now known as the Insolvency Act No. 18 of 2015. It is important at this very onset to distinguish between the terms bankruptcy and insolvency. Ban

This Petition is in respect of Diamond Hasham Lalji (the Debtor). Cargill Kenya Limited (the Creditor) seeks a Bankruptcy Order in respect of his Estate. 2. Some facts are common. The Debtor is the Chairman and Director of Premier Flour Mills Limited, Maize Milling Company Limited and Milling Corporation of Kenya (2009) Limited (hereafter jointly the ‘Companies’ or ‘Principal debtors’).

Background The creditor in his affidavit avers that the debtor was his client in an election petition in which he was retained to provide professional legal services. He further avers that the bill of costs was taxed by the Deputy Registrar and a Certificate of Costs dated 14.2.2020 for Kshs.1,404,595/= issued against the debtor. It followed that the debtor issued cheques towards settlement of the debt with one cheque of Kshs.300,000/= dated 30.4.2020 returned unpaid.

In re James Maina Kabatha (Debtor/Applicant) [2020] eKLR REPUBLIC OF KENYA IN THE HIGH COURT OF KENYA AT NAKURU INSOLVENCY CAUSE NO. 4 OF 2019 IN THE MATTER OF JAMES MAINA KABATHA (DEBTOR/APPLICANT) RULING 1. The twin goals of consumer or individual bankruptcy law are to protect creditors and ensure optimal payment to them where possible; and the provision of shelter and a "fresh start" to individual debtors overburdened by debt. There is no doubt that these twin goals run through the Insolvency Act, 2015 and the Insolvency Regulations, 2016. 2. The US Supreme Court explained the fundamental goal of bankruptcy law in Local Loan Co. v. Hunt, 292 U.S. 234, 244 (1934) thus: [Bankruptcy law] gives to the honest but unfortunate debtor…a new opportunity in life and a clear field for future effort, unhampered by the pressure and discouragement of pre-existing debt. 3. The “fresh start” goal is accomplished through the bankruptcy discharge, which usually releases the debtor from personal liability from certain debts and prevents creditors from taking any action against the debtor to collect those debts. 4. Consequently, bankruptcy protection being an extraordinary relief, one of the corollaries to the these seemingly conflictual twin goals of bankruptcy law – the protection of creditors and the provision of fresh start for the honest but unfortunate debtor -- is that an individual seeking bankruptcy protection is required to scrupulously demonstrate that he is acting in good faith an

E164 OF 2019 IN THE MATTER OF THE INSOLVENCY ACT, 2015 AND IN THE MATTER OF IFLIX (KENYA) LIMITED JUDGMENT 1. This petition concerns Iflix (Kenya) Limited (“the Company”) which was incorporated in Kenya on 11th October 2016 under the Companies Act, 2015. The nominal capital of the Company is Kshs. 1,000,000/- divided into 10,000 shares of Kshs. 100 each. The objects of the Company are unrestricted. 2. The petitioner, Iflix International PTE Ltd, is a limited liability company incorporated in the Republic of Singapore and presents this petition as creditor (“the petitioner”). 3. In the petition, the petitioner stated that between October and December 2018, it advanced the Company USD 620,246.28 to finance its growth and operations.

The petitioner served the Company with a Statutory Demand on 11th October 2019 demanding payment of the debt but the Company has failed to repay the Debt or part thereof.

Intellectual Property Collateralisation in the Age of the Movable Property Security Rights Act: The Case of Nakumatt Supermarkets By Victor B. Nzomo & Perpetua N. Mwangi** Nakumatt Holdings Limited (Nakumatt) is the proprietor of the largest supermarket retail chain in East and Central Africa. According to Superbrands, Nakumatt is one of the leading brands in East Africa with branches in Kenya Uganda, Tanzania and Rwanda. However the biggest story of 2017 has been the financial woes of Nakumatt with the retail chain facing liquidation over unpaid debts totaling over Sh30 billion. From an intellectual property (IP) perspective, Nakumatt’s brand power is based on its portfolio of over 23 registered trade marks including word marks, logos and slogans all currently subsisting on the Register of Trade Marks. This blogpost departs from the premise that the recent enactment of the Movable Property Security Rights Act was envisaged to allow individuals or businesses like Nakumatt to leverage their IP assets to access much-needed financing. For over a three-decade period the Nakumatt brand has achieved a wealth of goodwill, consumer confidence and customer loyalty. Nakumatt introduced the first 24-hour retail store in the country and it has its own product brand Nakumatt Select/Blue Label. In addition, the retailer embraced innovation by introducing the Nakumatt Global Prepaid Card in partnership with MasterCard. Nakumatt is the official sponsor of Nakumatt FC, a local professional fo

--- CONTENT EXCERPT ---
1. The Basics of Mergers and Acquisitions Over the past few decades, we have seen countless examples of companies, such as Amazon, Facebook, General Electric, Google, and Cisco, that have grown dramatically and built revenues through aggressive acquisition programs. Seasoned executives and entrepreneurs have always searched for efficient and profitable ways to increase revenues and gain market share. The typical strategic growth options are as follows: organic, inorganic, or by external means. Examples of organic growth are hiring additional salespeople, developing new products, and expanding geographically. The best example of inorganic growth is an acquisition of another firm, something that is often done to gain access to a new product line, customer segment, or geography. Finally, external revenue growth opportunities include franchising, licensing, joint ventures, strategic alliances, and the appointment of overseas distributors, which are available to growing companies as an alternative to mergers and acquisitions as a growth engine. Figure 1-1 discusses the benefits of organic versus other forms of growth. This book focuses primarily on mergers and acquisitions (M&A) as a means of growing, although toward the end of the book certain external means are explored as well. Figure 1-1. M&A Basics: Buy Versus Build At the heart of all decisions regarding mergers and acquisitions, regardless of the global financial crisis, is a fundamental question: Are we better off buying a

JOINT VENTURES – A PRIMER 1. Introduction Joint ventures have become increasingly important as a medium through which companies undertake signiﬁcant business activities and projects. A major factor has been the escalating size of transactions and projects, which frequently require commitments on a scale beyond the resources of individual companies. Equally important, particularly in the cross-border context, are changing business conditions and markets (largely as a result of changes in political and economic conditions, deregulation and technological developments) which provide opportunities for companies to enter into joint ventures as part of their strategic planning in relation to particular industries or markets. The rationale and perceived advantages of particular joint ventures (both large and small) vary from case to case. Whatever the advantages for the individual participant, however, a joint venture inevitably involves a sacriﬁce of the control and ﬂexibility which it might otherwise have enjoyed had it undertaken a business or project independently, and exposure to the tensions that are an inherent part of a joint venture relationship. Against this background, the challenge for lawyers involved in planning and documenting a joint venture is to help create a structure that not only meets the technical, operational, ﬁnancial, accounting, regulatory, legal and tax requirements of the venture but also encapsulates the underlying commercial objectives of the individual

The Consolidated Guidelines on the Substantive Assessment of Mergers under the Competition Act provide that a joint venture that performs all the functions of an autonomous economic entity for a long duration, which is a duration of ten years will be considered as a merger under the Competition Act A joint venture (JV) refers to a business arrangement under which two or more parties come together to undertake a project by pooling their resources together.

Kenya Data Protection Act Quick Guide 2021 Introduction Overview Kenya has promulgated a Data Protection Act…. Transfer of Personal Data Outside Kenya The Data Protection Bill that has been a subject of discussion for years, was passed into law on 8 November 2019 when the president assented to it. The Data protection Bill 2019, follows the path taken by the European Union in enacting the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in May 2018 and makes Kenya the third country in East Africa to have legislation dedicated to data protection. ➢ Every data controller or data processor is required to ensure the storage, on a server or data centre located in Kenya, of at least one serving copy of personal data to which the Act applies. ➢ Cross-border processing of sensitive personal data is prohibited and only allowed when certain conditions are met or under certain circumstances specified in the Act (Part IV – 48 – 50). This law was expedited following concerns raised over the Huduma Namba registration exercise, with those opposed to the process raising concern about the safety of citizen’s personal data collected by the Government. ➢ A data controller or data processor may transfer personal data to another country where— Purpose of the Act i. the data controller or data processor has given proof to the Data Commissioner on the appropriate safeguards with respect to the security and protection of the personal data; ii. the data subject has given explicit consent to the proposed tran

Key Franchising Considerations Introduction Franchising is a contractual arrangement by which franchisors, in exchange for an upfront payment or a series of payments (usually both), grant franchisees (usually independently owned and ﬁnanced) the right to operate a business and sell or distribute goods or services, or goods and services, identiﬁed with the franchisor’s trademarks, trade names, and other intellectual property. Franchisors typically exercise signiﬁcant control over the format and quality standards of franchisee businesses by requiring them to operate according to the franchisor’s requirements, set out in one or more contractually binding franchise manuals. Franchisors normally take care not to be involved in the management of the businesses of the franchisees so that the business risk is with the franchisees, but they usually provide support to assist franchisees in complying with the franchise agreement and franchise manuals. Franchising can have many beneﬁts for a foreign supplier, including the ability to expand and capture new markets quickly with limited capital expenditure. However, although franchising is lightly regulated in Kenya, counsel advising prospective franchisors planning to establish a franchising arrangement should consider the risks and requirements that may arise. This paper considers the following aspects of franchising: § Key legal and regulatory requirements governing franchising arrangements, including: • • • • • • absence of a statutory

MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS &amp; TAKEOVERS MERGERS A merger is a voluntary amalgamation of two firms on roughly equal terms into one new legal entity. The decision is usually mutual between the merging companies. Mergers are mostly geared towards enjoying greater economies of scale and increasing a companies competitiveness in the market. The term “merger” is defined in Section 2 of the Competition Act, 2010 (the Act) as “any acquisition of shares, business or other assets, whether inside or outside of Kenya, resulting in the change of control of a business, part of a business or an asset of a business in Kenya, in any manner and includes a takeover. Sec 41 of the Act goes ahead to define mergers in greater details to includea) the purchase or lease of shares, acquisition of an interest, or purchase of assets of the other undertaking in question;(b) the acquisition of a controlling interest in a section of the business of an undertaking capable of itself being operated independentlyThe Capital Markets (Take-overs and mergers) Regulations, 2002 provides that a merger is an arrangement whereby the assets of two or more companies become vested in or under the control of one company6/8/202214WAKIMANI 6/8/20227WAKIMANI 6/8/2022WAKIMANI6 6/8/2022WAKIMANI5 6/8/20224WAKIMANILINK POISON PILLPoison pills allow existing shareholders the right to purchase additional shares at a discount, effectively diluting the ownership interest of a new, hostile party.

Law of Limited liability Partnerships What is an LLP s6 - An LLP is not a partnership; rather it is a body corporate registered under the Limited Liability Partnership Act, No 42 of 2011 (the “Act”). On being registered under the Act, an LLP becomes a body corporate with perpetual succession with a legal personality separate from that of its partners or members. The idea of LLPs came about in the UK in the 1990s when some of the larger professional services partnerships became increasingly concerned by the risk of substantial personal liability of their partners, and applied pressure on government to address the issue. The consequence of this pressure was the entity called LLP, which retains the internal flexibility of a partnership but carries the all important limitation of liability for the partners. The law applicable to LLPs The main law applicable to LLPs is the Limited Liability Partnership Act, No 42 of 2011. s8 - The Partnership Act shall apply to an LLP except so far as a provision of the Act expressly provides otherwise. Like a company, an LLP must be formed by application to and registered at the companies registry. The Registrar of Companies is the Registrar of LLPs, and she may depute a deputy or an assistant registrar to exercise her functions under the Act. A body corporate Unlike a general or limited partnership, an LLP is a body corporate with unlimited capacity and has a legal capacity separate from its members.

The law applicable to LLPs • The main law applicable to LLPs is the Limited Liability Partnership Act, No 42 of 2011. • s8 - The Partnership Act shall apply to an LLP except so far as a provision of the Act expressly provides otherwise. • Like a company, an LLP must be formed by application to and registered at the companies registry. • The Registrar of Companies is the Registrar of LLPs, and she may depute a deputy or an assistant registrar to exercise her functions under the Act. 3 Limited Liability Partnership 3.

1. Business structures § The four principal business structures are the sole proprietorship, the partnership, the limited liability partnership, and the company. § Sole proprietorships are the most common business structure and involve little formality, but the liability of the sole proprietor is personal and unlimited. § Two or more persons who wish to conduct business can form an ordinary partnership. Such partnerships are subject to greater regulation than sole proprietorships, but less regulation than limited liability partnerships and companies. The liability of the partners is personal and unlimited. § Limited liability partnerships were created largely to be a suitable business vehicle for large professional firms. In many respects, limited liability partnerships closely resemble companies. § Public companies are so called because they can offer to sell their shares to the public at large. Private companies cannot offer to sell their shares to the public at large. There are other notable differences between public and private companies. § The vast majority of companies are limited companies, and so their members will usually have limited liability. Introduction A person who wishes to engage in some form of business activity will need to do so via some form of business structure, with differing business structures providing different advantages and disadvantages.

DIGITAL/ MOBILE LENDING Modern day lending is moving towards digital lending and away from Banks with emergence of mobile financial services. Digital technology is transforming the consumer loan industry by providing borrowers with greater simplicity, efficiency, and transparency. The lending process refers to the sequence of activities an FSP (Financial Service Provider) performs to provide credit from acquiring and onboarding a customer, evaluating the customer and disbursing the loan, receiving repayments and following up on past-due loans. Throughout the lending process, the FSP builds customer engagement and loyalty through high-touch interactions that adapt to client needs and preferences. The FSP’s lending involves the digital channels for acquisition, disbursement, repayment, and engagement and by leveraging digitized data and advanced algorithms for credit decisions, collections, and customer engagement. Digital lenders use digital data from different business functions and build the Data Bank to make quicker, automated, and more accurate underwriting decisions using both conventional and alternative data sources and advanced algorithms and analytics to quickly and remotely ‘score’ potential clients and make credit decisions.

MERGERS AND ACǪUISITIONS: THE NUPTIALS OF COMPANIES IN CORPORATE WORLD Harry Kiletyen Advocate of the High Court of Kenya. LLM Commercial Law (UCT) 2022 ). April 24, 2021 “It is clear that you cannot stay in the top league if you only grow internally. You cannot catch up just by internal growth. If you want to stay in the top league, you must combine.” -- Daniel Vasella, Chief Executive Oflicer, Novartis, July 2002. In the world or mergers and acquisitions who you merge with plays an important role in your ability to achieve strategic objectives, but it’s how you merge that will ultimately determine your success. Contract intelligence is one example of the more nuanced strategic value that a corporate marriage can bring. Mergers and acquisitions have become a common phenomenon in recent times. Companies have been actively involved in mergers and acquisitions domestically as well as internationally. The increased competition in the global market has prompted the Companies to go global for mergers and acquisitions as an important strategic choice. Mergers & Acquisitions (M&A) are the strategic growth devices in the hands of more and more Companies not only to stay in the competition but also to extend their margins, market share and dominance globally. The scale and the pace at which merger activities are coming up are remarkable. In the sense, mergers and acquisitions has become a strategic concept to grow quickly for a number of leading companies’ world over. The booms in mer

FIRM 18 - CLASS E COMMERCIAL TRANSACTIONS PART 7 Liquidation of an Unregistered Companies What is an unregistered company? Unregistered company includes any association and any company other than a company registered under the Companies Act, 2015. Companies registered under the Companies Act, 2015 are private and public limited or unlimited companies. All other entities are therefore considered unregistered companies for purposes of Insolvency Act, 2015. Circumstances in which unregistered company can be liquidated Liquidation is neither defined under the Insolvency Act, 2015 nor the Companies Act, 2015. The Black’s Law Dictionary defines ‘liquidate’ as to settle an obligation by payment or to determine the liabilities and distribute the assets of an entity especially in bankruptcy or dissolution. Liquidation of an unregistered company is a new concept introduced in the new Insolvency Act, 2015. An unregistered company can be liquidated like any other registered company under Part VI of the Insolvency Act, 2015. This part provides for liquidation of registered companies. Under this part, liquidation may be either: Voluntary – which can either be; Members’ Voluntary liquidation – where a resolution has been passed by members for voluntary liquidation and the directors have sworn a statutory declaration as to the ability of the company to pay its debts. Creditors’ Voluntary liquidation - where no statutory declaration has been made as above to assure creditors of payment of the

University of London Press Ltd v University Tutorial Press Ltd [1916] 2 Ch 601 Court: Chancery Division Judges: Peterson J Date decided: 26 July 1916 Examiners were hired to create exam scripts for the University of London. Peterson J held that the papers were original literary works: Assuming that they are ``literary work'’, the question then is whether they are original. The word ``original'’ does not in this connection mean that the work must be the expression of original or inventive thought. Copyright Acts are not concerned with the originality of ideas, but with the expression of thought, and, in the case of ``literary work'’, with the expression of thought in print or writing. The originality which is required relates to the expression of the thought. But the Act does not require that the expression must be in an original or novel form, but that the work must not be copied from another work — that it should originate from the author. In the present case it was not suggested that any of the papers were copied. Professor Lodge and Mr Jackson proved that they had thought out the questions which they set, and that they made notes or memoranda for future questions and drew on those notes for the purposes of the questions which they set. The papers which they prepared originated from themselves, and were, within the meaning of the Act, original. It was said, however, that they drew upon the stock of knowledge common to mathematicians, and that the time spent in producing the

How does the mergers and acquisitions (M&A) process start? The process is more informatively looked at from the Target’s point of view. The Target may decide to put itself up for sale because it needs to for ﬁnancial reasons, because it thinks it has reached its peak value, or because one or more shareholders need or want liquidity; or it may have been approached by a potential Buyer (often a customer or supplier) who wants to talk about “matter of mutual interest.” Before the Target puts itself up for sale, it is likely that its corporate and legal aDairs will have to be cleaned up. The Target’s lawyers may or may not have had close contact and involvement with their client during the course of their engagement. Companies vary widely in how highly they value their lawyer’s input and the degree to which they pay attention to legal matters. The sale process is where the cracks in the wall will show. Sometimes costly and un- rectiﬁable mistakes have been made, and the sale price will reﬂect them. Even if signiﬁcant mistakes have not been made, there will always be corporate housekeeping cleanup that will have to be done. Common problems include improperly documented customer arrangements; vague bonus arrangements for employees; nonexistent, inadequate, or unsigned customary employee arrangements (conﬁdentiality agreements, covenants not to compete, etc.); or license agreements that terminate upon an acquisition.

M&A IN AFRICA Current Trends, 2023 www.bowmanslaw.com 1 INTRODUCTION In this, our annual Africa M&A roundup, we discuss in brief the developing trends from 2023, followed by a targeted review of select jurisdictional developments. M&A in Africa has not been immune to global challenges, but remains resilient. There have been notable developments in the fintech and renewable energy spaces respectively and an increase in demand for African exports as the global demand for essential minerals continues to rise. The African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) and related agreements and protocols are gaining traction, already growing regional value chains and enhancing collaboration and capabilities. African deal metrics have remained largely constant. There has been an uptick in cross-border deals and restructurings, an emerging trend of joint ventures and the re-emergence of auction sales. Across Africa, exchanges are cutting red tape and embarking on simplification projects in an effort to increase listings amid the uptick in take-privates and unbundlings. Regulatory, public interest and local ownership considerations and shareholder activism are playing an increasing role in deal structuring across Africa. So too are in-country risk factors. Highly negotiated clauses include limitation of liability provisions, security, conditionality, purchase price mechanisms, material adverse change and force majeure clauses. The use of legal technology is commonplace and pockets of differen

MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS: THE NUPTIALS OF COMPANIES IN CORPORATE WORLD Harry Kiletyen Advocate of the High Court of Kenya. LLM Commercial Law (UCT) 2022 ). April 24, 2021 “It is clear that you cannot stay in the top league if you only grow internally. You cannot catch up just by internal growth. If you want to stay in the top league, you must combine.” -- Daniel Vasella, Chief Executive ODicer, Novartis, July 2002. In the world or mergers and acquisitions who you merge with plays an important role in your ability to achieve strategic objectives, but it’s how you merge that will ultimately determine your success. Contract intelligence is one example of the more nuanced strategic value that a corporate marriage can bring. Mergers and acquisitions have become a common phenomenon in recent times. Companies have been actively involved in mergers and acquisitions domestically as well as internationally. The increased competition in the global market has prompted the Companies to go global for mergers and acquisitions as an important strategic choice. Mergers & Acquisitions (M&A) are the strategic growth devices in the hands of more and more Companies not only to stay in the competition but also to extend their margins, market share and dominance globally. The scale and the pace at which merger activities are coming up are remarkable. In the sense, mergers and acquisitions has become a strategic concept to grow quickly for a number of leading companies’ world over. The booms in merg

Background Protecting minority shareholders' rights is not a common practice in takeovers. The laws and market practices have often protected the majority shareholders at the expense of minority shareholders. In Kenya, the law has been no more than unstable regarding the protection of minority shareholders' rights. Before 2019, the Companies Act 2015 provided for compulsory acquisition rights (squeeze-in) , allowing the acquiring company to "buy out" the dissenting minority shareholders. This is similar to the "drag along" principle in the repealed Companies Act. The sell-out rights were two parts: the acquiring company must acquire or unconditionally contract to acquire 90% of the shares relating to the offer and 90% of the voting rights in the target company. The law also provided for sell-out rights , which allowed the acquiring company to buy out the minority shareholders by purchasing their shares at the offer price, thus allowing the minority shareholders to exit the deal. However, the Statute Law (Miscellaneous Amendments) Act (Act No. 12 of 2019) (Amendment Act) introduced an amendment to the 2015 Act by lowering the threshold from 90% to 50%. The lowered threshold allowed the acquiring company to force out the non-assenting shareholders effortlessly if 50% of the issued shares accepted the offer. This change received a backlash as it undermined the minority shareholders' rights to decline a hostile takeover offer. This law was again changed in 2019, raising the thres

(1) An error in the grantor identifier entered by the registrant in a notice renders the registration of the notice ineffective.

MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS • Mergers are like marriages. They are the bringing together of two individuals. If you wouldn't marry someone for the 'operational efficiencies' they offer in the running of a household, then why would you combine two companies with unique cultures and identities for that reason? Simon Sinek • Reasonable mergers generate substantial synergies, so that provides for earnings and cash-flow growth even if it doesn't provide for revenue growth, and I think that's a big driver. 2/8/2024 WAKIMANI 2 2/8/2024 I 3 COMPANY X • • • • • Private Co.

NEGOTIABLE INSTRUMENTS INTRODUCTION There are certain documents, which are freely used in commercial transactions and monetary dealings. These documents, if they satisfy certain conditions, are known as negotiable instruments. ‘Negotiable’ is a word to mean transferable from one person to another in return for consideration. ‘Instrument’ means a written document by which right is created in favor of some person. The law relating to negotiable instrument is contained in the Bill of Exchange Act (Cap. 27) and the Cheque Act (Cap 41), which deals with promissory notes, bills of exchange and cheques. As per the Act, no definition is given. However, in simple, a negotiable instrument can be described as a commercial document which represents money. It passes to a bonafide transferee free from any defect. Therefore a negotiable instrument refers to a document, which entitles a person to a sum of money or money value which is transferable from one person to another by mere delivery or by endorsement and delivery. NATURE OF NEGOTIABLE INSTRUMENTS A negotiable instrument is a Chose in Action. A chose in action is a property right which cannot be enjoyed by physical possession, but which can only be enforced by legal action, for Example a debt, patent or copyright etc. Most types of chose in action are assignable but; 1. Notice to the debtor is always advisable and sometimes essential; and 2. The assignee can obtain no better rights than the assignor. 3. However, out of customary usage

The Law of Partnerships Mwangi J Mbogo ATP 108 – Commercial Transactions May 2018 Definition of partnership s2 – “partnership” means the relationship which exists between persons who carry on business in common with a view to making a profit. A partnership is not a distinct legal entity; rather it is a relationship between persons. The key element of the relationship between partners is that they are carrying on business, in common, with a view to making profit. “Business” includes any trade, profession or occupation. The objects of the partnership must be lawful, otherwise the partnership will be deemed illegal and liable to dissolution. See Foster v Driscoll [1929] 1 KB 70. The Act in s3 excludes certain bodies from consideration as partnerships: Limited liability partnerships Bodies corporate; or Foreign limited partnerships Types of partnerships General partnership Limited partnership Limited liability partnership Source of partnership law The main body of law governing partnerships is the Partnership Act, No 16 of 2012 The Act governs general and limited partnerships only. Limited liability partnerships are governed by the Limited Liability Partnership Act, 2011. There will often be a written agreement between the partners setting out the rights and duties of the partners between themselves. The Act sets out those provisions which will apply if no specific agreement is entered into. This is known as the “default rule” (s2). Who is a partner? The partners in a partnership

WWW.BRS.GO.KE PRE-INSOLVENCY MORATORIUM BY: DIANA MUMO, SENIOR ASSISTANT OFFICIAL RECEIVER A new provision under the Insolvency Act, 2015 has been introduced giving reprieve to distressed businesses. The purpose of the provision referred to as Pre-Insolvency moratorium is meant to prevent creditors from taking an enforcement action against a company while it considers its options for rescue, whether by new investment, formulating a restructuring plan, refinancing, sale or other rescue option available. What these provisions do is that they give time to the company to analyse its options. The process leaves the affairs of the company in the control of the company/directors under the supervision of a licenced Insolvency Practitioner who acts as a Monitor. The moratorium takes effect upon filing of Documents in Court and lasts for 30 days from and including the day on which the moratorium takes effect and may extended by Court for a further 30 days or more. The court shall endorse the copies of the documents filed and shall issue an Order recognising the moratorium in the Form provided under the Insolvency regulations. To obtain a pre-insolvency moratorium, the Directors have to file with the Court, among other documents, a statement from the Monitor indicating that the proposed moratorium has a reasonable prospect of achieving its aims and the Company has sufficient funds available to it during the proposed moratorium to enable it to carry on its business.

The 2nd respondent contends that the petition is not properly before the Court as there is no resolution for its institution passed in accordance with the company’s Articles of association; that the Articles require that a resolution of the company should be signed by a majority of the directors present in Kenya; and that the affidavits in support of the suit are sworn by persons other than those authorised by the Article or by the resolution relied on. 3.

Introduction to Guarantees A guarantee is a legal promise made by one party (the guarantor) to fulﬁll the obligations or settle the debt of another party (the principal debtor) if the latter fails to do so. Guarantees are commonly used in commercial transactions to provide security and assurance to creditors. They play a crucial role in risk mitigation and enhancing the creditworthiness of the debtor in the eyes of the creditor. In Kenya and under English law, guarantees are subject to various statutory provisions and case law principles that shape their formation, execution, and enforcement. 2. Legal Framework Governing Guarantees In Kenya, the legal framework governing guarantees is largely based on English common law, with certain statutory provisions that align with local practices. The key legal instruments include: The Law of Contract Act (Cap. 23, Kenya) This Act requires guarantees to be in writing and signed by the guarantor. Section 3(1) mandates that for a guarantee to be enforceable, there must be written evidence signed by the party to be charged with it. Section 3(1) of the LCA states: “No suit shall be brought whereby to charge the defendant upon any special promise to answer for the debt, default or miscarriages of another person unless the agreement upon which such suit is brought, or some memorandum or note thereof, is in writing and signed by the party to be charged therewith or some other person thereunto by

Chapter One Sources of Law in Kenya 1.1 What is Law? The world of commerce and industry is founded on distinct pillars of social order. The establishment and regulation of the various institutions of society depend upon frameworks of rules to which they owe their existence and from which they draw their power and legitimacy. These rules are promulgated and enforced in accordance with a defined legal system. As has been rightly observed, “[i]n order to ensure good order and the smooth running of society, it is necessary to formulate general rules which work well enough in the majority of cases.”1 Accordingly, there is need in every society to promulgate normative rules, principles and doctrines to regulate social order. Such rules and principles must be effectively binding in the sense that derogation from them, or breach thereof, attracts penal or other remedial consequences. The assemblage of these doctrines, principles, rules, and regulations, may, in very loose terms, be collectively referred to as law. Glanville Williams defines law as “… the body of principles recognized and applied by the state in the administration of justice …” According to him, it consists of “… the rules recognized and acted on by courts of justice.”2 In this sense, law includes all rules of conduct enacted by Parliament or established by court decisions in conformity with fundamental principles and doctrines recognized as essential for the administration of justice. Their binding nature demands tha

SAMPLE EXAM QUESTION: GUARANTEES Question: ABC Ltd, a construction company, was awarded a contract by the Government of Kenya to construct a highway. To secure the performance of its obligations under the contract, ABC Ltd approached XBank Ltd for a loan facility of KES 500 million. XBank Ltd agreed to provide the loan on the condition that ABC Ltd’s directors, Mr. Mwangi and Ms. Achieng, provide personal guarantees for the full amount of the loan. Mr. Mwangi and Ms. Achieng signed a written guarantee agreement, which was properly executed. Six months into the project, ABC Ltd ran into ﬁnancial diLiculties and defaulted on its loan repayments. XBank Ltd notiﬁed Mr. Mwangi and Ms. Achieng that it intended to enforce the guarantees and require them to repay the outstanding amount of KES 350 million. Unbeknownst to the guarantors, ABC Ltd had entered into a side agreement with the Government of Kenya that varied some of the original terms of the construction contract, extending the completion deadline by six months and altering certain payment milestones. The side agreement was not disclosed to XBank Ltd, and neither Mr. Mwangi nor Ms. Achieng was informed of the changes. Mr. Mwangi now claims that the variation of the construction contract without his knowledge or consent has discharged his liability under the guarantee. On the other hand, Ms. Achieng argues that she should be released from her guarantee because she was not provided with proper notice by XBank Ltd of ABC Ltd’s

It is binding upon anyone who acquires shares and can be enforced by a shareholder if there is a breach of his rights as a shareholder. It cannot be set aside for misrepresentation or undue influence and the court cannot imply any terms into it. Moreover, it can be amended by a 75% majority of shareholders present and voting at a members meeting rendering vulnerable a minority shareholder. The Articles are a public document and accordingly, available for anyone to obtain a copy from the Companies Registry. A shareholders’ agreement on the other hand is a private document. What is it? A shareholders’ agreement is a contract between the shareholders in a private limited company. It is intended to regulate the relationship between the shareholders. It may specify things which shareholders must do and may specify things which they must not do. The company may also be a party to the agreement which is particularly important if the intention is to bind the company to the provisions of any such agreement. The provisions of the agreement will be legally binding and enforceable by all parties to it.

Tax Revision Chart Government Uses of Taxes in Kenya a. Redistribution of income Kenya has a progressive tax structure whereas income increases one pays a higher percentage od taxes, since high income earners pay slightly more than the low earners taxation enables the redistribution of incomes in the economy. b. Controlling externalities An externality refers to a bi-product or consequence of activity (commercial or industrial) felt by a third party, like pollution. In a bid to discourage negative externalities such as noise pollution, the government can impose a tax. c. Revenue generation By taxing citizens, the government can generate money that can be spent to improve the lives of the citizens or to cater for any other government expenditure. Some areas where the government uses taxes include the provision of social welfare and infrastructure development. d. Finance debts A fraction of the revenues collected go to financing the debts accrued by the government e. Representation The people choose the government to represent them to ensures the responsible management of their taxes Direct Taxes Corporation tax ● Paid by corporations for their annual income - 30% ● File on itax ● Covers a period of 12 months ● A payment slip is generated via itax PAYE Instalment Tax ● Paid by persons who have tax payable for any year that amounts to KS 40,000 and above. ● It is paid in advance at four equal instalments. ● Is paid before the year of income. ● The rate of taxation for instalment

This article is brought to you by the William & Mary Law School Scholarship Repository. http://scholarship.law.wm.edu/wmblr THE BUSINESS JUDGMENT RULE AS AN IMMUNITY DOCTRINE LORI MCMILLAN* ABSTRACT The business judgment rule is a judicially created doctrine that protects directors from personal civil liability for the decisions they make on behalf of a corporation. In today’s era of corporate scandals, global financial meltdowns, and directorial malfeasance, it has become especially important in setting the bar for when directors are appropriately responsible to shareholders for their actions. Traditionally the business judgment rule has been regarded as a standard of liability, although it has never really been explored or enunciated as such. This view determines eligibility for business judgment rule protection of a directorial decision after an examination of certain preconditions. An alternate view has developed that posits the business judgment rule is actually an abstention doctrine, and should be applied automatically absent the establishment of the same preconditions as the liability standard approach, only to be used as nullifying factor

The Company as a Criminal: Comparative Examination of some Trends and Challenges Relating to Criminal Liability of Corporate Persons George O. Otieno Ochich1 2008. 1. ABSTRACT As sophistication engulfs the business sphere, an increasing number of individuals prefer to incorporate their business enterprises into companies to facilitate their enjoyment of the advantages of corporate trading.1 That trend has seen many activities that were previously the preserve of natural persons being increasingly undertaken under the veil of incorporation. Incidental to such activities are bound to be those that have criminal dimensions. Of course, there exist a whole lot of persons who would seek to use the veil of incorporation to disguise their individual criminal intents and acts. Thus, in the pursuit of their business objectives companies engage in criminal activities, some of which are deliberate while others are merely incidental to their mandate. While certain such criminal activities may be blamed on the individuals who comprise the company, others are attributable to none other than the company itself. As the number of corporations increases and their involvement in diverse spheres of life expands, the need to call them to account for their criminal wrongdoing equally grows. This development poses new and complex challenges to criminal law as traditionally understood. Various jurisdictions have had to expand or reorient their perspectives of criminal responsibility in response to th

--- CONTENT EXCERPT ---
The Key Elements of Insurance Contracts Offer and Acceptance An insurance contract begins with an application. You work with an agent or broker and provide the necessary information via their application form. If your offer meets the insurance company’s criteria, the company may accept it. You might have to pay your first premium before they will accept it, as is the case when you apply for property or liability insurance. Most of the time, the insurance agent can accept the offer for the company they represent. They issue a temporary contract, or binder, which activates your coverage immediately. After the company reviews your application, they issue a formal, detailed policy. If an agent cannot bind the insurance company, your application goes to the insurance company and you do not have coverage until acceptance. This might require making your first payment of your premium, such as when you apply for life insurance. Some companies also require a medical examination and will only activate coverage on the date you pass the exam. Legal Consideration Consideration is the agreed value between you and your insurance company. For you, it means you agree to abide by the contract and pay premiums. For the insurance company, it means they’ll pay if you submit a claim for a covered loss. Competent Parties Only legally competent parties can enter into an insurance contract. This means you must be of legal age of majority, of sound mind, and not disqualified from the contract by law. T

For more information about NAFER, visit www.NAFER.org The Legacy Of Twyne’s Case By Daniel Seligman W e know the facts only from court records. One day, a sheriff showed up on the property of a farmer name Pierce. The sheriff had a mission: he had a writ of execution (a court order) that gave him the right to take Pierce’s sheep to satisfy a debt that Pierce owed to someone called “C.”1 And that is when the trouble started. Pierce insisted that he didn’t have the sheep anymore. They now belonged to Twyne, to whom Pierce also owed money. Yes, Pierce’s mark was on the sheep and he had recently sheared some of them and even sold others. From the records we can infer that Pierce and Twyne were neighbors and perhaps friends, and that Pierce didn’t mind repaying Twyne, but he objected to paying anything (sheep or money) to C. Pierce had apparently heard in advance of the sheriff ’s visit and had given everything he owned – his sheep, clothes and other personal possessions – by deed to Twyne.2 As a result, there was nothing for the sheriff to recover. All of Pierce’s property was beyond the sheriff ’s reach, thus depriving C of any repayment. What happened next is somewhat unclear but Twyne and his friends (perhaps Pierce) physically resisted the sheriff “with force.” Getting in an altercation with the sheriff – then or now –

The cross-border insolvency regime in Kenya. To what extent has the Kenyan regime followed the UNCITRAL implementation guidelines? BY: NDWIGA SUSAN NJERI INTRODUCTION National insolvency laws provide treatment and remedy to the issues arising out of the corporate restructuring drives within the jurisdictions of the national laws. The law relating to insolvency that is operative in Kenya has remained in force without any substantive reform for about five decades. The changing economic climate coupled with the drive by multilateral institutions for institutionalization of the rule of law and good governance in developing countries has created a pressing need for amelioration of insolvency law and cross-border insolvency law in Kenya. The initiative is undertaken within the broad context of facilitating growth of trade and investment and foreign direct investment in particular with a view to reducing poverty. Cross-border insolvency in Kenya is a new creature that came along after the enactment of the new Insolvency Act. Cross-border insolvency deals with regulation of how debtors who owe debts and have assets in another country or creditors should be treated. It is more concerned with insolvency of companies which operate in more than one country rather than individual bankruptcy. The United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) has come with the Model Law for the cross border mergers & acquisitions exercise. It was established in 1966 as a subsidiary body of

Primer: Trust Deeds under Common Law Introduction Trust deeds are foundational documents in commercial law, used in a wide range of transactions to create and manage trusts. Trusts allow one party (the trustee) to hold and manage assets on behalf of others (the beneﬁciaries). Trust deeds formalize this arrangement by setting out the terms and conditions governing the trust. Understanding the structure and application of trust deeds is essential for commercial lawyers, particularly in complex ﬁnancial and real estate transactions. 1. Trusts under English Law Deﬁnition of a Trust A trust is a legal relationship where a trustee holds assets for the beneﬁt of the beneﬁciaries. Trusts are a key component of English law, reﬂecting the division between legal and equitable ownership. The trustee has legal ownership, but they must act in the interest of the beneﬁciaries, who hold the equitable (or beneﬁcial) interest. Key Components of a Trust § § § § Settlor: The person who creates the trust by transferring property to the trustee. Trustee: The individual or entity holding and managing the trust property. Beneﬁciary: The person(s) beneﬁting from the trust. Trust Property: The assets or property held in the trust. Types of Trusts § § Express Trusts: Created intentionally by the settlor. Can be ﬁxed (speciﬁc beneﬁciaries and interests) or discretionary (trustees decide how to distribute assets). Implied Trusts: Resulting from actions or circumstances, rather than explicit intentions.

SETTING UP OF A TRUST IN KENYA A trust is a legal arrangement through which property is held by a third-party for the benefit of another party, called the beneficiary. The person who creates the trust is the “settlor." The settlor must transfer her property to the trust, which is then handled and administered by the trustee, or administrator, although the settlor may reserve specific powers to herself with respect to the trust. A trust deed is the document that details the trust's terms and conditions and lists the parties involved. In a trust deed, the settlor is simply the creator of the trust. Registration of a charitable trust or a foundation in Kenya generally requires the following: 1. Name of the Trust or Foundation 2. Main Object of the Trust. Charitable trust must fall in at least one of the following categories:  Relief of poverty e.g. homes & orphanages, hospitals  Advancement of education  Advancement of religion  Advancement of Health or saving of lives  Advancement of environmental protection or improvement  Trusts beneficial to the community not falling under the preceding heads e.g. advancing art, culture, racial harmony. 3. Name of the Settlor/ Donor  Full name, copy of ID card/passport ; If company, a copy of the certificate of registration  Address  Domicile and residence 4. Beneficiaries: This could be a class of persons in the society e.g. bright needy children; orphans between 0-10 years or an orphanage, cancer patients, women etc. There is also

COMPANIES ● The Companies Act, 2015 Section 3 defines a company as "a company formed and registered under this Act or an existing company." ● This definition is vague. In legal theory, a company can be defined as an association of a member of persons who come together for some common object or objects. (In ordinary usage it is associated with economic purposes or gain). ● A company is an artificial legal person created by complying with the provisions of the Companies Act, 2015 of the Laws of Kenya. Fundamental concepts of company law 1. The concept of legal personality ● Legal personality means that the law recognizes certain persons as having certain legal rights and duties which can be enforced by the courts. ● Apart from human beings, the law also accords legal personality to corporations. A corporation is an artificial person created by law, and once it comes into being it is treated by law as a person in its own right, and is independent from the individual members who compose it. ● Corporate personality thus encompasses the capacity of a corporation to have a name of its own, to sue and be sued, and the right to purchase, sell, lease, and mortgage its property in its own name. In addition, property cannot be taken away from a corporation without due process of the law. 2. The concept of limited liability ● Liability means the extent to which a person can be made to account by law. One can be made accountable either for the full amount of their debts or else pay towards

Structure of Kenya’s Financial Sector ARIEMBA JARED MOGAKA SOUTH EASTERN UNIVERSITY COLLEGE (A CONSTITUENT COLLEGE OF THE UNIVERSITY OF NAIROBI) BACHELOR OF COMMERCE LECTURE II  The financial market deals with the purchase and sale of money. It therefore involves obtaining money from those who have more than they need by attracting it either as:  deposits through commercial banks;  premiums through insurance companies;  units or shares through Mutual Funds  or shares or bonds through investment banks.  The money drawn from the savers is then pooled and allocated throughout the economy by giving it out as loans, common or corporate bonds, treasury bills inter alia.  The financial market in Kenya can be said to have two major functions:  it allocates money capital through identifying those with surplus funds, attracting the funds into a pool and then distributing them to those who need to spend more than they have.  The other function of the financial market is the distribution of the economic risk through the creation and distribution of securities.  Principally, financial market in Kenya comprise:  commercial banks,  non-bank financial institutions,  mortgage companies,  forex bureaus,  development finance institutions,  pension schemes,  SACCOs  the insurance sector and the stock market.

GUARANTEES A contract of guarantee, is defined as “A contract to perform the promise, or discharge the liability of a third person in case of his defaults”. Example: A advances a loan of ksH.10,000 to B, and C promises A that if B does not repay the loan, I will repay it. This is a contract of guarantee. It involves three parties namely, 1. Surety, who gives the guarantee. 2. Principal Debtor, in respect of whose default the guarantee is given. 3. Creditor, to whom the guarantee is given. Example: A supplies goods to B on C’s guaranteeing payment by B to A. This means that if B does not pay, C would be liable to pay. This is a “Contract of Guarantee”. Here B is the principal debtor, C is the surety and A is the creditor. A guarantee may be either “oral” or “written“. Just like any other contract, it should also fulfill all the essentials of a valid contract. As stated already, three parties are involved in a contract of guarantee. At the same time, there are three collateral contracts also namely, 1. As between A and B [A supplies goods to B on credit who promises that he would pay]. 2. As between A and C [C gives guarantee the price of goods, I will pay]. 3. As between C and B [C indemnifies A in case of B’s default in paying the amount to A). Essentials of a Contract of Guarantee 1. Concurrence of All the Parties All the three parties namely, the principal debtor, the creditor and the surety must agree to make such a contract. 2. Liability In a contract of guarantee, liabil

International Commercial Law and Arbitration Conference International Commercial Dispute Resolution and the Place of Judicial Power Chief Justice Robert French AC 22 August 2013, Sydney It is an old saw that the more things change the more they remain the same. While it no doubt illuminates a truth about constants in life, it also has the ring of nonsense about it. No more so than in the areas of interest to this Conference. In the delivery of legal services and in dispute resolution things are changing at a fast pace and nowhere at a faster pace than in the field of global trade and commerce which increasingly interpenetrates domestic trade and commerce. Those changes and changes in resolution of commercial disputes challenge long-established perspectives. One of those perspectives concerns the place of the judicial powers of the Commonwealth and the States in the field of international commercial disputes, which are constitutionally within the jurisdiction of Australian courts to resolve. Reference to global trade and commerce conjures the ugly word 'globalisation'. That word, which has crawled out of its birthing cave in the dark landscapes of economics, has now acquired the status of a term of art in the social sciences. It is defined in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy as referring to: fundamental changes in the spatial and temporal contours of social existence, according to which the significance of space or territory undergoes shifts in the face of a no less dra

Both the 1878 Act and the 1882 Act remain in force today. Absolute bills are regulated only by the 1878 Act. Security bills are regulated by the 1882 Act IN New Zealand the New Zealand Chattels Transfer Act of 1924 was replaced by the Personal Property Security Act of 1999The Law Reform Commission of New Zealand said the factors that led to the replacement of the New Zealand Chattels Transfer Act of 1924 were that the law was complex, uncertain, anomalous and inflexible Over the past decade over 80 economies have reformed their legislation governing chattels securities (secured transactions). More recently, reform has been effected in Rwanda, Liberia, Malawi, Gambia, Ghana, Nigeria. Additional reform efforts are now in process in Morocco, Tunisia, Lesotho.In April 2016 Zambia enacted the Moveable Property (Security Interest) Act 3 of 2016 (the MPA)In Uganda the Movable Property Security Interest Act of 2017 (the Movable Property Security Act) was enacted after the Chattels Security Act of 2014 was found to be inadequate In line with Vision 2030 and the economic recovery programme (ESP) initiated by former President Kibaki’s regime, the ease of doing business was part of the strategy to jumpstart the economy by creating a conducive environment for local as well as international investors.This started the raft of reforms that culminated in changes in the Company, Insolvency and Banking Regimes.

A reverse merger or reverse takeover is a transaction in which a private company acquires or merges with (or into) a public “shell” company to become publicly listed. The primary motivation for such a transaction is that it is much less expensive than a full IPO with its extensive Registration Statement (and disclosures) and the detailed guidance and approvals with the CAPITAL Markets Authority or similar agencies in other jurisdictions. Another advantage is likely the ability to not hire an underwriter for the offeror’s stock. As a result, the reverse merger is a way to enter the Kenyan capital market without engaging an underwriter and investment banker. The public company target in this type of transaction is usually a “shell” company since all that exists of such company is its organizational structure with little or no active operations, assets, or liabilities, but listed on a nationally recognized stock exchange and not necessarily actively traded. A principal assumption for undertaking this kind of transaction is that the private company does not need liquidity or capital access immediately. While the process of going public and raising capital is combined in an IPO, in a reverse merger/takeover, these two functions are separate. So, a reverse merger/takeover is not a capital-raising event although the transaction could involve the filing of a Registration Statement or other securities regulatory filings once certain steps are complete.

SHARE AGREEMENT Definition A shareholders’ agreement is essentially a corporate pre-nuptial agreement. A shareholders’ agreement is, as you might expect, an agreement between the shareholders of a company. It can be between all or, in some cases, only some of the shareholders (like, for instance, the holders of a particular class of share). Its purpose is to protect the shareholders’ investment in the company, to establish a fair relationship between the shareholders and govern how the company is run. The agreement will:  set out the shareholders’ rights and obligations;  regulate the sale of shares in the company;  describe how the company is going to be run;  provide an element of protection for minority shareholders and the company; and  define how important decisions are to be made. Usually, it is best to put a shareholders’ agreement in place when the company is formed and issue the first shares. In fact, it can be a positive exercise to ensure there is common understanding of shareholders’ expectations of the business. At that point, the shareholders should, as far as is possible, be of a similar mind about what they expect to offer and get from the company. Indeed if the differences of opinion between the investors at this stage are too strong to form a shareholders’ agreement, it is likely to ring warning bells about the nature of their future working relationship. The investors may choose to defer discussing a shareholders’ agreement in order to get on with the
