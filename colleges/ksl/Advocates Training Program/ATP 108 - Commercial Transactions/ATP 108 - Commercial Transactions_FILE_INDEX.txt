DematerializationThe use paper certificates was the norm until the establishment of the Central Depository and Settlement Corporation (CDSC). The setting up of the CDSC reduced the inefficiencies and risks associated with the paper certificates through immobilization of securities. The CDSC was incorporated in the year 1999 to establish and operate a central depository system and provide central clearing, settlement and depository services for securities initially in Kenya in respect to securities listed on the Nairobi Stock Exchange.The certificates are surrendered and replaced with an electronic record of shares making it safer, faster, easier to transfer. No eligible security could be traded on the securities exchange without being immobilized. By February 2005, all securities listed on the Nairobi Securities Exchange were eligible for immobilization, and all trades in the market were conducted on book entry securities.All the physical certificates thus ceased being used as evidence of ownership of securities of any company quoted at NSE A share is defined as the smallest division of the share capital of the company which represents the proportion of ownership of the shareholders in the company.

The Capital Markets Authority and its Regulations The Capital Markets Authority (CMA) is the regulatory body for the capital markets in Kenya. It is responsible for regulating the issuance, trading and listing of securities, as well as the provision of investment services. The CMA also regulates mergers and acquisitions (M&A) involving companies listed on the Nairobi Securities Exchange (NSE). The CMA's M&A regulations are designed to protect the interests of investors and to ensure that M&A transactions are conducted in a fair and transparent manner. The regulations cover a wide range of issues, including: The disclosure of information to investors The approval of M&A transactions by the CMA The protection of minority shareholders The CMA's M&A regulations apply to all M&A transactions involving companies listed on the NSE. However, the regulations do not apply to M&A transactions involving companies that are not listed on the NSE.

OVERVIEW OF THE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK IN FINANCIAL SERVICES SECTOR a) Central Bank of Kenya The Central Bank of Kenya was established in 1966 through an Act of Parliament – the Central Bank of Kenya Act of 1966. The establishment of the Bank was a direct result of the desire among the three East African states to have independent monetary and financial policies. The Central Bank of Kenya Act of 1966 set out objectives and functions and gave the Central Bank limited autonomy. Since the amendment of the Central Bank of Kenya Act in April 1997, the Central Bank operations have been restructured to conform with ongoing economic reforms. There is now greater monetary autonomy. The Mandate of the Central Bank Section 4 of the Central Bank of Kenya Act states the core mandate of the Bank as follows: The principal object of the Bank shall be to formulate and implement monetary policy directed to achieving and maintaining stability in the general level of prices; The Bank shall foster the liquidity, solvency and proper functioning of a stable market- based financial system; and Subject to (1) and (2), the Bank shall support the economic policy of the Government, including its objectives for growth and employment. b) Capital Markets Authority The Capital Market is part of the Financial Market that provides funds for long term development. This is a market that brings together lenders(Investors) of capital and Borrowers(companies that sell securities to the public) of capital. In Novembe

CENTRAL BANK DIGITAL CURRENCY (CBDC)CDBC is a complex piece of software and a complex digital framework capable of delivering both benefits and shocks across the economy. Money and payments have evolved continuously throughout history. Our wallets are progressively being replaced by smartphones and other electronic gadgets in our pockets. These shifts have far- reaching implications for the nature of money, raising the question whether central banks should issue digital currencies for consumer usage.The financial sector and payments industry has gradually and consistently evolved nationally and globally. This was also fast tracked by the COVID-19 pandemic which changed the way payments are made to a more digital mode. This has led to the emergence of digital currencies which have facilitated payment transactions. Such digital currencies include: Cryptocurrency, Stable Coin, Electronic Money and Central Bank Digital Currency. A digital currency is a form of payment issued by a central bank, serves as a legal tender that exists in an electronic form, and is exchangeable with the fiat currency.

With share acquisition, all assets, liabilities and obligations are taken (know and unknown) ➢ Share purchase is simpler? Only asset is shares. In asset purchase, more complex as each separate asset constituting the target business is separately transferred to the purchaser meaning more consents and approvals e.g. contracts (change of control clauses), land. ➢ Share acquisitions can also be complex- often involve more than one seller, or large number of shareholders to negotiate with, having conflicting interests and separately represented ➢ Shares or Assets contd.

PARTNERSHIPS GENERAL PARTNERSHIPS & LIMITED LIABILITY PARTNERSHIPS SOMANE BY MAHAT PARTNERSHIPS DEED OF PARTNERSHIP • Although there is no need to have a formal partnership agreement, the vast majority of partnerships do draw such an agreement up. It is important to recall that a partnership can be created informally and that people can be partners even without realising it. • Partnership is based on a contractual agreement and therefore a partnership is only created if all the requirements of a contract are fulfilled. • There must be an offer, acceptance, an intention to create legal relations and consideration. The contract must not be void for mistake or illegality and it might be rendered voidable by misrepresentation, duress or undue influence. • The contract might become frustrated if it becomes impossible to perform, or illegal to perform, or if it can be performed only in a manner which is radically different from what the parties contemplated when they made it. 2 Partnerships contnd... • Where the terms of the agreement are not expressed by the partners they might either be implied by the Partnership Act or implied as a maHer of general construcJon of contracts {Law of Contact}. • Formal partnership agreements are oPen known as ar#cles of partnership.

Chapter One Sources of Law in Kenya 1.1 What is Law? The world of commerce and industry is founded on distinct pillars of social order. The establishment and regulation of the various institutions of society depend upon frameworks of rules to which they owe their existence and from which they draw their power and legitimacy. These rules are promulgated and enforced in accordance with a defined legal system. As has been rightly observed, “[i]n order to ensure good order and the smooth running of society, it is necessary to formulate general rules which work well enough in the majority of cases.”1 Accordingly, there is need in every society to promulgate normative rules, principles and doctrines to regulate social order. Such rules and principles must be effectively binding in the sense that derogation from them, or breach thereof, attracts penal or other remedial consequences. The assemblage of these doctrines, principles, rules, and regulations, may, in very loose terms, be collectively referred to as law. Glanville Williams defines law as “… the body of principles recognized and applied by the state in the administration of justice …” According to him, it consists of “… the rules recognized and acted on by courts of justice.”2 In this sense, law includes all rules of conduct enacted by Parliament or established by court decisions in conformity with fundamental principles and doctrines recognized as essential for the administration of justice. Their binding nature demands tha

JULY 2015 a) The National Payments System (NPS) generally is the conduit(s) through which buyers and sellers of financial products and services make transactions and are an important component of a country’s financial system. In Kenya the NPS system comprises of the Central Bank of Kenya, the Government, Commercial Banks, Financial Institutions and Payment System Providers(including mobile service providers) The National Payment System Act 2011 was enacted to provide the legal framework for NPS in Kenya. This act makes provision for the regulation and supervision of payment systems and payment service providers, and for connected purposes. Additionally the National Payment System Regulations 2014 was enacted to operationalize the NPS Act 2011 and provides for the authorization and oversight of payment service providers, designation of payment systems, designation of payment instruments and Anti-Money Laundering measures. It should be noted that the NPS provisions apply hand in hand with the supervisory role of the CBK as per the Central Bank of Kenya Act 2004, Chapter 491 Section 4(A) (2) in subsection (1) (d), which provides the Bank the mandate to exercise the oversight powers of promoting financial stability through cohesion in financial market infrastructure. Furthermore mobile payments have transformed the way financial services have been delivered in Kenya, by bringing in a large number of ‘unbanked’ and ‘under banked’ persons into the financial realm.

Secured Transactions: The Power of Collateral HEYWOOD FLEISIG In many developing countries, businesses are unable to get low-cost, long-term loans from private lenders to finance investment projects. Reforms that make it easier for borrowers to use movable property as collateral would give comfort to lenders, stimulate investment, and boost productivity and growth. T HE FIRST question any private lender asks is, “How do I get my money back?” Given the risks involved in lending—borrowers may be unlucky, unwise, or dishonest— what conditions give comfort to lenders? Two basic loan transactions have evolved in private markets: unsecured and secured. When a borrower offers an unsecured promise to pay, the lender must rely on the borrower’s reputation, or trust that the borrower will pay back the loan in order to have access to future loans. In secured transactions, promises to repay are backed by collateral that lenders can seize and sell in the event loan payments are not made as agreed. Collateral may be real estate or personal property—tangible personal property such as inventory, equipment, livestock, and tractors; or intangible personal property such as unsecured accounts owed to merchants (accounts receivable) and secured agreements (chattel paper). Secured transactions have advantages for borrowers and lenders alike— transaction costs are lower and lenders do not need to gather as much information about borrowers. The issue of collateral is one of great economic importance

INTRODUCTION Various definitions are accorded to the word appointment. For purposes of this subject, the applicable definition to the word would be the one that refers it to as the act of giving a particular job or position to someone. It is an act of appointing or designation. It can also be the fact, act and/or process of choosing someone to do or have a particular position. The position involves responsibility. In relation to agency, agency being the relationship arising where one person, the principal, appoints another, the agent to bring about, modify or terminate legal relations between the principal and one or more third parties; appointment to the given position , job and/or responsibility of an agent takes various forms, forms which make up the substance of this paper. The paper will be divided into two major thematic areas with the first discussing the forms of appointment of different persons to the position, job and/or responsibility of agents with reference to various case law; with the second highlighting given types of agents that arise from the appointments while pointing out to how a given form of appointment will apply to them. FORMS OF APPOINTMENT OF THE AGENTS It is worth noting that the appointment of an agent gives rise to the creation of agency as such the appointment of an agent can be said to be a pre-requisite in the creation and/or formation of an agency relationship, creation which comes in different ways.

Where the agent has authority, but is not known to be an agent (non disclosure by agent)Where the agent does not name the principal, (undisclosed principal) it is more likely that the agent will be considered to be a contracting party. In the case of Consolidated Marine Contracts Ltd vs Samhere [1990] KLR 701 it was held that, unless the third party elects to engage the undisclosed principal then the agent is personally liable on the contractHowever, even here, if it is clear that the parties intended that the agent should act only as agent, then he will not be liable.

OVERVIEW OF THE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK IN FINANCIAL SERVICES SECTOR a) Central Bank of Kenya The Central Bank of Kenya was established in 1966 through an Act of Parliament – the Central Bank of Kenya Act of 1966. The establishment of the Bank was a direct result of the desire among the three East African states to have independent monetary and financial policies. The Central Bank of Kenya Act of 1966 set out objectives and functions and gave the Central Bank limited autonomy. Since the amendment of the Central Bank of Kenya Act in April 1997, the Central Bank operations have been restructured to conform with ongoing economic reforms. There is now greater monetary autonomy. The Mandate of the Central Bank Section 4 of the Central Bank of Kenya Act states the core mandate of the Bank as follows: The principal object of the Bank shall be to formulate and implement monetary policy directed to achieving and maintaining stability in the general level of prices; The Bank shall foster the liquidity, solvency and proper functioning of a stable market- based financial system; and Subject to (1) and (2), the Bank shall support the economic policy of the Government, including its objectives for growth and employment. b) Capital Markets Authority The Capital Market is part of the Financial Market that provides funds for long term development. This is a market that brings together lenders(Investors) of capital and Borrowers(companies that sell securities to the public) of capital. In Novembe

CASE BRIEFS ON AGENCY IN LLOYDS BANK LTD V CHARTERED BANK OF INDIA, AUSTRALIA AND CHINA (1929) 1 KB 40, One Lawson, a senior employee of Lloyds Bank fraudulently drew cheques on the bank’s account and paid them into a personal account he maintained at the Chartered Bank. When Lloyds Bank discovered the fraud, they claimed the value of the cheques so drawn from the Chartered Bank. The Chartered Bank argued that Lawson was an accredited agent of Lloyd’s Bank and therefore Lloyd’s Bank was liable as the principal for the agent’s acts – even if they were unauthorized. The Court refused to accept this argument by saying that the Chartered Bank should have questioned how a bank official was paying cheques of his employer into a private account. No estopel applied because the Chartered Bank could not prove that their loss was caused by any representation of Lloyd’s Bank. Further it was the Chartered Bank’s own negligence that caused the loss. Therefore, Lloyd’s Bank was held not liable for the fraudulent act of Lawson.

Types of Retail/low value systems are:i)Nairobi Automated Clearing House.ii)Payment Card Industry.iii)Mobile phone Money Transfer Services. In the context of National Payment Systems, this allows for innovation and development of the technology surrounding these payment systems. It also encourages foreign and national investment within this sector. Section 9 (j) states that the Authority may investigate on policies from regulatory bodies and its effects in competition and consumer welfare. the Authority has been given the duty to investigate regulatory authorities like the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) and Capital Markets Authority (CMA) on some of the policies they make and determine whether they stifle competition and consumer welfare or not. Section 24 advises against abuse of dominance in the market. The Competition Act only steps in if there has been any impediment to competition, unfair trade practices by co-operations or during mergers and acquisitions. Therefore, because of their limited role in the National Payment Systems, it hardly stifles advancement of technology hence it is an effective Law. see Telkom &amp; Airtel vs CAK DATA PROTECTIONData protection in Kenya is regulated by the Data Protection Act No. 24 of 2019 (the "DPA").Personal data is to be kept in a form which identifies the data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes which it was collected; and.

Advice PESA MINGI Bank on how they can finance Jesse. Jesse Muriithi is the inventor of a solar backup gadget and is seeking to mass produce his invention and have it installed in every home in Kenya and eventually break into the international market. After carefully considering all the legally available funding options, Jesse has decided to approach PESA MINGI bank for financing. In accordance with the Movable Property Security Rights Act (‘the Act) 2017, movable property can now be used to secure credit from financial institutions. The Act seeks to promote consistency and certainty in secured financing relating to movable assets. It also creates two types of movable assets; tangible and intangible assets. Among intangible assets are receivables, choses in action, deposit accounts, electronic securities and intellectual property rights. In this case, Jesse can use his IP rights as security to secure funding from PESA MINGI bank. Section 2 of the Act provides the definition of a security as “a property right in a movable asset that is created by an agreement to secure payment or other performance of an obligation, regardless of whether the parties have denominated it as a security right and regardless of the type of asset, the status of the grantor or secured creditor, or the nature of the secured obligation”. With Jesse using his IP as security, the bank can finance him in various ways provided they have a security agreement, which is defined in Section 2 of the Act. The exe

PARTNERSHIPS The statutory principles and regulations on the law of partnerships will be found in Chapter 29 of the Laws of Kenya which is the Partnership Act (PA). This Act is based on the English Partnership Act of 1890, the main object of which was to codify the main principle of the pre-existing partnership law. The rules of the common law and the doctrines of equity will therefore continue to apply only in so far as they are not inconsistent with the express provisions of the Act. In interpreting partnership law therefore, one must always look at the Act first and if its provisions are clear then there is no need to revert to case law. However, the cases decided after 1890 would also help in understanding the interpretation of the Act. Section 49 of the PA states that the rules of equity and common law, applicable to partnerships in England shall apply to parts in Kenya. Sec 3(1) PA defines partnership as the relation which subsists between persons carrying on a business in common with a view of profit. If this relation exists in point of law, whatever arrangements the partners may have made between themselves and however much they may have tried to reject the notion of partnership, each of them will be regarded as a partner. Therefore, once a relationship of partnership is established even if the business was run by one party and the other partner(s) only participated in the profits, even such sleeping partners will bear as much liability as the active partners for the

COMPANY LAW CLASS NOTES: INTRODUCTION TO COMPANIES AND COMPANY LAW The exact scope of company law is difficult to define, on account that the laws of Kenya do not define the term in testament to the words of Buckley J in Re: Stanley (1906) “The word company has no strict legal meaning...” However, section 3 (1) of the Companies Act, No. 17 of 2015 (The Companies Act) it is provided that a company refers to: “A company formed and registered under this Act [the 2015 Companies Act of Kenya] or an existing company [one incorporated under a pre-existing or other statute e.g. CAP 486]” This definition fails to identify the attributes of the company as it only describes a registered company i.e. a company incorporated by registration. A company may also be defined as an association of many persons who contribute money or money’s worth to a common stock and who employ it to a common purpose. Regrettably, this explanation fails to distinguish a company from a partnership. In common law, a company is a ‘legal person’ or ‘legal entity’ separate from, and capable of surviving beyond the lives of its members. Like any juristic person a company is legally an entity apart from its members, capable of rights and duties of its own, and endowed with the potential of perpetual succession. However, ‘a company’ is not merely a legal institution; it is also a legal device for the attainment of any social or economic end, and to a large extent has public and social responsibility.

CPA SECTION 3: CORPORATE INSOLVENCY UNDER THE 2015 INSOLVENCY ACT Corporate Insolvency in Kenya was previously governed under the Companies Act, CAP 486 Laws of Kenya. However in September 2015, the Insolvency Act regulates this feature of company law. Unlike the previous legislation, the Insolvency Act seeks to redeem insolvent companies through administration as opposed to liquidation. The Act focuses more on assisting insolvent natural persons, unincorporated entities and insolvent corporate bodies whose financial position is redeemable to continue operating as going concerns so that they may be able to meet their financial obligations to the satisfaction of their creditors. The consolidation of the laws with respect to insolvency is aimed at not only providing for and regulating the liquidation of incorporated and unincorporated bodies but also to enable their affairs to be managed for the benefit of their creditors by providing alternatives to bankruptcy and liquidation. Meaning of Insolvency Insolvency means that a company is unable to pay its debts. Section 384 of the Insolvency Act 2015 provides that a company is unable to pay its debts: if a creditor (by assignment or otherwise) to whom the company is indebted for KES 100,000 or more has served on the company, by leaving it at the company’s registered office, a written demand requiring the company to pay the debt and the company has for 21 days afterwards failed to pay the debt or to secure or compound for it to the

A promoter is a person who was a party to the preparation of the Company Prospectus or on the particulars thereof but doesn’t include any person so engaged in his professional capacity e.g. Advocate, CPS, unless they are named as directors of the company being formed. In the words of Cockburn C.J in Twycross v Grant (1877) 2C.P.D. 469: “A promoter, I apprehend, is one who undertakes to form a company with reference to a particular project and set it going and who takes the necessary steps to accomplish that purpose. ” This explanation fails to capture the role that a person must play to qualify as a promoter. In the words of Lindley J in Emma Silver Mining Co. V Lewis 4 C. P. D. 396 (I879): “As used in connection with companies, the term promoter involves the idea of exertion for the purpose of getting up and starting a company (floating it).” This explanation also fails to fully identify the role of a promoter. Promotional acts usually include: a) Preparation of the Memorandum and Articles of the proposed company b) The appointment of the first directors c) Preparation of the prospectus d) Negotiating the preliminary contracts e) Paying the preliminary expenses etc. A PROMOTER DEMYSTIFIED It has been observed that a promoter is a person who comes up with the idea of en

The personal representative would be entitled to be registered as a member of the company unless the company’s articles provide otherwise. Corporations: A corporation, whether a registered company or not, may, if authorized by its articles (expressly or impliedly), take shares in a registered company and become a member of it.

Classes of shares 1.1.1. introduction Section 323 of the Act provides that the shares or other interest of a member in a personal property and are not in the nature of real estate. Section 32 thereafter provides that The shares and any other interests of a member in a company are transferable in accordance with the company's articles. The definition of a share which is generally quoted in English text-books on Company Law is that of Farwell, J. in Borland’s Trustee v Steel Brothers to the effect that, “a share is the interest of a shareholder in the company measured by a sum of money, for the purpose of liability in the first place, and of interest in the second, but also consisting of a series of mutual covenants entered into by all the shareholders inter se in accordance with (Section 30 of the Companies Act ). The contract contained in the Articles of Association is one of the original incidents of the share. A share is not a sum of money, but is an interest measured by a sum of money and made up of various rights contained in the contract, including the right to a sum of money of a more or less amount”. From the above definition it should be noted that a share: i. ii. iii. iv.

CPA SECTION 3: COMPANY MEETINGS Neither the Companies Act defines the term meeting nor have Courts provided a legal definition of a meeting. They appear to have adopted the ordinary meaning of the term. In the words of Lord Coleridge in Sharp V Dawes (1876) “The word meeting prima facie means a coming together of more than one person” The ordinary meaning of the term meeting is an assembly of persons. It therefore follows that one person cannot constitute a meeting. This is the rule in Sharp V Dawes where a single shareholder purported to hold a meeting to pass a resolution to make calls. The meeting was scheduled for 30th Dec 1874 and only 2 people attended; these two people were Sharp who was the Company’s Secretary and Silversides, a member. The latter acted as Chairman while the former took minutes. The meeting resolved that calls be made but the defendant member declined and was sued. It was held that no meeting had been properly constituted and the purported proceedings were null and void. The case is authority for the proposition that one person cannot constitute a meeting or a corporate assembly. However in law, one person can constitute a meeting as well as quorum for the meeting, these are exceptions to the rule in Sharp V Dawes. Exceptions to the rule in Sharp V Dawes: 1. Directors meeting. Where a private company has only one director, that director constitutes a directors meeting for purposes of exercise of the powers conferred on the board by the Articles. 2. Cl

CPA SECTION 3: INSIDER TRADING This is the sale or purchase of company securities by or on behalf of a person whose relationship with the company is such that he is likely to have access to material information on the company not generally available to the public. It takes place when a person buys or sells securities while knowingly in possession of price sensitive information not available to the public which if made available will affect the price or value of those securities. It is the taking advantage of confidential information on the company for personal gain. Insider trading occurs where an individual or organization buys or sells securities while knowingly in possession of some piece of confidential information which is not generally available and which is not likely, if made available to the general public, to materially affect the price of the securities. For example, where a company director who is aware that the company is in a bad financial state and will consequently cut its dividend pay-out sells his shares before a public announcement to this effect is made. This is also the case when the director buys shares in the company with knowledge that the company is declaring super profits or is acquiring a competitor. Regulation of Insider Trading in Kenya In Kenya, Insider Trading is prohibited and criminalised by Section 32B of the Capital Markets Act Cap 485A. Under Section 32B, a person who deals in listed securities or their derivatives that are price-affected i

CPA SECTION 3: THE COMPANY SECRETARY This is the officer appointed by the directors of a company as responsible for ensuring that firm's legal obligations under the corporate legislation are complied with. The office of the Company Secretary, Corporate Secretary or Board Secretary is in charge of legal and regulatory compliance at Board level. A company secretary is not automatically an employee of the company but remains a principal officer under the Act. The office of the Company Secretary is created by the Section 198(1) of the 2015 Companies Act which states that every company must have a Company Secretary. Specifically however, Company Secretaries are provided in Part XII of the 2015 Companies Act of Kenya. Section 243 provides that a private company is required to have a company secretary only if it has a paid up capital of KES 5,000,000 or more. Under Section 243, if a private company does not have a company secretary: 1. Anything required to be done by the CS may be done by a director or any other authorized person 2. Anything required to be served on the CS may be served on the company itself or on any authorized person Under Section 178 (2) if the office of the Company Secretary is vacant, its function and duties may be discharged by a deputy or assistant Secretary or delegate of the Board of Directors.

CPA SECTION 3: COMPANY DIRECTORS Both the Companies Act and case law recognize the General Meeting and the Board of Directors (the BOD) as the principal managerial organs of the company and the Constitution vest power in both. Whereas the General Meeting makes major decisions the Board of Directors is responsible for managing the day to day affairs of the company. The 2015 Companies Act extensively deals with Directors under Part IX, outlining statutory provisions from Sections 122 to 237 on these company managers. Section 3 of the Act states that "director", in relation to a body corporate, includes: a) any person occupying the position of a director of the body( by whatever name the person is called); and b) any person in accordance with whose directions or instructions (not being advice given in a professional capacity) the directors of the body are accustomed to act; Any person who occupies the position of director is treated as such. The test is one function. The directors’ function is to take part in making decisions by attending the meetings of board of directors. Anyone who does that is a director whatever they may be called. A person who is given the title of director, such as ‘Sales Director’ or ‘Director of Research’, to give them status in the company structure is a not a director in company law. This is unless by virtue of their appointment they are member of the board of director, or they carry out functions that would be properly discharged only by a director.

Introduction Definition of a company: • Sec 3 of the Companies Act 2015 defines a company as a company formed and registered under the Act or an existing company. • The term existing company is defined in sec 3 of the Act as a company formed and registered under the repealed companies act or other repealed ordinances as defined by the repealed companies act. Introduction • Buckley J. in Re: Stanley (1906) noted that the word company has no strict legal meaning and further noted that a company may be defined as an association of persons who contribute money or money’s worth to common stock and who employ it to a common purpose. • The above definition in Re: Stanley (1906) does not distinguish a company from a partnership. • Under common law, a company is considered a legal person or legal entity separate from and with perpetual succession. Historical background of companies • The company as a form of business organization was first applied by English merchants trading cloth and other goods overseas. • The company emerged during the mercantile era due to two reasons: • The need for large scale investment, production and operation to satisfy the market demand, as a result of which, traders were in dire need of a commercial de

The lender thereby gains a collection of rights over those assets (rights “in rem”). Security or a security interest is a simply a reference to that collection of rights. Security should not be confused with securities (capital markets). Security to be distinguished from quasi security (e.g. guarantee, set off provisions, retention of title)- these create rights against a person (rights in “personam”). Security contd.  • Why take security Gives the secured party: ➢ rights against specific assets of security provider making it easier to recover the amounts owed by the security provider ➢ priority over unsecured creditors and lower ranking secured creditors of the security provider in respect of any proceeds ➢ more control if borrower gets into difficulties e.g. right to appoint an administrator over assets Security contd. • What to consider when taking security The type of security- have regard to the nature of the asset and the nature of rights that the lende

COMPANY LAW CLASS NOTES: INTRODUCTION TO COMPANIES AND COMPANY LAW The exact scope of company law is difficult to define, on account that the laws of Kenya do not define the term in testament to the words of Buckley J in Re: Stanley (1906) “The word company has no strict legal meaning...” However, section 3 (1) of the Companies Act, No. 17 of 2015 (The Companies Act) it is provided that a company refers to: “A company formed and registered under this Act [the 2015 Companies Act of Kenya] or an existing company [one incorporated under a pre-existing or other statute e.g. CAP 486]” This definition fails to identify the attributes of the company as it only describes a registered company i.e. a company incorporated by registration. A company may also be defined as an association of many persons who contribute money or money’s worth to a common stock and who employ it to a common purpose. Regrettably, this explanation fails to distinguish a company from a partnership. In common law, a company is a ‘legal person’ or ‘legal entity’ separate from, and capable of surviving beyond the lives of its members. Like any juristic person a company is legally an entity apart from its members, capable of rights and duties of its own, and endowed with the potential of perpetual succession. However, ‘a company’ is not merely a legal institution; it is also a legal device for the attainment of any social or economic end, and to a large extent has public and social responsibility.

CPA SECTION 3: CORPORATE INSOLVENCY UNDER THE 2015 INSOLVENCY ACT Corporate Insolvency in Kenya was previously governed under the Companies Act, CAP 486 Laws of Kenya. However in September 2015, the Insolvency Act regulates this feature of company law. Unlike the previous legislation, the Insolvency Act seeks to redeem insolvent companies through administration as opposed to liquidation. The Act focuses more on assisting insolvent natural persons, unincorporated entities and insolvent corporate bodies whose financial position is redeemable to continue operating as going concerns so that they may be able to meet their financial obligations to the satisfaction of their creditors. The consolidation of the laws with respect to insolvency is aimed at not only providing for and regulating the liquidation of incorporated and unincorporated bodies but also to enable their affairs to be managed for the benefit of their creditors by providing alternatives to bankruptcy and liquidation. Meaning of Insolvency Insolvency means that a company is unable to pay its debts. Section 384 of the Insolvency Act 2015 provides that a company is unable to pay its debts: a) if a creditor (by assignment or otherwise) to whom the company is indebted for KES 100,000 or more has served on the company, by leaving it at the company’s registered office, a written demand requiring the company to pay the debt and the company has for 21 days afterwards failed to pay the debt or to secure or compound for it to t

CPA SECTION 3: CORPORATE RESTRUCTURING It is not always in the best interests of the company and its shareholders for the company to be wound up. As such, Company Law offers a number of alternatives for companies experiencing financial and other difficulties. These include: Reconstructions Amalgamations Mergers Schemes of arrangement Takeover bids Reconstruction A reconstruction may be an alteration of the structure of a group of companies or an alteration of the capital structure of a single company. It explains how a company is “built again” or reconstituted. This may be effected through: Reduction of capital Variation of class rights Scheme of arrangements Amalgamation This is a transaction whereby two or more companies are combined in some way in united ownership Merger It means the uniting of two companies through an acquisition by one company of a controlling holding of shares in another. A company may absorb a minority shareholding in its partly owned subsidiary in exchange for cash or shares. A company may seek to alter the rights of its creditors, e.g. by variation of the rights of debenture holders, by mutual agreement. Under Section 933 of the 2015 Companies Act, a merger occurs where: the assets and liabilities of a public company are to be transferred to another existing public company (merger by absorption) The assets and liabilities of a public company are transferred to a new company (merger by formation of a new company) Scheme of Arrangement This is the maki

SCHOOL OF ACCOUNTANCY CPA PART 2 SECTION 3 FULL TIME COURSE COMPANY LAW CHAPTER THREE: MEMBERSHIP OF A COMPANY Acquisition of Membership Definition of Member Section 92 of the Act does not define the word “member”. Rather, it states the two basic ways in which a person may become a member of a company, namely: By subscribing to the memorandum and articles of the company, or By agreeing to become a member and the entry of his name in the company’s register of members. Who may become a member Capacity to be a member of a company is governed by the rules of the common law relating to contracts. Anyone who has the capacity to make a contract may become a member of a company. The following are some of the special cases, which require explanation: Personal Representatives: On a shareholder’s death, ownership of the shares previously held by him is transmitted to his personal representative, who may be an executor or administrator. The personal representative would be entitled to be registered as a member of the company unless the company’s articles provide otherwise. Corporations: A corporation, whether a registered company or not, may, if authorized by its articles (expressly or impliedly), take shares in a registered company and become a member of it. It would authorize such person as it thinks fit to act as its representative at any meeting of the company. The authorization would be made by a resolution of its directors or other governing body Methods of becoming a member A pers

STRATHMORE UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF ACCOUNTANCY CPA PART 2 SECTION 3 FULL TIME COURSE COMPANY LAW CHAPTER FOUR: SHARES EMERGING ISSUES Dematerialization/immobilization of share certificates Dematerialized securities are securities that are not on paper and a certificate to that effect does not exist. They exist in the form of entries in the book of depositories. Essentially, unlike the traditional method of possessing a share certificate to the effect of ownership of shares, in the dematerialized system, the shares are held in a dematerialized form. This system works through the CDS. CDS stands for the Central Depository System. This is a computer system operated by The Central Depository and Settlement Corporation (CDSC) that facilitates holdings of shares in electronic accounts, opened by shareholders and manages the process of transferring shares traded at the Stock Exchange. Advantages of Dematerialization The advantages of dematerialization of securities can be summarized as follows: Share certificates, on dematerialization, are cancelled and the same will not be sent back to the investor. The depository system and dematerialized securities offer paperless trading and transfer of shares through the use of technology. It enables processing of share trading and transfers electronically without involving share certificates and transfer deeds, thus eliminating the paper work involved in scrip-based trading and share transfer system. Transfer of dematerialized securities is immed

The definition of a share which is generally quoted in English text-books on Company Law is that of Farwell, J. in Borland’s Trustee v Steel Brothers to the effect that, “a share is the interest of a shareholder in the company measured by a sum of money, for the purpose of liability in the first place, and of interest in the second, but also consisting of a series of mutual covenants entered into by all the shareholders inter se in accordance with (Section 30 of the Companies Act ). The contract contained in the Articles of Association is one of the original incidents of the share.

CPA SECTION 3: COMPANY MEETINGS Neither the Companies Act defines the term meeting nor have Courts provided a legal definition of a meeting. They appear to have adopted the ordinary meaning of the term. In the words of Lord Coleridge in Sharp V Dawes (1876) “The word meeting prima facie means a coming together of more than one person” The ordinary meaning of the term meeting is an assembly of persons. It therefore follows that one person cannot constitute a meeting. This is the rule in Sharp V Dawes where a single shareholder purported to hold a meeting to pass a resolution to make calls. The meeting was scheduled for 30th Dec 1874 and only 2 people attended; these two people were Sharp who was the Company’s Secretary and Silversides, a member. The latter acted as Chairman while the former took minutes. The meeting resolved that calls be made but the defendant member declined and was sued. It was held that no meeting had been properly constituted and the purported proceedings were null and void. The case is authority for the proposition that one person cannot constitute a meeting or a corporate assembly. However in law, one person can constitute a meeting as well as quorum for the meeting, these are exceptions to the rule in Sharp V Dawes. Exceptions to the rule in Sharp V Dawes: 1.

However, prima facie the term means coming together of two or more persons. It denotes an assembly of persons. Company general meetings are held from time to time in order: To comply with statutory provisions which require certain general meetings to be held in order to transact specified business. Such meetings include the statutory meeting, the annual general meeting and class meetings. To transact business that may only be transacted at a general meeting of the members or shareholders, such as alteration or reduction of the company’s capital. To enable the directors and members to exchange views regarding the running of the company’s affairs or resolve some existing disputes. To transact some business which may only be transacted at a meeting of a class of the company’s members, such as variation of a right attached to a class of shares. Types of meetings There are four kinds of meetings of members which may be held by a company: The statutory general meeting (under the previous Companies Act) The annual general meeting General meetings at other times (Extra ordinary general meetings) Class meetings The annual general meeting Section 310 provides that every public company shall hold a general meeting as its annual gener

CPA SECTION 3: INSIDER TRADING This is the sale or purchase of company securities by or on behalf of a person whose relationship with the company is such that he is likely to have access to material information on the company not generally available to the public. It takes place when a person buys or sells securities while knowingly in possession of price sensitive information not available to the public which if made available will affect the price or value of those securities. It is the taking advantage of confidential information on the company for personal gain. Insider trading occurs where an individual or organization buys or sells securities while knowingly in possession of some piece of confidential information which is not generally available and which is not likely, if made available to the general public, to materially affect the price of the securities. For example, where a company director who is aware that the company is in a bad financial state and will consequently cut its dividend pay-out sells his shares before a public announcement to this effect is made. This is also the case when the director buys shares in the company with knowledge that the company is declaring super profits or is acquiring a competitor. Regulation of Insider Trading in Kenya In Kenya, Insider Trading is prohibited and criminalised by Section 32B of the Capital Markets Act Cap 485A. Under Section 32B, a person who deals in listed securities or their derivatives that are price-affected i

CPA SECTION 3: THE COMPANY SECRETARY This is the officer appointed by the directors of a company as responsible for ensuring that firm's legal obligations under the corporate legislation are complied with. The office of the Company Secretary, Corporate Secretary or Board Secretary is in charge of legal and regulatory compliance at Board level. A company secretary is not automatically an employee of the company but remains a principal officer under the Act. The office of the Company Secretary is created by the Section 198(1) of the 2015 Companies Act which states that every company must have a Company Secretary. Specifically however, Company Secretaries are provided in Part XII of the 2015 Companies Act of Kenya. Section 243 provides that a private company is required to have a company secretary only if it has a paid up capital of KES 5,000,000 or more. Under Section 243, if a private company does not have a company secretary: 1. Anything required to be done by the CS may be done by a director or any other authorized person 2. Anything required to be served on the CS may be served on the company itself or on any authorized person Under Section 178 (2) if the office of the Company Secretary is vacant, its function and duties may be discharged by a deputy or assistant Secretary or delegate of the Board of Directors.

CPA SECTION 3: COMPANY DIRECTORS Both the Companies Act and case law recognize the General Meeting and the Board of Directors (the BOD) as the principal managerial organs of the company and the Constitution vest power in both. Whereas the General Meeting makes major decisions the Board of Directors is responsible for managing the day to day affairs of the company. The 2015 Companies Act extensively deals with Directors under Part IX, outlining statutory provisions from Sections 122 to 237 on these company managers. Section 3 of the Act states that "director", in relation to a body corporate, includes: a) any person occupying the position of a director of the body( by whatever name the person is called); and b) any person in accordance with whose directions or instructions (not being advice given in a professional capacity) the directors of the body are accustomed to act; Any person who occupies the position of director is treated as such. The test is one function. The directors’ function is to take part in making decisions by attending the meetings of board of directors. Anyone who does that is a director whatever they may be called. A person who is given the title of director, such as ‘Sales Director’ or ‘Director of Research’, to give them status in the company structure is a not a director in company law. This is unless by virtue of their appointment they are member of the board of director, or they carry out functions that would be properly discharged only by a director.

LAW OF BUSINESS ASSOCIATIONS (COMPANY LAW) This course is primarily concerned with companies as defined in the Companies Act Cap 486. These are companies which are formed and registered under that Act. There are companies incorporated otherwise than under the companies Act. Some companies are formed under specific Acts of Parliament. The parastatal bodies are created under statute as bodies corporate. Most companies derive their existence through a process of registration under the Companies Act cap 486. EARLY FORMS OF BUSINESS ORGANISATIONS Early forms of business organizations owing their existence to royal charter was primarily ecclesiastical bodies or public bodies such as boroughs. Trading in joint account was accomplished through types of partnerships known as the commenda and the societus…and later through the limited liability company. A commenda was a formal partnership in which one of the partners supplied capital in money or goods without personally taking part in the management of the venture. The financier advanced a sum of money to the active trader upon the understanding that he should share in the profits of the enterprise but with no liability beyond the capital advanced. The societus was a form of association which developed into the present age partnership. Each partner, being an agent of the others is liable to the full extent of his private fortune and partnership debts.

A debenture is the document that grants lenders a charge over a borrower’s assets, giving them a means of collecting debt if the borrower defaults. Debentures are commonly used by traditional lenders, such as banks, when providing high-value funding to larger companies. To register a debenture, a lender simply has to file it with Companies Registery. This can usually be done in a matter of days. Fixed chargeA lender can ensure it is the first creditor to recoup any outstanding debt if a borrower defaults on a loan.

DEFINITION Section 2 of the Companies Act defines a company as an association of people for a common object or objects. Thus unlike a Partnership which is an association of persons who come together for business with a view of profit, the objects of a company extend beyond profit making. COMPANIES AND PARTNERSHIPS A company is different from a partnership in that in a partnership, each partner is liable for the debts and liabilities of the firm without limits, except for limited partnerships. Second, a partnership has no separate existence from the partners; third, a partnership has no perpetual succession unlike a company, so that the death, retirement or bankruptcy of a partner ends it. Section 389 of the Companies Act provides that no association or partnership consisting of more than 20 persons may be formed for the purposes of carrying on any business for the acquisition of gains unless it is registered under the Companies Act, or is formed pursuant to some other statute. Section 2 of the Companies Act 2015 provides that a company is a company formed and registered under the Act or an existing company. It also provides that one natural person may incorporate a company. TYPES OF COMPANIES Companies may be statutory companies which are formed either by specific Acts of Parliament such as Kenya Ports Authority Act, Kenya Railways Corporation Act, etc. (statutory corporations), or State corporations (parastatals) which are formed under the State Corporations Act which gives

LAW OF BUSINESS ASSOCIATIONS (COMPANY LAW) This course is primarily concerned with companies as defined in the Companies Act Cap 486. These are companies which are formed and registered under that Act. There are companies incorporated otherwise than under the companies Act. Some companies are formed under specific Acts of Parliament. The parastatal bodies are created under statute as bodies corporate. Most companies derive their existence through a process of registration under the Companies Act cap 486. EARLY FORMS OF BUSINESS ORGANISATIONS Early forms of business organizations owing their existence to royal charter was primarily ecclesiastical bodies or public bodies such as boroughs. Trading in joint account was accomplished through types of partnerships known as the commenda and the societus…and later through the limited liability company. A commenda was a formal partnership in which one of the partners supplied capital in money or goods without personally taking part in the management of the venture. The financier advanced a sum of money to the active trader upon the understanding that he should share in the profits of the enterprise but with no liability beyond the capital advanced. The societus was a form of association which developed into the present age partnership. Each partner, being an agent of the others is liable to the full extent of his private fortune and partnership debts.

PRESS RELEASE ENACTMENT OF THE LAW TO REGULATE DIGITAL LENDERS AND ISSUANCE OF THE CORRESPONDING DRAFT REGULATIONS FOR PUBLIC COMMENT Following Presidential assent on December 7, 2021, the Central Bank of Kenya (Amendment) Act, 2021, has become effective today, December 23, 2021. The Amendment provides the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) with the powers to license and oversight the previously unregulated digital credit providers. This is a significant milestone. Correspondingly, CBK announces the issuance of draft Digital Credit Providers Regulations and invites public comments. With the recent advances in technology and ongoing innovations, lending through digital channels, particularly mobile phones, has grown significantly in Kenya. However, concerns have been raised by the public about the predatory practices of the unregulated digital credit providers, and in particular, their high cost, unethical debt collection practices, and the abuse of personal information. The Amendment requires CBK to publish Regulations within three months, i.e., by March 23, 2022, and accordingly CBK has developed the draft Regulations for public consultation. The Regulations provide for inter alia the licensing, governance, and credit operations of Digital Credit Providers (DCPs). They further provide for consumer protection, credit information sharing, and elaborate on the Anti-Money Laundering and Combating the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) obligations of DCPs.

Data Protection Act In Kenya The Data Protection Act No. 24 of2019 (the Act or DPA hereinafter) which was enacted on 8th November 2019 has a commencement date of 25th November 2019. Its preamble states that it is meant to give effect to Article 31 (c) and (d) of the Constitution. These provisions guarantee that every person has the right to privacy, including not to have information relating to their family or private affairs unnecessarily required or revealed and not to have the privacy of their communications infringed. The Act is a clean-up of several bills that were introduced previously then withdrawn for one reason or the other. The new law comes against the backdrop of the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulations (EUGDPR). Most companies operating in Kenya were still grappling with compliance. Notably, the provisions of the Act mimic those of the EUGDPR and therefore companies that had taken steps towards compliance with EUGDPR will be a step ahead. Who is affected by the Data Protection Act? The Act limits its scope to data controllers or processors who are established and ordinarily reside in Kenya and process personal data of natural persons while in Kenya OR If they are not established or resident in Kenya, they process personal data of data subjects located in Kenya. This scope captures anyone whose operations involve collection or processing of personal information pertaining to Kenyan residents. For instance, any person running an app that collects p

FINANCIAL SERVICES REGULATION IN KENYA. Introduction The financial services sector in Kenya has historically evolved since pre independence. Through the years, the sector has been regulated by the government, although at different spheres, both directly and indirectly. From the onset of establishment of financial services sector, some of the sub sectors were self regulated. However, with penetration and increase of financial services there has been continued demand for efficient regulation.157 This has created a mix of both self regulation and government regulation.158 The different sub sectors have experienced different paces for development and regulation. With the growth of the Kenyan economy, and the palpable need for proper regulation of the sector, the Ministry of Finance has played the oversight role. However, with subsequent development, the regulatory framework developed from the different departments to having independent regulators for each sub sector.159 This chapter discusses the financial services sector regulatory framework. The chapter chronicles the history of regulation of the financial services sector and illuminates the current regulatory framework. It also analyzes the challenges thataffect regulation, which appear to have been the catalyst for the clamor for an integrated History of financial services sector regulation The different sub sectors of the financial sector have had different paces of regulation, which are discussed below.

Real Time Gross Settlement System (RTGS)KEPSS is Kenya’s Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) System and went live on July 29th 2005. It is wholly owned and managed by the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK).An RTGS system is defined as a gross settlement system in which both processing and final settlement of funds transfer instructions take place continuously (i.e. in real time) from one bank to another. How Do We regulate Payment systems?¨ Firm establishment of the rule of law. The payment system law should be manifest at the highest hierarchy level of the rules of a particular country. If in a country’s legal system a statute has greater force and effect than a regulation or an administrative order, the law governing funds transfers should take the form of a statute. This should protect the system against political and bureaucratic meddling Accountability of the institutions involved in funds transfers. The institutions involved in funds transfers should be held accountable for their own behavior. The utmo st importance must be accorded to the rule of law, not to relationships among parties and between parties and the government. In this regard, the direct participation of the central bank in the payment system should not be overemphasized. Private sector action and responsibility ought to be encouraged. Integration with other bodies of law. The payment system law must be part of the broad commercial and bankruptcy framework. Accordingly, the rules, concepts, and incentives created

Chapter One Sources of Law in Kenya 1.1 What is Law? The world of commerce and industry is founded on distinct pillars of social order. The establishment and regulation of the various institutions of society depend upon frameworks of rules to which they owe their existence and from which they draw their power and legitimacy. These rules are promulgated and enforced in accordance with a defined legal system. As has been rightly observed, “[i]n order to ensure good order and the smooth running of society, it is necessary to formulate general rules which work well enough in the majority of cases.”1 Accordingly, there is need in every society to promulgate normative rules, principles and doctrines to regulate social order. Such rules and principles must be effectively binding in the sense that derogation from them, or breach thereof, attracts penal or other remedial consequences. The assemblage of these doctrines, principles, rules, and regulations, may, in very loose terms, be collectively referred to as law. Glanville Williams defines law as “… the body of principles recognized and applied by the state in the administration of justice …” According to him, it consists of “… the rules recognized and acted on by courts of justice.”2 In this sense, law includes all rules of conduct enacted by Parliament or established by court decisions in conformity with fundamental principles and doctrines recognized as essential for the administration of justice. Their binding nature demands tha

CENTRAL BANK DIGITAL CURRENCY (CBDC)CDBC is a complex piece of software and a complex digital framework capable of delivering both benefits and shocks across the economy. Money and payments have evolved continuously throughout history. Our wallets are progressively being replaced by smartphones and other electronic gadgets in our pockets. These shifts have far- reaching implications for the nature of money, raising the question whether central banks should issue digital currencies for consumer usage.The financial sector and payments industry has gradually and consistently evolved nationally and globally. This was also fast tracked by the COVID-19 pandemic which changed the way payments are made to a more digital mode. This has led to the emergence of digital currencies which have facilitated payment transactions. Such digital currencies include: Cryptocurrency, Stable Coin, Electronic Money and Central Bank Digital Currency. A digital currency is a form of payment issued by a central bank, serves as a legal tender that exists in an electronic form, and is exchangeable with the fiat currency. One of the main purposes of central banks is to provide money to the public through reserve, settl

COMPANIES ● The Companies Act, 2015 Section 3 defines a company as "a company formed and registered under this Act or an existing company." ● This definition is vague. In legal theory, a company can be defined as an association of a member of persons who come together for some common object or objects. (In ordinary usage it is associated with economic purposes or gain). ● A company is an artificial legal person created by complying with the provisions of the Companies Act, 2015 of the Laws of Kenya. Fundamental concepts of company law 1. The concept of legal personality ● Legal personality means that the law recognizes certain persons as having certain legal rights and duties which can be enforced by the courts. ● Apart from human beings, the law also accords legal personality to corporations. A corporation is an artificial person created by law, and once it comes into being it is treated by law as a person in its own right, and is independent from the individual members who compose it. ● Corporate personality thus encompasses the capacity of a corporation to have a name of its own, to sue and be sued, and the right to purchase, sell, lease, and mortgage its property in its own name. In addition, property cannot be taken away from a corporation without due process of the law. 2. The concept of limited liability ● Liability means the extent to which a person can be made to account by law. One can be made accountable either for the full amount of their debts or else pay towards

NEWS ALERT ISSUE: 17 JUNE 2017 2.0 Nature of rights over moveable properties covered by the Act (Security rights) A property right in a movable asset that is created by an agreement to secure payment or other performance of an obligation is defined as a security right under the Act. It is important to note that the Act adopts a “substance over form” approach as the Act classifies any such right in any agreement as a security right regardless of whether the parties have denominated it as a security right. The Act also defines the right of the transferee in an outright transfer of a receivable as a security right. The Act applies to security rights in moveable assets, including: A BRIEF OUTLINE OF THE MOVABLE PROPERTY SECURITY RIGHTS ACT, 2017 1. Introduction The Moveable Property Security Rights Act, 2017 (the “Act”) came into operation on 16th May 2017. The Act aims at facilitating the use of movable property as security for credit facilities and enhancing the ability of individuals and entities to access credit using moveable assets. To this end, the Act creates the office of the Registrar of Security Rights and sets out provisions in respect of the registration of security rights in movable property, the realisation process and related matters.

HIRE-PURCHASE LAW INTRODUCTION. A person who wants to buy goods, but does not have sufficient monetary consideration as the price may enter into an agreement with the owner of goods, so that the owner may hire the goods to him with a view of finally purchasing them. In this case, the owner allows the hirer to take immediate possession and custody of the goods after which the hirer pays periodic instalments. At common law a hire purchase agreement is defined as a contract for the delivery of goods under which the Hirer is granted an option to purchase the goods. The agreement is a hybrid form of contract in that it is neither a simple bailment nor a contract of sale but combines elements of both. The Kenyan Hire Purchase Law is governed by the principles of the English common law as modified by the Hire Purchase Act Cap. 507 of the Laws of Kenya. The late J. M. Kariuki sponsored this bill as a private member bill in 1968. It however came into operation from the 2nd November 1970. It was based on the English Hire Purchase Act 1965. The preamble of Cap. 507 states that it is ’ an Act of Parliament to make provisions for the regulation of certain hire-purchase agreements, and for the licensing of hire-purchase concerns, and for the purposes connected herewith’ These ‘certain hire-purchase agreements’ are stated in Section 3 to include:- Hire-purchase agreements entered into after the commencement of the Act. - Hire Purchase Agreements under which Hire-purchase price does not exce

Chapter One Sources of Law in Kenya 1.1 What is Law? The world of commerce and industry is founded on distinct pillars of social order. The establishment and regulation of the various institutions of society depend upon frameworks of rules to which they owe their existence and from which they draw their power and legitimacy. These rules are promulgated and enforced in accordance with a defined legal system. As has been rightly observed, “[i]n order to ensure good order and the smooth running of society, it is necessary to formulate general rules which work well enough in the majority of cases.”1 Accordingly, there is need in every society to promulgate normative rules, principles and doctrines to regulate social order. Such rules and principles must be effectively binding in the sense that derogation from them, or breach thereof, attracts penal or other remedial consequences. The assemblage of these doctrines, principles, rules, and regulations, may, in very loose terms, be collectively referred to as law. Glanville Williams defines law as “… the body of principles recognized and applied by the state in the administration of justice …” According to him, it consists of “… the rules recognized and acted on by courts of justice.”2 In this sense, law includes all rules of conduct enacted by Parliament or established by court decisions in conformity with fundamental principles and doctrines recognized as essential for the administration of justice. Their binding nature demands tha

This is to ascertain the true financial position of the debtor. It is an offence under the Act to hide any pertinent information during the public examination A debtor who makes an application is required to publish a notice in a) a newspaper circulating within the region in which the debtor ordinarily residesb) in such other publication (if any) as may be prescribed by the regulationsThe debtor shall be responsible for the costs of publishing the statementThe application also needs to be served on the creditors and the same given the time to oppose the application if they can show that the debtor has the ability to pay.Once the petition is filed the creditors are prohibited from using any means to attempt to collect the debtOnce the petition is filed the court issues an automatic stay which prohibits creditors from the commencement or continuation of collection of a debt that arose prior to filing the bankruptcy Debtors Application

INSIGHTS / EXPERTISE / PEOPLE / NEWS / CONTACTS SITEMAP DISCLAIMER The Insolvency Act, 2015: The impact on creditors and their right to realise securities Posted on: December 5, 2015 The Insolvency Act, 2015(the Insolvency Act) was enacted with the key objective of amending and consolidating the legislation relating to the insolvency of natural persons and incorporated and unincorporated bodies. It aims to provide for and regulate the bankruptcy or liquidation of natural persons, incorporated and unincorporated bodies to enable their affairs to be managed for the benefit of their creditors. The Act was assented on 11th September, 2015 and will come into operation on such date as the Cabinet Secretary may direct by notice in the Kenya Gazette, however, any provision that is not brought into force through gazettement within nine months after the publication of the Act shall automatically come into force on the expiry of that period. Prior to the enactment of the Insolvency Act, corporate insolvency was dealt with under the Winding-up provisions of the Companies Act(Cap 486 of the Laws of Kenya) (the Companies Act) while the insolvency of natural persons was covered in the Bankruptcy Act of Kenya(Cap 53 of the Laws of Kenya) (the Bankruptcy Act). Unlike the previous legislation, the Act seeks to redeem insolvent companies through administration as opposed to liquidation. The Act focuses more on assisting insolvent natural persons, unincorporated entities and insolvent corporate

When the old financial laws regarding implementation of bankruptcy orders were applied to an individual in Kenya’s traditional legal landscape, one was not allowed to carry more than Sh100 in their pockets. The time tested legal provision, which has been the last resort by individuals who are unable to service their debt, now faces several headwinds with the changing financial times and particularly the move to cashless transactions. Experts say although the declaration of bankruptcy does not discharge one from debt obligation but only protects them from creditors within the period of bankruptcy, the way of determining whether one’s economic conditions have changed, necessitating his debt obligation to be reimposed, remain gray in the modern cashlite economy. Once a bankruptcy order is made, the property of the bankrupt and the power he could have vested over that property vests in a trustee. The only assets allowed are his tools of trade, necessary household furniture and personal effects, and even a motor vehicle if its value is not more than Sh1 million. Later, the Insolvency Act was introduced with the sole aim of helping the individual or company, return to stability and not destroy them. The move is a shift from the previous focus where debtors who defaulted were punished by being sent to prison, hurting the very businesses from which they were expected to generate funds to settle the debts.

University of London Press Ltd v University Tutorial Press Ltd [1916] 2 Ch 601 Court: Chancery Division Judges: Peterson J Date decided: 26 July 1916 Examiners were hired to create exam scripts for the University of London. Peterson J held that the papers were original literary works: Assuming that they are ``literary work'’, the question then is whether they are original. The word ``original'’ does not in this connection mean that the work must be the expression of original or inventive thought. Copyright Acts are not concerned with the originality of ideas, but with the expression of thought, and, in the case of ``literary work'’, with the expression of thought in print or writing. The originality which is required relates to the expression of the thought. But the Act does not require that the expression must be in an original or novel form, but that the work must not be copied from another work — that it should originate from the author. In the present case it was not suggested that any of the papers were copied. Professor Lodge and Mr Jackson proved that they had thought out the questions which they set, and that they made notes or memoranda for future questions and drew on those notes for the purposes of the questions which they set. The papers which they prepared originated from themselves, and were, within the meaning of the Act, original. It was said, however, that they drew upon the stock of knowledge common to mathematicians, and that the time spent in producing the

Intellectual Property Collateralisation in the Age of the Movable Property Security Rights Act: The Case of Nakumatt Supermarkets By Victor B. Nzomo & Perpetua N. Mwangi** Nakumatt Holdings Limited (Nakumatt) is the proprietor of the largest supermarket retail chain in East and Central Africa. According to Superbrands, Nakumatt is one of the leading brands in East Africa with branches in Kenya Uganda, Tanzania and Rwanda. However the biggest story of 2017 has been the financial woes of Nakumatt with the retail chain facing liquidation over unpaid debts totaling over Sh30 billion. From an intellectual property (IP) perspective, Nakumatt’s brand power is based on its portfolio of over 23 registered trade marks including word marks, logos and slogans all currently subsisting on the Register of Trade Marks. This blogpost departs from the premise that the recent enactment of the Movable Property Security Rights Act was envisaged to allow individuals or businesses like Nakumatt to leverage their IP assets to access much-needed financing. For over a three-decade period the Nakumatt brand has achieved a wealth of goodwill, consumer confidence and customer loyalty. Nakumatt introduced the first 24-hour retail store in the country and it has its own product brand Nakumatt Select/Blue Label.

INTERNATIONAL COMMERCIAL AGREEMENTS International commerce definition: trade that takes place between persons/companies in different countries. International trade transactions are complex and involve many players, regulations, standards and financial relationships. Pre-contractual negotiations The parties to a contract traditionally are usually considered not to be bound by any agreement regarding the formation of a contract at the pre-contractual stage and the law of contract under the freedom of contract usually does not impose any obligations with respect to the way how negotiations to form a contract should be conducted. However, its inflexible application sometimes produces unfair consequences. As a result, most legal systems recognized the need to govern the parties’ relations at the contract formation stage. But legal systems differ in how to regulate this relation. Due to the tension between different legal systems, it is difficult to set trans-national compilations of principles which may be used to govern international contracts. However the general duty of good faith and pre-contractual liability are a reasonable compromise to the conflicting positions between different legal systems (for example as adopted in the United Nations Convention on Contract for the International Sale of Goods, Vienna 1980) Letters of Intent This is is a document that serves to confirm the Buyer´s interest and willingness to continue negotiating an International Sale Contract that due to

LEGAL CONSIDERATIONS ACCORDING TO THE COMPETITION ACT KENYA. Mergers are defined as the acquisition of shares or assets both in and outside of Kenya, that results in the change of control of a business or part of a business in Kenya in any manner and also includes takeovers. The Competition Act Cap 504 of the laws of Kenya (the Act), is the key piece of legislation that regulates mergers and acquisitions. The Act aims to promote and safeguard competition in the Kenyan market and prevent anti-competitive practices. The Act established the Competition Authority (the Authority) that has the mandate to approve mergers and acquisitions and investigate any obstacles to healthy competition in the market. The Cabinet Secretary for the National Treasury and Planning then in consultation with the Competition Authority, made the Competition (General) Rules 2019 (the General Rules), which introduced changes to the merger notification thresholds, requirements and filing fees. The following are the legal considerations with respect to the Act: MERGER NOTIFICATIONS. Section 43 of the Act prescribes that where a merger is proposed, all the parties involved in the transaction are obligated to notify the Authority either in writing or in the manner prescribed. The First Schedule of the General Rules set out the thresholds for mergers subject to notification and those that are exempted from notifying the Authority. Mergers that meet these thresholds are subject to notification; Where the minimu

Law of Limited liability Partnerships Mwangi J Mbogo ATP 108 – Commercial Transactions May 2017 1 Limited Liability Partnership 1. What is an LLP • s6 - An LLP is not a partnership; rather it is a body corporate registered under the Limited Liability Partnership Act, No 42 of 2011 (the “Act”). On being registered under the Act, an LLP becomes a body corporate with perpetual succession with a legal personality separate from that of its partners or members. • The idea of LLPs came about in the UK in the 1990s when some of the larger professional services partnerships became increasingly concerned by the risk of substantial personal liability of their partners, and applied pressure on government to address the issue. • The consequence of this pressure was the entity called LLP, which retains the internal flexibility of a partnership but carries the all important limitation of liability for the partners. 2 Limited Liability Partnership 2. The law applicable to LLPs • The main law applicable to LLPs is the Limited Liability Partnership Act, No 42 of 2011. • s8 - The Partnership Act shall apply to an LLP except so far as a provision of the Act expressly provides otherwise. • Like a company, an LLP must be formed by application to and registered at the companies registry. • The Registrar of Companies is the Registrar of LLPs, and she may depute a deputy or an assistant registrar to exercise her functions under the Act. 3 Limited Liability Partnership 3.

MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS IN KENYA 1. REGULATORY FRAMEWORK 1.1 What legislation and regulatory bodies govern public M&A in your jurisdiction? Public companies listed on the Nairobi Securities Exchange (NSE) are regulated by the Companies Act 2015 and the Capital Markets Act (chapter 485A, Laws of Kenya) and associated regulations. Non-listed companies are only subject to the Companies Act. Both may be subject to sector-specific legislation governing entities such as banks, insurance and telecommunications providers, and other regulated industry players. Merger activity resulting in a deemed change of control may require regulatory approval from either or both of the Competition Authority of Kenya (CAK) and the Comesa [Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa] Competition Commission (CCC) for regional transactions. 1.2 How, by whom and what measures, are takeover regulations (or equivalent) enforced? For listed companies, the Capital Markets Authority (CMA) enforces the requirements of the Capital Markets Act and associated takeover rules. The Capital Markets Tribunal (CMT) hears appeals concerning actions by the CMA on any matter relating to the Capital Markets Act. While there are no takeover regulations applicable to non-listed companies, the CAK enforces Kenya's antitrust and merger approval regime. In regulated industries, prior notification to or approval from the relevant sector regulator may also be required, particularly where foreign investors are concerned. 2. S

KN LAW LLP LEGAL March 17, 2020 Changes in Competition Law in Kenya Introduction The Competition (Amendment) Act, 2019 (the “Act”) was assented to by the President on December 13, 2019 to commence on December 31, 2019. The Act introduced amendments to the Competition Act to regulate abuse of buyer power in the market. Additionally, the Competition (General) Rules, 2019 (“Rules”) made under Section 93 of the Act, were gazetted on December 06, 2019. The Rules consolidate the informal practice guidelines issued by Competition Authority of Kenya (CAK). We discuss the changes introduced by the Act and the Rules below. The Competition (Amendment) Act, 2019 The amendments reorganize the provisions of the Act on buyer power and abuse of buyer power. They increase CAK’s scope of powers in preventing abuse of buyer power by enabling it to monitor industries and sectors in which abuse of power is likely to occur. CAK may also require a sector or undertaking to develop a binding code of practice. The CAK is then required to publish the code of practice. The implication to businesses is that companies in ‘monitored’ sectors will be required to comply with reporting and prudential requirements. What is buyer power? It is the influence exerted by an undertaking in the position of purchaser to either obtain from a supplier more favourable terms or impose a long-term opportunity cost including harm or withheld benefit which would be significantly disproportionate to any resulting long-term co

MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS &amp; TAKEOVERS MERGERS A merger is a voluntary amalgamation of two firms on roughly equal terms into one new legal entity. The decision is usually mutual between the merging companies. Mergers are mostly geared towards enjoying greater economies of scale and increasing a companies competitiveness in the market. The term “merger” is defined in Section 2 of the Competition Act, 2010 (the Act) as “any acquisition of shares, business or other assets, whether inside or outside of Kenya, resulting in the change of control of a business, part of a business or an asset of a business in Kenya, in any manner and includes a takeover. Sec 41 of the Act goes ahead to define mergers in greater details to includea) the purchase or lease of shares, acquisition of an interest, or purchase of assets of the other undertaking in question;(b) the acquisition of a controlling interest in a section of the business of an undertaking capable of itself being operated independentlyThe Capital Markets (Take-overs and mergers) Regulations, 2002 provides that a merger is an arrangement whereby the assets of two or more companies become vested in or under the control of one company6/8/202214WAKIMANI 6/8/20227WAKIMANI 6/8/2022WAKIMANI6 6/8/2022WAKIMANI5 6/8/20224WAKIMANILINK POISON PILLPoison pills allow existing shareholders the right to purchase additional shares at a discount, effectively diluting the ownership interest of a new, hostile party.

MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS IN KENYA 1. REGULATORY FRAMEWORK 1.1 What legislation and regulatory bodies govern public M&A in your jurisdiction? Public companies listed on the Nairobi Securities Exchange (NSE) are regulated by the Companies Act 2015 and the Capital Markets Act (chapter 485A, Laws of Kenya) and associated regulations. Non-listed companies are only subject to the Companies Act. Both may be subject to sector-specific legislation governing entities such as banks, insurance and telecommunications providers, and other regulated industry players. Merger activity resulting in a deemed change of control may require regulatory approval from either or both of the Competition Authority of Kenya (CAK) and the Comesa [Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa] Competition Commission (CCC) for regional transactions. 1.2 How, by whom and what measures, are takeover regulations (or equivalent) enforced? For listed companies, the Capital Markets Authority (CMA) enforces the requirements of the Capital Markets Act and associated takeover rules. The Capital Markets Tribunal (CMT) hears appeals concerning actions by the CMA on any matter relating to the Capital Markets Act. While there are no takeover regulations applicable to non-listed companies, the CAK enforces Kenya's antitrust and merger approval regime. In regulated industries, prior notification to or approval from the relevant sector regulator may also be required, particularly where foreign investors are concerned. 2. S

COMPETITION AUTHORITY OF KENYA MERGER NOTIFICATION FORM CAK/M&A/F-001 Instructions 1. This form is issued in terms of Section 43 (1) of the Competition Act which stipulates that each of the undertakings to the merger shall notify the Authority of the proposal in writing or in the prescribed manner. 2. The objective of this merger notification form is to improve the efficiency, transparency and predictability of the merger notification process. 3. Please note that the Competition Act empowers the Competition Authority of Kenya to obtain information relevant to evaluate mergers and acquisitions. This form facilitates the process by identifying relevant information depending on the activities of the merging parties and whether they are operating in the same markets and/or are actual or potential customers or suppliers to each other. By anticipating the likely information required by CAK and collating it in advance the time taken for the evaluation of the merger will be reduced. However, omitting relevant information may lead to the merger evaluation being delayed. This table below summarizes the schedules which should be normally submitted, depending on the characteristics of the merger.

When the old financial laws regarding implementation of bankruptcy orders were applied to an individual in Kenya’s traditional legal landscape, one was not allowed to carry more than Sh100 in their pockets. The time tested legal provision, which has been the last resort by individuals who are unable to service their debt, now faces several headwinds with the changing financial times and particularly the move to cashless transactions. Experts say although the declaration of bankruptcy does not discharge one from debt obligation but only protects them from creditors within the period of bankruptcy, the way of determining whether one’s economic conditions have changed, necessitating his debt obligation to be reimposed, remain gray in the modern cashlite economy. Once a bankruptcy order is made, the property of the bankrupt and the power he could have vested over that property vests in a trustee. The only assets allowed are his tools of trade, necessary household furniture and personal effects, and even a motor vehicle if its value is not more than Sh1 million. Later, the Insolvency Act was introduced with the sole aim of helping the individual or company, return to stability and not destroy them. The move is a shift from the previous focus where debtors who defaulted were punished by being sent to prison, hurting the very businesses from which they were expected to generate funds to settle the debts. Lawyers argue that the use of mobile money platforms will now be the new avenue

KENYA SCHOOL OF LAW COMMERCIAL TRANSACTIONS MOVABLE PROPERTY SECURITY RIGHTS Revision Sample answers November 2012 Question 4 a) Advice Fanya Kazi Yes Mr Fanya Kazi can use his movables as collateral.  What is a movable? All property other than land.  The applicable law is the MPSR 2017 which provides for the use of movables as collateral in secured financing  Therefore Mr Fanya Kazi can create a security agreement depending on the type of movable. A security agreement will give rise to a security right that can be enforced by the secured creditor in case of default by the grantor  Sec 4 provides for different types of security agreements like a chattels mortgage, fixed and floating charges depending on the nature of the movable  According to the facts we may categorize Mr Fanya Kazis movable as tangible or intangible. Sec 7 (2a) a security right may encumber a tangible or intangible asset. o Tangible  Crops in the Barn  Ruminants- live stock  Tractors and Combine harvesters o Intangible  Money on the bank  In line with the facts of the question o The crops in the barn are commingled assets(see sec 2 for the definition) and therefore may require a different security agreement like a floating charge. Same applies to the livestock o For the tractors and combine harvester may be secured with a chattels mortgage or a fixed charge  However in our case if Mr Fanya Kazi would like to use all his movable property the Act provides that a security right may encumber all of t

Bowie Bonds: A Look at David Bowie's Innovative Estate Plan At the time of his tragic and unexpected (to the public, anyway) death, the iconic David Bowie had it all: family, fame, and fortune. Not so long ago, however, the artist found himself increasingly under pressure as financial obligations began to overcome a somewhat unpredictable music career. Eager to overcome his fiscal problems while retaining ultimate rights to his music, Bowie devised an ingenious plan that accomplished both goals, all while creating a lasting intellectual property dynasty that will benefit his surviving wife and children for years to come. Known as "Bowie Bonds", his innovative plan has transformed the transactional side of the music industry and helped to protect vulnerable artists from irrevocably signing away the rights to their creations during periods of financial uncertainty. The concept he pioneered has been embraced by elite artists and securities investors worldwide. Intellectual Property Bonds In 1997, amid growing concerns of physical and financial security, David Bowie met with a group of financial analysts to devise an investment vehicle that would both protect his artistic achievements and ensure regular income and protection from a somewhat volatile and unpredictable industry: show business. After meeting with several inventive financial professionals, Bowie opted to create an asset-backed security resting on the value of his pre-1990 portfolio of artistic works, which consisted

Intellectual Property Collateralisation in the Age of the Movable Property Security Rights Act: The Case of Nakumatt Supermarkets By Victor B. Nzomo & Perpetua N. Mwangi** Nakumatt Holdings Limited (Nakumatt) is the proprietor of the largest supermarket retail chain in East and Central Africa. According to Superbrands, Nakumatt is one of the leading brands in East Africa with branches in Kenya Uganda, Tanzania and Rwanda. However the biggest story of 2017 has been the financial woes of Nakumatt with the retail chain facing liquidation over unpaid debts totaling over Sh30 billion. From an intellectual property (IP) perspective, Nakumatt’s brand power is based on its portfolio of over 23 registered trade marks including word marks, logos and slogans all currently subsisting on the Register of Trade Marks. This blogpost departs from the premise that the recent enactment of the Movable Property Security Rights Act was envisaged to allow individuals or businesses like Nakumatt to leverage their IP assets to access much-needed financing. For over a three-decade period the Nakumatt brand has achieved a wealth of goodwill, consumer confidence and customer loyalty. Nakumatt introduced the first 24-hour retail store in the country and it has its own product brand Nakumatt Select/Blue Label. In addition, the retailer embraced innovation by introducing the Nakumatt Global Prepaid Card in partnership with MasterCard. Nakumatt is the official sponsor of Nakumatt FC, a local professional fo

THE RECEIVER OFFICIAL PUBLICATION OF THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF FEDERAL EQUITY RECEIVERS This article originally appeared in the April 2019 | Issue 8 release. For more information about NAFER, visit www.NAFER.org The Legacy Of Twyne’s Case By Daniel Seligman W e know the facts only from court records. One day, a sheriff showed up on the property of a farmer name Pierce. The sheriff had a mission: he had a writ of execution (a court order) that gave him the right to take Pierce’s sheep to satisfy a debt that Pierce owed to someone called “C.”1 And that is when the trouble started. Pierce insisted that he didn’t have the sheep anymore. They now belonged to Twyne, to whom Pierce also owed money. Yes, Pierce’s mark was on the sheep and he had recently sheared some of them and even sold others. From the records we can infer that Pierce and Twyne were neighbors and perhaps friends, and that Pierce didn’t mind repaying Twyne, but he objected to paying anything (sheep or money) to C. Pierce had apparently heard in advance of the sheriff ’s visit and had given everything he owned – his sheep, clothes and other personal possessions – by deed to Twyne.2 As a result, there was nothing for the sheriff to recover. All of Pierce’s property was beyond the sheriff ’s reach, thus depriving C of any repayment. What happened next is somewhat unclear but Twyne and his friends (perhaps Pierce) physically resisted the sheriff “with force.” Getting in an altercation with the sheriff – then or now –

Secured Transactions: The Power of Collateral HEYWOOD FLEISIG In many developing countries, businesses are unable to get low-cost, long-term loans from private lenders to finance investment projects. Reforms that make it easier for borrowers to use movable property as collateral would give comfort to lenders, stimulate investment, and boost productivity and growth. T HE FIRST question any private lender asks is, “How do I get my money back?” Given the risks involved in lending—borrowers may be unlucky, unwise, or dishonest— what conditions give comfort to lenders? Two basic loan transactions have evolved in private markets: unsecured and secured. When a borrower offers an unsecured promise to pay, the lender must rely on the borrower’s reputation, or trust that the borrower will pay back the loan in order to have access to future loans. In secured transactions, promises to repay are backed by collateral that lenders can seize and sell in the event loan payments are not made as agreed. Collateral may be real estate or personal property—tangible personal property such as inventory, equipment, livestock, and tractors; or intangible personal property such as unsecured accounts owed to merchants (accounts receivable) and secured agreements (chattel paper). Secured transactions have advantages for borrowers and lenders alike— transaction costs are lower and lenders do not need to gather as much information about borrowers. The issue of collateral is one of great economic importance

ATP 108 Commercial Transactions - 2024LECTURE 1 – INTRODUCTION TO CORPORATE LAW – FOUNDATIONAL CONCEPTSCourse Instructor – Stephen Mallowah LLB, LLM, MSc Is there a common structure for legal business corporations? Are there similarities of legal characteristics of companies/ corporations in all jurisdictions? There are five characteristics that it is possible to observe in every company doing business:Legal personality;Limited liability;Transferable shares;Delegated management;Investor ownership.2 The five core structural characteristics of a CompanyIn most economically active jurisdictions there is a basic statute that provides for the formation of firms with all of the above-mentioned characteristics.These characteristics respond to the economic exigencies of the large modern business enterprise.Even if there are other forms of business enterprise that lack one or more of these characteristics, in market economies, almost all companies adopt a legal form that possess all of them. These characteristics make the company attractive for organizing productive activity, but also generate tensions and trade-offs that lead to the the agency problems that corporate law must deal with.3 1. Legal PersonalityFirm as a “nexus of contracts”: this description is often used to emphasize the fact that most of the important relationships within a firm are essentially based on consent, rather than involving some form of extra-contractual command-and-control authority.

1. Business structures § The four principal business structures are the sole proprietorship, the partnership, the limited liability partnership, and the company. § Sole proprietorships are the most common business structure and involve little formality, but the liability of the sole proprietor is personal and unlimited. § Two or more persons who wish to conduct business can form an ordinary partnership. Such partnerships are subject to greater regulation than sole proprietorships, but less regulation than limited liability partnerships and companies. The liability of the partners is personal and unlimited. § Limited liability partnerships were created largely to be a suitable business vehicle for large professional firms. In many respects, limited liability partnerships closely resemble companies. § Public companies are so called because they can offer to sell their shares to the public at large. Private companies cannot offer to sell their shares to the public at large. There are other notable differences between public and private companies. § The vast majority of companies are limited companies, and so their members will usually have limited liability. Introduction A person who wishes to engage in some form of business activity will need to do so via some form of business structure, with differing business structures providing different advantages and disadvantages.

Incorporation Companies (and limited liability partnerships) are formed via a formal process known as ‘incorporation’. The vast majority of companies are incorporated by registration, which involves registering certain documents with the Registrar of Companies at Sheria House. A company can do many things that a natural person can, including entering into contracts, owning property and commencing legal proceedings. In the vast majority of companies, the liability of the members will be limited. A company can be held liable for a civil wrong, or found guilty of committing a crime. A company has corporate personality, which means that, at law, it is a person. The courts can set aside a company’s corporate personality where statute so provides, or where a company is interposed in order to evade, or frustrate the enforcement of, a legal obligation. Introduction Sole proprietorships and ordinary partnerships can be brought into existence very easily and with minimal state involvement. Conversely, companies (and LLPs) are brought into existence at the discretion of the state via a formal process known as ‘incorporation’. The word ‘incorporation’ is used because successful incorporation brings into existence a ‘corporation’ (s 18-19 of the CA 2015 – effects of incorporation.

New Approaches The decision of the Court of Appeal in Adams v Cape Industries plc clearly indicates that the courts are not quick to pierce the veil and the number of grounds upon which the veil can be pierced is limited. The Supreme Court case of Petrodel Resources Ltd v Prest [2013] has further limited the grounds on which the veil can be pierced by stating that there is only one instance in which the veil can be pierced and, even in that instance, the veil will only be pierced if it is necessary to do so. Prest must now be regarded as the leading case in this area and casts significant doubt on the validity of many of the cases discussed (at least in terms of them being regarded as instances of piercing the veil). Petrodel Resources Ltd v Prest [2013] UKSC 34 FACTS: The case involved a divorce settlement between Mr and Mrs Prest. The High Court had awarded Mrs Prest a divorce settlement totalling £17.5 million, but much of Mr Prest’s assets were (p. 39) tied up in companies that were solely controlled by him. Section 24(1)(a) of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 grants the court the power to ‘order that a party to the marriage shall transfer to the other party … property to which the first mentioned party is entitled’. The High Court utilized this power to pierce the corporate veils of these companies and order the relevant properties to be transferred to Mrs Prest. Mr Prest appealed, questioning whether the court had the power to do this given that the properties did not be

New Approaches The decision of the Court of Appeal in Adams v Cape Industries plc clearly indicates that the courts are not quick to pierce the veil and the number of grounds upon which the veil can be pierced is limited. The Supreme Court case of Petrodel Resources Ltd v Prest [2013] has further limited the grounds on which the veil can be pierced by stating that there is only one instance in which the veil can be pierced and, even in that instance, the veil will only be pierced if it is necessary to do so. Prest must now be regarded as the leading case in this area and casts significant doubt on the validity of many of the cases discussed (at least in terms of them being regarded as instances of piercing the veil). Petrodel Resources Ltd v Prest [2013] UKSC 34 FACTS: The case involved a divorce settlement between Mr and Mrs Prest. The High Court had awarded Mrs Prest a divorce settlement totalling £17.5 million, but much of Mr Prest’s assets were (p. 39) tied up in companies that were solely controlled by him. Section 24(1)(a) of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 grants the court the power to ‘order that a party to the marriage shall transfer to the other party … property to which the first mentioned party is entitled’. The High Court utilized this power to pierce the corporate veils of these companies and order the relevant properties to be transferred to Mrs Prest. Mr Prest appealed, questioning whether the court had the power to do this given that the properties did not be

Directors Key facts Every private company must have at least one director and every public company must have at least two directors. The power to manage the company is initially vested in the members, but is usually delegated to the directors by the articles. Directors’ duties are now found in the Companies Act 2015, which provides for seven general duties that directors owe to the company. The general duties are based on prior common law duties, so pre-2015 case law will remain relevant. Certain types of transaction involving directors will only be valid if authorized by a resolution of the members. A director’s term of office can terminate in several ways including resignation, retirement, or removal. Additionally, the courts can disqualify a person from acting as director. The definition of ‘director’ A company may be run by persons who call themselves ‘governors’ or ‘managers’ and, increasingly, persons not involved in management at board level are called ‘directors’. Are such persons actually directors? The CA 2015 s3 defines a director as follows: in relation to a body corporate, includes— any person occupying the position of a director of the body (by whatever name the person is called); and any person in accordance with whose directions or instructions (not being advice given in a professional capacity) the directors of the body are accustomed to act; This broad definition will cover those who have been validly appointed to the office of director (known as de jure (‘i

Members Although the terms ‘member’ and ‘shareholder’ tend to be used interchangeably, there is a distinction (especially in companies that do not have a share capital). Members usually exercise their decision-making powers via the passing of resolutions. A resolution is simply a formal vote. The two forms of resolution are ordinary resolutions (which require a simple majority) and special resolutions (which require a majority of no less than 75 per cent). Public companies must pass resolutions at general meetings. Private companies must pass resolutions at general meetings, unless the written resolution procedure is used. Resolutions are only valid if sufficient notice of the meeting is provided and a quorum is present. A quorum is simply the minimum number of persons required to be present in order to conduct business. Members can appoint a proxy to attend, speak, and vote at general meetings on their behalf. Introduction The members of a company play two vital roles. First, through the purchase of shares, they contribute capital to the company. The nature of the share and share capital is discussed in the next class but our focus is on the second vital role that the members play, namely their ability to make decisions. As will be seen, a significant amount of power is placed into the hands of members and numerous key decisions are reserved for them alone.

The constitution of the company A company’s constitution consists primarily of the articles of association, and agreements and resolutions affecting the company’s constitution. The Companies Act 2015 has significantly reduced the importance of the memorandum of association, and the articles now form the company’s principal constitutional document. The constitution forms a statutory contract between the company and its members, and between the members themselves, but only those provisions relating to membership rights will constitute terms of the statutory contract. A company that acts outside the scope of its objects clause will be acting ultra vires. Companies incorporated under the Companies Act 2015 have unrestricted objects by default – CA 2015 s28. A company can alter its articles by passing a special resolution, although statute and the common law restrict a company’s ability to alter its articles. Despite being the largest piece of legislation ever passed, the CA 2015 does not seek to exhaustively regulate the internal affairs of companies. Much is left to the companies themselves who will usually create their own internal rules via the company’s constitution. A company’s constitution largely fulfils the same function as the constitution of a country, namely, to set out the powers, rights and obligations of those who are subject to the constitution.

2. Incorporation § Companies (and limited liability partnerships) are formed via a formal process known as ‘incorporation’. § The vast majority of companies are incorporated by registration, which involves registering certain documents with the Registrar of Companies at Sheria House. § A company can do many things that a natural person can, including entering into contracts, owning property and commencing legal proceedings. § In the vast majority of companies, the liability of the members will be limited. § A company can be held liable for a civil wrong, or found guilty of committing a crime. § A company has corporate personality, which means that, at law, it is a person. § The courts can set aside a company’s corporate personality where statute so provides, or where a company is interposed in order to evade, or frustrate the enforcement of, a legal obligation. Introduction Sole proprietorships and ordinary partnerships can be brought into existence very easily and with minimal state involvement. Conversely, companies (and LLPs) are brought into existence at the discretion of the state via a formal process known as ‘incorporation’. The word ‘incorporation’ is used because successful incorporation brings into existence a ‘corporation’ (s 18-19 of the CA 2015 – effects of incorporation.

TRAINING MODULE Table of Contents NAME SEARCH During the registering a new company, the first step is to get a name for the company. This involves making an application though e-citizen website, to reserve the name. Before conducting a name search the following should be observed: That there is an application for reservation of a company name. A receipt for payment/invoice of the prescribed fee. The Registrar may, on written application, reserve a name pending the registration of the company1, through online search at the Companies Registry. The name is reserved for a minimum of 30 days, as the registrar confirms whether the name is being used by another company. The period may be extended for another 30 days, for special reasons, to give the applicant time to register the name2. One is then required to pay a fee of Ksh 150 per name, which is broken down to Ksh1003 for the name and Ksh50 as the convenience fee. It should be noted that there is no requirement for a minimum or maximum number of names that an application can give. Choosing of a suitable company Name One must choose a company name for the business that he/she intends to run. The name cannot be the same as another company in the index of registered companies (Section 57 of Companies Act, 2015). The Business Registration Service department ensures that the names being lodged for registration do not constitute any prohibited names such as “Al Shabab, Mungiki”.

1. Business structures § The four principal business structures are the sole proprietorship, the partnership, the limited liability partnership, and the company. § Sole proprietorships are the most common business structure and involve little formality, but the liability of the sole proprietor is personal and unlimited. § Two or more persons who wish to conduct business can form an ordinary partnership. Such partnerships are subject to greater regulation than sole proprietorships, but less regulation than limited liability partnerships and companies. The liability of the partners is personal and unlimited. § Limited liability partnerships were created largely to be a suitable business vehicle for large professional firms. In many respects, limited liability partnerships closely resemble companies. § Public companies are so called because they can offer to sell their shares to the public at large. Private companies cannot offer to sell their shares to the public at large. There are other notable differences between public and private companies. § The vast majority of companies are limited companies, and so their members will usually have limited liability.

Capital and capital maintenance § The two principal types of capital that companies acquire are share capital (capital obtained by selling shares) and debt capital (capital borrowed from others). § A new allotment of shares must usually first be offered to existing shareholders. § Companies are prohibited from allotting shares for less than their nominal value. § Companies can issue different classes of shares with different class rights, and the law regulates the ability to vary such class rights. § Public companies are subject to minimum capital requirements when commencing business, whereas private companies are not. § A reduction of share capital is only valid if the strict procedures relating to a reduction of capital found in the Companies Act 2015 are complied with. § § Companies are generally prohibited from purchasing their own shares, but the 2015 Act does provide exceptions to this prohibition. Private companies are permitted to provide financial assistance to acquire their own shares. Public companies are generally prohibited from providing such assistance, but there are exceptions. § Companies can only pay a dividend out of ‘profits available for the purpose’. § The two principal types of charge are fixed charges and floating charges and, in order to be enforceable, charges need to be registered in accordance with the Companies Act 2015. Shares and share capital The CA 2015 defines ‘shares’ as (a) in relation to an undertaking with a share capital, means shares i

SHAREHOLDERS’ AGREEMENT The Statutory Contract The company’s constitution comprised in its Articles of Association (the Articles) forms the basis of a statutory contract between the shareholders and the company and between the shareholders themselves. It is binding upon anyone who acquires shares and can be enforced by a shareholder if there is a breach of his rights as a shareholder. It cannot be set aside for misrepresentation or undue influence and the court cannot imply any terms into it. Moreover, it can be amended by a 75% majority of shareholders present and voting at a members meeting rendering vulnerable a minority shareholder. The Articles are a public document and accordingly, available for anyone to obtain a copy from the Companies Registry. A shareholders’ agreement on the other hand is a private document. What is it? A shareholders’ agreement is a contract between the shareholders in a private limited company. It is intended to regulate the relationship between the shareholders. It may specify things which shareholders must do and may specify things which they must not do. The company may also be a party to the agreement which is particularly important if the intention is to bind the company to the provisions of any such agreement. The provisions of the agreement will be legally binding and enforceable by all parties to it.

The Company as a Criminal: Comparative Examination of some Trends and Challenges Relating to Criminal Liability of Corporate Persons George O. Otieno Ochich1 2008. 1. ABSTRACT As sophistication engulfs the business sphere, an increasing number of individuals prefer to incorporate their business enterprises into companies to facilitate their enjoyment of the advantages of corporate trading.1 That trend has seen many activities that were previously the preserve of natural persons being increasingly undertaken under the veil of incorporation. Incidental to such activities are bound to be those that have criminal dimensions. Of course, there exist a whole lot of persons who would seek to use the veil of incorporation to disguise their individual criminal intents and acts. Thus, in the pursuit of their business objectives companies engage in criminal activities, some of which are deliberate while others are merely incidental to their mandate. While certain such criminal activities may be blamed on the individuals who comprise the company, others are attributable to none other than the company itself. As the number of corporations increases and their involvement in diverse spheres of life expands, the need to call them to account for their criminal wrongdoing equally grows. This development poses new and complex challenges to criminal law as traditionally understood. Various jurisdictions have had to expand or reorient their perspectives of criminal responsibility in response to th

General partnerships, LLPs and limited partnerships: comparison of key features This checklist sets out a comparison of the key features of general partnerships and limited partnerships under the Partnerships Act No. 16 of 2012, and limited liability partnerships (LLPs) incorporated under the Limited Liability Partnerships Act No. 42 of 2011 (Cap 30A). Scope of this checklist The table below provides a comparison of the key features of: General partnerships under the Partnerships Act 2012 (PA 2012). Many general partnerships (or ordinary partnerships as they are sometimes known) arise without the knowledge of the persons involved. Partnership is defined as the relation which exists between persons carrying on a business in common with a view to profit (section 3, PA 2012). It is a matter of fact whether a general partnership exists and the parties cannot simply determine this for themselves. Normally the relationship is governed by a contractual agreement but the essence of a partnership is the continuing relationship, personal as well as commercial, with the contractual agreement being only an indication of the relationship (Hurst v Bryk [2001] 1 AC 185). When the courts have to consider whether a general partnership exists, they look at the substance of the arrangements and not the stated intentions of the parties. One advantage a general partnership has over limited partnerships and LLPs is that they are simple and cheap to set up. No formal agreement is necessary as the t

1. The Basics of Mergers and Acquisitions Over the past few decades, we have seen countless examples of companies, such as Amazon, Facebook, General Electric, Google, and Cisco, that have grown dramatically and built revenues through aggressive acquisition programs. Seasoned executives and entrepreneurs have always searched for efficient and profitable ways to increase revenues and gain market share. The typical strategic growth options are as follows: organic, inorganic, or by external means. Examples of organic growth are hiring additional salespeople, developing new products, and expanding geographically. The best example of inorganic growth is an acquisition of another firm, something that is often done to gain access to a new product line, customer segment, or geography. Finally, external revenue growth opportunities include franchising, licensing, joint ventures, strategic alliances, and the appointment of overseas distributors, which are available to growing companies as an alternative to mergers and acquisitions as a growth engine. Figure 1-1 discusses the benefits of organic versus other forms of growth. This book focuses primarily on mergers and acquisitions (M&A) as a means of growing, although toward the end of the book certain external means are explored as well. Figure 1-1. M&A Basics: Buy Versus Build At the heart of all decisions regarding mergers and acquisitions, regardless of the global financial crisis, is a fundamental question: Are we better off buying a

CHAPTER 1 Conducting Due Diligence: An Overview Risk has always been a companion of reward, inherent in assessing opportunities against a company’s strengths and weaknesses. —Report of the NACD Blue Ribbon Commission on Risk Governance (2009) INTRODUCTION The due diligence phase of any acquisition—the study of the risks that the deal poses—can make the difference between success and failure. Many a deal that looks good on the back of an envelope looks bad in a spreadsheet. Acquirers must face all the facts—even worst-case scenarios. This is why due diligence must be considered in conjunction with other acquisition activities and goals, including strategic planning, valuation, financing, structuring, and—most important—charting the future of the combined company, with all its new risks and opportunities. To put due diligence in its proper perspective, we begin this chapter with the legal foundations of due diligence. Next, we discuss the “what, when, and who” of due diligence—that is, its scope, duration, and key participants. We then give some further background on the legal aspects of due diligence (focusing on “due diligence” in the securities law context). Finally, we close with suggestions for verification and risk prevention. Our goal is to build a strong platform of understanding for the more detailed work ahead. LEGAL FOUNDATIONS What are the legal origins of due diligence? The term due diligence originated in so-called common law, also known as case law—the law that h

CHAPTER 4 The Legal Compliance Review Are we disposed to be the number of those who, having eyes, see not, and having ears, hear not . . . ? For my part, whatever anguish of spirit it may cost, I am willing to know the whole truth; to know the worst, and to provide for it. —Patrick Henry, Speech at the Virginia Convention, Richmond, March 23, 1775 INTRODUCTION Legal compliance begins at home, with a responsible due diligence process that uncovers current and potential causes of financial, operational, and legal problems. This process itself can eliminate about a quarter of potential suits against directors and officers. According to past research by Tillinghast Insurance, a unit of Towers Watson, one out of every four lawsuits filed against officers and directors in any 10-year period stems from a merger that has gone bad.1 Plaintiffs allege that the buyer or seller committed errors in the purchase or sale of the company. A responsible due diligence process, well documented, can provide a strong defense against such legal actions. It is somewhat more difficult, however, to anticipate and manage the other causes of lawsuits against corporate officers and directors. These can come from anyone over any issue—and legal claims often come in clusters, involving multiple issues.2 This chapter is about that vast terrain of potential litigation, one that expands whenever an acquirer buys another company. Why? Because the seller’s legal vulnerabilities are usually transferred to the bu

How does the mergers and acquisitions (M&A) process start? The process is more informatively looked at from the Target’s point of view. The Target may decide to put itself up for sale because it needs to for ﬁnancial reasons, because it thinks it has reached its peak value, or because one or more shareholders need or want liquidity; or it may have been approached by a potential Buyer (often a customer or supplier) who wants to talk about “matter of mutual interest.” Before the Target puts itself up for sale, it is likely that its corporate and legal aDairs will have to be cleaned up. The Target’s lawyers may or may not have had close contact and involvement with their client during the course of their engagement. Companies vary widely in how highly they value their lawyer’s input and the degree to which they pay attention to legal matters. The sale process is where the cracks in the wall will show. Sometimes costly and unrectiﬁable mistakes have been made, and the sale price will reﬂect them. Even if signiﬁcant mistakes have not been made, there will always be corporate housekeeping cleanup that will have to be done. Common problems include improperly documented customer arrangements; vague bonus arrangements for employees; nonexistent, inadequate, or unsigned customary employee arrangements (conﬁdentiality agreements, covenants not to compete, etc.); or license agreements that terminate upon an acquisition. Additionally, there may not be good records as to who owns the busin

April 24, 2021 “It is clear that you cannot stay in the top league if you only grow internally. You cannot catch up just by internal growth.

In the world or mergers and acquisitions who you merge with plays an important role in your ability to achieve strategic objectives, but it’s how you merge that will ultimately determine your success. Contract intelligence is one example of the more nuanced strategic value that a corporate marriage can bring. Mergers and acquisitions have become a common phenomenon in recent times.

ATP 108 COMMERCIAL TRANSACTIONS MARCH 2023 QUESTION ONE A. Alfa Kenya Co. Ltd. (Alfa), is a large private non-listed company, incorporated in Kenya, with two main business operations i.e. mining and shipping and manufacturing of mining and shipping machinery and equipment. Alfa is in the process of considering whether or not to undertake a restructuring programme. Alfa's annual turnover is USD $12 million. Five Alfa members of the Board of Directors (who own 60% of the equity share capital in total) hold the view that the restructuring programme would not only simplify the company's structure, but also, and most importantly, become a tool for raising extra funds for expansion of mining and shipping business. According to these members, few years after the implementation of the proposed restructuring programme, a reverse takeover should be undertaken to obtain a listing on the Nairobi stock exchange in order to raise new ﬁnance. However, the other four members of Alfa's Board of Directors (who own 40% of the equity share capital in total), have raised doubts about the restructuring programme and the reverse takeover, and are of the opinion that the company should either join hands or purchase one of the two foreign corporate entities Indaba Mining Ltd., a Ugandan company that is the market leader in manufacturing equipment for mining sector in Uganda or Ethiopian Shipping Services Ltd, that holds 40% of the local market share in Ethiopian shipping industry.

WWW.BRS.GO.KE GENERAL OVERVIEW OF THE DEBTOR’S BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS BY: JUDY MUGO, SENIOR ASSISTANT OFFICIAL RECEIVER What is bankruptcy? Bankruptcy is a legal proceeding initiated when a person is unable to repay their debts or obligations when they fall due. Bankruptcy offers an individual a chance to start afresh by pardoning debts that they declared at the time of entering into bankruptcy. In Kenya, bankruptcy proceedings are governed by the Insolvency Act 2015 and its Regulations. The High court is vested with the jurisdiction to hear and determine bankruptcy matters. The bankruptcy process Section 32 of the Act states that a debtor may make an application in court for a Bankruptcy Order adjudging him bankrupt. The legal process commences when the debtor files a Bankruptcy Petition in court. A Bankruptcy Petition can either be filed by the debtor in their own capacity or by the advocate representing the debtor. The debtor presents the following documents to the Official Receiver for approval and confirmation that he has complied with the requirements of the Act:Bankruptcy petition- Form No. 10 Supporting Affidavit- Form No.8 Application for bankruptcy trustee- Form No. 9 Statement of Affairs- Form 11 Once the Official Receiver confirms compliance, the debtor makes a statutory payment of Kshs. 30,000/= to the Official Receiver, who then issues a Certificate of Compliance in relation to the petition.

INSOLVENCY IN KENYA Historical Background For a long period of time the law governing insolvency in respect to individuals and companies in Kenya was the Bankruptcy Act, Cap 53 Laws of Kenya. This piece of legislation was enacted in 1938, and upon Kenya attaining its independence, like many other legislations in operation at the time, we adopted it and thus became the guide with which matters insolvency would be undertaken. Like many of the statutes we inherited from our colonial masters, this piece of legislation was a carbon copy version of the British Bankruptcy Laws. We adopted it and continued in its use over time despite the changing tides in this very area of our law to a point this law became more or less a moribund and backward piece of legislation. Due to concerted efforts exerted by various interest groups for a change in laws that affected the conduct of business within our jurisdiction, the Bankruptcy Act among many others such as the Companies Act came under a microscope and those concerned began the process of formulating a new law to govern matters insolvency. This desire is demonstrable from the several bills that have been debated within the precincts of parliament from the Insolvency Bill 2008, 2010, 2012 and finally the Insolvency Bill 2014 that was then assented to by the president on 11th September 2015 and is now known as the Insolvency Act No. 18 of 2015. It is important at this very onset to distinguish between the terms bankruptcy and insolvency. Ban

CONDITIONS, DISCRETIONARY AUTHORITY, AND DECLARATIONS CONDITIONS TO OBLIGATIONS Let’s continue with the Susan Seller/John Buyer house purchase hypothetical that we discussed in the last class. After negotiating the purchase price, John tells Susan that he needs to obtain a mortgage and that the application process will take about six weeks. He also tells her that while he is quite conﬁdent that he will obtain the mortgage, he does not want to be obligated to buy the house if he cannot obtain it. Susan agrees. To establish the mortgage as a contractual prerequisite to John’s obligation to buy the house, the purchase contract will use a condition. A condition is a state of facts that must exist before a party is obligated to perform. If that state of facts does not exist, the obligation to perform is not triggered. Uncertainty is a hallmark of a condition. For a state of facts to be a condition, those facts cannot be certain to occur. Thus, the passage of time cannot be a condition because it will occur. Conditions may appear in any type of agreement. They are not limited to acquisition agreements. A condition is not a condition to the making of a covenant. Instead, a condition is a state of facts that must exist before a party must perform the obligation that ﬂows from a covenant. Many lawyers still refer to a condition as a condition precedent, although this usage is now no longer necessary. Previously, a condition was labeled either a condition precedent or a condition subse

ATP 108 COMMERCIAL TRANSACTIONS 2024 TOPIC: COMMERCIAL CONTRACTS PART 1 – INTRODUCTION TO ADVANCED CONTRACT DRAFTING 1.1 INTRODUCTION A well-drafted contract is elegant. Its language is clear and unambiguous, and its organization cohesive and thoughtful. But drafting a contract requires more than good writing and organizational skills. A drafter should have keen analytical skills; a superior ability to negotiate; a sophisticated understanding of business, the business deal, and the client’s business; a comprehensive knowledge of the law; and a discerning eye for details. 1.2 WHAT DOES A CONTRACT DO? A contract establishes the terms of the parties’ relationship. It reﬂects their agreement as to the rules that will govern their transaction. The rules generally include § § § § § § § the statements of facts that each party made that induced the other to enter the transaction; each party’s promises as to its future performance; each party’s rights; the events that must occur before each party is obligated to perform; each party’s discretionary authority; how the contract will end, including the events that constitute breach and the remedies for breach; and the general policies that govern the parties’ relationship. These rules are the parties’ private laws, which the courts will enforce, subject to public policy exceptions found in statutes and common law. Indeed, commentators speak of contracts as private law. They also refer to them as planning documents. Unlike litigation, whic

PRIMER ON DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENTS Scope This paper examines the relationship between a manufacturer or supplier and its distributor. It provides an overview of the principal legal and commercial considerations likely to apply when appointing a distributor. It explores the principal di=erences between the various types of distribution agreement (exclusive, non-exclusive, sole, selective). It also examines the di=erences between the appointment of an agent and distributor. A. Distribution and agency Distinction between distributors, resellers and agents It is important for a supplier or manufacturer, when considering how best to market, sell or distribute its products, to be aware of the di=erence, in legal and practical terms, between appointing an agent and a distributor. Agency and distribution compared Agent promotes contract between principal and customer Essentially, an agent is appointed by the principal to negotiate and possibly conclude contracts with customers on the principal’s behalf. Agents are paid commission on the sales they make, usually on a percentage basis. The only contract for sale of the products is made between the principal and the customer. The agent generally has no contractual liability to the customer. Distributor is a reseller A distributor buys goods from manufacturers or other suppliers and resells them to others in the supply chain, such as resellers and end-users, adding a margin to cover its own costs and proﬁt.

He inherited the business from his father and the reason for the success of his business has been the secret recipe for the crunchy chicken. This recipe is a well-guarded family secret, and over the years the family has ensured that only members of the immediate family have access to the recipe. In fact, all the branches in South Africa are headed by family members who are the only ones who have access to the recipe.

Chapter 29 KENYA John Syekei, Philip Coulson and Babette Märzheuser-Wood 1 I INTRODUCTION The international franchise market in Kenya has grown extensively. There are currently a considerable number of international franchisors with established operations in the Kenyan market, for example KFC, Nando’s, Subway, Papa John’s and Dubai-based Baby Shop or South African Mr Price. Local franchisors are few but well established within the Kenyan market, such as the livestock services offered by Sidai Africa to local farmers and Sasini Tea and Coffee or Dormans Coffee. The Kenyan franchise industry is not formally organised into a national body but there is a Kenya Franchise Association (KEFRA) which was called into life as part of a private local initiative. II MARKET ENTRY i Restrictions There are no specific restrictions or approvals for foreign franchisors entering the Kenyan market. There are, however, regulatory issues relating to establishing a business or operating a branch in Kenya. Typically, it would be best to structure the franchise so that the franchisor does not acquire a local presence. Most franchise agreements are structured in this way. Kenyan law is based on common law principles and very similar to English law so that English law agreements can be used without substantial amendments. The decisions of the English courts are often used as persuasive precedents. Certain franchise agreements or arrangements may fall within the ambit of the Competition Act, 2010 if the

Key Franchising Considerations Introduction Franchising is a contractual arrangement by which franchisors, in exchange for an upfront payment or a series of payments (usually both), grant franchisees (usually independently owned and ﬁnanced) the right to operate a business and sell or distribute goods or services, or goods and services, identiﬁed with the franchisor’s trademarks, trade names, and other intellectual property. Franchisors typically exercise signiﬁcant control over the format and quality standards of franchisee businesses by requiring them to operate according to the franchisor’s requirements, set out in one or more contractually binding franchise manuals. Franchisors normally take care not to be involved in the management of the businesses of the franchisees so that the business risk is with the franchisees, but they usually provide support to assist franchisees in complying with the franchise agreement and franchise manuals. Franchising can have many beneﬁts for a foreign supplier, including the ability to expand and capture new markets quickly with limited capital expenditure. However, although franchising is lightly regulated in Kenya, counsel advising prospective franchisors planning to establish a franchising arrangement should consider the risks and requirements that may arise. This paper considers the following aspects of franchising: § Key legal and regulatory requirements governing franchising arrangements, including: • • • • • • absence of a statutory

Primer on Guarantees in Kenya and English Law 1. Introduction to Guarantees A guarantee is a legal promise made by one party (the guarantor) to fulﬁll the obligations or settle the debt of another party (the principal debtor) if the latter fails to do so. Guarantees are commonly used in commercial transactions to provide security and assurance to creditors. They play a crucial role in risk mitigation and enhancing the creditworthiness of the debtor in the eyes of the creditor. In Kenya and under English law, guarantees are subject to various statutory provisions and case law principles that shape their formation, execution, and enforcement. 2. Legal Framework Governing Guarantees In Kenya, the legal framework governing guarantees is largely based on English common law, with certain statutory provisions that align with local practices. The key legal instruments include: The Law of Contract Act (Cap. 23, Kenya) This Act requires guarantees to be in writing and signed by the guarantor. Section 3(1) mandates that for a guarantee to be enforceable, there must be written evidence signed by the party to be charged with it. Section 3(1) of the LCA states: “No suit shall be brought whereby to charge the defendant upon any special promise to answer for the debt, default or miscarriages of another person unless the agreement upon which such suit is brought, or some memorandum or note thereof, is in writing and signed by the party to be charged therewith or some other person thereunto by

SAMPLE EXAM QUESTION: GUARANTEES Question: ABC Ltd, a construction company, was awarded a contract by the Government of Kenya to construct a highway. To secure the performance of its obligations under the contract, ABC Ltd approached XBank Ltd for a loan facility of KES 500 million. XBank Ltd agreed to provide the loan on the condition that ABC Ltd’s directors, Mr. Mwangi and Ms. Achieng, provide personal guarantees for the full amount of the loan. Mr. Mwangi and Ms. Achieng signed a written guarantee agreement, which was properly executed. Six months into the project, ABC Ltd ran into ﬁnancial diLiculties and defaulted on its loan repayments. XBank Ltd notiﬁed Mr. Mwangi and Ms. Achieng that it intended to enforce the guarantees and require them to repay the outstanding amount of KES 350 million. Unbeknownst to the guarantors, ABC Ltd had entered into a side agreement with the Government of Kenya that varied some of the original terms of the construction contract, extending the completion deadline by six months and altering certain payment milestones. The side agreement was not disclosed to XBank Ltd, and neither Mr. Mwangi nor Ms. Achieng was informed of the changes. Mr. Mwangi now claims that the variation of the construction contract without his knowledge or consent has discharged his liability under the guarantee. On the other hand, Ms. Achieng argues that she should be released from her guarantee because she was not provided with proper notice by XBank Ltd of ABC Ltd’s

ATP 108 COMMERCIAL TRANSACTIONS - FRIDAY 1GTH APRIL 2024 ǪUESTION 6(A) – (7 Marks) Kweli Co. Ltd discovered an exciting business opportunity of gas refilling for hybrid cars that recently became fashionable in the transport sector especially amongst Uber, Bolt, Little Cab among others. The business became especially lucrative when the government decided to remove all fuel subsidies and increase the rate of VAT on fuel from 8% to 16%. Consequently, the prices of petrol and diesel in the country became extremely high that some drivers opted to fuel in neighboring countries. Taxi drivers countrywide complained of reduced profits. They adopted several measures in order to cope. One measure was to plead with Customers to pay them extra than the amount stated in their apps. The other measure taken was to resort to hybrid cars, which could use both petrol and gas. In just five years, Kweli Co. Ltd has grown in leaps and bounds and has become one of the top blue-chip companies. Most of their operations however are still located in Mombasa, Nairobi, and Kisumu. The rural market is largely underserved and according to Kweli Co. Ltd market analysis, this segment of the market represents another goldmine. Having done its market survey, Kweli Co.

ATP 108 COMMERCIAL TRANSACTIONS MARCH 2023 QUESTION ONE A. Alfa Kenya Co. Ltd. (Alfa), is a large private non-listed company, incorporated in Kenya, with two main business operations i.e. mining and shipping and manufacturing of mining and shipping machinery and equipment. Alfa is in the process of considering whether or not to undertake a restructuring programme. Alfa's annual turnover is USD $12 million. Five Alfa members of the Board of Directors (who own 60% of the equity share capital in total) hold the view that the restructuring programme would not only simplify the company's structure, but also, and most importantly, become a tool for raising extra funds for expansion of mining and shipping business. According to these members, few years after the implementation of the proposed restructuring programme, a reverse takeover should be undertaken to obtain a listing on the Nairobi stock exchange in order to raise new ﬁnance. However, the other four members of Alfa's Board of Directors (who own 40% of the equity share capital in total), have raised doubts about the restructuring programme and the reverse takeover, and are of the opinion that the company should either join hands or purchase one of the two foreign corporate entities Indaba Mining Ltd., a Ugandan company that is the market leader in manufacturing equipment for mining sector in Uganda or Ethiopian Shipping Services Ltd, that holds 40% of the local market share in Ethiopian shipping industry.

JOINT VENTURES – A PRIMER 1. Introduction Joint ventures have become increasingly important as a medium through which companies undertake signiﬁcant business activities and projects. A major factor has been the escalating size of transactions and projects, which frequently require commitments on a scale beyond the resources of individual companies. Equally important, particularly in the cross-border context, are changing business conditions and markets (largely as a result of changes in political and economic conditions, deregulation and technological developments) which provide opportunities for companies to enter into joint ventures as part of their strategic planning in relation to particular industries or markets. The rationale and perceived advantages of particular joint ventures (both large and small) vary from case to case. Whatever the advantages for the individual participant, however, a joint venture inevitably involves a sacriﬁce of the control and ﬂexibility which it might otherwise have enjoyed had it undertaken a business or project independently, and exposure to the tensions that are an inherent part of a joint venture relationship. Against this background, the challenge for lawyers involved in planning and documenting a joint venture is to help create a structure that not only meets the technical, operational, ﬁnancial, accounting, regulatory, legal and tax requirements of the venture but also encapsulates the underlying commercial objectives of the individual

A trust is a fiduciary relationship where a settlor (person setting up the trust) gives another party, known as the trustee, the right to hold title to property or assets for the benefit of a third party commonly referred to as beneficiaries.

Primer: Trust Deeds under Common Law Introduction Trust deeds are foundational documents in commercial law, used in a wide range of transactions to create and manage trusts. Trusts allow one party (the trustee) to hold and manage assets on behalf of others (the beneﬁciaries). Trust deeds formalize this arrangement by setting out the terms and conditions governing the trust. Understanding the structure and application of trust deeds is essential for commercial lawyers, particularly in complex ﬁnancial and real estate transactions. 1. Trusts under English Law Deﬁnition of a Trust A trust is a legal relationship where a trustee holds assets for the beneﬁt of the beneﬁciaries. Trusts are a key component of English law, reﬂecting the division between legal and equitable ownership. The trustee has legal ownership, but they must act in the interest of the beneﬁciaries, who hold the equitable (or beneﬁcial) interest. Key Components of a Trust § § § § Settlor: The person who creates the trust by transferring property to the trustee. Trustee: The individual or entity holding and managing the trust property. Beneﬁciary: The person(s) beneﬁting from the trust. Trust Property: The assets or property held in the trust. Types of Trusts § § Express Trusts: Created intentionally by the settlor. Can be ﬁxed (speciﬁc beneﬁciaries and interests) or discretionary (trustees decide how to distribute assets). Implied Trusts: Resulting from actions or circumstances, rather than explicit intentions.

QUESTION FOUR (d) Busi Co. Ltd joined the Kenyan tourism market in 2020 at the height of the tourism boom. It invested heavily in tour vans that were to be used to transport tourists to various destinations of interest. The ﬁrst few months proved to be very lucrative since the company had managed to secure full booking throughout the year. In March 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic struck the world and many bookings were cancelled. The deposits that had been secured had to be refunded at short notice. The company found itself unable to pay its employees and had to let go many of them who were drivers. Gude Co. Ltd specializing in medical emergencies on the other hand witnessed a surge in demand for their services after securing a government contract to respond to critical cases in far ﬂung areas. Their vans were no longer adequate to respond to the medical emergencies throughout the country and they risked losing the contract if some urgent action was not taken. Gude Co. Ltd passed a resolution to acquire additional ﬂeet of vans from Busi Co. Ltd that could penetrate remote areas that they were expected to cover under the terms of the contract they signed with the government. The vans from Busi Co. Ltd ﬁtted the speciﬁcations. Although they were initially intended to transports tourist, with limited modiﬁcation, the vehicles could also be used to respond to medical emergencies in remote areas of the country.

Nigel Foster: Revision and examination guidance Revision and examination guidance Nigel Foster, Professor of Law and Deputy Vice-Chancellor, The University of Buckingham General During the course of your studies and as you approach exam time you will no doubt be receiving advice, not all of which is the same, from many sources. Mine is based on my experience taking examinations at degree, post-graduate, and a number of other levels and from twenty-four years of experience of the problems, difficulties, and successes of students. This does not mean to say that this will coincide with the experience of others, or what may work for one person will necessarily work for another. I am loath, therefore, to give full and detailed advice of 'the best way' to learn and pass exams, merely to give some pointers on the way. Revision for examination Revision preparation The most important requirement for revision is a coherent set of notes from which to work. If you do not have a complete and reasonably comprehensive set, the first task will be to produce a set of concise notes prior to the revision period. You may find it necessary to rewrite parts of your notes in order to reduce them to a manageable size for revision purposes. What to revise Exam content An internally set and marked examination, which is the case in nearly all degree examinations, would usually reflect fairly accurately what has been taught during the year. Whilst there is no guaranteed way of knowing when a topic will

Defences to takeoversA competing bid from a strategic investor is often the most attractive form of anti-takeover defence. Target companies may also make counter-offers to purchase the shares at a premium this includes a company buying a sizable portion of its own shares, which prevents the acquiring company from purchasing the shares and becoming the majority owner.. A target entity may modify its capital structure and force a re-evaluation of the deal's attractiveness or seek white knight offers from other players in the relevant industry. Further anti-takeover defences may be prescribed in a listed company's articles of association.Targets may persuade the existing shareholders to reject the offer based on the independent adviser's evaluation.Confidentiality is key to prevent the any counters to the acquisitionKeeping the proposed bid as confidential as possible until it is announced generally assists in protecting the deal. Entering into voting agreements to secure the minimum percentage of shares to be taken up may help encourage a friendly deal.

NEGOTIABLE INSTRUMENTS INTRODUCTION There are certain documents, which are freely used in commercial transactions and monetary dealings. These documents, if they satisfy certain conditions, are known as negotiable instruments. ‘Negotiable’ is a word to mean transferable from one person to another in return for consideration. ‘Instrument’ means a written document by which right is created in favor of some person. The law relating to negotiable instrument is contained in the Bill of Exchange Act (Cap. 27) and the Cheque Act (Cap 41), which deals with promissory notes, bills of exchange and cheques. As per the Act, no definition is given. However, in simple, a negotiable instrument can be described as a commercial document which represents money. It passes to a bonafide transferee free from any defect. Therefore a negotiable instrument refers to a document, which entitles a person to a sum of money or money value which is transferable from one person to another by mere delivery or by endorsement and delivery. NATURE OF NEGOTIABLE INSTRUMENTS A negotiable instrument is a Chose in Action. A chose in action is a property right which cannot be enjoyed by physical possession, but which can only be enforced by legal action, for Example a debt, patent or copyright etc. Most types of chose in action are assignable but; 1. Notice to the debtor is always advisable and sometimes essential; and 2. The assignee can obtain no better rights than the assignor. 3. However, out of customary usage

Law of Limited liability Partnerships Mwangi J Mbogo ATP 108 – Commercial Transactions May 2017 1 Limited Liability Partnership 1. What is an LLP • s6 - An LLP is not a partnership; rather it is a body corporate registered under the Limited Liability Partnership Act, No 42 of 2011 (the “Act”). On being registered under the Act, an LLP becomes a body corporate with perpetual succession with a legal personality separate from that of its partners or members. • The idea of LLPs came about in the UK in the 1990s when some of the larger professional services partnerships became increasingly concerned by the risk of substantial personal liability of their partners, and applied pressure on government to address the issue. • The consequence of this pressure was the entity called LLP, which retains the internal flexibility of a partnership but carries the all important limitation of liability for the partners. 2 Limited Liability Partnership 2. The law applicable to LLPs • The main law applicable to LLPs is the Limited Liability Partnership Act, No 42 of 2011. • s8 - The Partnership Act shall apply to an LLP except so far as a provision of the Act expressly provides otherwise. • Like a company, an LLP must be formed by application to and registered at the companies registry. • The Registrar of Companies is the Registrar of LLPs, and she may depute a deputy or an assistant registrar to exercise her functions under the Act. 3 Limited Liability Partnership 3.

PARTNERSHIPS BY MAHAT SOMANE THE LIMITED LIABILITY PARTNERSHIP • The Limited Liability Partnership Act, 2011 was assented into law and commenced operation on 16th March, 2012. The Act repeals Limited Partnerships Act, Cap 30 of the Laws of Kenya, which previously governed the formation, management and regulation of limited partnerships. • Some of the important features of an LLP include: • It is established through registration under the Act; • It must have at least 2 partners and 1 manager. The partners may be natural persons or a bodies corporate. The manager must be a natural person; • An LLP is a separate legal entity from its partners. In this respect, it is similar to a company, and different from a typical partnership; • Partners of an LLP are not liable for the firm’s debts and obligations nor are they liable • for each other’s debts and obligations. This is not the case with general partnerships; • However, individual partners in an LLP are liable for their own wrongful acts or omissions. The LLP is also liable for a partner’s wrongful acts or omissions, to the same extent as that partner, where the partner is engaging in the LLP’s business or acting with • its authority. • The LLP structure provides a potentially useful alternative business vehicle to the private company. It has the benefit, at least at present, of being less regulated than a private company. • From a tax perspective, it may prove more effective than a company because currently partnership income is

Chapter One Sources of Law in Kenya 1.1 What is Law? The world of commerce and industry is founded on distinct pillars of social order. The establishment and regulation of the various institutions of society depend upon frameworks of rules to which they owe their existence and from which they draw their power and legitimacy. These rules are promulgated and enforced in accordance with a defined legal system. As has been rightly observed, “[i]n order to ensure good order and the smooth running of society, it is necessary to formulate general rules which work well enough in the majority of cases.”1 Accordingly, there is need in every society to promulgate normative rules, principles and doctrines to regulate social order. Such rules and principles must be effectively binding in the sense that derogation from them, or breach thereof, attracts penal or other remedial consequences. The assemblage of these doctrines, principles, rules, and regulations, may, in very loose terms, be collectively referred to as law. Glanville Williams defines law as “… the body of principles recognized and applied by the state in the administration of justice …” According to him, it consists of “… the rules recognized and acted on by courts of justice.”2 In this sense, law includes all rules of conduct enacted by Parliament or established by court decisions in conformity with fundamental principles and doctrines recognized as essential for the administration of justice.

The process involves the drafting and signing of an agreement between the hirer (the consumer) and the owner (the lending institution). Although the process has been beneficial to parties interested in acquiring goods, many of the requirements of such agreements have proven cumbersome. Among these are the minimum payment clause and the requirement for agreements to be registered. This situation calls for a review. The process of hire­purchase financing has become an alternative option for consumers who want to buy large and expensive items which may otherwise be difficult to afford. The transactions allow the buyer to pay for items without cashing in investments or savings, and to spread the cost of expensive items over an extended period. In such transactions ownership of goods is transferred to a finance company at a discounted price, and the company hires out and then sells those goods to the buyer. Kenyan law recognizes regulates hire­purchase agreement transactions through the Hire­Purchase Act. However, it

Registration of Security Rights in Movable Property A valid security agreement must be written and signed by the grantor. It should also identify the secured creditor and the grantor, describe the secured obligation (except in the case of an agreement that provides for the outright transfer of a receivable), and describe the collateral in a manner that reasonably allows its identification. Did you know that you can now create a security over movable property from the comfort of your computer using your e-citizen account? The Movable Property Security Rights Act enacted in May 2017 which is aimed at improving access to finance now enables that. The Act repealed the Chattels Transfer Act and amended sections of The Agricultural Finance Corporation Act, The Stamp Duty Act, The Hire Purchase Act, The Pawnbrokers Act, The Business Registration Services Act, The Companies Act, 2015 and The Insolvency Act, 2015. The Act is effected by the Movable Property Security Rights (General) Regulations, 2017.

DematerializationThe use paper certificates was the norm until the establishment of the Central Depository and Settlement Corporation (CDSC). The setting up of the CDSC reduced the inefficiencies and risks associated with the paper certificates through immobilization of securities. The CDSC was incorporated in the year 1999 to establish and operate a central depository system and provide central clearing, settlement and depository services for securities initially in Kenya in respect to securities listed on the Nairobi Stock Exchange.The certificates are surrendered and replaced with an electronic record of shares making it safer, faster, easier to transfer. No eligible security could be traded on the securities exchange without being immobilized. By February 2005, all securities listed on the Nairobi Securities Exchange were eligible for immobilization, and all trades in the market were conducted on book entry securities.All the physical certificates thus ceased being used as evidence of ownership of securities of any company quoted at NSE A share is defined as the smallest division of the share capital of the company which represents the proportion of ownership of the shareholders in the company.

The regulations cover a wide range of issues, including: The disclosure of information to investors The approval of M&A transactions by the CMA The protection of minority shareholders The CMA's M&A regulations apply to all M&A transactions involving companies listed on the NSE. However, the regulations do not apply to M&A transactions involving companies that are not listed on the NSE.

Capital and capital maintenance The two principal types of capital that companies acquire are share capital (capital obtained by selling shares) and debt capital (capital borrowed from others). A new allotment of shares must usually first be offered to existing shareholders. Companies are prohibited from allotting shares for less than their nominal value. Companies can issue different classes of shares with different class rights, and the law regulates the ability to vary such class rights. Public companies are subject to minimum capital requirements when commencing business, whereas private companies are not. A reduction of share capital is only valid if the strict procedures relating to a reduction of capital found in the Companies Act 2015 are complied with. Companies are generally prohibited from purchasing their own shares, but the 2015 Act does provide exceptions to this prohibition. Private companies are permitted to provide financial assistance to acquire their own shares. Public companies are generally prohibited from providing such assistance, but there are exceptions. Companies can only pay a dividend out of ‘profits available for thepurpose’. The two principal types of charge are fixed charges and floating charges and, in order to be enforceable, charges need to be registered in accordance with the Companies Act 2015.

Capital and capital maintenance § The two principal types of capital that companies acquire are share capital (capital obtained by selling shares) and debt capital (capital borrowed from others). § A new allotment of shares must usually first be offered to existing shareholders. § Companies are prohibited from allotting shares for less than their nominal value. § Companies can issue different classes of shares with different class rights, and the law regulates the ability to vary such class rights. § Public companies are subject to minimum capital requirements when commencing business, whereas private companies are not. § A reduction of share capital is only valid if the strict procedures relating to a reduction of capital found in the Companies Act 2015 are complied with. § § Companies are generally prohibited from purchasing their own shares, but the 2015 Act does provide exceptions to this prohibition. Private companies are permitted to provide financial assistance to acquire their own shares. Public companies are generally prohibited from providing such assistance, but there are exceptions. § Companies can only pay a dividend out of ‘profits available for the purpose’. § The two principal types of charge are fixed charges and floating charges and, in order to be enforceable, charges need to be registered in accordance with the Companies Act 2015. Shares and share capital The CA 2015 defines ‘shares’ as (a) in relation to an undertaking with a share capital, means shares i

Directors Key facts § Every private company must have at least one director and every public company must have at least two directors. § The power to manage the company is initially vested in the members, but is usually delegated to the directors by the articles. § Directors’ duties are now found in the Companies Act 2015, which provides for seven general duties that directors owe to the company. § The general duties are based on prior common law duties, so pre-2015 case law will remain relevant. § Certain types of transaction involving directors will only be valid if authorized by a resolution of the members. § A director’s term of office can terminate in several ways including resignation, retirement, or removal. Additionally, the courts can disqualify a person from acting as director. The definition of ‘director’ A company may be run by persons who call themselves ‘governors’ or ‘managers’ and, increasingly, persons not involved in management at board level are called ‘directors’. Are such persons actually directors? The CA 2015 s3 defines a director as follows: in relation to a body corporate, includes— (a) any person occupying the position of a director of the body (by whatever name the person is called); and (b) any person in accordance with whose directions or instructions (not being advice given in a professional capacity) the directors of the body are accustomed to act; This broad definition will cover those who have been validly appointed to the office of director (

Members § § § § § § Although the terms ‘member’ and ‘shareholder’ tend to be used interchangeably, there is a distinction (especially in companies that do not have a share capital). Members usually exercise their decision-making powers via the passing of resolutions. A resolution is simply a formal vote. The two forms of resolution are ordinary resolutions (which require a simple majority) and special resolutions (which require a majority of no less than 75 per cent). Public companies must pass resolutions at general meetings. Private companies must pass resolutions at general meetings, unless the written resolution procedure is used. Resolutions are only valid if sufficient notice of the meeting is provided and a quorum is present. A quorum is simply the minimum number of persons required to be present in order to conduct business. Members can appoint a proxy to attend, speak, and vote at general meetings on their behalf. Introduction The members of a company play two vital roles. First, through the purchase of shares, they contribute capital to the company. The nature of the share and share capital is discussed in the next class but our focus is on the second vital role that the members play, namely their ability to make decisions. As will be seen, a significant amount of power is placed into the hands of members and numerous key decisions are reserved for them alone. However, before the members’ ability to exercise this power can be discussed, it is important to note the d

COMPANY LAW STATUTORY PROTECTION OF MINORITY SHAREHOLDERSSection 221 provides that a contributory maypetition that a company be wound up by thecourt. A member of a company is a contributoryand it has been held that a holder of fully paidup shares is a contributory. Thus in appropriatecircumstances even a single member canpetition for winding up.Thus a member can petition for winding up on ‘JUST AND EQUITABLE’the just and equitable ground, and a member is notconfined to such circumstances as affect him as ashareholder i.e. he is not confined to cases wherehis position as a shareholder has been worsened bythe action of which he complains. He is entitledonly to rely on any circumstances of justice orequity which affect him in his relations with thecompany or with other shareholders. However the ‘JUST AND EQUITABLE’Court will not as a rule order a winding up on acontributory’s petition unless he alleges and provesat least to the extent of a prima facie case, thatthere will be assets for distribution among theshareholder, so that a purely private advantage willnot suffice: Re Chesterfield Catering Co. Ltd [1976]3All E.R. 294. The reason is that unless there are suchassets the contributory has no interest in a winding ‘JUST AND EQUITABLE’up.

Introduction Definition of a company: • Sec 3 of the Companies Act 2015 defines a company as a company formed and registered under the Act or an existing company. • The term existing company is defined in sec 3 of the Act as a company formed and registered under the repealed companies act or other repealed ordinances as defined by the repealed companies act. Introduction • Buckley J. in Re: Stanley (1906) noted that the word company has no strict legal meaning and further noted that a company may be defined as an association of persons who contribute money or money’s worth to common stock and who employ it to a common purpose. • The above definition in Re: Stanley (1906) does not distinguish a company from a partnership. • Under common law, a company is considered a legal person or legal entity separate from and with perpetual succession. Historical background of companies • The company as a form of business organization was first applied by English merchants trading cloth and other goods overseas. • The company emerged during the mercantile era due to two reasons: • The need for large scale investment, production and operation to satisfy the market demand, as a result of which, traders were in dire need of a commercial de

COMPANY LAW DEFINITION Section 2 of the Companies Act defines a company as an association of people for a common object or objects. Thus unlike a Partnership which is an association of persons who come together for business with a view of profit, the objects of a company extend beyond profit making. A company is different from a partnership in that in a partnership, each partner is liable for COMPANIES AND PARTNERSHIPS the debts and liabilities of the firm without limits, except for limited partnerships. Second, a partnership has no separate existence from the partners; third, a partnership has no perpetual succession unlike a company, so that the death, retirement or bankruptcy of a partner ends it. it. Section 389 of the Companies Act provides COMPANIES AND PARTNERHIPS that no association or partnership consisting of more than 20 persons may be formed for the purposes of carrying on any business for the acquisition of gains unless it is registered under the Companies Act, or is formed pursuant to some other statute. Section 2 of the Companies Act 2015 provides that a company is a company formed and registered under the Act or an existing company. It also provides that one natural person may incorporate a company. Companies may be statutory companies which are formed either by specific Acts of Parliament such as Kenya Ports Authority Act, Kenya Railways Corporation Act, etc, (statutory corporations), or State corporations (parastatals) which are formed TYPES OF COMPANIES und

The Facts B and L were directors of two companies, N and TPG. B and L indirectly held 35 per cent-of the issued ordinary shares in TPG, which in turn held 25.6 per cent of the issued ordinary shares in N. B and L induced the board of directors of N to purchase TPG's main assets, allegedly at an over-valuation. In accordance with Stock Exchange regulations, the consent of N's shareholders was obtained, but by an allegedly "tricky" circular. P, which held 3.2 per cent of N's issued ordinary shares, sued N, B, L and TPG claiming: (a) as representative of itselfand the other shareholders at the time of the action, equitable damages on behalf of the company for breach of the defendants' fiduciary duty to N ("the derivative claim"), and (b) on behalf of itself alone, common law damages for conspiracy against B and L ("the direct personal claim"). Later P sought to amend its originating process to claim: (c) on behalf of itself and the other shareholders at the time of the alleged conspiracy, (i) a declaration of entitlement to damages and (ii) damages ("the direct representative claim"). - 2.

DERIVATIVE ACTION INTRODUCTION AND DEFINITIONS A company is an artificial person capable of being injured and can, when wronged, institute court proceedings to protect its interests. Much as the law recognizes and appreciates the juristic personality of companies, one jurisprudential question that courts have to grapple with before proceeding to entertain suits seeking to remedy harm suffered by companies is: in whose name are such suits brought or rather, who is the proper plaintiff? In the case of Foss v Harbottle (discussed in detail later) it was held that the proper plaintiff in an action in respect of a wrong alleged to be done to a company is the company itself, which essentially mean the directors or majority shareholders must okay the lodging of such suits. The decision was termed oppressive as it denied members of a company, especially minority shareholders, the chance to prosecute matters where there is lethargy on the part of the directors or where the directors or majority shareholders themselves are the perpetrators of the injury suffered. Over time and in order to ensure proper management of companies and sustainability of their businesses, the law was changed to allow members of companies to initiate suits in their own names and on behalf of the company. This is known as derivative action. A derivative action has been variously defined. The Black’s Law Dictionary (8th edition) defines it as a suit brought by a beneficiary to enforce a right belonging to the fi

The objection relates to the competence of this petition in that, among other reasons, it was lodged without the authority of the Company as required under the Articles of Association of East African Portland Cement Company Limited (Hereafter ‘the company’). 2. The 2nd respondent contends that the petition is not properly before the Court as there is no resolution for its institution passed in accordance with the company’s Articles of association; that the Articles require that a resolution of the company should be signed by a majority of the directors present in Kenya; and that the affidavits in support of the suit are sworn by persons other than those authorised by the Article or by the resolution relied on. 3.

COMPANY LAW CLASS NOTES: INTRODUCTION TO COMPANIES AND COMPANY LAW The exact scope of company law is difficult to define, on account that the laws of Kenya do not define the term in testament to the words of Buckley J in Re: Stanley (1906) “The word company has no strict legal meaning...” However, section 3 (1) of the Companies Act, No. 17 of 2015 (The Companies Act) it is provided that a company refers to: “A company formed and registered under this Act [the 2015 Companies Act of Kenya] or an existing company [one incorporated under a pre-existing or other statute e.g. CAP 486]” This definition fails to identify the attributes of the company as it only describes a registered company i.e. a company incorporated by registration. A company may also be defined as an association of many persons who contribute money or money’s worth to a common stock and who employ it to a common purpose. Regrettably, this explanation fails to distinguish a company from a partnership. In common law, a company is a ‘legal person’ or ‘legal entity’ separate from, and capable of surviving beyond the lives of its members. Like any juristic person a company is legally an entity apart from its members, capable of rights and duties of its own, and endowed with the potential of perpetual succession. However, ‘a company’ is not merely a legal institution; it is also a legal device for the attainment of any social or economic end, and to a large extent has public and social responsibility.

CPA SECTION 3: CORPORATE INSOLVENCY UNDER THE 2015 INSOLVENCY ACT Corporate Insolvency in Kenya was previously governed under the Companies Act, CAP 486 Laws of Kenya. However in September 2015, the Insolvency Act regulates this feature of company law. Unlike the previous legislation, the Insolvency Act seeks to redeem insolvent companies through administration as opposed to liquidation. The Act focuses more on assisting insolvent natural persons, unincorporated entities and insolvent corporate bodies whose financial position is redeemable to continue operating as going concerns so that they may be able to meet their financial obligations to the satisfaction of their creditors. The consolidation of the laws with respect to insolvency is aimed at not only providing for and regulating the liquidation of incorporated and unincorporated bodies but also to enable their affairs to be managed for the benefit of their creditors by providing alternatives to bankruptcy and liquidation. Meaning of Insolvency Insolvency means that a company is unable to pay its debts. Section 384 of the Insolvency Act 2015 provides that a company is unable to pay its debts: a) if a creditor (by assignment or otherwise) to whom the company is indebted for KES 100,000 or more has served on the company, by leaving it at the company’s registered office, a written demand requiring the company to pay the debt and the company has for 21 days afterwards failed to pay the debt or to secure or compound for it to t

The Act focuses more on assisting insolvent natural persons, unincorporated entities and insolvent corporate bodies whose financial position is redeemable to continue operating as going concerns so that they may be able to meet their financial obligations to the satisfaction of their creditors. The consolidation of the laws with respect to insolvency is aimed at not only providing for and regulating the liquidation of incorporated and unincorporated bodies but also to enable their affairs to be managed for the benefit of their creditors by providing alternatives to bankruptcy and liquidation. Meaning of Insolvency Insolvency means that a company is unable to pay its debts. Section 384 of the Insolvency Act 2015 provides that a company is unable to pay its debts: if a creditor (by assignment or otherwise) to whom the company is indebted for KES 100,000 or more has served on the company, by leaving it at the company’s registered office, a written demand requiring the company to pay the debt and the company has for 21 days afterwards failed to pay the debt or to secure or compound for it to the

CPA SECTION 3: CORPORATE RESTRUCTURING It is not always in the best interests of the company and its shareholders for the company to be wound up. As such, Company Law offers a number of alternatives for companies experiencing financial and other difficulties. These include: Reconstructions Amalgamations Mergers Schemes of arrangement Takeover bids Reconstruction A reconstruction may be an alteration of the structure of a group of companies or an alteration of the capital structure of a single company. It explains how a company is “built again” or reconstituted. This may be effected through: Reduction of capital Variation of class rights Scheme of arrangements Amalgamation This is a transaction whereby two or more companies are combined in some way in united ownership Merger It means the uniting of two companies through an acquisition by one company of a controlling holding of shares in another. A company may absorb a minority shareholding in its partly owned subsidiary in exchange for cash or shares. A company may seek to alter the rights of its creditors, e.g. by variation of the rights of debenture holders, by mutual agreement. Under Section 933 of the 2015 Companies Act, a merger occurs where: the assets and liabilities of a public company are to be transferred to another existing public company (merger by absorption) The assets and liabilities of a public company are transferred to a new company (merger by formation of a new company) Scheme of Arrangement This is the maki

Rather, it states the two basic ways in which a person may become a member of a company, namely: By subscribing to the memorandum and articles of the company, or By agreeing to become a member and the entry of his name in the company’s register of members. Who may become a member Capacity to be a member of a company is governed by the rules of the common law relating to contracts. Anyone who has the capacity to make a contract may become a member of a company. The following are some of the special cases, which require explanation: Personal Representatives: On a shareholder’s death, ownership of the shares previously held by him is transmitted to his personal representative, who may be an executor or administrator. The personal representative would be entitled to be registered as a member of the company unless the company’s articles provide otherwise. Corporations: A corporation, whether a registered company or not, may, if authorized by its articles (expressly or impliedly), take shares in a registered company and become a member of it. It would authorize such person as it thinks fit to act as its representative at any meeting of the company.

STRATHMORE UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF ACCOUNTANCY CPA PART 2 SECTION 3 FULL TIME COURSE COMPANY LAW CHAPTER FOUR: SHARES EMERGING ISSUES Dematerialization/immobilization of share certificates Dematerialized securities are securities that are not on paper and a certificate to that effect does not exist. They exist in the form of entries in the book of depositories. Essentially, unlike the traditional method of possessing a share certificate to the effect of ownership of shares, in the dematerialized system, the shares are held in a dematerialized form. This system works through the CDS. CDS stands for the Central Depository System. This is a computer system operated by The Central Depository and Settlement Corporation (CDSC) that facilitates holdings of shares in electronic accounts, opened by shareholders and manages the process of transferring shares traded at the Stock Exchange. Advantages of Dematerialization The advantages of dematerialization of securities can be summarized as follows: Share certificates, on dematerialization, are cancelled and the same will not be sent back to the investor. The depository system and dematerialized securities offer paperless trading and transfer of shares through the use of technology. It enables processing of share trading and transfers electronically without involving share certificates and transfer deeds, thus eliminating the paper work involved in scrip-based trading and share transfer system.

In the words of Lord Coleridge in Sharp V Dawes (1876) “The word meeting prima facie means a coming together of more than one person” The ordinary meaning of the term meeting is an assembly of persons. It therefore follows that one person cannot constitute a meeting. This is the rule in Sharp V Dawes where a single shareholder purported to hold a meeting to pass a resolution to make calls. The meeting was scheduled for 30th Dec 1874 and only 2 people attended; these two people were Sharp who was the Company’s Secretary and Silversides, a member. The latter acted as Chairman while the former took minutes. The meeting resolved that calls be made but the defendant member declined and was sued. It was held that no meeting had been properly constituted and the purported proceedings were null and void. The case is authority for the proposition that one person cannot constitute a meeting or a corporate assembly. However in law, one person can constitute a meeting as well as quorum for the meeting, these are exceptions to the rule in Sharp V Dawes. Exceptions to the rule in Sharp V Dawes: 1.

However, prima facie the term means coming together of two or more persons. It denotes an assembly of persons. Company general meetings are held from time to time in order: To comply with statutory provisions which require certain general meetings to be held in order to transact specified business. Such meetings include the statutory meeting, the annual general meeting and class meetings. To transact business that may only be transacted at a general meeting of the members or shareholders, such as alteration or reduction of the company’s capital. To enable the directors and members to exchange views regarding the running of the company’s affairs or resolve some existing disputes. To transact some business which may only be transacted at a meeting of a class of the company’s members, such as variation of a right attached to a class of shares. Types of meetings There are four kinds of meetings of members which may be held by a company: The statutory general meeting (under the previous Companies Act) The annual general meeting General meetings at other times (Extra ordinary general meetings) Class meetings The annual general meeting Section 310 provides that every public company shall hold a general meeting as its annual gener

CPA SECTION 3: INSIDER TRADING This is the sale or purchase of company securities by or on behalf of a person whose relationship with the company is such that he is likely to have access to material information on the company not generally available to the public. It takes place when a person buys or sells securities while knowingly in possession of price sensitive information not available to the public which if made available will affect the price or value of those securities. It is the taking advantage of confidential information on the company for personal gain. Insider trading occurs where an individual or organization buys or sells securities while knowingly in possession of some piece of confidential information which is not generally available and which is not likely, if made available to the general public, to materially affect the price of the securities. For example, where a company director who is aware that the company is in a bad financial state and will consequently cut its dividend pay-out sells his shares before a public announcement to this effect is made. This is also the case when the director buys shares in the company with knowledge that the company is declaring super profits or is acquiring a competitor. Regulation of Insider Trading in Kenya In Kenya, Insider Trading is prohibited and criminalised by Section 32B of the Capital Markets Act Cap 485A.

CPA SECTION 3: THE COMPANY SECRETARY This is the officer appointed by the directors of a company as responsible for ensuring that firm's legal obligations under the corporate legislation are complied with. The office of the Company Secretary, Corporate Secretary or Board Secretary is in charge of legal and regulatory compliance at Board level. A company secretary is not automatically an employee of the company but remains a principal officer under the Act. The office of the Company Secretary is created by the Section 198(1) of the 2015 Companies Act which states that every company must have a Company Secretary. Specifically however, Company Secretaries are provided in Part XII of the 2015 Companies Act of Kenya. Section 243 provides that a private company is required to have a company secretary only if it has a paid up capital of KES 5,000,000 or more.

CPA SECTION 3: COMPANY DIRECTORS Both the Companies Act and case law recognize the General Meeting and the Board of Directors (the BOD) as the principal managerial organs of the company and the Constitution vest power in both. Whereas the General Meeting makes major decisions the Board of Directors is responsible for managing the day to day affairs of the company. The 2015 Companies Act extensively deals with Directors under Part IX, outlining statutory provisions from Sections 122 to 237 on these company managers. Section 3 of the Act states that "director", in relation to a body corporate, includes: a) any person occupying the position of a director of the body( by whatever name the person is called); and b) any person in accordance with whose directions or instructions (not being advice given in a professional capacity) the directors of the body are accustomed to act; Any person who occupies the position of director is treated as such. The test is one function. The directors’ function is to take part in making decisions by attending the meetings of board of directors. Anyone who does that is a director whatever they may be called. A person who is given the title of director, such as ‘Sales Director’ or ‘Director of Research’, to give them status in the company structure is a not a director in company law. This is unless by virtue of their appointment they are member of the board of director, or they carry out functions that would be properly discharged only by a director.

DEFINITION Section 2 of the Companies Act defines a company as an association of people for a common object or objects. Thus unlike a Partnership which is an association of persons who come together for business with a view of profit, the objects of a company extend beyond profit making. COMPANIES AND PARTNERSHIPS A company is different from a partnership in that in a partnership, each partner is liable for the debts and liabilities of the firm without limits, except for limited partnerships. Second, a partnership has no separate existence from the partners; third, a partnership has no perpetual succession unlike a company, so that the death, retirement or bankruptcy of a partner ends it. Section 389 of the Companies Act provides that no association or partnership consisting of more than 20 persons may be formed for the purposes of carrying on any business for the acquisition of gains unless it is registered under the Companies Act, or is formed pursuant to some other statute. Section 2 of the Companies Act 2015 provides that a company is a company formed and registered under the Act or an existing company. It also provides that one natural person may incorporate a company. TYPES OF COMPANIES Companies may be statutory companies which are formed either by specific Acts of Parliament such as Kenya Ports Authority Act, Kenya Railways Corporation Act, etc. (statutory corporations), or State corporations (parastatals) which are formed under the State Corporations Act which gives

DematerializationThe use paper certificates was the norm until the establishment of the Central Depository and Settlement Corporation (CDSC). The setting up of the CDSC reduced the inefficiencies and risks associated with the paper certificates through immobilization of securities. The CDSC was incorporated in the year 1999 to establish and operate a central depository system and provide central clearing, settlement and depository services for securities initially in Kenya in respect to securities listed on the Nairobi Stock Exchange.The certificates are surrendered and replaced with an electronic record of shares making it safer, faster, easier to transfer. No eligible security could be traded on the securities exchange without being immobilized. By February 2005, all securities listed on the Nairobi Securities Exchange were eligible for immobilization, and all trades in the market were conducted on book entry securities.All the physical certificates thus ceased being used as evidence of ownership of securities of any company quoted at NSE A share is defined as the smallest division of the share capital of the company which represents the proportion of ownership of the shareholders in the company.

ATP 100 COMMERCIAL TRANSACTIONSFIRM 33QUESTION 7: Outline the legal and structural considerations about the merger of two limited liability companies in Kenya. (20 marks)This Photo by Unknown Author is licensed under CC BY-SA-NCThis Photo by Unknown Author is licensed under CC BY-SA IntroductionMergers in Kenya are regulated by various statutes and bodies. As such, there are legal requirements which the merging parties will have to consider in accordance with those statutes and regulator’s regulations. The structure of the merger deal is itself a great consideration since it may form part of the internal or economic determination of whether to merge in the first place. This group will therefore start by looking at the statutory provisions governing mergers and identify the legal and structural considerations arising from each. We will the conclude by discussing any other considerations particularly those touching on the structure of the deal itself. LEGAL CONSIDERATIONSThe Companies Act (No. 17 of 2015)- Part XXXV, Division 2 -Sections 933 to 947 Section 933 – Applies to public companies which can merge in either two ways:by absorption (where one is subsumed in the other and ceases to exist in its own name); and creation of a new company-can either be private or public. Section 934 - the draft terms of the proposed merger to be prepared.Section 935 - a notice of the lodgement of the terms to the registrar be published in the Gazette at least a month before the shareholder’s a

CHAPTER 1 Conducting Due Diligence: An Overview Risk has always been a companion of reward, inherent in assessing opportunities against a company’s strengths and weaknesses. —Report of the NACD Blue Ribbon Commission on Risk Governance (2009) INTRODUCTION The due diligence phase of any acquisition—the study of the risks that the deal poses—can make the difference between success and failure. Many a deal that looks good on the back of an envelope looks bad in a spreadsheet. Acquirers must face all the facts—even worst-case scenarios. This is why due diligence must be considered in conjunction with other acquisition activities and goals, including strategic planning, valuation, financing, structuring, and—most important—charting the future of the combined company, with all its new risks and opportunities. To put due diligence in its proper perspective, we begin this chapter with the legal foundations of due diligence. Next, we discuss the “what, when, and who” of due diligence—that is, its scope, duration, and key participants. We then give some further background on the legal aspects of due diligence (focusing on “due diligence” in the securities law context). Finally, we close with suggestions for verification and risk prevention. Our goal is to build a strong platform of understanding for the more detailed work ahead. LEGAL FOUNDATIONS What are the legal origins of due diligence? The term due diligence originated in so-called common law, also known as case law—the law that h

CHAPTER 4 The Legal Compliance Review Are we disposed to be the number of those who, having eyes, see not, and having ears, hear not . . . ? For my part, whatever anguish of spirit it may cost, I am willing to know the whole truth; to know the worst, and to provide for it. —Patrick Henry, Speech at the Virginia Convention, Richmond, March 23, 1775 INTRODUCTION Legal compliance begins at home, with a responsible due diligence process that uncovers current and potential causes of financial, operational, and legal problems. This process itself can eliminate about a quarter of potential suits against directors and officers. According to past research by Tillinghast Insurance, a unit of Towers Watson, one out of every four lawsuits filed against officers and directors in any 10-year period stems from a merger that has gone bad.1 Plaintiffs allege that the buyer or seller committed errors in the purchase or sale of the company. A responsible due diligence process, well documented, can provide a strong defense against such legal actions. It is somewhat more difficult, however, to anticipate and manage the other causes of lawsuits against corporate officers and directors. These can come from anyone over any issue—and legal claims often come in clusters, involving multiple issues.2 This chapter is about that vast terrain of potential litigation, one that expands whenever an acquirer buys another company. Why? Because the seller’s legal vulnerabilities are usually transferred to the bu

ATP 108:COMMERCIAL TRANSACTIONSTOPIC:TAKEOVERS AND ACQUISITIONSFIRM 8 CLASS C MEANING AND SCOPE A takeover according to Section 584 of the Companies Act is the making of an offer by a company to buy shares, whether the offer is to buy all the shares, a class of shares or all classes of shares of a company.The Black’s Law Dictionary (9th edition) define takeover as ‘the acquisition of ownership or control of a corporation.' A takeover is typically accomplished by a purchase of shares or assets, a tender offer, or a merger. Takeovers are a common business strategy aimed at consolidating market position, diversifying operations or entering new markets. MEANING AND SCOPE CONT'DAn acquisition on the other hand refers to an agreed, strategic, operation where one company acquires another. Acquisitions involve buying more than 50% of the target company stock to enable the acquiring company to make decisions without the approval of the target company, an example is in 2016 Longhorn publishers acquired 74% stake in Law Africa publishers.The acquiring company will be entitled to all the assets, liabilities, properties and equipment of the target company. Once acquisition is complete, the target company ceases to exist as it is absorbed by the acquirer.Businesses may engage in takeovers or acquisitions to increase their consumer bases, get access to new markets, acquire innovative technology or goods, or oust rivals.

There are different forms of mergers like, statutory mergers, and triangular mergers; there are also consolidations.2 In general there is a common agreement that mergers are friendly, even in those occasions when a transaction indeed it was not a merger but an acquisition however due to reputational reasons both the companies agreed to name it as merger.3 One the other hand, acquisition4, also known as a takeover, it is a direct action by the acquiring company to buy the target company.5 Acquisition can take two forms.

How does the mergers and acquisitions (M&A) process start? The process is more informatively looked at from the Target’s point of view. The Target may decide to put itself up for sale because it needs to for ﬁnancial reasons, because it thinks it has reached its peak value, or because one or more shareholders need or want liquidity; or it may have been approached by a potential Buyer (often a customer or supplier) who wants to talk about “matter of mutual interest.” Before the Target puts itself up for sale, it is likely that its corporate and legal aDairs will have to be cleaned up. The Target’s lawyers may or may not have had close contact and involvement with their client during the course of their engagement. Companies vary widely in how highly they value their lawyer’s input and the degree to which they pay attention to legal matters. The sale process is where the cracks in the wall will show. Sometimes costly and un- rectiﬁable mistakes have been made, and the sale price will reﬂect them. Even if signiﬁcant mistakes have not been made, there will always be corporate housekeeping cleanup that will have to be done. Common problems include improperly documented customer arrangements; vague bonus arrangements for employees; nonexistent, inadequate, or unsigned customary employee arrangements (conﬁdentiality agreements, covenants not to compete, etc.); or license agreements that terminate upon an acquisition. Additionally, there may not be good records as to who owns the bus

M&A IN AFRICA Current Trends, 2023 www.bowmanslaw.com 1 INTRODUCTION In this, our annual Africa M&A roundup, we discuss in brief the developing trends from 2023, followed by a targeted review of select jurisdictional developments. M&A in Africa has not been immune to global challenges, but remains resilient. There have been notable developments in the fintech and renewable energy spaces respectively and an increase in demand for African exports as the global demand for essential minerals continues to rise. The African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) and related agreements and protocols are gaining traction, already growing regional value chains and enhancing collaboration and capabilities. African deal metrics have remained largely constant. There has been an uptick in cross-border deals and restructurings, an emerging trend of joint ventures and the re-emergence of auction sales. Across Africa, exchanges are cutting red tape and embarking on simplification projects in an effort to increase listings amid the uptick in take-privates and unbundlings. Regulatory, public interest and local ownership considerations and shareholder activism are playing an increasing role in deal structuring across Africa. So too are in-country risk factors. Highly negotiated clauses include limitation of liability provisions, security, conditionality, purchase price mechanisms, material adverse change and force majeure clauses. The use of legal technology is commonplace and pockets of differen

KN LAW LLP LEGAL March 17, 2020 Changes in Competition Law in Kenya Introduction The Competition (Amendment) Act, 2019 (the “Act”) was assented to by the President on December 13, 2019 to commence on December 31, 2019. The Act introduced amendments to the Competition Act to regulate abuse of buyer power in the market. Additionally, the Competition (General) Rules, 2019 (“Rules”) made under Section 93 of the Act, were gazetted on December 06, 2019. The Rules consolidate the informal practice guidelines issued by Competition Authority of Kenya (CAK). We discuss the changes introduced by the Act and the Rules below. The Competition (Amendment) Act, 2019 The amendments reorganize the provisions of the Act on buyer power and abuse of buyer power. They increase CAK’s scope of powers in preventing abuse of buyer power by enabling it to monitor industries and sectors in which abuse of power is likely to occur. CAK may also require a sector or undertaking to develop a binding code of practice. The CAK is then required to publish the code of practice. The implication to businesses is that companies in ‘monitored’ sectors will be required to comply with reporting and prudential requirements. What is buyer power? It is the influence exerted by an undertaking in the position of purchaser to either obtain from a supplier more favourable terms or impose a long-term opportunity cost including harm or withheld benefit which would be significantly disproportionate to any resulting long-term co

MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS &amp; TAKEOVERS MERGERS A merger is a voluntary amalgamation of two firms on roughly equal terms into one new legal entity. The decision is usually mutual between the merging companies. Mergers are mostly geared towards enjoying greater economies of scale and increasing a companies competitiveness in the market. The term “merger” is defined in Section 2 of the Competition Act, 2010 (the Act) as “any acquisition of shares, business or other assets, whether inside or outside of Kenya, resulting in the change of control of a business, part of a business or an asset of a business in Kenya, in any manner and includes a takeover. Sec 41 of the Act goes ahead to define mergers in greater details to includea) the purchase or lease of shares, acquisition of an interest, or purchase of assets of the other undertaking in question;(b) the acquisition of a controlling interest in a section of the business of an undertaking capable of itself being operated independentlyThe Capital Markets (Take-overs and mergers) Regulations, 2002 provides that a merger is an arrangement whereby the assets of two or more companies become vested in or under the control of one company6/8/202214WAKIMANI 6/8/20227WAKIMANI 6/8/2022WAKIMANI6 6/8/2022WAKIMANI5 6/8/20224WAKIMANILINK POISON PILLPoison pills allow existing shareholders the right to purchase additional shares at a discount, effectively diluting the ownership interest of a new, hostile party.

MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS IN KENYA 1. REGULATORY FRAMEWORK 1.1 What legislation and regulatory bodies govern public M&A in your jurisdiction? Public companies listed on the Nairobi Securities Exchange (NSE) are regulated by the Companies Act 2015 and the Capital Markets Act (chapter 485A, Laws of Kenya) and associated regulations. Non-listed companies are only subject to the Companies Act. Both may be subject to sector-specific legislation governing entities such as banks, insurance and telecommunications providers, and other regulated industry players. Merger activity resulting in a deemed change of control may require regulatory approval from either or both of the Competition Authority of Kenya (CAK) and the Comesa [Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa] Competition Commission (CCC) for regional transactions. 1.2 How, by whom and what measures, are takeover regulations (or equivalent) enforced? For listed companies, the Capital Markets Authority (CMA) enforces the requirements of the Capital Markets Act and associated takeover rules. The Capital Markets Tribunal (CMT) hears appeals concerning actions by the CMA on any matter relating to the Capital Markets Act. While there are no takeover regulations applicable to non-listed companies, the CAK enforces Kenya's antitrust and merger approval regime. In regulated industries, prior notification to or approval from the relevant sector regulator may also be required, particularly where foreign investors are concerned. 2. S

COMPETITION AUTHORITY OF KENYA MERGER NOTIFICATION FORM CAK/M&A/F-001 Instructions 1. This form is issued in terms of Section 43 (1) of the Competition Act which stipulates that each of the undertakings to the merger shall notify the Authority of the proposal in writing or in the prescribed manner. 2. The objective of this merger notification form is to improve the efficiency, transparency and predictability of the merger notification process. 3. Please note that the Competition Act empowers the Competition Authority of Kenya to obtain information relevant to evaluate mergers and acquisitions. This form facilitates the process by identifying relevant information depending on the activities of the merging parties and whether they are operating in the same markets and/or are actual or potential customers or suppliers to each other. By anticipating the likely information required by CAK and collating it in advance the time taken for the evaluation of the merger will be reduced. However, omitting relevant information may lead to the merger evaluation being delayed. This table below summarizes the schedules which should be normally submitted, depending on the characteristics of the merger. The thresholds referred to therein are according to the CAK merger threshold guidelines.

MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS IN KENYA 1. REGULATORY FRAMEWORK 1.1 What legislation and regulatory bodies govern public M&A in your jurisdiction? Public companies listed on the Nairobi Securities Exchange (NSE) are regulated by the Companies Act 2015 and the Capital Markets Act (chapter 485A, Laws of Kenya) and associated regulations. Non-listed companies are only subject to the Companies Act. Both may be subject to sector-specific legislation governing entities such as banks, insurance and telecommunications providers, and other regulated industry players. Merger activity resulting in a deemed change of control may require regulatory approval from either or both of the Competition Authority of Kenya (CAK) and the Comesa [Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa] Competition Commission (CCC) for regional transactions. 1.2 How, by whom and what measures, are takeover regulations (or equivalent) enforced? For listed companies, the Capital Markets Authority (CMA) enforces the requirements of the Capital Markets Act and associated takeover rules. The Capital Markets Tribunal (CMT) hears appeals concerning actions by the CMA on any matter relating to the Capital Markets Act. While there are no takeover regulations applicable to non-listed companies, the CAK enforces Kenya's antitrust and merger approval regime. In regulated industries, prior notification to or approval from the relevant sector regulator may also be required, particularly where foreign investors are concerned. 2. S

Background Protecting minority shareholders' rights is not a common practice in takeovers. The laws and market practices have often protected the majority shareholders at the expense of minority shareholders. In Kenya, the law has been no more than unstable regarding the protection of minority shareholders' rights. Before 2019, the Companies Act 2015 provided for compulsory acquisition rights (squeeze-in) , allowing the acquiring company to "buy out" the dissenting minority shareholders. This is similar to the "drag along" principle in the repealed Companies Act. The sell-out rights were two parts: the acquiring company must acquire or unconditionally contract to acquire 90% of the shares relating to the offer and 90% of the voting rights in the target company. The law also provided for sell-out rights , which allowed the acquiring company to buy out the minority shareholders by purchasing their shares at the offer price, thus allowing the minority shareholders to exit the deal. However, the Statute Law (Miscellaneous Amendments) Act (Act No. 12 of 2019) (Amendment Act) introduced an amendment to the 2015 Act by lowering the threshold from 90% to 50%. The lowered threshold allowed the acquiring company to force out the non-assenting shareholders effortlessly if 50% of the issued shares accepted the offer. This change received a backlash as it undermined the minority shareholders' rights to decline a hostile takeover offer. This law was again changed in 2019, raising the thres

MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS • Mergers are like marriages. They are the bringing together of two individuals. If you wouldn't marry someone for the 'operational efficiencies' they offer in the running of a household, then why would you combine two companies with unique cultures and identities for that reason? Simon Sinek • Reasonable mergers generate substantial synergies, so that provides for earnings and cash-flow growth even if it doesn't provide for revenue growth, and I think that's a big driver. 2/8/2024 WAKIMANI 2 2/8/2024 I 3 COMPANY X • • • • • Private Co.

Defences to takeoversA competing bid from a strategic investor is often the most attractive form of anti-takeover defence. Target companies may also make counter-offers to purchase the shares at a premium this includes a company buying a sizable portion of its own shares, which prevents the acquiring company from purchasing the shares and becoming the majority owner.. A target entity may modify its capital structure and force a re-evaluation of the deal's attractiveness or seek white knight offers from other players in the relevant industry. Further anti-takeover defences may be prescribed in a listed company's articles of association.Targets may persuade the existing shareholders to reject the offer based on the independent adviser's evaluation.Confidentiality is key to prevent the any counters to the acquisitionKeeping the proposed bid as confidential as possible until it is announced generally assists in protecting the deal. Entering into voting agreements to secure the minimum percentage of shares to be taken up may help encourage a friendly deal.

KN LAW LLP LEGAL March 17, 2020 Changes in Competition Law in Kenya Introduction The Competition (Amendment) Act, 2019 (the “Act”) was assented to by the President on December 13, 2019 to commence on December 31, 2019. The Act introduced amendments to the Competition Act to regulate abuse of buyer power in the market. Additionally, the Competition (General) Rules, 2019 (“Rules”) made under Section 93 of the Act, were gazetted on December 06, 2019. The Rules consolidate the informal practice guidelines issued by Competition Authority of Kenya (CAK). We discuss the changes introduced by the Act and the Rules below. The Competition (Amendment) Act, 2019 The amendments reorganize the provisions of the Act on buyer power and abuse of buyer power. They increase CAK’s scope of powers in preventing abuse of buyer power by enabling it to monitor industries and sectors in which abuse of power is likely to occur. CAK may also require a sector or undertaking to develop a binding code of practice. The CAK is then required to publish the code of practice. The implication to businesses is that companies in ‘monitored’ sectors will be required to comply with reporting and prudential requirements. What is buyer power? It is the influence exerted by an undertaking in the position of purchaser to either obtain from a supplier more favourable terms or impose a long-term opportunity cost including harm or withheld benefit which would be significantly disproportionate to any resulting long-term co

MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS &amp; TAKEOVERS MERGERS A merger is a voluntary amalgamation of two firms on roughly equal terms into one new legal entity. The decision is usually mutual between the merging companies. Mergers are mostly geared towards enjoying greater economies of scale and increasing a companies competitiveness in the market. The term “merger” is defined in Section 2 of the Competition Act, 2010 (the Act) as “any acquisition of shares, business or other assets, whether inside or outside of Kenya, resulting in the change of control of a business, part of a business or an asset of a business in Kenya, in any manner and includes a takeover. Sec 41 of the Act goes ahead to define mergers in greater details to includea) the purchase or lease of shares, acquisition of an interest, or purchase of assets of the other undertaking in question;(b) the acquisition of a controlling interest in a section of the business of an undertaking capable of itself being operated independentlyThe Capital Markets (Take-overs and mergers) Regulations, 2002 provides that a merger is an arrangement whereby the assets of two or more companies become vested in or under the control of one company6/8/202214WAKIMANI 6/8/20227WAKIMANI 6/8/2022WAKIMANI6 6/8/2022WAKIMANI5 6/8/20224WAKIMANILINK POISON PILLPoison pills allow existing shareholders the right to purchase additional shares at a discount, effectively diluting the ownership interest of a new, hostile party.

MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS IN KENYA 1. REGULATORY FRAMEWORK 1.1 What legislation and regulatory bodies govern public M&A in your jurisdiction? Public companies listed on the Nairobi Securities Exchange (NSE) are regulated by the Companies Act 2015 and the Capital Markets Act (chapter 485A, Laws of Kenya) and associated regulations. Non-listed companies are only subject to the Companies Act. Both may be subject to sector-specific legislation governing entities such as banks, insurance and telecommunications providers, and other regulated industry players. Merger activity resulting in a deemed change of control may require regulatory approval from either or both of the Competition Authority of Kenya (CAK) and the Comesa [Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa] Competition Commission (CCC) for regional transactions. 1.2 How, by whom and what measures, are takeover regulations (or equivalent) enforced? For listed companies, the Capital Markets Authority (CMA) enforces the requirements of the Capital Markets Act and associated takeover rules. The Capital Markets Tribunal (CMT) hears appeals concerning actions by the CMA on any matter relating to the Capital Markets Act. While there are no takeover regulations applicable to non-listed companies, the CAK enforces Kenya's antitrust and merger approval regime. In regulated industries, prior notification to or approval from the relevant sector regulator may also be required, particularly where foreign investors are concerned. 2. S

This form facilitates the process by identifying relevant information depending on the activities of the merging parties and whether they are operating in the same markets and/or are actual or potential customers or suppliers to each other. By anticipating the likely information required by CAK and collating it in advance the time taken for the evaluation of the merger will be reduced. However, omitting relevant information may lead to the merger evaluation being delayed. This table below summarizes the schedules which should be normally submitted, depending on the characteristics of the merger. The thresholds referred to therein are according to the CAK merger threshold guidelines. Characteristics of the merger Schedules to be submitted Firms applying for exclusion as prescribed by the CAK Schedule Merger Threshold Guidelines, I (only questions 1-18) and Schedule IV Merger at or above

A reverse merger or reverse takeover is a transaction in which a private company acquires or merges with (or into) a public “shell” company to become publicly listed. The primary motivation for such a transaction is that it is much less expensive than a full IPO with its extensive Registration Statement (and disclosures) and the detailed guidance and approvals with the CAPITAL Markets Authority or similar agencies in other jurisdictions. Another advantage is likely the ability to not hire an underwriter for the offeror’s stock. As a result, the reverse merger is a way to enter the Kenyan capital market without engaging an underwriter and investment banker. The public company target in this type of transaction is usually a “shell” company since all that exists of such company is its organizational structure with little or no active operations, assets, or liabilities, but listed on a nationally recognized stock exchange and not necessarily actively traded. A principal assumption for undertaking this kind of transaction is that the private company does not need liquidity or capital access immediately. While the process of going public and raising capital is combined in an IPO, in a reverse merger/takeover, these two functions are separate. So, a reverse merger/takeover is not a capital-raising event although the transaction could involve the filing of a Registration Statement or other securities regulatory filings once certain steps are complete.

INSOLVENCY PROCEDURES CONTINUED Insolvency Procedures Continued Administration It involves taking in control by the administrator the whole or substantially all of the company's business and assets to manage the company's business and if need be to realize its assets for the purpose of paying one or more of its creditors. The administrator may also be appointed by the court to collect the protect the property of an insolvent company until its fate is determined by the court and to utilize the property or manage the company's affairs in discharging debt. The primary objective of the administration of a company is a) To maintain a company as a going concern b) Achieve a more favorable outcome for the company's group of creditors which would likely not be the case if the company were liquidated without first being under administration c) To realize the property of the company in order to make a distribution to one or more secured or preferential creditors The general rule is that the debt which an administration order is founded is due and payable or is undisputed. If the subject is disputed a petition for an administration order or liquidation would amount to ordinary proceedings for debt collection. The administration must not be used as a means of bringing pressure using the courts for payment of debts In the case of Re The Standard Limited Ex Parte Tricom Paper International BV [2002] KLR 644 it was held that if a petition is intended to enforce payment of a disputed debt it

A company can be in receivership and also in liquidation or voluntary administration. Voluntary administration An administrator is appointed to review and rearrange a business to avoid liquidation.

The liquidator is usually a chartered accountant, or an insolvency expert. Note The Insolvency and Trustee Service only deals with liquidations, and generally only if appointed by the court. The Liquidation Process This process can be different depending on the circumstances, e.g. whether the company is trading, or depending on what assets it has.

It aims to provide for and regulate the bankruptcy or liquidation of natural persons, incorporated and unincorporated bodies to enable their affairs to be managed for the benefit of their creditors. The Act was assented on 11th September, 2015 and will come into operation on such date as the Cabinet Secretary may direct by notice in the Kenya Gazette, however, any provision that is not brought into force through gazettement within nine months after the publication of the Act shall automatically come into force on the expiry of that period. Prior to the enactment of the Insolvency Act, corporate insolvency was dealt with under the Winding-up provisions of the Companies Act(Cap 486 of the Laws of Kenya) (the Companies Act) while the insolvency of natural persons was covered in the Bankruptcy Act of Kenya(Cap 53 of the Laws of Kenya) (the Bankruptcy Act). Unlike the previous legislation, the Act seeks to redeem insolvent companies through administration as opposed to liquidation.

The financial services industry’s self-examination has generated one practice that has now become increasingly popular: the introduction of restructuring2 options within existing insolvency laws to give failing companies a pathway to solvency. Studies have shown a positive correlation between insolvency law reform and the survival rates of distressed companies; these laws have also been found to promote job preservation. referred to as out-of-court restructuring.3 With liquidation of insolvent companies bearing potential losses to creditors of up to 85%, restructuring emerged as a preferred alternative. However, recent high-profile cases of insolvency highlight the need to further develop this restructuring framework. Some of the recent high-profile insolvency cases inc

When the old financial laws regarding implementation of bankruptcy orders were applied to an individual in Kenya’s traditional legal landscape, one was not allowed to carry more than Sh100 in their pockets. The time tested legal provision, which has been the last resort by individuals who are unable to service their debt, now faces several headwinds with the changing financial times and particularly the move to cashless transactions. Experts say although the declaration of bankruptcy does not discharge one from debt obligation but only protects them from creditors within the period of bankruptcy, the way of determining whether one’s economic conditions have changed, necessitating his debt obligation to be reimposed, remain gray in the modern cashlite economy. Once a bankruptcy order is made, the property of the bankrupt and the power he could have vested over that property vests in a trustee. The only assets allowed are his tools of trade, necessary household furniture and personal effects, and even a motor vehicle if its value is not more than Sh1 million. Later, the Insolvency Act was introduced with the sole aim of helping the individual or company, return to stability and not destroy them. The move is a shift from the previous focus where debtors who defaulted were punished by being sent to prison, hurting the very businesses from which they were expected to generate funds to settle the debts. Lawyers argue that the use of mobile money platforms will now be the new avenue

The cross-border insolvency regime in Kenya. To what extent has the Kenyan regime followed the UNCITRAL implementation guidelines? BY: NDWIGA SUSAN NJERI INTRODUCTION National insolvency laws provide treatment and remedy to the issues arising out of the corporate restructuring drives within the jurisdictions of the national laws. The law relating to insolvency that is operative in Kenya has remained in force without any substantive reform for about five decades. The changing economic climate coupled with the drive by multilateral institutions for institutionalization of the rule of law and good governance in developing countries has created a pressing need for amelioration of insolvency law and cross-border insolvency law in Kenya. The initiative is undertaken within the broad context of facilitating growth of trade and investment and foreign direct investment in particular with a view to reducing poverty. Cross-border insolvency in Kenya is a new creature that came along after the enactment of the new Insolvency Act. Cross-border insolvency deals with regulation of how debtors who owe debts and have assets in another country or creditors should be treated. It is more concerned with insolvency of companies which operate in more than one country rather than individual bankruptcy. The United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) has come with the Model Law for the cross border mergers & acquisitions exercise. It was established in 1966 as a subsidiary body of

In re Abdallah Chitechi Munyendo [2022] eKLR REPUBLIC OF KENYA IN THE HIGH COURT OF KENYA AT KAKAMEGA BANKRUPTY CAUSE No. 1 OF 2018 IN THE MATTER OF THE MATTER OF THE INSOLVENCY ACT No 18 of 2015 AND IN THE MATTER OF ABDALLAH CHITECHI MUNYENDO RULING 1. The Petitioner before the Court petitioning for bankruptcy is the Debtor himself, Abdallah Chitechi Munyendo. Section 13 of the Insolvency Act No 18 of 2015 (hereinafter referred to as “the Act”) envisages such a petition. It is to be made in accordance with Section 32 of the Act. The only ground under which the Court can make an order for bankruptcy is that the debtor is unable to pay his/her debts. 2. Before the Court can exercise its jurisdiction, it must be satisfied that the Debtor has complied with Section 32(2) of the Act, in particular that the Application must be accompanied by a statement of the debtor’s financial position. The Statement of Financial Position must contain the following: (a) Such particulars of the debtor’s creditors and of the debtor’s debts and other liabilities and assets as may be prescribed by the insolvency regulations; and (b) Such other information as may be so prescribed. 3. The importance of the Statement of Financial Position can be seen by the fact that sub-section (3) provides that the Court may reject a statement of the debtor’s financial position if of the opinion that it is incorrect or incomplete. Further under Sub-Section 4 the debtor must publish the notice in a local newspaper and

This Petition is in respect of Diamond Hasham Lalji (the Debtor). Cargill Kenya Limited (the Creditor) seeks a Bankruptcy Order in respect of his Estate. 2. Some facts are common. The Debtor is the Chairman and Director of Premier Flour Mills Limited, Maize Milling Company Limited and Milling Corporation of Kenya (2009) Limited (hereafter jointly the ‘Companies’ or ‘Principal debtors’).

In re James Maina Kabatha (Debtor/Applicant) [2020] eKLR REPUBLIC OF KENYA IN THE HIGH COURT OF KENYA AT NAKURU INSOLVENCY CAUSE NO. 4 OF 2019 IN THE MATTER OF JAMES MAINA KABATHA (DEBTOR/APPLICANT) RULING 1. The twin goals of consumer or individual bankruptcy law are to protect creditors and ensure optimal payment to them where possible; and the provision of shelter and a "fresh start" to individual debtors overburdened by debt. There is no doubt that these twin goals run through the Insolvency Act, 2015 and the Insolvency Regulations, 2016. 2. The US Supreme Court explained the fundamental goal of bankruptcy law in Local Loan Co. v. Hunt, 292 U.S. 234, 244 (1934) thus: [Bankruptcy law] gives to the honest but unfortunate debtor…a new opportunity in life and a clear field for future effort, unhampered by the pressure and discouragement of pre-existing debt. 3. The “fresh start” goal is accomplished through the bankruptcy discharge, which usually releases the debtor from personal liability from certain debts and prevents creditors from taking any action against the debtor to collect those debts. 4. Consequently, bankruptcy protection being an extraordinary relief, one of the corollaries to the these seemingly conflictual twin goals of bankruptcy law – the protection of creditors and the provision of fresh start for the honest but unfortunate debtor -- is that an individual seeking bankruptcy protection is required to scrupulously demonstrate that he is acting in good faith an

A company can be in receivership and also in liquidation or voluntary administration. Voluntary administration An administrator is appointed to review and rearrange a business to avoid liquidation. Liquidation A liquidator is appointed to investigate and deal with all the business assets. The creditors can apply to the High Court for this to happen (Creditor Liquidation), or the shareholders can pass a special resolution (Voluntary Liquidation). The liquidator is usually a chartered accountant, or an insolvency expert. Note The Insolvency and Trustee Service only deals with liquidations, and generally only if appointed by the court. The Liquidation Process This process can be different depending on the circumstances, e.g. whether the company is trading, or depending on what assets it has.

INSIGHTS / EXPERTISE / PEOPLE / NEWS / CONTACTS SITEMAP DISCLAIMER The Insolvency Act, 2015: The impact on creditors and their right to realise securities Posted on: December 5, 2015 The Insolvency Act, 2015(the Insolvency Act) was enacted with the key objective of amending and consolidating the legislation relating to the insolvency of natural persons and incorporated and unincorporated bodies. It aims to provide for and regulate the bankruptcy or liquidation of natural persons, incorporated and unincorporated bodies to enable their affairs to be managed for the benefit of their creditors. The Act was assented on 11th September, 2015 and will come into operation on such date as the Cabinet Secretary may direct by notice in the Kenya Gazette, however, any provision that is not brought into force through gazettement within nine months after the publication of the Act shall automatically come into force on the expiry of that period. Prior to the enactment of the Insolvency Act, corporate insolvency was dealt with under the Winding-up provisions of the Companies Act(Cap 486 of the Laws of Kenya) (the Companies Act) while the insolvency of natural persons was covered in the Bankruptcy Act of Kenya(Cap 53 of the Laws of Kenya) (the Bankruptcy Act). Unlike the previous legislation, the Act seeks to redeem insolvent companies through administration as opposed to liquidation. The Act focuses more on assisting insolvent natural persons, unincorporated entities and insolvent corporate

When the old financial laws regarding implementation of bankruptcy orders were applied to an individual in Kenya’s traditional legal landscape, one was not allowed to carry more than Sh100 in their pockets. The time tested legal provision, which has been the last resort by individuals who are unable to service their debt, now faces several headwinds with the changing financial times and particularly the move to cashless transactions. Experts say although the declaration of bankruptcy does not discharge one from debt obligation but only protects them from creditors within the period of bankruptcy, the way of determining whether one’s economic conditions have changed, necessitating his debt obligation to be reimposed, remain gray in the modern cashlite economy. Once a bankruptcy order is made, the property of the bankrupt and the power he could have vested over that property vests in a trustee. The only assets allowed are his tools of trade, necessary household furniture and personal effects, and even a motor vehicle if its value is not more than Sh1 million. Later, the Insolvency Act was introduced with the sole aim of helping the individual or company, return to stability and not destroy them. The move is a shift from the previous focus where debtors who defaulted were punished by being sent to prison, hurting the very businesses from which they were expected to generate funds to settle the debts. Lawyers argue that the use of mobile money platforms will now be the new avenue

CORPORATE INSOLVENCY: LIQUIDATION OF REGISTERED COMPANIES Class E: Firm 7 This topic will focus on the key corporate insolvency procedures of liquidation, administration and voluntary arrangements of companies under the Insolvency Act, 2015; highlighting the role of the government, regulators, the insolvency practitioner and other stakeholders including the duties and conduct of directors in relation to business in financial difficulty. Liquidation is a proceeding by means of which a company is dissolved and in the course of such dissolution its assets are collected and its debts are paid off out of the assets of the company or from contributions by its members, if necessary. If any surplus is left, it is distributed among the members in accordance with their rights. Section 384 of the Insolvency Act provides that a company is unable to pay its debts if- if a creditor (by assignment or otherwise) to whom the company is indebted for hundred thousand shillings or more has served on the company, by leaving it at the company's registered office, a written demand requiring the company to pay the debt and the company has for twenty-one days afterwards failed to pay the debt or to secure or compound for it to the reasonable satisfaction of the creditor; if execution or other process issued on a judgment, decree or order of any court in favour of a creditor of the company is returned unsatisfied in whole or in part; or if it is proved to the satisfaction of the Court that the company

Circumstances in which a company may be liquidated voluntarily(a) When the period (if any) fixed for the duration of the company by the articles expires(b) The event (if any) occurs, on the occurrence of which the articles provide that the company is to be dissolved, and the company in general meeting has passed a resolution providing for its voluntary liquidation; or (c) If the company resolves by special resolution that it be liquidated voluntarily.However, before passing a resolution for voluntary liquidation, the company shall give notice of the resolution to the holder of any qualifying floating charge in respect of the company's property. Appointment Of Special Managers A special manager is an officer of the court. The power of the special manager to exercise functions is conferred by the court and the special manager exercises them as a principal and appointee of the court. The official receiver should not request a special manager to perform acts in respect of which the official receiver has no statutory right to undertake himself/herself, nor should the official receiver request a special manager to discharge any responsibility outside the powers granted to him/her by the court. Cont.If, because of a charge a person surrenders property to a company or pays money to a company, the person ranks, in respect of the amount of the proceeds of sale of the property by the liquidator, or the amount money paid, as a preferential creditor of the company, except as against so mu

Joint Stock Companies Act of 1844The 1844 Act incorporated companies that were registered its provisions, and regulated the winding up of joint stock companies. ii. Winding-up Act of 1844Was the first statute enacted to regulate the winding up of companies.Before this Act was passed, the creditors could proceed against a company’s properties as well as the properties of shareholders.With the enactment of this statute, the creditors’ rights were limited to the company’s property.The purpose of the Act was to force companies into bankruptcy just like natural persons. Historical Background…continueda. BankruptcyThe individual insolvency, also known as bankruptcy dominated the early history of England and Wales. Corporate insolvency is a recent phenomenon because limited liability companies were only recently conceived as juristic persons (Salmon vs Salmon)Can be traced back to the law which was applied to the Italian medieval city states. Bankruptcy law then was applicable to the merchants and had its roots in Roman law.The early bankruptcy laws in England, just like the Italian city states, were put in place to give creditors additional remedy against a debtor. i. The Bankruptcy Act of 1542 A.D.Bankruptcy Statute was enacted (can be said to mark the official promulgation of bankruptcy law regime). Prior to the

FIRM 18 - CLASS E COMMERCIAL TRANSACTIONS PART 7 Liquidation of an Unregistered Companies What is an unregistered company? Unregistered company includes any association and any company other than a company registered under the Companies Act, 2015. Companies registered under the Companies Act, 2015 are private and public limited or unlimited companies. All other entities are therefore considered unregistered companies for purposes of Insolvency Act, 2015. Circumstances in which unregistered company can be liquidated Liquidation is neither defined under the Insolvency Act, 2015 nor the Companies Act, 2015. The Black’s Law Dictionary defines ‘liquidate’ as to settle an obligation by payment or to determine the liabilities and distribute the assets of an entity especially in bankruptcy or dissolution. Liquidation of an unregistered company is a new concept introduced in the new Insolvency Act, 2015. An unregistered company can be liquidated like any other registered company under Part VI of the Insolvency Act, 2015. This part provides for liquidation of registered companies. Under this part, liquidation may be either: Voluntary – which can either be; Members’ Voluntary liquidation – where a resolution has been passed by members for voluntary liquidation and the directors have sworn a statutory declaration as to the ability of the company to pay its debts. Creditors’ Voluntary liquidation - where no statutory declaration has been made as above to assure creditors of payment of the

Uchumi Supermarket Limited (herein after the company) is in the business of operating supermarkets throughout Kenya. It was incorporated in 1975. 2. A petition was filed in this matter by Githunguri Dairy Farmers co-operative society seeking the liquidation of the company for non payment of debt. On 20th March, 2019 the company appointed Owen Njenga Koimburi to supervise the implementation of the Company’s Voluntary Arrangement (CVA). On 13th May 2019 the said supervisor convened a first meeting of the company and its creditors. The meeting was convened for the purpose of the company’s members and its creditors to decide whether to approve the CVA with or without modification. 3. The said supervisor submitted a report to this court of the outcome of the meeting. It is clear from the report that the CVA was rejected by the company’s secured creditors. It is as a consequence of that rejection of CVA that an application dated 29th May 2019 was filed by Securitas Kenya Limited (the applicant) one of the Company’s Creditor. By that application the applicant seeks the prayers: (1) THAT the secured creditors vote in the company’s creditors meeting held on 13th May 2019 be disregarded due to material irregularity.

The purpose of the provision referred to as Pre-Insolvency moratorium is meant to prevent creditors from taking an enforcement action against a company while it considers its options for rescue, whether by new investment, formulating a restructuring plan, refinancing, sale or other rescue option available. What these provisions do is that they give time to the company to analyse its options. The process leaves the affairs of the company in the control of the company/directors under the supervision of a licenced Insolvency Practitioner who acts as a Monitor. The moratorium takes effect upon filing of Documents in Court and lasts for 30 days from and including the day on which the moratorium takes effect and may extended by Court for a further 30 days or more. The court shall endorse the copies of the documents filed and shall issue an Order recognising the moratorium in the Form provided under the Insolvency regulations. To obtain a pre-insolvency moratorium, the Directors have to file with the Court, among other documents, a statement from the Monitor indicating that the proposed moratorium has a reasonable prospect of achieving its aims and the Company has sufficient funds available to it during the proposed moratorium to enable it to carry on its business.

OVERVIEW OF THE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK IN FINANCIAL SERVICES SECTOR a) Central Bank of Kenya The Central Bank of Kenya was established in 1966 through an Act of Parliament – the Central Bank of Kenya Act of 1966. The establishment of the Bank was a direct result of the desire among the three East African states to have independent monetary and financial policies. The Central Bank of Kenya Act of 1966 set out objectives and functions and gave the Central Bank limited autonomy. Since the amendment of the Central Bank of Kenya Act in April 1997, the Central Bank operations have been restructured to conform with ongoing economic reforms. There is now greater monetary autonomy. The Mandate of the Central Bank Section 4 of the Central Bank of Kenya Act states the core mandate of the Bank as follows: The principal object of the Bank shall be to formulate and implement monetary policy directed to achieving and maintaining stability in the general level of prices; The Bank shall foster the liquidity, solvency and proper functioning of a stable market- based financial system; and Subject to (1) and (2), the Bank shall support the economic policy of the Government, including its objectives for growth and employment. b) Capital Markets Authority The Capital Market is part of the Financial Market that provides funds for long term development. This is a market that brings together lenders(Investors) of capital and Borrowers(companies that sell securities to the public) of capital. In Novembe

The Act establishes the Competition Authority of Kenya (“the Authority”) as the country’s competition regulator and consumer watchdog. The Authority actively executes its mandate to promote and safeguard competition in the national economy, to deter abuse of buyer power and to protect consumers from unfair and misleading market conduct. Consequently, the Authority has delivered hundreds of determinations and market inquiries and studies. These determinations have shaped public discourse on enforcement of competition and consumer protection law, set precedent and new jurisprudence in Kenya and beyond. More importantly, these determinations have contributed to the country’s economic progress including facilitating investments and safeguarding businesses, as well as enhancing the welfare of consumer

Types of Retail/low value systems are:i)Nairobi Automated Clearing House.ii)Payment Card Industry.iii)Mobile phone Money Transfer Services. In the context of National Payment Systems, this allows for innovation and development of the technology surrounding these payment systems. It also encourages foreign and national investment within this sector. Section 9 (j) states that the Authority may investigate on policies from regulatory bodies and its effects in competition and consumer welfare. the Authority has been given the duty to investigate regulatory authorities like the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) and Capital Markets Authority (CMA) on some of the policies they make and determine whether they stifle competition and consumer welfare or not. Section 24 advises against abuse of dominance in the market. The Competition Act only steps in if there has been any impediment to competition, unfair trade practices by co-operations or during mergers and acquisitions. Therefore, because of their limited role in the National Payment Systems, it hardly stifles advancement of technology hence it is an effective Law. see Telkom &amp; Airtel vs CAK DATA PROTECTIONData protection in Kenya is regulated by the Data Protection Act No. 24 of 2019 (the "DPA").Personal data is to be kept in a form which identifies the data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes which it was collected; and.

Consumer Protection in the Financial Service Sector in Kenya An evaluation of the treatment of consumer protection in the financial services sector through the provisions of the Central Bank of Kenya Act, the Banking Act, the Insurance Act, the Capital Markets Act and the Retirement Benefits Act and the Subsidiary legislations made thereunder and suggested reforms, if any, that may improve the situation. Table of Contents INTRODUCTION Consumer protection is about ensuring fair exchange between goods and service providers on the one hand and consumers on the other hand. A deliberate legal framework is necessary to counter-balance the inherent disadvantage of a consumer vis-a-vis the power, information and resources of their goods and service providers. As a result, reforms in the financial sector regulations center on the concept of consumer protection.3 From the onset, the Kenya 2010 Constitution entrenches the right to consumer protection, that is, consumers should be protected from unfair market practices from services and goods providers.4 This constitutional entrenchment, in conjunction with the Consumer Protection Act 2012 and sector-specific statutes, place enormous obligations and responsibilities on providers of financial services and goods (both private and public) to be discussed hereunder. With regard to the foregoing observation this paper purposes to evaluate the treatment of consumer protection in the financial services sector through the provisions of the Centr

INTRODUCTION Prior to the development of digital credit, most Kenyans relied on informal lenders (shylocks), relatives and friends for short-term loans. The introduction of pioneer digital credit products such as M-Shwari has led to exponential growth of digital lending over the last couple of years.According to research conducted by Reek Analytics in 2021, out of every 100 Kenyans polled, 55 had acquired loans from digital credit providers at some point.Yet, despite the popularity, the digital credit market remained unregulated for a long time. As a result, the market was marred with unfair industry practices around unethical debt collection, abuse of personal information and high interest rates. “You are now attached by a serious defaulter by the Name: Alex Mpole who used your details as a referee begging for your contribution on the same. Being the last warning. Seek clearance from this rogue client who has refused to pay off the loan Kshs. 25,000. Avoid being denied loans, listed in the CBK, CRB and or your job application being rejected. We will look for you.” – sample message sent to a defaulter’s contact list IMPACT OF THE DCP REGULATIONS ON THE EXISTING LEGISLATIVE FRAMEWORKData Protection Act No. 24 of 2019The regulations have provisions that guarantee protection of the rights of data subjects (borrowers) and obligations of data controllers (DCPs) in accordance with the DPA.Reg 13; DCP to put in place appropriate policies, procedures and systems to ensure the confide

There is therefore urgent need to promote data security and protection by states and private entities. The right to privacy is fundamental and plays a pivotal role in promoting data security in financial services. Financial services handle a great deal of sensitive information belonging to consumers on a day to day basis in order to efficiently carry out their services. The ecosystem of the finance sector is one that demands multiple data transfers as part of the day to day activities, a lot of which is information of individuals which they consider personal and private.Additionally, a lot of companies are using innovativ

Data Protection Act In Kenya The Data Protection Act No. 24 of2019 (the Act or DPA hereinafter) which was enacted on 8th November 2019 has a commencement date of 25th November 2019. Its preamble states that it is meant to give effect to Article 31 (c) and (d) of the Constitution. These provisions guarantee that every person has the right to privacy, including not to have information relating to their family or private affairs unnecessarily required or revealed and not to have the privacy of their communications infringed. The Act is a clean-up of several bills that were introduced previously then withdrawn for one reason or the other. The new law comes against the backdrop of the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulations (EUGDPR). Most companies operating in Kenya were still grappling with compliance. Notably, the provisions of the Act mimic those of the EUGDPR and therefore companies that had taken steps towards compliance with EUGDPR will be a step ahead. Who is affected by the Data Protection Act? The Act limits its scope to data controllers or processors who are established and ordinarily reside in Kenya and process personal data of natural persons while in Kenya OR If they are not established or resident in Kenya, they process personal data of data subjects located in Kenya. This scope captures anyone whose operations involve collection or processing of personal information pertaining to Kenyan residents. For instance, any person running an app that collects p

FINANCIAL SERVICES REGULATION IN KENYA. Introduction The financial services sector in Kenya has historically evolved since pre independence. Through the years, the sector has been regulated by the government, although at different spheres, both directly and indirectly. From the onset of establishment of financial services sector, some of the sub sectors were self regulated. However, with penetration and increase of financial services there has been continued demand for efficient regulation.157 This has created a mix of both self regulation and government regulation.158 The different sub sectors have experienced different paces for development and regulation. With the growth of the Kenyan economy, and the palpable need for proper regulation of the sector, the Ministry of Finance has played the oversight role. However, with subsequent development, the regulatory framework developed from the different departments to having independent regulators for each sub sector.159 This chapter discusses the financial services sector regulatory framework.

PRESS RELEASE ENACTMENT OF THE LAW TO REGULATE DIGITAL LENDERS AND ISSUANCE OF THE CORRESPONDING DRAFT REGULATIONS FOR PUBLIC COMMENT Following Presidential assent on December 7, 2021, the Central Bank of Kenya (Amendment) Act, 2021, has become effective today, December 23, 2021. The Amendment provides the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) with the powers to license and oversight the previously unregulated digital credit providers. This is a significant milestone. Correspondingly, CBK announces the issuance of draft Digital Credit Providers Regulations and invites public comments. With the recent advances in technology and ongoing innovations, lending through digital channels, particularly mobile phones, has grown significantly in Kenya. However, concerns have been raised by the public about the predatory practices of the unregulated digital credit providers, and in particular, their high cost, unethical debt collection practices, and the abuse of personal information. The Amendment requires CBK to publish Regulations within three months, i.e., by March 23, 2022, and accordingly CBK has developed the draft Regulations for public consultation. The Regulations provide for inter alia the licensing, governance, and credit operations of Digital Credit Providers (DCPs). They further provide for consumer protection, credit information sharing, and elaborate on the Anti-Money Laundering and Combating the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) obligations of DCPs. In line with the public particip

Data Protection Act In Kenya The Data Protection Act No. 24 of2019 (the Act or DPA hereinafter) which was enacted on 8th November 2019 has a commencement date of 25th November 2019. Its preamble states that it is meant to give effect to Article 31 (c) and (d) of the Constitution. These provisions guarantee that every person has the right to privacy, including not to have information relating to their family or private affairs unnecessarily required or revealed and not to have the privacy of their communications infringed. The Act is a clean-up of several bills that were introduced previously then withdrawn for one reason or the other. The new law comes against the backdrop of the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulations (EUGDPR). Most companies operating in Kenya were still grappling with compliance. Notably, the provisions of the Act mimic those of the EUGDPR and therefore companies that had taken steps towards compliance with EUGDPR will be a step ahead. Who is affected by the Data Protection Act? The Act limits its scope to data controllers or processors who are established and ordinarily reside in Kenya and process personal data of natural persons while in Kenya OR If they are not established or resident in Kenya, they process personal data of data subjects located in Kenya. This scope captures anyone whose operations involve collection or processing of personal information pertaining to Kenyan residents. For instance, any person running an app that collects p

Real Time Gross Settlement System (RTGS)KEPSS is Kenya’s Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) System and went live on July 29th 2005. It is wholly owned and managed by the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK).An RTGS system is defined as a gross settlement system in which both processing and final settlement of funds transfer instructions take place continuously (i.e. in real time) from one bank to another. How Do We regulate Payment systems?¨ Firm establishment of the rule of law. The payment system law should be manifest at the highest hierarchy level of the rules of a particular country. If in a country’s legal system a statute has greater force and effect than a regulation or an administrative order, the law governing funds transfers should take the form of a statute. This should protect the system against political and bureaucratic meddling Accountability of the institutions involved in funds transfers. The institutions involved in funds transfers should be held accountable for their own behavior. The utmo st importance must be accorded to the rule of law, not to relationships among parties and between parties and the government. In this regard, the direct participation of the central bank in the payment system should not be overemphasized. Private sector action and responsibility ought to be encouraged. Integration with other bodies of law. The payment system law must be part of the broad commercial and bankruptcy framework. Accordingly, the rules, concepts, and incentives created

Chapter One Sources of Law in Kenya 1.1 What is Law? The world of commerce and industry is founded on distinct pillars of social order. The establishment and regulation of the various institutions of society depend upon frameworks of rules to which they owe their existence and from which they draw their power and legitimacy. These rules are promulgated and enforced in accordance with a defined legal system. As has been rightly observed, “[i]n order to ensure good order and the smooth running of society, it is necessary to formulate general rules which work well enough in the majority of cases.”1 Accordingly, there is need in every society to promulgate normative rules, principles and doctrines to regulate social order. Such rules and principles must be effectively binding in the sense that derogation from them, or breach thereof, attracts penal or other remedial consequences. The assemblage of these doctrines, principles, rules, and regulations, may, in very loose terms, be collectively referred to as law. Glanville Williams defines law as “… the body of principles recognized and applied by the state in the administration of justice …” According to him, it consists of “… the rules recognized and acted on by courts of justice.”2 In this sense, law includes all rules of conduct enacted by Parliament or established by court decisions in conformity with fundamental principles and doctrines recognized as essential for the administration of justice. Their binding nature demands tha

FINTECH REGULATION IN KENYA Introduction According to the Economic Survey Report of 2022[1], the value of output from the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) Sector rose by 6.9% from USD 4.03 billion in 2020 to USD 4.31 billion in 2021. Mobile money subscribers increased by 8.5% to 35.2 million in 2021 and the value of mobile commerce transactions increased by 63.2% to USD 116.4 billion in the same period. Essentially, the total mobile money transfers grew by 31.7% to USD 52.5 billion, a growth which is attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic. Within this period the Kenyan Government encouraged use of mobile money platforms with an aim to curb the spread of the virus through handling of cash. Financial technology (‘Fintech’) refers to the integration of technology by firms in delivering financial services to customers. Fintech is a rapidly growing industry in the East Africa region steered by a unique blend of mobile adoption, technology innovations and investor interests.[2] Some of the major Fintech activities carried out in Kenya include mobile payments, digital lending, asset and wealth management, insurance, and money remittance operations. The Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) is the primary regulator, responsible for ensuring that all financial institutions operate within the set standards. However, the dynamic nature of the Fintech industry and its overlap across different sectors, leads to a multiplicity in the regulatory framework. There are however sector-specific

Rationale for requirement Licenses serve as assurance that the Regulator has approved the DCP as a credible entity to conduct the digital credit business after fulfilling all requirements. Licensing requirement ensures that only those who are fit &amp; proper to provide credit are given the go ahead to do so. The requirement for licensing is aimed at protecting consumers from DCPs that have not been licensed. Licensed DCPs are regulated and it is assumed that they will comply with the law. This will ensure the safety &amp; safeguarding of interests of consumers. Requirement for consumer protectionReg 26- DCP shall ensure that any advertisement that it publishes does not include any false, misleading or deceptive representation &amp; this includes: (a) a representation that the provision of the credit has an approval, benefits or qualities that it does not in fact have; (b) a representation that the DCP has an approval, status, affiliation or connection that it does not in fact have; (c) an inaccurate or incomplete representation as to the interest rate, costs or charges payable under a digital credit facility.Reg 27- DCP shall not increase charges or limits or have a provision in the credit agreement that purports to vary credit terms without the customer’s consent.

CENTRAL BANK DIGITAL CURRENCY (CBDC)CDBC is a complex piece of software and a complex digital framework capable of delivering both benefits and shocks across the economy. Money and payments have evolved continuously throughout history. Our wallets are progressively being replaced by smartphones and other electronic gadgets in our pockets. These shifts have far- reaching implications for the nature of money, raising the question whether central banks should issue digital currencies for consumer usage.The financial sector and payments industry has gradually and consistently evolved nationally and globally. This was also fast tracked by the COVID-19 pandemic which changed the way payments are made to a more digital mode. This has led to the emergence of digital currencies which have facilitated payment transactions. Such digital currencies include: Cryptocurrency, Stable Coin, Electronic Money and Central Bank Digital Currency.

OVERVIEW OF THE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK IN FINANCIAL SERVICES SECTOR a) Central Bank of Kenya The Central Bank of Kenya was established in 1966 through an Act of Parliament – the Central Bank of Kenya Act of 1966. The establishment of the Bank was a direct result of the desire among the three East African states to have independent monetary and financial policies. The Central Bank of Kenya Act of 1966 set out objectives and functions and gave the Central Bank limited autonomy. Since the amendment of the Central Bank of Kenya Act in April 1997, the Central Bank operations have been restructured to conform with ongoing economic reforms. There is now greater monetary autonomy. The Mandate of the Central Bank Section 4 of the Central Bank of Kenya Act states the core mandate of the Bank as follows: The principal object of the Bank shall be to formulate and implement monetary policy directed to achieving and maintaining stability in the general level of prices; The Bank shall foster the liquidity, solvency and proper functioning of a stable market- based financial system; and Subject to (1) and (2), the Bank shall support the economic policy of the Government, including its objectives for growth and employment. b) Capital Markets Authority The Capital Market is part of the Financial Market that provides funds for long term development. This is a market that brings together lenders(Investors) of capital and Borrowers(companies that sell securities to the public) of capital. In Novembe

Regulated vs Unregulated Products, & Cytonn Weekly #25/2021 Focus of the Week Following ongoing discussions in the financial markets around regulated and unregulated offers, a member of parliament recently requested the Chairperson of the Department Committee on Finance and Planning to issue a statement on unregulated / private offers. Therefore, in this week’s topical, our Research Team seeks to build on a previous focus on the same topic covered in 2020 and educate the general public about these two types of markets/investment categories, which are complementary and important to well-functioning financial markets. As such, we shall discuss the following: i. Introduction to Regulated and Unregulated markets, ii. Regulated and Unregulated Investment Categories, iii. Pros and Cons of Each Investment Category, iv. Issues to Consider for Each Category, v. Myths About Each Category, and, vi. Conclusion. Section I: Introduction to Regulated and Unregulated Investment markets Investment markets from a regulatory point of view can be divided into two large categories, regulated and unregulated markets. Regulated markets, often referred to as public markets are controlled by a regulatory body whose key mandate is to protect the public interest. The products in the public markets tend to be standardized and easily accessible to the public. Common examples of regulated products include shares purchased at the securities exchange, Fixed Deposits offered by Banks, Collective Investment S

DIGITAL/ MOBILE LENDING Modern day lending is moving towards digital lending and away from Banks with emergence of mobile financial services. Digital technology is transforming the consumer loan industry by providing borrowers with greater simplicity, efficiency, and transparency. The lending process refers to the sequence of activities an FSP (Financial Service Provider) performs to provide credit from acquiring and onboarding a customer, evaluating the customer and disbursing the loan, receiving repayments and following up on past-due loans. Throughout the lending process, the FSP builds customer engagement and loyalty through high-touch interactions that adapt to client needs and preferences. The FSP’s lending involves the digital channels for acquisition, disbursement, repayment, and engagement and by leveraging digitized data and advanced algorithms for credit decisions, collections, and customer engagement. Digital lenders use digital data from different business functions and build the Data Bank to make quicker, automated, and more accurate underwriting decisions using both conventional and alternative data sources and advanced algorithms and analytics to quickly and remotely ‘score’ potential clients and make credit decisions.

THE BANK CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIP AND NEGOTIABLE INSTRUMENTS A LECTURE PRESENTED AT THE KENYA SCHOOL OF LAW DANSON KIRITU, ADVOCATE LEGAL MANAGER, HEAD OFFICE & INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS KCB BANK KENYA LIMITED What is a 'Bank' A bank is a financial institution licensed to receive deposits and issue financial facilities including loans, guarantees and letters of credit. Banks may also provide financial services, such as wealth management, currency exchange and safe deposit boxes. There are two types of banks: commercial/retail banks and investment banks. In this country, banks are regulated by the central bank. Commercial banks are typically concerned with managing withdrawals and receiving deposits as well as supplying short-term loans to individuals and small businesses. Consumers primarily use these banks for basic checking and savings accounts, certificates of deposit (CDs) and home mortgages. Examples of commercial banks include KCB Bank, Barclays Bank of Kenya and Cooperative Bank Investment banks focus on providing corporate clients with services such as underwriting and assisting with merger and acquisition (M&A) activity. KCB Capital, Dyer and Blair, Kingdom Securities are examples of investment banks. Central banks are chiefly responsible for currency stability, controlling inflation and monetary policy and overseeing money supply. According to the Blacks Law Dictionary, a bank is defined as “A quasi public institution, for the custody and loan of money, the exchange and t

L. Rev. 521 (2013), http://scholarship.law.wm.edu/wmblr/vol4/iss2/5 Copyright c 2013 by the authors. This article is brought to you by the William & Mary Law School Scholarship Repository. http://scholarship.law.wm.edu/wmblr THE BUSINESS JUDGMENT RULE AS AN IMMUNITY DOCTRINE LORI MCMILLAN* ABSTRACT The business judgment rule is a judicially created doctrine that protects directors from personal civil liability for the decisions they make on behalf of a corporation. In today’s era of corporate scandals, global financial meltdowns, and directorial malfeasance, it has become especially important in setting the bar for when directors are appropriately responsible to shareholders for their actions. Traditionally the business judgment rule has been regarded as a standard of liability, although it has never really been explored or enunciated as such. This view determines eligibility for business judgment rule protection of a directorial decision after an examination of certain preconditions. An alternate view has developed that posits the business judgment rule is actually an abstention doctrine, and should be applied automatically absent the establishment of the same preconditions as the liability standard approach, only to be used as nullifying factor

PRESS RELEASE ENACTMENT OF THE LAW TO REGULATE DIGITAL LENDERS AND ISSUANCE OF THE CORRESPONDING DRAFT REGULATIONS FOR PUBLIC COMMENT Following Presidential assent on December 7, 2021, the Central Bank of Kenya (Amendment) Act, 2021, has become effective today, December 23, 2021. The Amendment provides the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) with the powers to license and oversight the previously unregulated digital credit providers. This is a significant milestone. Correspondingly, CBK announces the issuance of draft Digital Credit Providers Regulations and invites public comments. With the recent advances in technology and ongoing innovations, lending through digital channels, particularly mobile phones, has grown significantly in Kenya. However, concerns have been raised by the public about the predatory practices of the unregulated digital credit providers, and in particular, their high cost, unethical debt collection practices, and the abuse of personal information. The Amendment requires CBK to publish Regulations within three months, i.e., by March 23, 2022, and accordingly CBK has developed the draft Regulations for public consultation. The Regulations provide for inter alia the licensing, governance, and credit operations of Digital Credit Providers (DCPs). They further provide for consumer protection, credit information sharing, and elaborate on the Anti-Money Laundering and Combating the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) obligations of DCPs.

Registered company is liable for torts and crimes committed by its servants and agents and the company is distinct and separate from its founders/members. Section 2 (1) of the Companies Act Cap 486 Laws of Kenya states what company means as 'a company formed and registered under this Act or an existing company. This is a very vague definition, in the statute the word company is not a legal term hence the vagueness of the definition. The legal attributes of the word company will depend upon a particular legal system.

COMMERCIAL TRANSACTIONS PAST PAPERS PAST PAPER: DECEMBER 2016 1. Charles seeks your advice on the following matters: a. How can Ellen be removed from her position as director and what steps might she take to resist the removal or to assert her rights? Removal of Directors:              Section 139(1), CA 2015: a company may, by ordinary resolution at a meeting, remove a director before the expiration of his period of office, notwithstanding anything in any agreement between it and him This section can also be used to remove multiple directors The words ‘at a meeting’ indicate that the written resolution procedure cannot be used While the power granted to members under this section appears extremely substantial, Section 139(6)(a) mitigates its usefulness by stating that removal does not deprive a director of compensation payable as a result of the removal  if the directors’ remuneration is substantial or his service contract lengthy, this compensation may be extremely high In addition, Section 139 should not be construed as derogating from any power to remove a director that exists outside the section, e.g. the articles may contain a provision allowing removal of a Board member via a Board resolution, and the advantage of using a separate Board power is that it will not be subject to the procedural requirements of Section 139 Notice of Meetings: Section 284, CA 2015: resolutions passed at a general meeting are only valid if adequate notice of the meeting is provi

Table of Contents INTRODUCTION 1 Background to the Study 1 Conceptual Framework 2 Consumer 2 Financial Services Sector 3 Consumer Protection 4 LEGAL FRAMEWORK FOR CONSUMER PROTECTION IN KENYA 7 The Constitution 7 The Consumer Protection Act 7 Sector-Specific Legislations 8 The Central Bank of Kenya Act 8 The Banking Act 10 The Insurance Act 13 The Capital Markets Act 15 The Retirement Benefits Act 17 3.0 RECOMMENDATIONS 19 INTRODUCTION Consumer protection is about ensuring fair exchange between goods and service providers on the one hand and consumers on the other hand. A deliberate legal framework is necessary to counter-balance the inherent disadvantage of a consumer vis-a-vis the power, information and resources of their goods and service providers. As a result, reforms in the financial sector regulations center on the concept of consumer protection.3 From the onset, the Kenya 2010 Constitution entrenches the right to consumer protection, that is, consumers should be protected from unfair market practices from services and goods providers.4 This constitutional entrenchment

Data Protection Act In Kenya The Data Protection Act No. 24 of2019 (the Act or DPA hereinafter) which was enacted on 8th November 2019 has a commencement date of 25th November 2019. Its preamble states that it is meant to give effect to Article 31 (c) and (d) of the Constitution. These provisions guarantee that every person has the right to privacy, including not to have information relating to their family or private affairs unnecessarily required or revealed and not to have the privacy of their communications infringed. The Act is a clean-up of several bills that were introduced previously then withdrawn for one reason or the other. The new law comes against the backdrop of the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulations (EUGDPR). Most companies operating in Kenya were still grappling with compliance. Notably, the provisions of the Act mimic those of the EUGDPR and therefore companies that had taken steps towards compliance with EUGDPR will be a step ahead. Who is affected by the Data Protection Act? The Act limits its scope to data controllers or processors who are established and ordinarily reside in Kenya and process personal data of natural persons while in Kenya OR If they are not established or resident in Kenya, they process personal data of data subjects located in Kenya. This scope captures anyone whose operations involve collection or processing of personal information pertaining to Kenyan residents. For instance, any person running an app that collects p

FINANCIAL SERVICES REGULATION IN KENYA. Introduction The financial services sector in Kenya has historically evolved since pre independence. Through the years, the sector has been regulated by the government, although at different spheres, both directly and indirectly. From the onset of establishment of financial services sector, some of the sub sectors were self regulated. However, with penetration and increase of financial services there has been continued demand for efficient regulation.157 This has created a mix of both self regulation and government regulation.158 The different sub sectors have experienced different paces for development and regulation. With the growth of the Kenyan economy, and the palpable need for proper regulation of the sector, the Ministry of Finance has played the oversight role. However, with subsequent development, the regulatory framework developed from the different departments to having independent regulators for each sub sector.159 This chapter discusses the financial services sector regulatory framework. The chapter chronicles the history of regulation of the financial services sector and illuminates the current regulatory framework. It also analyzes the challenges thataffect regulation, which appear to have been the catalyst for the clamor for an integrated History of financial services sector regulation The different sub sectors of the financial sector have had different paces of regulation, which are discussed below.

Structure of Kenya’s Financial SectorAPRIL 2023 The financial market deals with the purchase and sale of money. It therefore involves obtaining money from those who have more than they need by attracting it either as:deposits through commercial banks;premiums through insurance companies;units or shares through Mutual Fundsor shares or bonds through investment banks.The money drawn from the savers is then pooled and allocated throughout the economy by giving it out as loans, common or corporate bonds, treasury bills inter alia. The financial market in Kenya can be said to have two major functions:it allocates money capital through identifying those with surplus funds, attracting the funds into a pool and then distributing them to those who need to spend more than they have.The other function of the financial market is the distribution of the economic risk through the creation and distribution of securities. Principally, financial market in Kenya comprise:commercial banks,non-bank financial institutions,mortgage companies,forex bureaus,development finance institutions,pension schemes,SACCOsthe insurance sector and the stock market.

SETTING UP OF A TRUST IN KENYA A trust is a legal arrangement through which property is held by a third-party for the benefit of another party, called the beneficiary. The person who creates the trust is the “settlor." The settlor must transfer her property to the trust, which is then handled and administered by the trustee, or administrator, although the settlor may reserve specific powers to herself with respect to the trust. A trust deed is the document that details the trust's terms and conditions and lists the parties involved. In a trust deed, the settlor is simply the creator of the trust. Registration of a charitable trust or a foundation in Kenya generally requires the following: 1. Name of the Trust or Foundation 2. Main Object of the Trust. Charitable trust must fall in at least one of the following categories:  Relief of poverty e.g. homes & orphanages, hospitals  Advancement of education  Advancement of religion  Advancement of Health or saving of lives  Advancement of environmental protection or improvement  Trusts beneficial to the community not falling under the preceding heads e.g. advancing art, culture, racial harmony. 3. Name of the Settlor/ Donor  Full name, copy of ID card/passport ; If company, a copy of the certificate of registration  Address  Domicile and residence 4. Beneficiaries: This could be a class of persons in the society e.g. bright needy children; orphans between 0-10 years or an orphanage, cancer patients, women etc. There is also

GUARANTEES A contract of guarantee, is defined as “A contract to perform the promise, or discharge the liability of a third person in case of his defaults”. Example: A advances a loan of ksH.10,000 to B, and C promises A that if B does not repay the loan, I will repay it. This is a contract of guarantee. It involves three parties namely, 1. Surety, who gives the guarantee. 2. Principal Debtor, in respect of whose default the guarantee is given. 3. Creditor, to whom the guarantee is given. Example: A supplies goods to B on C’s guaranteeing payment by B to A. This means that if B does not pay, C would be liable to pay. This is a “Contract of Guarantee”. Here B is the principal debtor, C is the surety and A is the creditor. A guarantee may be either “oral” or “written“. Just like any other contract, it should also fulfill all the essentials of a valid contract. As stated already, three parties are involved in a contract of guarantee. At the same time, there are three collateral contracts also namely, 1. As between A and B [A supplies goods to B on credit who promises that he would pay]. 2. As between A and C [C gives guarantee the price of goods, I will pay]. 3. As between C and B [C indemnifies A in case of B’s default in paying the amount to A). Essentials of a Contract of Guarantee 1. Concurrence of All the Parties All the three parties namely, the principal debtor, the creditor and the surety must agree to make such a contract. 2.

SHARE AGREEMENT Definition A shareholders’ agreement is essentially a corporate pre-nuptial agreement. A shareholders’ agreement is, as you might expect, an agreement between the shareholders of a company. It can be between all or, in some cases, only some of the shareholders (like, for instance, the holders of a particular class of share). Its purpose is to protect the shareholders’ investment in the company, to establish a fair relationship between the shareholders and govern how the company is run. The agreement will:  set out the shareholders’ rights and obligations;  regulate the sale of shares in the company;  describe how the company is going to be run;  provide an element of protection for minority shareholders and the company; and  define how important decisions are to be made. Usually, it is best to put a shareholders’ agreement in place when the company is formed and issue the first shares. In fact, it can be a positive exercise to ensure there is common understanding of shareholders’ expectations of the business. At that point, the shareholders should, as far as is possible, be of a similar mind about what they expect to offer and get from the company. Indeed if the differences of opinion between the investors at this stage are too strong to form a shareholders’ agreement, it is likely to ring warning bells about the nature of their future working relationship. The investors may choose to defer discussing a shareholders’ agreement in order to get on with the

The distributor contracts both with the supplier and with its customer.Title to the products in question will pass to and from the distributor. the duties owed by the principal and agent to each other are replaced by mutual contractual rights and obligations within the distribution agreement.Less control by supplier, more risk assumed by distributor. AGENCY VS DISTRIBUTIONAGENCYAn agent is appointed by the principal to negotiate and possibly conclude contracts with customers on the principal's behalf. Agents are paid commission on the sales they make, usually on a percentage basis. The only contract for sale of the products is made between the principal and the customer. The agent generally has no contractual liability to the customer. Types of Distribution ArrangementsExclusive DistributionSupplier agrees to sell the contract products only to the distributor within a certain defined territory, and agrees not to appoint other distributors or sell the products directly to other customers within the territory.Sole Distribution Supplier appoints a distributor as its only or sole distributor within a territory, but the supplier reserves the right to supply the products directly to end users.

University of London Press Ltd v University Tutorial Press Ltd [1916] 2 Ch 601 Court: Chancery Division Judges: Peterson J Date decided: 26 July 1916 Examiners were hired to create exam scripts for the University of London. Peterson J held that the papers were original literary works: Assuming that they are ``literary work'’, the question then is whether they are original. The word ``original'’ does not in this connection mean that the work must be the expression of original or inventive thought. Copyright Acts are not concerned with the originality of ideas, but with the expression of thought, and, in the case of ``literary work'’, with the expression of thought in print or writing. The originality which is required relates to the expression of the thought. But the Act does not require that the expression must be in an original or novel form, but that the work must not be copied from another work — that it should originate from the author. In the present case it was not suggested that any of the papers were copied. Professor Lodge and Mr Jackson proved that they had thought out the questions which they set, and that they made notes or memoranda for future questions and drew on those notes for the purposes of the questions which they set. The papers which they prepared originated from themselves, and were, within the meaning of the Act, original. It was said, however, that they drew upon the stock of knowledge common to mathematicians, and that the time spent in producing the

NEGOTIABLE INSTRUMENTS INTRODUCTION There are certain documents, which are freely used in commercial transactions and monetary dealings. These documents, if they satisfy certain conditions, are known as negotiable instruments. ‘Negotiable’ is a word to mean transferable from one person to another in return for consideration. ‘Instrument’ means a written document by which right is created in favor of some person. The law relating to negotiable instrument is contained in the Bill of Exchange Act (Cap. 27) and the Cheque Act (Cap 41), which deals with promissory notes, bills of exchange and cheques. As per the Act, no definition is given. However, in simple, a negotiable instrument can be described as a commercial document which represents money. It passes to a bonafide transferee free from any defect. Therefore a negotiable instrument refers to a document, which entitles a person to a sum of money or money value which is transferable from one person to another by mere delivery or by endorsement and delivery. NATURE OF NEGOTIABLE INSTRUMENTS A negotiable instrument is a Chose in Action. A chose in action is a property right which cannot be enjoyed by physical possession, but which can only be enforced by legal action, for Example a debt, patent or copyright etc. Most types of chose in action are assignable but; 1. Notice to the debtor is always advisable and sometimes essential; and 2. The assignee can obtain no better rights than the assignor. 3. However, out of customary usage

THE BANK CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIP AND NEGOTIABLE INSTRUMENTS A LECTURE PRESENTED AT THE KENYA SCHOOL OF LAW DANSON KIRITU, ADVOCATE LEGAL MANAGER, HEAD OFFICE & INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS KCB BANK KENYA LIMITED What is a 'Bank' A bank is a financial institution licensed to receive deposits and issue financial facilities including loans, guarantees and letters of credit. Banks may also provide financial services, such as wealth management, currency exchange and safe deposit boxes. There are two types of banks: commercial/retail banks and investment banks. In this country, banks are regulated by the central bank. Commercial banks are typically concerned with managing withdrawals and receiving deposits as well as supplying short-term loans to individuals and small businesses. Consumers primarily use these banks for basic checking and savings accounts, certificates of deposit (CDs) and home mortgages. Examples of commercial banks include KCB Bank, Barclays Bank of Kenya and Cooperative Bank Investment banks focus on providing corporate clients with services such as underwriting and assisting with merger and acquisition (M&A) activity. KCB Capital, Dyer and Blair, Kingdom Securities are examples of investment banks. Central banks are chiefly responsible for currency stability, controlling inflation and monetary policy and overseeing money supply. According to the Blacks Law Dictionary, a bank is defined as “A quasi public institution, for the custody and loan of money, the exchange and t

Forgery is the production of a replica to as close as possible to the actual object with the intention of deceiving people into accepting it as the original. Sec 345 of the Penal Code cap 63 defines forgery as the making of a false document with intent to defraud or to deceive Where the forgery consists of the drawer's signature and the banker pays such a cheque, he cannot normally debit his customer's account with the amount so paid out as he has not in actual fact received his customer's mandate to do so. Where the acceptor’s signature is forged, he incurs no liability, but all other persons whose signature are genuine are liable to the holder. Hence, the customer's signature on the cheque must be the same as the specimen. If it differs, the cheque should be returned "Drawer's signature differs". However, if the customer on discovering the forgery remains silent about it for an unreasonable time by the end of which the banker's ability to recover such payment becomes adversely affected, he is precluded from setting up the forgery and may have to suffer the loss himself: see Greenwood v. Martins Bank Ltd (1933). Similarly, In Kenya industrial Research and Development Institute v. National Bank of Kenya Civil Case No. 225 of 1995, it was held that a cheque on which a drawer’s signature is forged is a mere paper and is not a cheque at all unless it becomes valid by estoppel. An unauthorized signature is one not amounting to a forgery but one placed on an instrument by an agent

MATERIAL ALTERATION IN THE BILL OF EXCHANGE By Sharon K The following alterations will not vitiate an instrument: (i) An alteration, which, though made in a material part, was made before the instrument was issued. (ii) An alteration made for the purpose of correcting a mistake, such as the correction of mistake in respect of date on a bill e.g. if the date is wrongly written i.e 13/09/2006 instead of 13/09/2016.Material alteration cont.. Non-Apparent alteration / Clever alteration The holder is given further rights. Not only can he hold D and E liable for the full $80 as before but he can also hold A, B, &amp; X liable for $ 8 (original tenor) Therefore, B would claim his $ 80 from E and E similarly from D. D would be able to claim $ 80 from C if he could be found, but failing that $8 from A,B,X, thereby losing $72 by C’s authorized alteration.Material alteration cont.. Apparent alteration F will look at C and subsequent endorsers, D and E for the $80 he gave for the bill. But he has no rights to against those parties who did not make, assent to or authorize the alteration.Material alteration cont.. SCENARIO A draws a bill for $8 payable to B. It is accepted by X, and B negotiates it by special endorsement to C. C alters the Bill to $80 and persuades D to give him $80 for it. The Bill by special endorsements passes from D to E then to F. F presents it for payments on the due date but X refuses payment because of the alteration. What is the position of F?Material alteration c

By Gordon Drakes and Tim Rickard | 12 Mar 2018 In February this year, the press in the UK took a break from Brexit for a few days and led with a story about KFC's supply chain crisis, which saw almost two thirds of its 900 + stores in the UK close due to a lack of chickens. The majority of these stores are franchised and the resulting loss of revenue and negative PR could not have come at a worse time given the current pressures that all businesses in this sector are facing. The story helps shine a light on the importance of supply chain management and also how the different parties which rely on it need to protect themselves from a contractual and legal point of view. Who "fowled" up? The root cause of the closures appears to have been operational issues under a new chicken supply contract between KFC and DHL. In November 2016, Yum Brands-owned KFC revamped its supply chain in the UK by ending its relationship with delivery company Bidvest and entering into a three-way partnership with DHL and Quick Service Logistics (QSL). Whilst it is not thought that trying to stuff chickens into brown jiffy bags was the issue(!), it has been reported that DHL only uses a single depot from which to deliver all of the KFC ingredients to its stores across the UK, and deliveries were compromised by a new and malfunctioning IT system. Poor planning and risk/contingency mitigation also exacerbated the problems. What can franchisors learn from this? In most franchise supply chains, the franchis

Intellectual Property Collateralisation in the Age of the Movable Property Security Rights Act: The Case of Nakumatt Supermarkets By Victor B. Nzomo & Perpetua N. Mwangi** Nakumatt Holdings Limited (Nakumatt) is the proprietor of the largest supermarket retail chain in East and Central Africa. According to Superbrands, Nakumatt is one of the leading brands in East Africa with branches in Kenya Uganda, Tanzania and Rwanda. However the biggest story of 2017 has been the financial woes of Nakumatt with the retail chain facing liquidation over unpaid debts totaling over Sh30 billion. From an intellectual property (IP) perspective, Nakumatt’s brand power is based on its portfolio of over 23 registered trade marks including word marks, logos and slogans all currently subsisting on the Register of Trade Marks. This blogpost departs from the premise that the recent enactment of the Movable Property Security Rights Act was envisaged to allow individuals or businesses like Nakumatt to leverage their IP assets to access much-needed financing. For over a three-decade period the Nakumatt brand has achieved a wealth of goodwill, consumer confidence and customer loyalty. Nakumatt introduced the first 24-hour retail store in the country and it has its own product brand Nakumatt Select/Blue Label. In addition, the retailer embraced innovation by introducing the Nakumatt Global Prepaid Card in partnership with MasterCard. Nakumatt is the official sponsor of Nakumatt FC, a local professional fo

Bowie Bonds: A Look at David Bowie's Innovative Estate Plan At the time of his tragic and unexpected (to the public, anyway) death, the iconic David Bowie had it all: family, fame, and fortune. Not so long ago, however, the artist found himself increasingly under pressure as financial obligations began to overcome a somewhat unpredictable music career. Eager to overcome his fiscal problems while retaining ultimate rights to his music, Bowie devised an ingenious plan that accomplished both goals, all while creating a lasting intellectual property dynasty that will benefit his surviving wife and children for years to come. Known as "Bowie Bonds", his innovative plan has transformed the transactional side of the music industry and helped to protect vulnerable artists from irrevocably signing away the rights to their creations during periods of financial uncertainty. The concept he pioneered has been embraced by elite artists and securities investors worldwide. Intellectual Property Bonds In 1997, amid growing concerns of physical and financial security, David Bowie met with a group of financial analysts to devise an investment vehicle that would both protect his artistic achievements and ensure regular income and protection from a somewhat volatile and unpredictable industry: show business. After meeting with several inventive financial professionals, Bowie opted to create an asset-backed security resting on the value of his pre-1990 portfolio of artistic works, which consisted

THE RECEIVER OFFICIAL PUBLICATION OF THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF FEDERAL EQUITY RECEIVERS This article originally appeared in the April 2019 | Issue 8 release. For more information about NAFER, visit www.NAFER.org The Legacy Of Twyne’s Case By Daniel Seligman W e know the facts only from court records. One day, a sheriff showed up on the property of a farmer name Pierce. The sheriff had a mission: he had a writ of execution (a court order) that gave him the right to take Pierce’s sheep to satisfy a debt that Pierce owed to someone called “C.”1 And that is when the trouble started. Pierce insisted that he didn’t have the sheep anymore. They now belonged to Twyne, to whom Pierce also owed money. Yes, Pierce’s mark was on the sheep and he had recently sheared some of them and even sold others. From the records we can infer that Pierce and Twyne were neighbors and perhaps friends, and that Pierce didn’t mind repaying Twyne, but he objected to paying anything (sheep or money) to C. Pierce had apparently heard in advance of the sheriff ’s visit and had given everything he owned – his sheep, clothes and other personal possessions – by deed to Twyne.2 As a result, there was nothing for the sheriff to recover. All of Pierce’s property was beyond the sheriff ’s reach, thus depriving C of any repayment. What happened next is somewhat unclear but Twyne and his friends (perhaps Pierce) physically resisted the sheriff “with force.” Getting in an altercation with the sheriff – then or now –

Secured Transactions: The Power of Collateral HEYWOOD FLEISIG In many developing countries, businesses are unable to get low-cost, long-term loans from private lenders to finance investment projects. Reforms that make it easier for borrowers to use movable property as collateral would give comfort to lenders, stimulate investment, and boost productivity and growth. T HE FIRST question any private lender asks is, “How do I get my money back?” Given the risks involved in lending—borrowers may be unlucky, unwise, or dishonest— what conditions give comfort to lenders? Two basic loan transactions have evolved in private markets: unsecured and secured. When a borrower offers an unsecured promise to pay, the lender must rely on the borrower’s reputation, or trust that the borrower will pay back the loan in order to have access to future loans. In secured transactions, promises to repay are backed by collateral that lenders can seize and sell in the event loan payments are not made as agreed. Collateral may be real estate or personal property—tangible personal property such as inventory, equipment, livestock, and tractors; or intangible personal property such as unsecured accounts owed to merchants (accounts receivable) and secured agreements (chattel paper). Secured transactions have advantages for borrowers and lenders alike— transaction costs are lower and lenders do not need to gather as much information about borrowers. The issue of collateral is one of great economic importance

Adukia B.Com (Hons.), FCA, ACS, AICWA, LL.B, M.B.A, Dip In IFRS (UK), Dip In LL & LW Mobile: 098200 61049 Email: rajkumarfca@gmail.com Wesite: www.carajkumarradukia.com Address: 1/3, Meridien Apartments, Veera Desai Road, Andheri (West), Mumbai-400058. 1 PREFACE From the moment we wake up to the moment we go to sleep our life is governed by the set of expectations we have as a result of the explicit and implicit agreements between us and others. In fact, agreement can be defined as a meeting of minds with the understanding and acceptance of reciprocal legal rights and duties as to particular actions or obligations, which the parties intend to exchange or a mutual assent to do or refrain from doing something. It is important to understand that if we enter into agreements with commercial organizations we will have important obligations to fulfil in return for any rewards that we might receive. So before any commercial agreement is finally signed all parties should invest considerable time and effort in the process which can take many months. This book’s extensive coverage of most of the types of business agreements that we are likely to encounter in the commercial sphere enables the readers to understand the mode of drafting agreements and contracts in a simple and understandable manner. We shall appreciate further questions from our readers and all concerned on various issues so that they can be inclu

--- CONTENT EXCERPT ---
The Key Elements of Insurance Contracts Offer and Acceptance An insurance contract begins with an application. You work with an agent or broker and provide the necessary information via their application form. If your offer meets the insurance company’s criteria, the company may accept it. You might have to pay your first premium before they will accept it, as is the case when you apply for property or liability insurance. Most of the time, the insurance agent can accept the offer for the company they represent. They issue a temporary contract, or binder, which activates your coverage immediately. After the company reviews your application, they issue a formal, detailed policy. If an agent cannot bind the insurance company, your application goes to the insurance company and you do not have coverage until acceptance. This might require making your first payment of your premium, such as when you apply for life insurance. Some companies also require a medical examination and will only activate coverage on the date you pass the exam. Legal Consideration Consideration is the agreed value between you and your insurance company. For you, it means you agree to abide by the contract and pay premiums. For the insurance company, it means they’ll pay if you submit a claim for a covered loss. Competent Parties Only legally competent parties can enter into an insurance contract. This means you must be of legal age of majority, of sound mind, and not disqualified from the contract by law. T

Section 30 the period of effectiveness shall not exceed ten (10) years. Additionally, the Act also provides for the extension of the period of effectiveness upon expiry of the initial period of effectiveness for a further period not exceeding ten (10) years.Sec 35. (1) An error in the grantor identifier entered by the registrant in a notice renders the registration of the notice ineffective. However any other error does not render the notice ineffective unless it is a major error. However an error in the serial number of the serial numbered collateral renders the registration ineffective as against a buyer or lessee of that asset. The security rights over IP may be created by written agreement between the grantor and secured creditor.The lender takes ownership of the IP right and then licenses it to the borrower.The borrower retains ownership but simultaneously grants an interest of the IP to the lender.The revenue received from an intellectual property can be used by borrowers as security on a loan. However there still needs to be a proper legal framework for IP to successfully become an active security collateralNeed for an active IP exchange marketNeed for more IP valuation experts General Terms as per the MPSR 2017A Grantor means -a person that creates a security right to secureeither its own obligation or that of another person;a buyer or other transferee, lessee, or licensee of the collateral that acquires its rights subject to a security right; anda transferor in an ou

Bowie Bonds: A Look at David Bowie's Innovative Estate Plan At the time of his tragic and unexpected (to the public, anyway) death, the iconic David Bowie had it all: family, fame, and fortune. Not so long ago, however, the artist found himself increasingly under pressure as financial obligations began to overcome a somewhat unpredictable music career. Eager to overcome his fiscal problems while retaining ultimate rights to his music, Bowie devised an ingenious plan that accomplished both goals, all while creating a lasting intellectual property dynasty that will benefit his surviving wife and children for years to come. Known as "Bowie Bonds", his innovative plan has transformed the transactional side of the music industry and helped to protect vulnerable artists from irrevocably signing away the rights to their creations during periods of financial uncertainty. The concept he pioneered has been embraced by elite artists and securities investors worldwide. Intellectual Property Bonds In 1997, amid growing concerns of physical and financial security, David Bowie met with a group of financial analysts to devise an investment vehicle that would both protect his artistic achievements and ensure regular income and protection from a somewhat volatile and unpredictable industry: show business. After meeting with several inventive financial professionals, Bowie opted to create an asset-backed security resting on the value of his pre-1990 portfolio of artistic works, which consisted

THE RECEIVER OFFICIAL PUBLICATION OF THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF FEDERAL EQUITY RECEIVERS This article originally appeared in the April 2019 | Issue 8 release. For more information about NAFER, visit www.NAFER.org The Legacy Of Twyne’s Case By Daniel Seligman W e know the facts only from court records. One day, a sheriff showed up on the property of a farmer name Pierce. The sheriff had a mission: he had a writ of execution (a court order) that gave him the right to take Pierce’s sheep to satisfy a debt that Pierce owed to someone called “C.”1 And that is when the trouble started. Pierce insisted that he didn’t have the sheep anymore. They now belonged to Twyne, to whom Pierce also owed money. Yes, Pierce’s mark was on the sheep and he had recently sheared some of them and even sold others. From the records we can infer that Pierce and Twyne were neighbors and perhaps friends, and that Pierce didn’t mind repaying Twyne, but he objected to paying anything (sheep or money) to C. Pierce had apparently heard in advance of the sheriff ’s visit and had given everything he owned – his sheep, clothes and other personal possessions – by deed to Twyne.2 As a result, there was nothing for the sheriff to recover. All of Pierce’s property was beyond the sheriff ’s reach, thus depriving C of any repayment. What happened next is somewhat unclear but Twyne and his friends (perhaps Pierce) physically resisted the sheriff “with force.” Getting in an altercation with the sheriff – then or now –

Secured Transactions: The Power of Collateral HEYWOOD FLEISIG In many developing countries, businesses are unable to get low-cost, long-term loans from private lenders to finance investment projects. Reforms that make it easier for borrowers to use movable property as collateral would give comfort to lenders, stimulate investment, and boost productivity and growth. T HE FIRST question any private lender asks is, “How do I get my money back?” Given the risks involved in lending—borrowers may be unlucky, unwise, or dishonest— what conditions give comfort to lenders? Two basic loan transactions have evolved in private markets: unsecured and secured. When a borrower offers an unsecured promise to pay, the lender must rely on the borrower’s reputation, or trust that the borrower will pay back the loan in order to have access to future loans. In secured transactions, promises to repay are backed by collateral that lenders can seize and sell in the event loan payments are not made as agreed. Collateral may be real estate or personal property—tangible personal property such as inventory, equipment, livestock, and tractors; or intangible personal property such as unsecured accounts owed to merchants (accounts receivable) and secured agreements (chattel paper). Secured transactions have advantages for borrowers and lenders alike— transaction costs are lower and lenders do not need to gather as much information about borrowers. The issue of collateral is one of great economic importance

Instances of violation of Article 47Failure to comply with the lawTetrapak Limited –vs- Commissioner of Customs ServicesThe Commissioner did not render a valid decision on an application for review as required under Section 229 of EACCMA, 2004. A valid decision was not rendered within thirty (30) days.The Court held, “Non compliance with the statutory procedures set out in the Act taints what would have an otherwise lawful decision with illegality and procedural impropriety which automatically invites this courts intervention by way of judicial review.” Mobile Planet Limited vs. Kenya Revenue Authority“The right of the KRA to exercise its statutory mandate in correction of taxes must be protected as the importance of tax cannot be gainsaid. However, the same must be squared within the tenets of due process which encompass the right to receive notice prior to enforcement and the right of the subject to invoke appeal or review processes………… Under section 83 (3) (b) where the Commissioner refuses to amend the assessment, he shall cause a notice confirming the assessment to be served on the person to enable the person lodge an appeal under Section 86 of the Act as the case may be. I find and hold that for purposes of Section 83 (3) (b), the letter dated 13th November 2012 constituted a notice as it clearly communicated the decision disallowing the objection by reference to the Notice of Objection filed, confirming that the assessment that had been issued under Section 78 of the A

Denied: Uber's request to skip to UK Supreme Court to appeal workers' rights Claimant: We've beaten Uber twice, prepared to do it again By Rebecca Hill 5 Dec 2017 at 12:22 37 SHARE ▼ Uber’s request to leapfrog the Court of Appeals and go straight to the UK Supreme Court in its bid to appeal a decision on workers’ rights, has been knocked back. The private taxi app biz had wanted to skip the Court of Appeals and have its case heard in front of the higher court, but its application has been denied. It’s the latest set-back in the taxi hailing biz’s attempts to appeal a 2016 decision in which the Central London Employment Tribunal ruled that two drivers – James Farrar and Yaseen Aslam – were Uber staff and so entitled to holiday pay, paid rest breaks and the minimum wage. The firm appealed the decision, but lost that case last month at the Employment Appeal Tribunal, after which it applied to have its appeal heard at the Supreme Court. "Now that Uber has been denied permission to go straight to the Supreme Court, they should take this opportunity to work with their drivers instead of fighting them at every stage," Aslam said of the decisions. "We've already beaten Uber twice and are prepared to do so again in the Court of Appeal." Jason Moyer-Lee, general secretary of the Independent Workers Union of Great Britain, which is backing Farrar and Aslam's case, said the latest decision was "another blow to Uber's legal strategy behind denying workers their rights". He added: "The IWG

Equity financingThis is the process of raising capital through the sale of shares in an enterprise. It is the sale of an ownership interest to raise funds for business purposes. This can be sale of equity toThe owners The publicPrivate placementAngel investors Venture capitalists. Equity investors get ownership in the company but do not have a guaranteed return. Retained earnings (when the company uses its own earning to finance projects) are also an equity investment. With retained earnings, the company takes money that could have been returned to shareholders and uses it to fund capital projects. An equity financing is accompanied by an offering of the memorandum or prospectus. (see Part 3 of the Sixth schedule)Such information includes the company's activities, details on its officers and directors, use of financing proceeds, risk factors, financial statements and so on. Commercial Paper This is the corporate equivalent of a Treasury bill. Commercial paper is issued by large companies to meet their short-term borrowing needs. A company’s ability to issue commercial paper is typically agreed with banks in advance. Unlike bonds, commercial papers are used for arrangements with a shorter maturity, usually less than 1 yearCommercial paper is zero coupon and issued at a discount to its par value.Mostly issued to raise short-term capital for upcoming expenses or to pay for expansions. Sometimes called revenue bonds because they may be expected to be paid for out of the proceeds

Secured Transactions: The Power of Collateral HEYWOOD FLEISIG In many developing countries, businesses are unable to get low-cost, long-term loans from private lenders to finance investment projects. Reforms that make it easier for borrowers to use movable property as collateral would give comfort to lenders, stimulate investment, and boost productivity and growth. T HE FIRST question any private lender asks is, “How do I get my money back?” Given the risks involved in lending—borrowers may be unlucky, unwise, or dishonest— what conditions give comfort to lenders? Two basic loan transactions have evolved in private markets: unsecured and secured. When a borrower offers an unsecured promise to pay, the lender must rely on the borrower’s reputation, or trust that the borrower will pay back the loan in order to have access to future loans. In secured transactions, promises to repay are backed by collateral that lenders can seize and sell in the event loan payments are not made as agreed. Collateral may be real estate or personal property—tangible personal property such as inventory, equipment, livestock, and tractors; or intangible personal property such as unsecured accounts owed to merchants (accounts receivable) and secured agreements (chattel paper). Secured transactions have advantages for borrowers and lenders alike— transaction costs are lower and lenders do not need to gather as much information about borrowers. The issue of collateral is one of great economic importance

By Gordon Drakes and Tim Rickard | 12 Mar 2018 In February this year, the press in the UK took a break from Brexit for a few days and led with a story about KFC's supply chain crisis, which saw almost two thirds of its 900 + stores in the UK close due to a lack of chickens. The majority of these stores are franchised and the resulting loss of revenue and negative PR could not have come at a worse time given the current pressures that all businesses in this sector are facing. The story helps shine a light on the importance of supply chain management and also how the different parties which rely on it need to protect themselves from a contractual and legal point of view. Who "fowled" up? The root cause of the closures appears to have been operational issues under a new chicken supply contract between KFC and DHL. In November 2016, Yum Brands-owned KFC revamped its supply chain in the UK by ending its relationship with delivery company Bidvest and entering into a three-way partnership with DHL and Quick Service Logistics (QSL). Whilst it is not thought that trying to stuff chickens into brown jiffy bags was the issue(!), it has been reported that DHL only uses a single depot from which to deliver all of the KFC ingredients to its stores across the UK, and deliveries were compromised by a new and malfunctioning IT system. Poor planning and risk/contingency mitigation also exacerbated the problems. What can franchisors learn from this? In most franchise supply chains, the franchis

International Commercial Law and Arbitration Conference International Commercial Dispute Resolution and the Place of Judicial Power Chief Justice Robert French AC 22 August 2013, Sydney It is an old saw that the more things change the more they remain the same. While it no doubt illuminates a truth about constants in life, it also has the ring of nonsense about it. No more so than in the areas of interest to this Conference. In the delivery of legal services and in dispute resolution things are changing at a fast pace and nowhere at a faster pace than in the field of global trade and commerce which increasingly interpenetrates domestic trade and commerce. Those changes and changes in resolution of commercial disputes challenge long-established perspectives. One of those perspectives concerns the place of the judicial powers of the Commonwealth and the States in the field of international commercial disputes, which are constitutionally within the jurisdiction of Australian courts to resolve. Reference to global trade and commerce conjures the ugly word 'globalisation'. That word, which has crawled out of its birthing cave in the dark landscapes of economics, has now acquired the status of a term of art in the social sciences. It is defined in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy as referring to: fundamental changes in the spatial and temporal contours of social existence, according to which the significance of space or territory undergoes shifts in the face of a no less dra
