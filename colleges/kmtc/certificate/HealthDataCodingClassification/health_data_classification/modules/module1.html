                    <p>Health data classification is a cornerstone of modern healthcare, essential for standardizing information about diseases, health conditions, and medical procedures. The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) and the International Classification of Procedures in Medicine (ICPM) are two key tools used worldwide for this purpose. This module will introduce you to these vital classification systems and their importance in health data management.</p>

                  <div class="content-block">
                    <p>The ICD is a globally recognized diagnostic tool used for epidemiology, health management, and clinical purposes. It provides a standardized way to classify diseases and health conditions, making it possible to monitor disease incidence, prevalence, and conduct quality and research. The ICD is used on many types of health and vital records including death certificates and health records. In addition to enabling the storage and retrieval of diagnostic information for clinical, epidemiological, and quality purposes, these records also provide the basis for the compilation of national mortality and morbidity statistics by WHO Member States.</p>

                <div class="content-block">
                  <p>The ICPM is a system designed to classify medical procedures. It includes a wide range of procedures for medical diagnosis, prevention, therapy, radiology, drugs, surgical, and laboratory applications. The ICPM provides a standardized approach to categorizing medical interventions and ensures the comparability of health data relating to medical procedures. Developed alongside the ICD, the ICPM facilitates a comprehensive approach to classifying medical encounters and their impact on patient care.</p>

                 <div class="content-block">
                    <p>The development of the ICD has involved numerous contributors over many years. Key figures who helped to form the basis for the current system include:</p>
                      <ul>
                        <li><strong>Fran√ßois Bossier de Lacroix:</strong> Credited with the first attempt to classify diseases systematically according to period, age, and presentation. His work was termed ‚ÄúNosologia methodica‚Äù.</li>
                        <li><strong>William Cullen:</strong> In the early 19th century, when disease classification became more common, Cullen published ‚ÄúSynopsis nosologiae methodicae,‚Äù emphasizing classification on an individual basis.</li>
                        <li><strong>John Graunt:</strong>  Began all practical purposes for the statistical study of disease. His work was in London at a period when the age of six years, indicated no records of age at death being available, but he estimated 36% mortality before that age.</li>
                       <li><strong>William Farr:</strong>  Farr worked to improve disease classification and to secure international uniformity. His work involved making the best possible use of imperfect disease classifications available at the time and he wrote principles that should be followed.</li>

           <section class="content-section">
                <h2>üìö History of the Development of ICPM</h2>
                 <div class="content-block">
                    <p>The development of ICPM was concurrent to the development of ICD-9.  The surgical procedures fascicle was originally created by the United States, based on its adaptations of ICD (called ICDA), which had procedure classifications since 1962. ICPM was published separately from the ICD disease classification as a series of supplementary documents called fascicles. Each fascicle contains a classification of modes of laboratory, radiology, surgery, therapy, and other diagnostic procedures. Many countries have adapted and translated the ICPM in parts or as a whole, and are using it with amendments since then.</p>
                    <p>The Heads of WHO Collaborating Centers for Classification of Diseases recognized that the process of consultation that had to be followed before finalization and publication was inappropriate in such a wide and rapidly advancing field.  They, therefore, recommended that there should be no revision of the ICPM in conjunction with the Tenth Revision of the ICD.</p>
                    <p>In 1987, the Expert Committee on the International Classification of Diseases asked WHO to consider updating at least the outline for surgical procedures. This resulted in a data tabulation list which could serve as a guide for the national publication of statistics on surgical procedures and could also facilitate inter-country comparisons. The list could also be used as a basis for the development of comparable national classifications of surgical procedures.</p>

                <h3>üí° Pro Tip</h3>
                <p>When studying these systems, it helps to keep in mind that both ICD and ICPM are dynamic. There are regular revisions based on changes in medical understanding and practices.</p>
