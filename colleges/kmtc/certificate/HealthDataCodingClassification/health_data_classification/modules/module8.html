                    <p>When recording cause of death, it's important to understand the following terms:</p>
                     <ul>
                        <li><strong>Immediate Cause of Death:</strong> The final disease, injury, or complication that directly resulted in death.</li>
                       <li><strong>Underlying Cause of Death:</strong> The disease or injury that initiated the chain of events leading directly to death.</li>
                       <li><strong>Contributing Conditions:</strong> Conditions that contributed to the death but were not part of the direct chain of events leading to death.</li>
                     </ul>
                     <p>It is important to note that the symptoms or mode of dying should not be included in the certificate of death, but rather, the conditions that led to the mode of dying should be.</p>

                <div class="content-block">
                     <p>The international form of the medical certificate of the cause of death has two parts:</p>
                     <ul>
                         <li><strong>Part I:</strong> Records the sequence of events directly leading to death, beginning with the immediate cause and going backwards to the underlying cause.</li>
                       <li><strong>Part II:</strong> Is for recording any other significant conditions that contributed to the death but were not part of the direct chain of events.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The physician is responsible for filling out both parts of the certificate. The underlying cause of death is what is selected for mortality tabulation and is recorded on the lowest line of part I of the certificate.</p>

                 <div class="content-block">
                   <p>When determining the underlying cause of death, certain rules should be followed:</p>
                      <ul>
                          <li><strong>Rule 1:</strong> Select the condition entered alone on the lowest used line in Part I.</li>
                            <li><strong>Rule 2:</strong> Select the originating cause of the sequence first entered on the certificate.</li>
                           <li><strong>Rule 3:</strong> If there is no reported sequence terminating in the condition first entered on the certificate, select this first-mentioned condition in the lowest row.</li>
                            <li><strong>Rule 4:</strong> If the condition selected in row (a) is obviously a direct consequence of another reported condition, whether in Part I or Part II, select the primary condition.</li>

               <div class="content-block">
                 <p>Mortality and morbidity statistics are a primary source of health information. Mortality statistics are generally considered the most reliable type of health data. The following principles must be adhered to when recording morbidity and mortality data:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>All morbid conditions and injuries which contributed to the death should be recorded on the medical certificate of cause of death. The circumstances of any accident or violence that produced the injury should also be included.</li>
                     <li>The certifiers should include all conditions, but not the symptoms or mode of dying.</li>

                     <p>Here are a couple of examples of how to complete Part I of a death certificate and then determine the underlying cause of death.</p>
                      <p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>(a) Pulmonary Embolism</li>
                        <li>(b) Pathological Fracture</li>
                        <li>(c) Secondary Carcinoma of the Rt Femur</li>
                        <li>(d) Carcinoma of the Breast</li>
                      </ul>
                      <p>In this example, the underlying cause of death is Carcinoma of the Breast.</p>
                       <p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>(a) Pulmonary Embolism</li>
