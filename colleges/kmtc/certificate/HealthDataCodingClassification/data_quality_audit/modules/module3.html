                <h2>ðŸ“š Operational Definition of Reliability</h2>
                <div class="content-block">
                    <p>Data are reliable if they are arguably complete and accurate, measure the intended indicator and are consistent, not subject to inappropriate alteration over time. For example, PMTCT positive clients should only include those who are newly tested positive in ANC, labour and delivery, PNC and KP for the first visit.</p>
                </div>
            </section>
            <section class="content-section">
                <h2>ðŸ“š Operational Definition of Precision</h2>
                <div class="content-block">
                   <p>Precision means that the data have sufficient detail. For example, an indicator requires the number of individuals who received HIV counseling and testing and received their test results by sex of the individual. In this case, an information system lacks precision if it is not designed to record the sex of the individual who received HIV counseling and testing.</p>

            </section>
           <section class="content-section">
                <h2>ðŸ“š Operational Definition of Timeliness</h2>
               <div class="content-block">
                  <p>Data are timely when they are up to date (current), and when the information is available on time. Timeliness is affected by (a) the rate at which the program's information system is updated, (b) the rate of change of actual program activities; and (c) when the information is used or required. For example, if a health care worker provides a service on a specific date but then the record on CCC DAR or pharmacy DAR is made on another date. Failure to report the accurate date will lead to discordance.</p>

                <h2>ðŸ“š Operational Definition of Integrity</h2>
                <div class="content-block">
                  <p>Data has integrity when the system used to generate them is protected from deliberate bias or manipulation for political or personal reasons. For example, reporting numbers where no actual service has been provided to meet targets.</p>
                </div>
            </section>
          <section class="content-section">
                <h2>ðŸ“š Operational Definition of Confidentiality</h2>
                 <div class="content-block">
                     <p>Confidentiality means that clients are assured that their data will be maintained according to national and /or international standards for privacy of data. This means that personal data are not disclosed inappropriately, and that data in hard copy and electronic form are treated with appropriate levels of security. For example, client files are kept in locked cabinets and/or in password protected files.  The people involved in implementation of DQA should sign confidentiality agreements.</p>
