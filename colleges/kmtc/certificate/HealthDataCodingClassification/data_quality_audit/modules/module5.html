                   <p>After a DQA is conducted a facility level DQI plan must be developed and shared with the sub-county health management team within two weeks of the completion of the DQA. This plan should be developed jointly with the facility team. There must be continuous monitoring of the implementation of these DQI plans by the immediate supervisory level. The final verified numbers should be updated to KHIS immediately after the DQA.</p>

                <div class="content-block">
                    <p>To maximize efficiencies, DQA teams are advised to conduct an integrated/multi-program DQA.  This ensures that data on key indicators from multiple health programs are reviewed at the same time, providing an opportunity to determine the quality of data within a wider scope.</p>

               <div class="content-block">
                 <p>Personnel conducting a data quality assessment on site will have access to patient level data during the activity, and will be required to maintain absolute confidentiality. A DQA initiated by an entity outside the county shall seek authority from the county and the facility should give consent. DQA team members shall maintain confidentiality by signing an intent to maintain confidentiality. The DQA team will always be accompanied by a health facility staff member during the DQA visit.  This is to ensure that facility procedures are adhered to and that the DQA team does not cause disruption of service provision during the exercise. To ensure that all facility staff that will be providing input on the DQA have confidence that their participation is confidential and voluntary, an informed consent will be administered. The information obtained will be used to improve data quality.</p>

                <h2>ðŸ“š Procedures of DQA</h2>
               <div class="content-block">
                    <p>The following procedures should be followed during a DQA:</p>
                    <ul>
                       <li><strong>Designing a DQA Tool:</strong> The DQA team should design a DQA tool that will be used for the activity. This tool should be designed according to the program or area being audited.</li>
                         <li><strong>Training:</strong> Before conducting the DQA, the team should be trained on how to conduct the activity. A pilot activity can be done to test the DQA tool and process.</li>
                        <li><strong>Implementation:</strong> The team visits the facility for the activity, introduces themselves to facility staff, and explains the DQA activity. The DQA activity is then conducted in the relevant areas.</li>
                        <li><strong>Feedback:</strong> After the activity is conducted, a feedback meeting should be held to share the findings of the DQA and Data Quality Improvement (DQI) is implemented for the improvement of the quality of data.</li>

               <h2>ðŸ“š Calculating Indicator Data Concordance</h2>
               <div class="content-block">
                 <p>Ideally, concordance between compared sources is expected to be 100%. This indicates accuracy and consistency in reporting. Any results above 100% are considered under reporting while those below 100% are considered over reporting. Before any DQA exercise, a level of confidence needs to be set to guide follow-on actions. A relative margin of error of 10% for a 90% confidence interval is recommended as a minimum level of acceptable precision. Scores between 90-110% are within the accepted range. Counties and facilities with concordance results below 90% or above 110%, should be flagged for data quality improvement initiatives.</p>
