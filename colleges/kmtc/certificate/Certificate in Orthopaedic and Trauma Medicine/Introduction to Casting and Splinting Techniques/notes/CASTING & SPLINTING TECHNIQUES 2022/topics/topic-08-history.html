                                No other object is as closely associated with the branch of orthopaedics as Plaster of Paris or POP as we commonly call it. Orthopaedicians have been associated with POP just like cardiologists with ECG and the plastic surgeons with Humby's knife. Its use is ubiquitous and we put it to such a myriad of uses that the list is endless.
                            </p>

                            <h4 class="content-heading">1. History</h4>
                            <p class="content-text">
                                The name Plaster of Paris (POP) had its origins from the fact that it was extensively mined from Montmartre in Paris district. But its use predates the industrial revolution, they have been found on the insides of pyramids. The need to immobilise the fracture to prevent pain and deformity and all the while allowing mobilisation has been the perennial problem in orthopaedics. Splints made of bamboo and wooden sticks were used in the ancient times but they couldn't be relied upon to hold the reduction. More materials were tried like wax, starch, cardboard but all ended in failure. This was the time POP was beginning to be used in construction and by sculptors, surgeons observing its properties hit upon the idea of using it in orthopaedics. Patients with fractures in the long bones of leg were placed in long narrow wooden boxes and the gaps filled with POP. This was however bulky and alternatives were sought. The idea of incorporating POP in bandages was hit upon by two surgeons, Antonius Mathijsen and Nikolai Ivanovich Pirogov in the 1850's. The results are for us to see.

                            <h4 class="content-heading">2. Evolution of POP and its uses</h4>
                            <p class="content-text">
                                The uses of POP have only evolved with time. It started out as a method to immobilise and hold reductions in the management of adult and paediatric fractures, for which it still continues to be used. Sarmiento¹ has shown that the management of low energy fractures of humerus and tibia is possible without functional compromise with a POP cast even in the age of AO and ORIF. In Paediatric orthopaedics POP has revolutionised the management of club foot. What was once considered a surgically treatable condition is now managed by serial casting due to the innovation of Kite and Ponseti.² In DDH Hip spica is used once reduction is achieved either by closed or open methods. Plaster has also been used to treat fracture and deformities in spine. Hibbs introduced postoperative immobilisation using POP jacket in patients of Pott's spine. He also introduced turnbuckle cast that is used in the management of scoliosis.³ Risser also introduced a method for treatment of scoliosis by casting.⁴ Plaster of Paris is used in postoperative immobilisation and also in the management of some amputees. Casting over stumps has allowed immediate rehabilitation using prosthesis.⁵ POP was used in the immediate management of Open fractures until the evolution of external fixator. It has also been used in the management of neuropathic joints and diabetic ulcers.⁶ It is used in the correction of deformities like fixed flexion deformity of the knee.

                            <h4 class="content-heading">3. Plaster of Paris – properties and complications</h4>
                            <p class="content-text">
                                Plaster of Paris is calcined gypsum (roasted gypsum), ground to a fine powder by milling. When water is added, the more soluble form of calcium sulphate returns to the relatively insoluble form, and heat is produced.
                            </p>
                            <div class="equation">
                                $$ [2(\mathrm{CaSO}_{4.1} \cdot \frac{1}{2} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}) + 3 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} \rightarrow 2(\mathrm{CaSO}_{4.2} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}) + \mathrm{Heat}] $$
                            </div>
                            <p class="content-text">
                                The setting of unmodified plaster starts about 10 min after mixing and is complete in about 45 min; however, the cast is not fully dry for 72 h.
                            </p>
                            <p class="content-text">
                                The biggest advantage of POP is the property that allows itself to moulding. This allows POP to be contoured according to the limb that it is applied to. It is sufficiently rigid and allows immobilisation to allow healing to take place. However it is not without its complications. Prolonged immobilisation in a POP makes the skin under the cast vulnerable. The dead skin is not removed and leads to scaling. Other complications like ulceration, maceration, itching can result. Even burns can be caused by the exothermic reaction. Staphylococcal infection of the underlying skin can result in dermatitis. Cast syndrome, associated with body jacket casts, involves obstruction of the third portion of the duodenum from duodenal constriction caused by stretching of the superior mesenteric vessels. The symptoms are nausea, vomiting, fever, and electrolyte imbalance.

                            <p class="content-text">
                                The most dreaded complication however is compartment syndrome and the resulting sequelae Volkmann's Ischaemic contracture. The nerve palsies have also been associated with poor plaster techniques. The other chronic complication is the "fracture disease" that results from prolonged immobilisation, leading to osteoporotic bones and stiff joints. Complications when casts are used in fracture treatment are loss of reduction, malalignment, delayed and non-union. Localised hypertrichosis has also been reported as rare complication of internal fixation and POP application.⁸

                            <p class="content-text">
                                Recently parameters like cast index and gap index have been developed that predict cast failure.⁹ Cast index is the ratio between the inside diameter of the cast on the lateral view to the inner diameter of the cast on AP view. Gap index is the space between plaster and skin measured as a ratio to inner diameter of the plaster. Higher cast and gap index have been associated with higher failure rate.

                            <p class="content-text">
                                However most of the complications can be avoided by adhering to a good plaster technique. They include proper padding especially of the bony prominences, avoiding casts when the limb is swollen, maintaining functional position of joints and preventing pressure points when moulding the cast. To prevent compartment syndrome, care must be taken in children and in patients with soft tissue injury (including burns), multiple trauma, paralysis or paresis, head injury, or altered sensorium (due to medications, substance abuse, or psychosis). Evaluation of neurovascular status and recording of abnormalities are essential.

                                The factors that cause thermal burns are a dip water temperature of >75F (24 °C), use of more than eight layers, and use of a pillow (inadequate ventilation). Plaster residue in the dip water did not increase the exothermic reaction. Moisture on the outside of the cast decreased the temperature of the plaster.¹⁰ According to Halanski et al, the surface of the cast was 2.7 ± 1.9 °C cooler than the internal temperature. A dip water temperature of <24 °C did not result in a temperature high enough to cause burns, regardless of the number of layers. A dip water temperature of >50 °C, a twenty-four-ply cast thickness, use of a plastic pillow, overwrapping of a curing plaster cast with synthetic, and use of a splint folded on itself were associated with temperatures causing burns.[11]

                            <h4 class="content-heading">4. Recent uses and alternatives</h4>
                            <p class="content-text">
                                Plaster of Paris or calcium sulphate has found other uses as well. It has been used as bone graft substitute and to fill up bone defects.[12] It has been used in spinal surgery as a bone graft substitute. POP is also being investigated as an antibiotic delivery mechanism.[13] However POP usage has been declining in its use as casting material after the advent of fibreglass or polyurethane tapes and splints. Plaster has certain technical advantages over synthetics. Plaster can be tucked or pleated. Plaster requires less tension for application. Gloves are not required. Plaster absorbs fluids, including pus, blood, and sweat. If a cast saw is not available, the plaster cast may be removed by soaking and unrolling or using simple hand-cutting instruments. However, compared with fibreglass, plaster may be difficult to store in humidity and is more difficult to keep clean. Plaster casts are heavier than fibreglass, exhibit more breakdown for short-leg casts, and are judged to be more restrictive and less comfortable.[14] However in a country like India where the cost considerations come in to play POP still remains the choice of material in casting.

                            <h4 class="content-heading">5. Conclusion</h4>
                            <p class="content-text">
                                From the early days of orthopaedics when fracture management was mostly conservative to the present era of technological advancement where every fracture is managed aggressively and immediately with internal fixation, POP has been our constant companion, and we can safely hazard a guess that it will remain so in the future. This places a responsibility on the orthopaedic residents to learn proper plaster techniques and not look down upon this simple and effective method for the treatment of fractures. A consideration may also be given in more emphasis of closed management of fractures using POP as a part of orthopaedic curriculum in a developing country like India where access to surgical facilities are limited especially in remote places. We take liberty to state that the days of identifying orthopaedicians in hospital corridors by looking at the white POP stains on trousers and shoes will not be history.

                                History tells us of the many methods used by our ancestors in managing fractures, such as wooden sticks fastened around the fractured limb, the placement of the injured extremity in a box filled with sand, and later, the wrapping of the newly invented bandages of plaster of Paris. All these methods shared the objective of immobilizing the fractured fragments as much as possible.

                            <p class="content-text">
                                Improvements in anesthesia in the early part of the 20th century and the later discovery of antibiotics made the surgical treatment of fractures a practical reality. The surgical approach appeared to crystallize the dream of anatomical reduction of fractures. The promise that surgery would eliminate the need for immobilization of joints adjacent to the fracture made the new therapeutic modality even more attractive. A parallel loss of interest in nonsurgical treatments was a logical consequence.

                            <p class="content-text">
                                One can also suspect that physicians who believed that immobilization was good for fracture healing must have concluded that rigid immobilization was even better. This goal was thought to have been achieved when the technique of rigid fixation and interfragmentary compression was popularized by the Arbeitsgemeinschaft Osteosynthesefragen (AO) in the late 1950s. The original concept of rigid fixation had been advocated earlier by Danis, a Flemish surgeon.

                            <p class="content-text">
                                A similar philosophy regarding the benefit of fracture immobilization had developed among those who were treating fractures by non-surgical means. The principle that joints above and below a fracture must be immobilized became almost universally accepted. Exceptions to the prevailing practice never achieved wide recognition. Delbet, a French surgeon, described a method of treatment of tibial fractures using a "gaiter" firmly applied over the extremity, extending from below the knee to below the ankle. Lucas-Championniere, also a French surgeon, attempted to popularize the concept of massage to the injured limb. His success in disseminating his ideas was limited.

                                <li>A rebellion against the premises advanced by Sir Robert Jones seems to have been led by <strong>George Perkins</strong>, another Briton who advocated skeletal traction of fractured tibias, while encouraging active and passive motion of the knee joint. His method was practiced in Great Britain but failed to receive wide acceptance in Europe and America.</li>
                                <li>In Central Europe, just preceding the onset of the World War II, <strong>Bohler</strong>, from Austria successfully popularized the use of "skin-tight" plaster of Paris casts and the parallel active use of the injured extremities. His teachings reached America primarily through his disciple, Ernest Dehne, an Austrian who had emigrated to the United States. As a member of the armed forces, he successfully popularized Bohler's system. Bohler's casts adhered, nonetheless, to the traditional belief that immobilization above and below a fracture was necessary.</li>
                                <li>One of the fractures that had been traditionally managed with casts that included the adjacent joints was that of the humeral diaphysis. Spica casts immobilized the elbow and shoulder joints. The "hanging cast," popularized in the 1950s for the treatment of this fracture, demonstrated that immobilization of the two joints was not necessary for uneventful healing.</li>

                            <h3 class="subsection-title">A New Cast is Born (Functional Bracing)</h3>
                            <p class="content-text">
                                Inspired by the effectiveness of the patella tendon bearing prosthesis (PTB) used by below-the-knee amputees, a cast was designed for the treatment of diaphyseal tibial fractures in the 1960s. The cast was conceived on the assumption that weight bearing stresses could be effectively transmitted from the floor to the patellar tendon and tibial flares, and in that manner prevent shortening of the fractured extremity.

                            <p class="content-text">
                                Within a short time, it became obvious that the success of the new cast was not based on the anticipated transfer of stresses proximally but by the support of the soft tissues surrounding the fractured bone. This realization permitted the provision of freedom of motion, not only to the knee but to the ankle joint as well. The below-the-knee functional brace replaced the below-the-knee, PTB cast.

                            <p class="content-text">
                                Clinical and laboratory studies eventually demonstrated that, especially in body segments with two bones connected by an interosseous membrane, the initial shortening experienced in closed fractures remains essentially unchanged, and the role of the brace is significantly limited to providing angular stability through a hydraulic- like mechanism. Similarly, it was documented that the motion between the fractured fragments, produced by the active use of the extremity, has a beneficial osteogenic effect.

                            <p class="content-text">
                                Functional fracture bracing was extended to the management of other fractures with different degrees of success. Femoral fracture bracing failed to demonstrate a consistent rate of success, since angular deformities were seen with great frequency when the brace was used in the care of fractures above the distal third of the bone. Forearm fracture bracing also never gained popularity, probably because of technical difficulties encountered in the application of the brace and the simplicity of plate fixation. Braces for fractures of the humerus, ulna and distal radius, also developed in the 1960s and 1970s, brought about a high success rate.

                            <p class="content-text">
                                Fracture bracing further supported the often-neglected observation that angulation of a few degrees and mild shortening are not complications but inconsequential deviations from the normal.

                                A review of the literature has revealed that stabilizing devices for fractures resembling modern braces had been used in the past. In England, Gooch described one such device in 1776. Smith, in 1855, in Philadelphia, described “prostheses” for the treatment of non-unions. His appliances resemble modern braces. It is, however, a giant leap of the imagination to conclude that their designs, rationale, underlying philosophy and use were the same as those of contemporary functional fracture braces.

                                As progress is made in the field of surgical treatment of fractures, comparable advancements are taking place in the non-operative care of long bone fractures. “Gold standards” in fracture treatment do not belong, at this time, exclusively to one single methodology.

                                The 20th century closed with a record of major advances in the care of fractures. Unfortunately, the universal crisis in the delivery of health care, mainly produced by the high cost of advanced technology, has precluded the extension of such benefits to several in regions of the world where many are unable to afford its implementation. It remains a challenge and responsibility to future generations to address this issue in earnest, and to find practical and humane solutions.
