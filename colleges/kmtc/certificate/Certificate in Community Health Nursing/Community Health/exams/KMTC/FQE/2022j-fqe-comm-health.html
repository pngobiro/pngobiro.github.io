                                <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> In rural settings, natural ventilation (cross-ventilation via open windows) is the most practical, cost-effective, and common method.

                                <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Monovalent vaccines contain a single antigen/strain.
                                <br>- IPV is typically single antigen.
                                <br>- Measles (standalone) is monovalent.
                                <br>- Hep B (standalone) is monovalent.
                                <br>Note: Pentavalent contains 5 antigens. Measles/Rubella (MR) is bivalent (2).</p>
