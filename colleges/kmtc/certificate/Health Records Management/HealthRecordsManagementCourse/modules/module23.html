                                <li><strong>Integrity and Fairness</strong>: Ensuring that procurement processes are conducted ethically, impartially, and without bias.</li>
                                <li><strong>Transparency and Accountability</strong>: Maintaining openness and accountability in all procurement actions, making processes and decisions transparent to stakeholders.</li>
                                <li><strong>Public Confidence</strong>: Enhancing public trust in government processes by ensuring procurement is fair, transparent, and efficient.</li>

                        <li><strong>Procurement Methods</strong>: Different procurement methods are used based on the value and nature of procurement:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Open Tender: The most common method for high-value procurements, ensuring wide participation and competition.</li>
                                <li>Restricted Tender: Used in specific circumstances where competition is limited, or specialized suppliers are required.</li>
                                <li>Direct Procurement: For low-value or unique items, or in emergency situations, allowing direct negotiation with a single supplier.</li>
                                <li>Request for Quotations (RFQ): Simplified process for low-value, straightforward purchases, often involving obtaining quotes from multiple suppliers.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Stage Variations</strong>: At each stage of procurement, variations may be necessary:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Tender Documents: Complexity and detail vary based on procurement type. For example, tender documents for complex equipment will be more technical than for routine supplies.</li>
                                <li>Evaluation Criteria: Evaluation may focus on price for standard goods, but heavily weight technical quality and methodology for services and works.</li>
                                <li>Contract Terms: Contract terms and conditions are tailored to the specific goods, services, or works being procured, reflecting different risks and performance requirements.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Understanding these procedural variations is crucial for procurement officers to apply the most appropriate methods and ensure effective and compliant procurement across diverse healthcare needs.</p>
