                <div class="content-block">
                    <p><strong>Cards</strong> are the basic record document in most master indexes. They must meet certain standards to be effective:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Basic Record Document</strong>: Cards serve as the primary medium for recording index information. Each card typically represents a patient and contains essential details for identification and record retrieval.</li>
                        <li><strong>Quality for Endurance</strong>: Generally, a card must be of <strong>good quality for endurance</strong>. This means they should be made from card stock that is:
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Durable</strong>: Able to withstand frequent handling without tearing or bending.</li>
                                <li><strong>Long-lasting</strong>: Resistant to wear and tear over extended periods of use and storage.</li>
                                <li><strong>Suitable for Writing</strong>: Surface should be appropriate for writing or printing information clearly and legibly.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Drawer filing</strong> is a common method for organizing these cards:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>"Blind" Filing</strong>: Cards may be filled ‚Äúblind‚Äù in drawers, meaning they are filed one behind the other in an upright position within drawer cabinets.</li>
                        <li><strong>Upright Position</strong>: Cards stand vertically in drawers, allowing for easy flipping through to locate specific cards.</li>
                        <li><strong>Drawer Cabinets</strong>: Typically stored in specialized drawer cabinets designed for index cards, which may include features like dividers and compressor plates to keep cards organized and upright.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Drawer filing is a straightforward and space-efficient method, particularly suitable for manual card-based index systems.</p>

                <h2>üìö Strip Index and Elevator Files</h2>
                <div class="content-block">
                    <p><strong>Strip Index</strong> offers an alternative to traditional card filing, especially where space is a concern:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Components</strong>: A strip index, as its name suggests, consists of:
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Thin Strips</strong>: Series of thin wooden or metal strips.</li>
                                <li><strong>Paper Coating</strong>: Strips are coated with paper on which the details required for the master index are written or printed.</li>
                                <li><strong>Metal Panels</strong>: Strips are filed on metal panels.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Panel Design</strong>: The metal panels are designed with:
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Folded Edges</strong>: A fold of metal down each edge which holds the strips in place, preventing them from sliding out.</li>
                                <li><strong>Revolving Spindle</strong>: Panels are hung on a central revolving spindle, allowing them to fan out like leaves on an open book when accessed.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Mounting Options</strong>: Strip indexes can be:
                            <ul>

                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Suitability</strong>: Recommended for specific applications:
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Waiting List</strong>: Well-suited for managing waiting lists due to its compact and easily updatable nature.</li>
                                <li><strong>Not Ideal for Master Index</strong>: Less recommended for the main Patient Master Index due to potential limitations in expansion and handling very large volumes of data.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Elevator Files</strong> are advanced, often automated systems designed for high-volume card filing:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Tray-Based Filing</strong>: In an elevator file, cards are filed in trays that are:
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Foot-Long Trays</strong>: Typically about a foot long to hold a substantial number of cards.</li>
                                <li><strong>Multiple Trays</strong>: Several trays are stacked vertically within the machine.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Machine Structure</strong>: The elevator file machine resembles:
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Large Metal Cabinet</strong>: A cabinet that can be up to five feet high and ten feet wide, providing significant storage capacity.</li>
                                <li><strong>Top Opening</strong>: An opening at the top of the cabinet where shelves with trays of cards are visible and accessible.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>

                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>High Capacity</strong>: The largest elevator files can hold up to 900,000 index cards, suitable for very large healthcare facilities.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Operation</strong>: Elevator files can be electrically driven or manually controlled:
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Electrically Driven</strong>: Large files are typically electrically driven. To retrieve a card, the filing clerk:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><strong>Presses a Button</strong>: Presses a button indicating the desired shelf or section.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Rotation for Access</strong>: The cards rotate until the correct one arrives at hand level at the top opening.</li>
                                    </ul>

                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Advantages</strong>:
                            <ul>

                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Disadvantages</strong>:
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Expensive</strong>: Elevator files are costly to purchase and maintain.</li>
                                <li><strong>Affordability</strong>: May not be affordable for all health facilities, particularly smaller or resource-constrained ones.</li>

                <div class="content-block">
                    <p>Effective filing of Master Index Cards requires specific techniques to ensure accuracy, speed, and ease of retrieval. The main techniques include sorting, filing, and checking:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>(a) Sorting</strong>:
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Most Important Step</strong>: Sorting is the <strong>most important step in filing</strong>. It involves putting the cards into good order <strong>before being filed</strong>.</li>
                                <li><strong>Purpose</strong>: Sorting prepares the cards for systematic filing, making the actual filing process more efficient and accurate.</li>
                                <li><strong>Sorting Methods</strong>: Two methods are particularly appropriate for sorting Master Index Cards:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><strong>Use of Sort-File</strong>:
                                            <ul>
                                                <li><strong>Series of Flaps</strong>: A sort-file consists of a series of flaps.</li>
                                                <li><strong>Alphabetical Letters</strong>: Each flap bears a letter of the alphabet.</li>
                                                <li><strong>Solid Base Arrangement</strong>: Flaps are arranged in alphabetical order in a solid base.</li>
                                                <li><strong>Functionality</strong>: Cards are initially sorted into these alphabetical flaps before final filing.</li>
                                            </ul>
                                        </li>
                                        <li><strong>Pigeon Holes</strong>:
                                            <ul>
                                                <li><strong>Lettered Holes</strong>: Pigeon holes are used, with each hole lettered for initial sorting.</li>
                                                <li><strong>Initial Sorting</strong>: Index cards are sorted into these lettered pigeon holes as a preliminary step before being filed in drawers or other equipment.</li>
                                            </ul>
                                        </li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>(b) Filing</strong>:
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Requires Concentration</strong>: Filing index cards requires a <strong>lot of concentration</strong> to maintain accuracy and avoid misfiling.</li>
                                <li><strong>Checking Surrounding Files</strong>: To ensure accuracy, it is essential to:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><strong>Check Front and Behind</strong>: When filing a card, the files in front and behind in the drawer should be checked to ensure correct alphabetical sequence.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                <li><strong>Allocate to Experienced Clerk</strong>: This task should be allocated to an <strong>experienced clerk</strong> who is detail-oriented and understands the importance of accuracy in filing.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>(c) Checking</strong>:
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Mistakes Inevitable</strong>: It is obvious that <strong>mistakes do occur</strong> when filing, even with careful sorting and filing.</li>
                                <li><strong>Constant Checking Required</strong>: Therefore, <strong>constant checking of filed cards is required</strong> to catch and correct errors.</li>
                                <li><strong>Reference to Index</strong>: After cards have been filed and checked:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><strong>Limited Removal</strong>: They should only be removed when the address needs to be changed or for essential updates.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Prevent Overpacking</strong>: Cards should never be so tightly packed that checking and filing become difficult.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                <li><strong>Alphabetical Order and Staff Responsibility</strong>: Key points to ensure effective checking and filing:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><strong>Strict Alphabetical Order</strong>: Master Index Cards should be filed strictly alphabetically.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Single Staff Member</strong>: Only one member of staff should work on the cards at any one time to maintain consistency and prevent misfiling due to multiple handling.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ol>

                <div class="content-block">
                    <p>Besides the Patient Master Index, two other critical indices are the Diagnostic Index and the Operations Index, which serve specific purposes in health information management.</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Diagnostic Index</strong>:
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Purpose</strong>: The diagnostic index is designed to <strong>provide access for study purposes</strong> to the clinical data contained in hospital records.</li>
                                <li><strong>User Group</strong>: Primarily used by health personnel wishing to conduct studies on specific diseases.</li>
                                <li><strong>Information Retrieval</strong>: Researchers can use the diagnostic index to:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><strong>Obtain Case Folder Numbers</strong>: Find the case folder numbers of patients who have been admitted or attended outpatient departments with a particular disease of interest.</li>
