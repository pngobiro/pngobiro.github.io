                <div class="content-block">
                    <p>The <strong>Acquisition of Health Records Equipment</strong> is a systematic procedure to ensure that necessary tools and machinery for health records management are procured efficiently and compliantly. The standard procedure entails the following steps:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Needs Identifications</strong>:
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Assess Departmental Needs</strong>: The process begins with identifying the specific needs of the health records department for equipment. This involves evaluating current equipment, assessing gaps, and determining future requirements based on departmental goals and workload.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Specifications</strong>:
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Define Technical Specifications</strong>: Detailed specifications for the required equipment are developed. This includes technical requirements, performance criteria, quality standards, and any specific features needed to meet the department's operational needs.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Requisition of quotations</strong>:
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Request for Quotations (RFQs)</strong>: A formal requisition for quotations is initiated. This involves preparing and sending out RFQs to potential suppliers, detailing the equipment specifications and requesting price quotations and terms of supply.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Opening of the quotations</strong>:
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Quotation Opening Process</strong>: A formal process for opening the received quotations is conducted. This is typically done by a procurement committee to ensure transparency and fairness. Opened quotations are documented and recorded for evaluation.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Selection of the qualified bidder</strong>:
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Bidder Evaluation and Selection</strong>: Quotations are evaluated based on pre-defined criteria, including price, quality, supplier reputation, and compliance with specifications. A qualified bidder who meets the criteria and offers the best value is selected.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Supply of the goods by the bidder and receipt of the goods by the hospital supplies department</strong>:
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Goods Supply and Receipt</strong>: The selected bidder supplies the equipment, which is then received by the hospital supplies department. This step involves:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Delivery of Equipment</li>

                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Authentication of the goods by the concern department</strong>:
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Departmental Verification</strong>: The health records department, as the concerned department, authenticates the received goods. This involves:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Detailed Inspection: Conducting a thorough inspection to ensure the equipment meets the required specifications and quality standards.</li>
                                        <li>Performance Testing: If necessary, testing the equipment to verify its functionality and performance as per specifications.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Acquisition of the goods by the department by use of S11</strong>:
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Formal Acquisition via S11 Form</strong>: The formal acquisition of the goods by the health records department is completed using an S11 form (or equivalent internal requisition form). This form officially transfers ownership and responsibility for the equipment to the department.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Installation of the machines in the department after they have been entered into their inventory</strong>:
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Installation and Inventory Entry</strong>: Once acquired, the equipment is installed in the health records department. After installation, the equipment is formally entered into the department's inventory records for asset management and tracking.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Finally, maintenance of the equipments is put in place and observed(see the public procurement act)</strong>:
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Maintenance and Compliance</strong>: A maintenance plan for the equipment is established and implemented. This includes regular servicing, upkeep, and adherence to the public procurement act and hospital policies regarding equipment maintenance and management.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>This comprehensive procedure ensures that the acquisition of health records equipment is transparent, compliant, and results in the procurement of suitable and high-quality resources for the department.</p>
