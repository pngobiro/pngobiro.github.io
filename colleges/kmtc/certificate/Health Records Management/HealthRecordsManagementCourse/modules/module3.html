                <div class="content-block">
                    <p>To effectively manage the diverse functions of a health records department, a structured organization is necessary. The department is typically organized into functional units, each with assigned employees. In smaller facilities, some functions may be combined and handled by fewer staff. A typical organizational chart for a medical record department might include:</p>

                    </figure>
                    <p>The person in charge, often called a “director,” “manager,” or “assistant manager,” oversees the entire department. The number of staff varies based on facility size and patient volume, ranging from small teams to over 100 employees in large hospitals. The structure may also depend on whether the facility uses computerized or paper-based records.</p>
                    <p>Organization charts differ across facilities, but it is generally recommended that the department director or manager reports directly to the chief executive officer. Patient/client registration functions should report to the Director of Health Records & Information Officer in charge, ensuring streamlined operations and clear lines of responsibility.</p>
