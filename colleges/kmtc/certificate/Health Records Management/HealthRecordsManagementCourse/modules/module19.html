                <h2>ðŸ“š Filing Methods: 3. Numerical Filing System - (a) Straight Numerical Filing System</h2>
                <div class="content-block">
                    <p>The <strong>Straight Numerical Filing System</strong> is the most intuitive form of numerical filing, organizing records in a simple sequential order based on the assigned patient number. Key characteristics include:</p>
                    <p><strong>(a) Straight Numerical filing system</strong>: <strong>This is probably the filing system that comes automatically into peopleâ€™s mind:-12 3 4 5 6, 1 2 3 4 5 8</strong>. Straight numerical filing is based on direct number sequence.</p>
                    <p><strong>Simplicity and Intuition</strong>:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Intuitive Order</strong>: Records are arranged in a straightforward numerical sequence, such as 1, 2, 3, 4, and so on. This system is easy to understand and implement as it follows a natural numerical progression.</li>
                        <li><strong>Example Sequence</strong>: Files are organized in order like 123456, 123457, 123458, etc., making it easy to locate a file if you know the number.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Suitability for Small Libraries</strong>:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Best for Small Records Library</strong>: <strong>It is probably the most suitable method of filing for small records library where there is no necessity to go into the fairly elaborate detail needed to install a terminal digit system</strong>. Straight numerical filing is efficient and adequate for smaller healthcare facilities or departments with a limited volume of records.</li>
                        <li><strong>No Elaborate Setup</strong>: It does not require complex setup or specialized training, making it user-friendly for smaller operations.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Limitations for Large Libraries</strong>:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Growth at One End</strong>: In larger facilities, straight numerical filing leads to <strong>growth at one end of the file</strong>, as new records are always added at the highest number end. This can cause overcrowding in the newer sections of the file while older sections remain less utilized.</li>
                        <li><strong>File Congestion</strong>: As the library expands, the concentration of activity in the latest numerical sections can lead to congestion and slower retrieval times in those areas.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Straight numerical filing is effective for small-scale operations where simplicity and ease of use are prioritized, but it becomes less practical for larger, growing health record libraries due to its inherent limitations in file distribution and access efficiency.</p>

                <h2>ðŸ“š Filing Methods: 3. Numerical Filing System - (b) Terminal Digit Filing System</h2>
                <div class="content-block">
                    <p>The <strong>Terminal Digit Filing System</strong> is a sophisticated adaptation of numerical filing designed to address the limitations of straight numerical filing, particularly in large and growing health record libraries. Key characteristics and principles include:</p>
                    <p><strong>(b) Terminal Digit filing system</strong>:</p>
                    <p><strong>Origin and Standard</strong>:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>United States Origin</strong>: <strong>The filing system was first used in the United States hospitals and has been the standard method of filing in that country</strong>. Terminal digit filing is a well-established and widely used method, especially in the U.S.</li>
                        <li><strong>Recommended for New Departments</strong>: <strong>Anyone starting a new records department would be well advised to start with it from the beginning</strong>. For new health records departments, adopting terminal digit filing from the outset is highly recommended due to its long-term benefits and scalability.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Addressing Difficulties of Sequential Filing</strong>:</p>
                    <p>The terminal digit system overcomes difficulties associated with traditional sequential filing (straight numerical), which are:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>(i) Growth is at one end of the file</strong>:
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Uneven Expansion</strong>: In straight numerical filing, <strong>growth is at one end of the file because this is the busiest section of the library</strong>. New records are always added to the end, causing uneven expansion and congestion in recent number ranges.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>(ii) Gaps after Weeding</strong>:
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Creation of Empty Spaces</strong>: <strong>Gaps are usually left after weeding of notes</strong>. When old or inactive records are removed (weeded), straight numerical files can develop empty spaces throughout the system, but these gaps are not evenly distributed and do not solve the congestion issue at the active end.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>(iii) Transposition Errors</strong>:
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Number Mix-ups</strong>: <strong>Transposition of figures occurs whenever one is dealing with big numbers</strong>. When filing or retrieving large numerical sequences, errors like transposing digits (e.g., 123456 filed as 123465) are common, leading to misfiles and lost records.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Terminal digit filing system overcomes these difficulties</strong> by redistributing file activity and growth more evenly across the entire filing system.</p>
                    <p><strong>Main Principles of Terminal Digit Filing</strong>:</p>
                    <p>Its main principles are as follows:-</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>(i) Division into 100 Major Sections</strong>:
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Major Sections</strong>: <strong>The library is divided into 100major sections numbering from 00 to 99</strong>. The entire filing space is initially divided into 100 primary sections, each labeled with a terminal digit from 00 to 99.</li>
                                <li><strong>Sub-Sections within Major Sections</strong>: <strong>Each major section is again divided into 100 sub-sections. This means that the library is now divided into 10,000 sections. Each section should be labelled properly</strong>. Within each major section, there are 100 sub-sections, further refining the organization and distribution of files. This results in a total of 10,000 uniquely labeled sections across the entire filing system.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>(ii) Hospital Number as Digit Pairs</strong>:
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Three Pairs of Digits</strong>: <strong>The hospital number should be thought of as three pairs of digits e.g. 1 2 3 4 5 6 as 12-34-56</strong>. Patient unit numbers are considered as three pairs of digits for filing purposes, for example, 123456 is read as 12-34-56.</li>
                                <li><strong>Digit Significance</strong>:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><strong>56 is the terminal digit</strong>: The last two digits (56 in 12-34-56) are the terminal digits and determine the major section where the file is placed.</li>
                                        <li><strong>34 is the middle digit</strong>: The middle two digits (34 in 12-34-56) are the middle digits and determine the sub-section within the major section.</li>
                                        <li><strong>12 is the primary or first digit</strong>: The first two digits (12 in 12-34-56) are the primary digits and determine the order within the sub-section.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p><strong>Filing Process</strong>:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>a) Major Section Filing</strong>: <strong>The record will be filled in the major section appropriate to the terminal digit (last two numbers in section 56)</strong>. Files are initially placed in the major section corresponding to their terminal digits (00-99).</li>
                        <li><strong>b) Sub-Section Filing</strong>: <strong>Within major section 56, it goes behind the sub section guide appropriate to middle digit (middle two numbers) 34</strong>. Within the major section, files are further organized into sub-sections based on the middle digits (00-99).</li>
                        <li><strong>c) Primary Digit Order</strong>: <strong>It is then filed in he order of primary digit 12</strong>. Finally, within each sub-section, files are arranged in order of the primary digits (00-99), completing the terminal digit filing sequence.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>This three-tiered filing process ensures a balanced distribution of files and activity across all sections of the health records library, addressing the shortcomings of straight numerical systems.</p>

                <h2>ðŸ“š Advantages of Terminal Digit Filing System</h2>
                <div class="content-block">
                    <p>The <strong>Advantages of Terminal Digit Filing System</strong> are numerous, making it a preferred method for large health records libraries. Key benefits include:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>i. Even Distribution of Records</strong>:
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Balanced File Load</strong>: <strong>New and old records are evenly distributed throughout the records library</strong>. Unlike straight numerical filing, terminal digit filing ensures that new file growth is spread across all sections of the library, preventing congestion in any single area.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>ii. Equal Record Returns Each Day</strong>:
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Consistent Daily Returns</strong>: <strong>Chance ensures that an equal number of records and loose filing returns each day to each major section</strong>. The system naturally distributes daily filing and retrieval workload evenly across all sections.</li>
                                <li><strong>Workload Balance Example</strong>: <strong>Trials have shown that where 1,500 records are filled daily, 150 records will be returned to each section daily</strong>. In a large-scale operation, this balanced distribution significantly improves efficiency and reduces bottlenecks.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>iii. No Annual File Shift-Back</strong>:
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Eliminates Annual Shifts</strong>: <strong>There is no annual shift-back or closing up of notes after weeding, to make room for new records</strong>. Unlike some chronological systems that require periodic shifting of files, terminal digit filing does not necessitate annual file movements to accommodate new records, simplifying long-term maintenance.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>iv. Simpler Sorting</strong>:
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Easier Sorting Process</strong>: <strong>Sorting notes is simpler</strong> in terminal digit filing. The sorting process is streamlined as it focuses on the last two digits (terminal digits) first, simplifying initial file segregation.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>v. Easier Learning for New Staff</strong>:
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>User-Friendly System</strong>: <strong>New staff find the system very much easier to learn than sequential filing-probably because the library is much more static and the 00s are always in the same place</strong>. Terminal digit filing is often easier for new staff to grasp compared to straight numerical filing, as the system is more logically segmented and the location of files becomes predictable once the terminal digit principle is understood. The static nature and consistent location of terminal digit sections (like the 00s section) aid in learning and navigation.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>vi. Fever Misfiles</strong>:
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Reduced Misfiling Errors</strong>: <strong>Fever misfiles occur. This is because the filing clerk is concentrating on only two digits at a time</strong>. By focusing on pairs of digits, particularly the terminal digits, at each step of filing, the system reduces the likelihood of transposition errors and misfiles compared to systems requiring attention to longer numerical sequences at once.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>vii. Advance Tracer Card Preparation</strong>:
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Proactive Clinic Prep</strong>: <strong>Tracer cards can be written in advance when preparing a clinic</strong>. Preparation of tracer cards for record retrieval can be done more efficiently in advance, as the terminal digit system makes it easier to predict and locate files needed for upcoming clinics.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>These advantages collectively make terminal digit filing a robust, efficient, and scalable solution for managing large health records libraries, improving both file organization and operational workflow.</p>

                <h2>ðŸ“š Conversion of Straight Numerical Filing to Terminal Digit Order</h2>
                <div class="content-block">
                    <p><strong>Conversion of Straight Numerical Filing to Terminal Digit Order</strong> is a significant undertaking that requires careful planning and resource allocation. Before initiating such a conversion, healthcare facilities must ensure they have adequate resources and preparation. Key considerations include:</p>
                    <p><strong>(d) Conversion of straight numerical filing to terminal digit order</strong>:</p>
                    <p><strong>Pre-Conversion Requirements</strong>: <strong>Before one changes from straight numerical filing system to terminal digit filing system, one should make sure that there is enough:-</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Space</strong>: Sufficient physical space to reorganize and expand the filing system according to terminal digit principles. This may involve reconfiguring the existing filing area or acquiring additional space.</li>
                        <li><strong>Manpower â€“ trained</strong>: Adequate trained manpower to carry out the conversion process. Staff must be trained on the principles and procedures of terminal digit filing.</li>
                        <li><strong>Shelves constructed</strong>: Necessary shelving or filing equipment constructed or procured to set up the terminal digit filing sections. This includes labeling and preparing 100 major sections and 10,000 sub-sections.</li>
                        <li><strong>Medical forms</strong>: Sufficient medical forms and record folders prepared for the reorganized system. Existing forms may need to be adapted or new forms created to align with the terminal digit system.</li>
                        <li><strong>Pre-printed folders</strong>: Pre-printed folders with terminal digit labels to facilitate accurate filing and retrieval in the new system. This includes folders labeled for each of the 100 major sections and sub-sections.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Conversion Process</strong>:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Setting a Start Date</strong>: <strong>One day should be set on which to start the system</strong>. A specific date is designated as the cut-off for the conversion, after which all new filings will be under the terminal digit system.</li>
                        <li><strong>Issuing New Unit Numbers</strong>: <strong>The first patient who comes should be issued with a unit number 00 and the second patient who comes next 01. This should continue until the number 999999 is reached</strong>. From the start date, new patients are assigned unit numbers sequentially starting from 00 or 000000, and incrementing upwards.</li>
                        <li><strong>Handling Old Records</strong>: <strong>When an old patient has been issued with a number in the previous years comes, his record should be pulled out and brought forward to the new unit number. If a patient does not turn up, his record should be left in the old file</strong>. When patients with records filed under the straight numerical system return:
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Active Records Conversion</strong>: Their old records are retrieved and converted to the terminal digit system, assigned a new unit number if necessary, and integrated into the new filing order.</li>
                                <li><strong>Inactive Records Remain</strong>: Records of patients who do not return are left in the old straight numerical file system until they are needed, avoiding unnecessary mass conversion of inactive records.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Conversion to terminal digit filing is a resource-intensive project but yields long-term benefits in file management efficiency and scalability, particularly for large health records operations.</p>

                    <li>Terminal digit filing addresses the limitations of straight numerical filing by dividing the library into 10,000 sections, distributing file growth and workload evenly.</li>
                    <li>Advantages of terminal digit filing include even record distribution, balanced daily returns, no annual file shift, simpler sorting, fewer misfiles, and easier tracer card preparation.</li>
                    <li>Conversion to terminal digit filing requires careful planning, sufficient space, trained manpower, new shelving, and pre-printed folders, with a phased approach to integrating old records.</li>
