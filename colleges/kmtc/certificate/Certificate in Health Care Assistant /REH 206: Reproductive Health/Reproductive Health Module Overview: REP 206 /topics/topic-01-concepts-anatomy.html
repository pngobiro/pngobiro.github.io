                            <p><strong>Health:</strong> Refers to a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity. The enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health is one of the fundamental rights of every human being without distinction of race, religion, political belief, economic or social condition.</p>

                            <p><strong>Reproductive health:</strong> Reproductive health is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity, in all matters relating to the reproductive system and to its functions and processes. Reproductive health implies that people are able to have a satisfying and safe sex life and that they have the capability to reproduce and the freedom to decide if, when and how often to do so.</p>

                            <p><strong>Family planning:</strong> is the ability of individuals and couples to anticipate and attain their desired number of children and the spacing and timing of their births. It is achieved through use of contraceptive methods and the treatment of involuntary infertility.</p>

                            <p><strong>Pregnancy:</strong> is the term used to describe the period in which a fetus develops inside a woman's womb or uterus. Pregnancy usually lasts about 40 weeks, or just over 9 months, as measured from the last menstrual period to delivery. It is usually divide into three trimesters; 1st trimester, 2nd trimester and 3rd trimester.</p>

                            <p><strong>Abortion:</strong> is the termination of a pregnancy by removal or expulsion of an embryo or fetus. An abortion that occurs without intervention is known as a miscarriage or "spontaneous abortion" and occurs in approximately 30% to 40% of pregnancies. When deliberate steps are taken to end a pregnancy, it is called an induced abortion, or less frequently "induced miscarriage". The unmodified word abortion generally refers to an induced abortion. Although it prevents the birth of a child, abortion is not generally considered birth control (another term for contraception).</p>

                            <p><strong>Ante-natal:</strong> Is the care given to expectant mothers and their unborn children. Through this form of preventive health care, women can learn from skilled health personnel about healthy behaviors during pregnancy, better understand warning signs during pregnancy and childbirth, and receive social, emotional and psychological support at this critical time in their lives.</p>

                                    <p>Through antenatal care, pregnant women can also access micronutrient supplementation, treatment for hypertension to prevent eclampsia, as well as immunization against tetanus. Antenatal care can also provide HIV testing and medications to prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV. In areas where malaria is endemic, health personnel can provide pregnant women with medications and insecticide-treated mosquito nets to help prevent this debilitating and sometimes deadly disease.</p>

                            <p><strong>Post-natal:</strong> World health organization stated that postnatal care is defined as a care given to the mother and her newborn baby immediately after the birth of the placenta and for the first six weeks of life. Majority of maternal and neonatal deaths occur during childbirth and the postpartum period. Scaling up of maternal and newborn health through proper postnatal care services is the best way of reducing maternal and neonatal mortality.</p>

                            <p><strong>Menopause:</strong> is the time that marks the end of your menstrual cycles. It's diagnosed after a woman has gone 12 months without a menstrual period. Menopause can happen in 40s or 50s, but the average age is 50 in the united States. Menopause is a natural biological process.</p>

                            <p><strong>Menstrual cycle:</strong> Each month during the years between puberty and menopause, a woman's body goes through a number of changes to get it ready for a possible pregnancy. This series of hormone-driven events is called the menstrual cycle.</p>

                            <p><strong>Infant:</strong> An infant is a formal or specialised synonym for the common term baby, meaning the very young offspring of human beings. The term may also be used to refer to juveniles of other organisms. A newborn is, in colloquial use, an infant who is only hours, days, or up to one month old.</p>

                            <p><strong>Adolescent:</strong> This period of development corresponds roughly to the period between the ages of 10 and 19 years, which is consistent with the World Health Organization's definition of adolescence.</p>

                            <p><strong>Adolescent-Friendly Services:</strong> These are Sexual and Reproductive Health services delivered in ways that are responsive to specific needs, vulnerabilities and desires of adolescents. These services should be offered in a nonjudgmental and confidential way that fully respects human dignity.</p>

                            <p><strong>Fertility:</strong> is the capability to produce offspring through reproduction following the onset of sexual maturity. The fertility rate is the average number of children born by a female during her lifetime and is quantified demographically.</p>

                            <p><strong>Infertility:</strong> is difficulty or an inability to reproduce naturally. Infertility is widespread, with fertility specialists available all over the world to assist mothers and couples who experience difficulties having a baby. Human fertility depends on factors of nutrition, sexual behaviour, consanguinity, culture, instinct, endocrinology, timing, economics, personality, way of life, and emotions.</p>

                            <p><strong>Sexual Health:</strong> A state of physical, emotional, mental and social well-being in relation to sexuality; it is not merely the absence of disease, dysfunction or infirmity. Sexual health requires a positive and respectful approach to sexuality and sexual relationships, as well as the possibility of having pleasurable and safe sexual experiences, free of coercion, discrimination and violence. For sexual health to be attained and maintained, the sexual rights of all persons must be respected, protected and fulfilled.</p>

                            <p><strong>Sexuality:</strong> It is a central aspect of being human throughout life and encompasses sex, gender identities and roles, sexual orientation, pleasure, intimacy and reproduction. Sexuality is experienced and expressed in thoughts, fantasies, desires, beliefs, attitudes, values, behaviors, practices, roles and relationships.</p>

                            <p>The female reproductive system in humans has two parts, external and internal reproductive organs. The main functions of the female genital organs include the production of eggs, fertilization, implantation of the embryo, development of the fetus inside it.</p>
                            <p>A pair of ovaries are the major structure that produces the ovum. The fallopian tube is a tube-like structure. The uterus carries the ovum that is released from the ovary. The endometrium undergoes cycle changes and prepares the uterus for implantation of the fetus. The vagina is a tube-like structure extending from the cervix and opens outside.</p>

                            <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">Vagina</h4>
                            <p>The vagina is the outermost internal female sex organ. It extends from the uterus to the vulva (external genitalia). Functionally, it facilitates menstruation, sexual intercourse and childbirth. The vagina is located posterior to the urinary bladder and urethra, and anterior to the rectum.</p>
                            <p>The upper end of the vagina is attached to the cervix of the uterus. These structures form a pouch (vaginal fornix) which has anterior, posterior, and lateral parts. The lower end of the vagina (vaginal orifice) opens into the vaginal vestibule just behind the urethral orifice. The vaginal orifice may be partially covered with a membrane called hymen.</p>
                            <p>The vagina is supplied by branches of the internal iliac artery; uterine, vaginal and internal pudendal arteries.</p>

                            <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">Uterus</h4>
                            <p>The uterus (womb) is a hollow muscular organ located deep within the pelvic cavity. Anterior to the rectum and posterosuperiorly to the urinary bladder, the uterus normally sits in a position of anteversion and anteflexion. The endometrial lining of the uterus proliferates each month in preparation for embryo implantation. If fertilization occurs, the uterus acts to house the growing fetus and its placenta. If pregnancy does not occur, the endometrial lining is shed during menstruation.</p>
                            <p>The uterus is divided into three parts:</p>

                                    <span class="list-content"><strong>Cervix:</strong> the inferior portion of the uterus. It consists of two parts (supravaginal, vaginal), two openings (internal os, external os) and a cervical canal.</span>

                            </ul>
                            <p>The uterus is supplied mainly by the uterine artery which arises from the internal iliac artery. The superior branch of the uterine artery supplies the body and fundus, while the inferior branch supplies the cervix. The venous blood of the uterus is drained via the uterine venous plexus into the internal iliac vein.</p>

                            <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">Ovaries</h4>
                            <p>The ovaries are bilateral female gonads and the equivalent of the male testes. They release the ovum (egg) for the purpose of fertilization. In addition, they act as endocrine glands, secreting various hormones necessary for fertility, menstruation and sexual maturation of the female.</p>
                            <p>Each ovary is located in the ovarian fossa of the true pelvis, adjacent to the uterus and below the fallopian tubes. The ovary contains four surfaces (anterior, posterior, medial, lateral) and two poles (superior, inferior). It is held in its normal position by several paired ligaments: suspensory ligament of the ovary, proper ovarian ligaments (ligament of ovary) and mesovarium.</p>
                            <p>Ovaries receive arterial supply from the ovarian arteries, which arise from the abdominal aorta. These blood vessels reach the gonads by traveling within the suspensory ligaments. Venous blood of the ovaries is drained by the pampiniform plexus. These veins later coalesce and form the ovarian veins. The right ovarian vein drains into the inferior vena cava, whereas the left ovarian vein flows into the left renal vein.</p>

                            <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">Uterine Tubes</h4>
                            <p>The uterine (fallopian) tubes are bilateral muscular organs that extend from the uterine horns to the superior poles of the ovaries. The fallopian tubes represent the usual site for ovum fertilization. They also transport the resulting zygote into the uterus for implantation.</p>
                            <p>The uterine tubes are intraperitoneal organs, covered completely by a part of the broad ligament of the uterus called the mesosalpinx. They consist of four main parts:</p>

                            <p>The breasts are the mammary glands, varying in size according to age, heredity, and the amount of fatty tissue present. Each breast has 15-20 glandular lobes separated by connective tissue. After childbirth, the pituitary gland stimulates these lobules with the hormone prolactin... and they produce milk.</p>

In the center is the nipple, where ducts from the lobules open. The first secretion from the breast is not a true milk, but a thin yellowish substance called colostrum. Colostrum contains nutrients and the mother's immunities that can protect baby.</p>

                            <p>Most of the male reproductive system is located outside of your abdominal cavity or pelvis. The external parts of the male reproductive system include the penis, the scrotum and the testicles.</p>

                            <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">Penis</h4>
                            <p>The penis is the male organ for sexual intercourse. It has three parts:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li class="list-item">
                                    <span class="list-marker"></span>
                                    <span class="list-content"><strong>The root:</strong> This is the part of the penis that attaches to the wall of your abdomen.</span>
                                </li>
                                <li class="list-item">
                                    <span class="list-marker"></span>
                                    <span class="list-content"><strong>The body or shaft:</strong> Shaped like a tube or cylinder, the body of the penis is made up of three internal chambers. Inside these chambers there's a special, sponge-like erectile tissue that contains thousands of large spaces that fill with blood when you're sexually aroused. As the penis fills with blood, it becomes rigid and erect, which allows for penetration during sex. The skin of the penis is loose and elastic, allowing for changes in penis size during an erection.</span>
                                </li>
                                <li class="list-item">
                                    <span class="list-marker"></span>
                                    <span class="list-content"><strong>The glans:</strong> This is the cone-shaped end of the penis. The glans, which is also called the head of the penis, is covered with a loose layer of skin called foreskin. This skin is sometimes removed in a procedure called circumcision.</span>
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Semen, which contains sperm, is expelled (ejaculated) through the end of the penis when a man reaches sexual climax (orgasm). When the penis is erect, the flow of urine is blocked from the urethra, allowing only semen to be ejaculated at orgasm.</p>

                            <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">Scrotum</h4>
                            <p>The scrotum is the loose pouch-like sac of skin that hangs behind the penis. It holds the testicles (also called testes), as well as many nerves and blood vessels. The scrotum protects your testes, as well as providing a sort of climate control system. For normal sperm development, the testes must be at a temperature slightly cooler than the body temperature. Special muscles in the wall of the scrotum allow it to contract (tighten) and relax, moving the testicles closer to the body for warmth and protection or farther away from the body to cool the temperature.</p>

                            <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">Testicles (testes)</h4>
                            <p>The testes are oval organs about the size of very large olives that lie in the scrotum, secured at either end by a structure called the spermatic cord. Most men have two testes. The testes are responsible for making testosterone, the primary male sex hormone, and for producing sperm. Within the testes are coiled masses of tubes called seminiferous tubules. These tubules are responsible for producing the sperm cells through a process called spermatogenesis.</p>

                            <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">Epididymis</h4>
                            <p>The epididymis is a long, coiled tube that rests on the backside of each testicle. It carries and stores sperm cells that are created in the testes. It's also the job of the epididymis to bring the sperm to maturity — the sperm that emerge from the testes are immature and incapable of fertilization. During sexual arousal, contractions force the sperm into the vas deferens.</p>
