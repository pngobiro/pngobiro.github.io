                            <h3 class="card-title">4.2.1 Concepts in supervision</h3>
                            <p>Historically, and across professions, supervision has been an endeavor of task oversight and punitive, critical corrective actions. However, alternative modes of supervision have recently emerged, including supportive supervision.</p>
                            <p>Facilitative supervision is considered a best practice for CHW supervision in international settings and includes collaborative reviews, observations, monitoring, constructive feedback, participation, problem-solving, and training and education.</p>
                            <p>Such a comprehensive supervisory strategy is of particular importance to the success of CHW programs and facilitates the empowerment of CHWs across disparate health care settings.</p>
                            <p>Supervision refers to the direct and immediate guidance and control of subordinates in the performance of their task.” Thus, the supervision is concerned with three main functions of management, i.e., direction, immediate guidance and control with a view —</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>To see, they are working, according to plans, policies, programmes, instructions and the time schedule,</li>
                                <li>To guide them at the work if they are doing something inconsistent to directions given and need help so as to let them able to accomplish their assigned task, and</li>
                                <li>To give them directions to get the work done, if necessary.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>It is about ‘empowerment and not control, emphasizing building confidence and self-esteem through supportive feedback’. It is facilitated through an encouraging and respectful relationship with community health service provider.</p>
                            <p>It sets expectations, monitors and assesses performance, identifies problems and opportunities in which the supervisor remains an intermediary promoting collaboration in problem solving and linking to external resources.</p>
                            <p>The concept of facilitative supervision is to place within the health system individuals whose purpose is to coordinate the aspects of the health system which support community health service providers in service delivery.</p>
                            <p>A facilitative supervisor’s job is to identify everything that his/her community health service providers need to succeed – including continued training, supply of medicines, easy mobility, emotional support etc. and ensure that these supports are in place.</p>
                            <p>Good quality supervision is crucial for community health service providers to remain motivated and active in their jobs and to feel valued in their work. Community health service providers always feel a ‘value-add’ for participating in a supervision exercise, and not come to fear or avoid it. It should an opportunity to share their concerns, help them to overcome the challenges they have experienced in their work, and to learn more about the work that they are carrying out through the knowledge sharing and coaching of the supervisor.</p>
                            <p>For many, supervision also means ‘line-management’ and therefore CHWs may feel reluctant to report the difficulties they have. This attitude will limit the effectiveness of the supervision in improving work quality and eventually lead to supervisees becoming demoralized.</p>
                            <p>Creating and open dialogue and a mentoring relationship will be most effective in helping them to report, identify and resolve the problems they have and will lead to genuine improvements competencies improvement over time.</p>
                            <p>Facilitative supervision is a major component of continuous quality improvement in health services.</p>

In supervision, knowledge and information (theory base), personal development and skills training is carried out. Supervision is also of learning by doing, allowing supervisees to reflect on their work with in the presence of an experienced person who enables that reflection. Supervisors inevitably fill in gaps in knowledge, increase skills, make practical what was only abstract knowledge but what must now become working knowledge. A link is established between theory and practice.</p>

It is this function that provides the ‘containment’ side of supervision.</p>

                            <p>Mentoring is a process of deploying experienced individual to provide guidance and advice that will help to develop the careers of mentees allocated to them.</p>
                            <p>“A mentoring relationship is a relationship between two or more people, (whether formalised or not) where the relationship has a specific purpose. The relationship is reciprocal and both parties benefit, albeit in different ways. The mentor-mentee relationship is dynamic with different stages or phases. Each mentor-mentee relationship is unique although there may be certain general characteristics in all mentor-mentee relationships. This relationship transcends duty and obligation and often involves coaching, networking, sponsoring and career counselling”. (Meyer, M 2006).</p>
