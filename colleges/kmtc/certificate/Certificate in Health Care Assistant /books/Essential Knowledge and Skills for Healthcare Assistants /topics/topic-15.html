                            <p>Why write a chapter on urinalysis? Surely it just involves dipping a test strip into a pot of urine and reading the result? What could be difficult about that? Of course, there is much more to it as an important diagnostic tool that is all too often very badly performed, resulting in inadequate or inaccurate information and a potentially incorrect diagnosis. As with any other task the HCA performs, it is always easier to perform it well and accurately if there is an understanding of what is being tested for and why.</p>

                                    <p>Urine has historically been used for many different things and it has had many magical qualities attributed to it. Some tribes in Siberia drink the urine of people who have eaten magic mushrooms in the belief that this will help them communicate with the spirits. Ancient Romans used urine to bleach clothes. It has been used as an antiseptic and as a teeth whitener, and is thought by many different cultures to cure any number of ailments, from acne, warts, hair loss, wrinkles and gastric upset, to name but a few!</p>

                                What Do The Kidneys Do?
                            </h2>
                        </div>
                        
                        <div class="content-card content-card--accent">
                            <p>We have two kidneys, both weighing about 160 g and measuring 10–15 cm long. They filter the toxins and waste products from the blood, and these are then excreted in the urine.</p>
                            
                            <p>Each kidney contains approximately 2 million microscopic sieves or filtering systems called nephrons, which consist of networks of capillaries called glomeruli, where the first phase of filtration occurs. The Bowman's capsule surrounds each glomerulus and is connected to a long tube or 'tubule'. The kidney receives about one litre of blood every minute. This blood is filtered through the nephrons and the resulting fluid is sent through the long tubule, where most of the water, essential salts, such as potassium, sodium and other substances such as glucose, amino acids and vitamins are reabsorbed back into the bloodstream. The remaining water, urea and other waste substances make up the urine, and this is passed down the ureter to the bladder. Urine is normally made up of 5 per cent salts and ammonia and 95 per cent water.</p>
                            
                            <p>Approximately two litres of urine are produced in 24 hours, but this can vary greatly, and depends on factors such as fluid intake, sweating and general health.</p>
                            
                            <p>The kidneys are essential for maintaining <strong>homeostasis</strong> – the normal balance of fluids and salts or electrolytes upon which the proper functioning of the body depends.</p>
                            
                            <p>The kidneys also secrete some essential hormones such as erythropoietin, which is needed to make red blood cells. For this reason, patients with kidney failure may become anaemic (lacking in oxygen) if they fail to produce enough of this hormone, and therefore lack red blood cells to carry the oxygen.</p>
                            
                            <p>The nephrons are very delicate structures and easily damaged, especially when pressures are increased, such as in hypertension, or where the renal artery supplying the kidney with blood is narrowed (renal artery stenosis). When they are damaged, the sieves or filters become leaky, and larger molecules such as proteins (not normally seen in urine) may become detectable.</p>

                            <h3>Look at it</h3>
                            <p>Normal urine is straw coloured and transparent. So, to begin with, have a good look at it and assess if the sample looks normal.</p>
                            <p>Is it dark or pale? If it is very pale, it indicates a good level of hydration. If very dark, it may indicate dehydration.</p>
                            <p>What colour is it? The colour of the urine can also be altered by medication, foodstuff and disease. Red or pink urine may indicate blood, but may also be caused by eating beetroot! Bright yellow urine can be caused by some vitamins and other medications. Brown urine may indicate the presence of bilirubin if, for example, there is gall bladder disease, but it may also be caused by iron supplements. Turbid or cloudy urine may indicate infection. Frothy urine can be due to the presence of glucose or protein.</p>
                            <p>So, before you have even opened the urine bottle, you may already have some idea of the health, hydration or even diet of the patient.</p>

                            <h3>Smell it</h3>
                            <p>Once you've opened the urine bottle, notice if there is any offensive smell.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>A <strong>faecal smell</strong> could mean that there is a fistula, or direct connection between the bowel and bladder where faeces is able to contaminate the urine.</li>
                                <li>A <strong>fruity, sweet smell</strong> could be significant in a diabetic patient who may have ketoacidosis.</li>
                                <li>If the urine smells of <strong>asparagus</strong>, it is probably because the patient has been eating asparagus!</li>
                                <li>An unpleasant strong smell of <strong>ammonia</strong> could be due to a bacterial infection.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h3>Dip it</h3>
                            <p>The presence of various substances in the urine that can be detected on the dip test can be very useful to the clinician in making a diagnosis.</p>
