                                Healthcare Assistants and Assistant Practitioners
                            </h2>
                        </div>
                        
                        <div class="content-card">
                            <p>Healthcare assistants (HCAs) are increasingly at the front line of healthcare. There are other titles in use, including healthcare support worker, clinical support worker and nursing assistant, to name but a few, but for the purposes of this book I will use the title healthcare assistant (HCA) from here on. The development of the role in recent years has been exponential and left some nurses shaking their heads in disbelief and asking if their own role is being eroded at a similar rate. Other nurses have embraced the role with open arms, regarding it as an opportunity to develop their own role and broaden their skills in other more complex areas.</p>
                            
                            <p>It is difficult to establish exactly where and when the HCA role started to enter the scene.</p>
                            
                            <p>Support workers and HCAs can be found as far back as the Crimean War, and the role of the auxiliary nurse was then established in 1955 (Kessler et al. 2010). The NHS & Community Care Act (1990) formally recognised the HCA role, introducing it as a role to complement the existing auxiliary nursing role. Support workers have since been adopted to a greater or lesser extent in every area of health and social care. The Royal College of Nursing (RCN) has recognised the importance of support workers as providing a large proportion of hands-on care in the many different settings, and describes them as 'hugely valued members of the nursing team' (RCN 2018). This is quite a leap forward from when I began my nursing career in 1980. I can remember some extraordinarily capable state-enrolled nurses (SENs) and nursing auxiliaries in my early nursing days, but I only became aware of the healthcare assistant role in the mid-1990s. The practice I worked for felt that there was a need for a member of staff to be specifically employed to assist in taking blood pressures and other physiological measurements, as well as performing other various administrative tasks that were historically part of the practice nurse role. These were considered as tasks that were an inappropriate use of the practice nurse's skills and time. The GP contract was also emerging, and practice nurses started to move away from the treatment room and were given responsibility for more chronic disease management. We then needed somebody capable of performing the essential treatment room tasks such as phlebotomy and taking blood pressure. A member of the reception staff was duly sent on the only course for HCAs that was available at the time and I was asked to be her mentor. This was the start of my long and happy acquaintance with the HCA role. Together with a practice nurse colleague, I became very interested in the emerging role, and we quickly realised that the training provided was either very patchy or non-existent, with little ongoing support for newly trained HCAs. We developed accredited training courses and update days for HCAs, and began to understand the full potential of this new and exciting role in the nursing team.</p>

                                    <p>Other driving forces behind the rise of the HCA role include increasing pressure on primary and secondary healthcare systems due to the ageing population, the rise in chronic disease, advances in medical treatments, increasing costs of delivering healthcare, increasing patient expectations, and shortages of qualified healthcare staff.</p>

                            <p>The role of assistant practitioner (AP), also known as associate practitioner, was developed to plug the gap that existed between the HCAs and registered nurses, and involved completing a foundation degree at level 4. Skills for Health (2011a) has defined the AP as a worker who competently delivers health and social care to and for people, with a level of knowledge and skills beyond that of the traditional HCA. The AP delivers more complex health and social care and undertakes clinical work that was previously only within the remit of registered health professionals.</p>

                                What Is Happening About Regulation?
                            </h2>
                        </div>
                        
                        <div class="content-card">
                            <p>As word spread about reception staff becoming HCAs and performing phlebotomy, blood pressures, and numerous other clinical and administrative tasks, new HCAs began to appear everywhere in primary (and secondary) care. Kessler et al. (2010) estimated the number of those defined as support workers who support clinical staff as 284,000 in England in 2008. In 2017, that number had increased to 365,966 (NHS 2017).</p>
                            
                            <p>Unfortunately, because there is still no regulation of HCAs or APs, the title of HCA or AP (or equivalent) is not protected, unlike the title of 'nurse'. Consequently, anyone can put on a badge that says 'Healthcare Assistant' and no one is any the wiser in terms of how much or how little training that individual has had. Regulation would eliminate this scandalous anomaly, and would result in standardised training, competencies and conduct for the HCA/AP, and a clearer understanding of the role for all concerned, thereby ensuring safer practice and improving the outcome for the worker, the employer and - most importantly - the patient.</p>

                                    <p>When I was writing the first edition of this book, the call for regulation was given a huge boost with the publication of the Francis Report (Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust 2013). The inquiry was set up following the disclosure of appalling care resulting in patient suffering, and in many cases premature death, in hospitals within the Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust.</p>
                                    <p>The report made many recommendations, including the need for a uniform description of healthcare support workers that clearly distinguished them from registered nurses. It also recommended that healthcare support workers working for the NHS or for the independent sector should be registered and have a national code of conduct, with a common set of national standards for education and training to be overseen by the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC).</p>
                                </div>
                            </div>

                            <p>We do now at least have codes of conduct for healthcare support workers (HCSWs), which are to be used alongside the National Minimum Training Standards for Healthcare Support Workers and Adult Social Care Workers in England. These were produced in 2013 by Skills for Care in partnership with Skills for Health, and were based on similar codes of conduct for healthcare support workers produced previously in Scotland and Wales (NHS Scotland 2009; NHS Wales 2011; Skills for Health 2013). Many trusts and health boards are now striving to make some sort of training mandatory, as far as possible. The 'Care Certificate' that was launched in England (Skills for Health 2015a) has attempted to introduce a form of voluntary induction training for HCAs. It identifies a set of standards that HCAs should adhere to in their daily working life, specifically in areas such as role development, communication skills, patient dignity and privacy, but from my conversations with HCAs and nurses around the country, the uptake is very variable and many are unaware of its existence. Hopefully this will improve, and it is certainly a step in the right direction, but because these innovations are very dependent on voluntary participation, uptake of the training will always be an issue. I feel very strongly that regulation is the real issue here, but we are sadly no closer to this now than we were five years ago. This is hugely disappointing, and I wonder what catastrophe will have to happen before this is addressed.</p>
                            
                            <p>Until regulation for HCAs and APs happens, they must be given every opportunity and be actively encouraged to attend relevant courses and achieve accredited training to ensure competence in their area of work. It should not be acceptable for the ideology of 'see one, do one' to apply to HCAs or APs, where the range of ability and knowledge can vary so hugely. The public (you and me!) have a right to expect that when they are treated by a healthcare worker, that person has the relevant training and competence.</p>

                            <p>The nursing associate (NA) and trainee nursing associate (TNA) are new healthcare roles that were introduced by the Department of Health in England in 2017. As with the assistant practitioner role, they were introduced to bridge the gap between HCAs and registered nurses, but this time there will be a recognised route into nursing for those who want to make that career move. Understandably, there have been concerns voiced by APs who wonder where their role will fit in the grand scheme of things (RCN 2017a). Hopefully there will be some sort of bridging programme to allow APs to become NAs, but this has yet to be clarified. The good news is that at least the NAs are now regulated by the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) in time for the first cohort of NAs who will qualify in January 2019 (NMC 2018).</p>
                            
                            <p>At present, the NA role has only been introduced in England, and there are no plans to introduce them in Northern Ireland, Scotland or Wales.</p>
                            
                            <p>This role is not the same as the nursing apprentice, which is a new direct route into nursing, but these students may work as HCAs while also completing their degree-level training over at least four years.</p>
