                            <p>Many HCAs are now being asked to perform lung function testing to assist the nurse in the chronic disease clinic managing patients with respiratory disease. This chapter will give an overview of the anatomy and physiology of the respiratory system and common respiratory diseases to enhance your understanding and enable you to perform lung function testing more efficiently and accurately. You will need to complete a recognised course in spirometry before performing this task. Following concerns that the spirometry technique employed in many places was substandard, NHS England has implemented a scheme whereby any health professional (GP, nurse or HCA) who is involved in lung function testing must be trained to a specific standard by 2021 (Price 2016). The Association for Respiratory Technology and Physiology (ARTP) is the only organisation to offer national, professionally recognised qualifications in respiratory function testing and spirometry in the UK, and they now maintain the national register, which has been created to identify all appropriately trained and/or certified practitioners. HCAs will need to complete the foundation certificate, and this will enable them to perform the procedure competently, but not to interpret results.</p>

                                Why Do We Need to Breathe?
                            </h2>
                        </div>

                            <p>Breathing is something most of us take for granted and rarely think about unless we become short of breath for some reason.</p>
                            <p>Effective respiration provides us with essential oxygen, which must then be transferred from our airways into the bloodstream for distribution to all the organs and cells of the body. Oxygen is essential to help convert food into energy in our cells. This is called metabolism. Effective respiration also helps us to get rid of carbon dioxide, which is a waste product of metabolism and can become very toxic to the body if it accumulates.</p>
                            
                            <p>When you inhale (breathe in), the diaphragm and muscles between the ribs (intercostal muscles) contract and make the chest cavity expand. As the chest expands, the pressure in the chest will drop, and because the outside air pressure is now greater, air flows into the lungs. As you exhale (breathe out), the diaphragm and intercostal muscles relax, reducing the size of the chest cavity. This increases the pressure inside the chest so that air from inside the lungs flows to the outside. The cycle is repeated every time you breathe.</p>
                            
                            <p>Oxygen-enriched air that we breathe in travels down the trachea and is then sent via the left and right bronchus to the bronchioles in the lungs. The bronchioles become smaller and constantly branch so that if you looked at the inside of a healthy lung, it would look something like the branches of a very dense tree in miniature. At the end of every tiny branch, there is a tiny air sac called an alveolus. This is designed to maximise surface area for the exchange of gases (oxygen and carbon dioxide). From the outside, it looks like a tiny bunch of grapes wrapped in capillaries, which are tiny blood vessels. These contain deoxygenated blood — in other words, blood that has been all around the body and used up its oxygen supply. It is sent back from the heart to the lungs, via the pulmonary artery, to collect more oxygen. The artery becomes smaller and smaller until it forms the mesh of tiny capillaries with very thin walls that are only one cell thick. The mesh of capillaries wraps intimately around the alveolus. Oxygen from the air in the alveoli can then diffuse across the cell walls and into the blood to be taken back to the left side of the heart and sent off around the body again. Carbon dioxide is transferred by the same mechanism in the opposite direction, back into the lungs and then exhaled.</p>

                            <p>Asthma is a very common disease. There are 5.4 million people currently receiving treatment for asthma in the UK, which equates to one in every 11 people, or one in five households.</p>
                            <p>In 2016, 1,410 people died from asthma, and in most cases their deaths were entirely preventable (Asthma UK 2018).</p>

                            <h3>So, what is it?</h3>
                            <p>There is no standardised definition of the type, severity or frequency of symptoms, nor of the findings on investigation, for asthma. There are various possible symptoms, including wheeziness, breathlessness, chest tightness, cough and variable airflow obstruction. There may also be airway hyper-responsiveness and airway inflammation as components of the disease (Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network 2016). It can affect people of any age and can change throughout a person's life and it is characterised by attacks (or exacerbations), with the severity and frequency of attacks varying from person to person (NICE 2017).</p>

                                    <p>For those who have never had problems breathing, try taking in a little breath. Don't breathe out, but take in another little breath, and keep doing this until you can't breathe in any more. This is what it feels like not to be able to get any more air into your lungs.</p>
                                    <p>It's quite frightening, isn't it?</p>

                            <p>Asthma is very common, often misunderstood and often poorly managed. It can be very variable, very distressing and disabling, and can be life-threatening, but most of the time it can be treated.</p>
                            <p>The airways may become twitchy and constrict easily. There might be swelling or inflammation or mucus in the airways as well, which will make the airflow difficult. When the airways get smaller, the person with asthma might cough or wheeze or have difficulty breathing. Sometimes they may feel as if their chest is tight or as if there is a band around the chest. This usually happens in response to a trigger, and there are many possible triggers.</p>

                            <h3>Diagnosis and treatment</h3>
                            <p>Testing for airway inflammation is increasingly being used for diagnosis in clinical practice, and this has been endorsed in the NICE guidance (NICE 2017), but will take some time to implement everywhere. It involves measuring the amount of fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) because this will be raised in patients who have inflamed airways and who are more likely to respond well to steroid treatment. A FeNO level above 40 makes asthma and the response to an inhaled steroid very likely, while a level under 20 makes it unlikely (Thomas 2018).</p>
                            <p>Asthma can be treated with various inhalers and tablets, and the treatment follows a stepwise approach (Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network 2016), stepping up from occasional use of a bronchodilator inhaler (this will widen the airways) to regular use of inhaled steroids that help to stop the swelling and inflammation in the airways. Some patients will need very strong doses of inhaled steroids to control their symptoms, and some may also have inhalers that give a long-acting bronchodilator action.</p>

                                Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)
                            </h2>
                        </div>
                        
                        <div class="content-card content-card--alternate">
                            <p>An estimated 1.2 million people have been diagnosed with COPD in the UK, making this the second most common lung disease after asthma. The prevalence increases with age, and figures published by the British Lung Foundation (2018) indicate that 2 per cent of the whole population (4.5 per cent of people over the age of 40) have been diagnosed with COPD.</p>
                            
                            <p>COPD is usually associated with smoking, and because smoking levels are much higher in some disadvantaged sectors of the community, especially in people who have mental health issues, these people tend to be disproportionately affected by COPD compared with the rest of the population (ASH 2016a, 2016b). COPD can also have occupational causes such as exposure to dust or toxins. A small percentage of people with COPD may have inherited a condition called alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency, which results in destruction of the alveoli – the tiny air sacs at the end of the bronchioles.</p>

                            <h3>So, what is it?</h3>
                            <p>COPD is a term used to describe various conditions, including chronic bronchitis, emphysema, chronic obstructive airways disease and chronic airflow limitation. Patients with COPD experience progressive breathlessness, chronic productive cough and limited exercise capacity. This is caused by airflow obstruction that is not reversible in the way that asthma is. There is permanent damage to the airways and treatment options are limited.</p>

                            <h3>Managing COPD</h3>
                            <p>Smoking cessation is the most important treatment, and it is never too late to stop, despite what the patient may think. If the disease is in the early stages and symptoms are mild, no other treatment may be needed. Even if the patient has been a heavy smoker for most of their life, stopping smoking can still slow down the progression of the disease.</p>

                            <p>The patient should have been advised not to smoke for at least an hour before (preferably 24 hours if possible), not to have had a heavy meal for at least four hours, not to have had an alcoholic drink for at least four hours, not to have had any vigorous activity for 30 minutes, and not to wear restrictive clothing. Any deviations from these requirements should be documented.</p>
                            <p>If the patient is attending for routine monitoring, they can have their inhalers as usual. If they are attending for baseline reversibility testing, they should have no short-acting bronchodilator for four hours, no long-acting bronchodilator for eight hours, and no sustained-release bronchodilators for 36 hours (Primary Care Commissioning 2013).</p>

This is done first because the airways are likely to collapse prematurely when the patient with COPD tries to blow out hard. Place a nose clip on the patient or ask them to hold their nose. Ask the patient to breathe in as deeply as they can, place their lips around the mouthpiece to form a seal, and then blow out slowly and steadily for as long as they can. This is almost like sighing. Wait at least 30 seconds before repeating, and then repeat twice if possible, to ensure the results are consistent, accurate and reproducible.</li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker">9</span><strong>Now perform the forced vital capacity.</strong> Remove the nose clip. Ask the patient to take a deep breath in, place their lips around the mouthpiece to form a seal, and then blow out forcibly and rapidly for as long as they can until they have no breath left to blow out. This should take between 6 and 15 seconds. Take a minimum of three readings if possible. Wait at least 30 seconds between each attempt. The best two readings should have the FVC within \(100\mathrm{ml}\) of each other.</li>
