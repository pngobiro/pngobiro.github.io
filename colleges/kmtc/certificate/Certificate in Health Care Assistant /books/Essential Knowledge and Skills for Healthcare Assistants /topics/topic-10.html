                            <p>In recent years, the role of the chaperone in healthcare has been recognised as increasingly important for patients and healthcare providers alike. It is often performed badly, leaving the health professional and patient open to abuse, and so it is vital that all those who are to perform the role understand the reason for it and can do it properly. This chapter will outline the history behind the current situation and will provide guidelines for healthcare workers who may be asked to perform this role in the future.</p>
                            <p>All healthcare professionals have become acutely aware of the need to protect themselves from allegations of malpractice in today's litigious society. Furthermore, it has become clear that the title of 'doctor' or 'nurse' does not always guarantee protection for the patient. Consider the case of Harold Shipman, who was a GP who murdered more than 200 patients (Smith 2003). Consider also the case of Jimmy Savile, who so blatantly abused his position of trust as a hospital porter and used his status as a respected fundraising celebrity to abuse children and vulnerable patients for many decades. It is an unfortunate fact of life that in any sector of society, there will be people who will choose to abuse their positions of trust and respect to satisfy their own perverse needs. Baker (2004), writing about Shipman, argues that systems to protect the public and regulate the professions have been inadequate.</p>

                            <p>In 2004, the Department of Health set up an independent investigation into how the NHS handled allegations about the conduct of GP Clifford Ayling (DoH 2004). He was convicted of 13 counts of indecent assault on patients between 1991 and 1998. The report describes a 'long history of continuing unease' regarding the GP's behaviour, which was overfamiliar and unprofessional when performing intimate examinations. His colleagues appear to have ignored the warning signs and 'reworked the truth' to make it more acceptable, and had ultimately failed their patients. This investigation culminated in the Ayling Inquiry of 2004, and it is this that has been the catalyst for the increased awareness of the importance of the role of the chaperone. The report recommended that all patients should be offered a chaperone for intimate examinations, and that each NHS trust should create a chaperone policy, make it explicit to patients and resource it accordingly. Despite this, research suggests that the use of chaperones is still afforded only a low priority, and many NHS trusts in England are still to implement a chaperone policy. Even where chaperones are used, many doctors are not recording this properly, and are therefore liable to medico-legal proceedings (MDDUS 2014).</p>
                            <p>Many staff performing the role of chaperone today have yet to receive any formal training in the role, and are unlikely to appreciate the full importance of it.</p>

                            <p>There is no established single definition of the term chaperone. It originates from the fifteenth century, when it meant 'hood for a hawk', and later came to mean 'a woman who protects a young single woman'. In French, the word 'chaperonner' means to cover with a hood, and today the word is used in the sense of 'protector' (Wai et al. 2008).</p>

                                    <p>A Medical Protection fact sheet (Medical Protection 2016) defines the term 'chaperone' as 'an independent person, appropriately trained, whose role is to independently observe the examination/procedure undertaken by the doctor/health professional to assist the appropriate doctor–patient relationship'.</p>

                            <p>The chaperone can act as an advocate for the patient, assessing their understanding and offering an explanation when necessary. However, no matter how good the chaperone is, this does not negate the need for good communication and an adequate explanation of the procedure by the health professional performing the examination.</p>

                            <h3>What if a patient declines to have a chaperone?</h3>
                            <p>It is important to document that the offer was made and declined. The health worker should explain that they would prefer a chaperone to be present and explain the role of the chaperone. They should explore the reasons why the patient doesn't want a chaperone and address any concerns they may have. The healthcare professional may decline to examine the patient in this case if, in their clinical judgement, this would put them at risk of unjust or invalid accusation.</p>

                            <h3>Chaperone policy</h3>
                            <p>There should be a chaperone policy in place so that all members of the team understand what the role entails. The policy should be clearly advertised in the surgery through patient information leaflets, websites and on notice boards. You, as the HCA, may be the best person to prepare an information poster for the waiting areas. The poster should outline the role and availability of chaperones and how patients can request one. Clear notices will reassure patients and increase understanding regarding the need of either doctor or patient to expect an extra degree of protection.</p>

                            <h3>The HCA as chaperone</h3>
                            <p>Before the Ayling Inquiry (DoH 2004), there were very few, if any, recommendations as to who should act as a chaperone, and it would usually have been the nurse or female receptionist who were expected to perform the role. Friends or relatives may also have been used as chaperones, but are no longer considered appropriate. For patients with learning difficulties, a family member or carer may be present to support the patient, and in this instance a careful and sensitive explanation of the procedure is vital.</p>
                            <p>As a HCA, the role of chaperone will be one you can perform very competently, providing you have the appropriate training.</p>
                            <p>As a member of the clinical staff, you will usually have a Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) check, but where non-clinical staff are used for this role, they will need to have a DBS check depending on their specific duties as chaperone and the contact they have with patients, especially children and vulnerable adults (CQC 2017a).</p>
                            <p>Remember that as a HCA, you might need to have a chaperone yourself for some procedures. For example, when performing an ECG, you may need a chaperone, particularly if you are a male HCA and your patient is female, or when performing a wound dressing where clothing is removed.</p>
                            <p>Men appear to be unfairly discriminated against when having an intimate examination because most chaperones are female. There should (ideally) be men available in the practice who can chaperone male patients if required, but obviously this won't always be possible.</p>

                            <h3>Chaperoning the gay or transgender patient</h3>
                            <p>Remember, gay patients may prefer a chaperone of the opposite gender. All patients should be able to choose the gender of their chaperone if possible. Take care to use preferred gender titles with transgender patients.</p>

                                    <p>The doctor has asked you to act as chaperone for him to perform a breast examination. When you go into the room, you realise that the patient is someone you know quite well, and she appears quite nervous and flustered when she sees you.</p>
                                    <p>Dr Jones quickly introduces you to the patient (Mrs X) and asks you to stand just inside the curtain at the foot of the bed. Mrs X takes off her blouse, as instructed by the doctor, but has some difficulty with the buttons, so you help her. You make some small talk to try to relax her as she seems very tense – you ask about her children and chat about the recent bad weather. You also admire her all-over tan, all the time trying to relax Mrs X.</p>
                                    <p>Dr Jones comes behind the curtain and stands between you and the patient. He asks Mrs X to remove her bra and then proceeds to study her two breasts intently. He then asks Mrs X to raise her hands above her head and then to put her hands on her hips, all the while staring at her breasts. You're feeling a little embarrassed by now, so you look the other way and hope Mrs X will notice that you're not staring as well.</p>
                                    <p>Dr Jones then proceeds to feel both Mrs X's breasts, as well as in the armpits and around the neck. Mrs X is looking very red and uncomfortable, and you do find yourself wondering why he needs to be so thorough when she only complained of a lump in one breast. Still, he's the doctor and must know what he's doing.</p>
                                    <p>While examining Mrs X, Dr Jones talks to you, commenting on how busy the surgery is and asking if you will get the notes out for the next patient when you go out.</p>
                                    <p>When Dr Jones has finished examining Mrs X, and before she puts her top back on, he thanks you for your help and suggests that you can now leave. You're glad to get out because you just find the whole thing so awkward.</p>

                            </div>

                            <p><strong>How do you think the patient would have felt in this scenario, and why?</strong></p>
                            <p><strong>Using the information given in the chapter, suggest some ways this experience could have been improved for the patient and made safer in terms of protecting the doctor from allegations of malpractice.</strong></p>
                            
                            <p>The breast examination given in the scenario is exactly as it should be done, but if this is not explained to the patient it would seem a little odd.</p>
