                            <p>Examining people's feet may not sound like a very pleasant job, but for people who have diabetes it is vital that their feet are checked regularly. This can be a very suitable role for the HCA or AP who has completed appropriate training. The examination may be performed by the HCA in conjunction with other tests such as BMI, BP and relevant blood tests, and the patient can then be seen in a follow-up diabetic clinic with the appropriately trained nurse.</p>
                            <p>As with everything else you do, it is always useful to have a clear understanding of why the problems might occur and what you are looking for when you perform the task. This chapter will explain some of the underlying reasons for problems in the feet of diabetic patients and will identify how you can check for these to determine the patient's risk of ulceration.</p>

                            <p>Diabetes mellitus is the medical term used to encompass Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. The word Diabetes is Greek in origin, and means siphon (to pass through), referring to the glucose passing into the blood and urine. Mellitus is Latin in origin, and means honeyed or sweet. In medieval times, diabetes would be diagnosed by tasting the patient's urine to see if it was sweet. Fortunately, we have moved on a little in our testing techniques!</p>
                            
                            <p>There are an estimated 4.6 million people with diabetes in the UK. This figure includes 1 million people who are yet to be diagnosed and are unaware that they have it (Diabetes UK 2017).</p>
                            
                            <p>People without diabetes have a pancreas that produces a hormone called insulin. We need glucose in its simplest form to provide our cells with energy so that they can work efficiently. When we ingest glucose or more complex carbohydrates that are broken down into glucose, the insulin acts like a key to facilitate the entry of glucose through the cell wall and into the cell.</p>

                            <p>This is because of two main factors: peripheral neuropathy and peripheral vascular disease.</p>

                            <h3>Peripheral Neuropathy</h3>
                            <p>About half of patients with diabetes are likely to have some degree of peripheral neuropathy (Boulton 2005). This is nerve damage that is caused by increased glucose circulating in the blood. The glucose injures the walls of the arteries and prevents essential nutrients from reaching the nerves. Nerves carry messages of sensation and pain. If the nerves are damaged, patients may experience symptoms such as numbness, tingling, burning or stabbing pain, extreme sensitivity to touch, skin, hair or nail changes, and a lack of coordination. The patient may lose sensation in the feet and may not know if they have an injury.</p>
                            
                            <div class="callout callout--danger">

                                <div class="callout-content">
                                    <p>This loss of protective sensation (LOPS) is the single most important risk factor in the development of a foot ulcer.</p>

                            </div>

                            <p>Severe neuropathy can also cause a rare deformity called <strong>Charcot foot</strong>. The bones in the foot become weak and can fracture, and if the patient continues to walk on these weakened or fractured bones, the foot will change shape and will develop the characteristic 'rocker bottom'. Sometimes there may be a deformity on the side of the foot as well (see Figure 16.2). The protrusion forms a point of increased pressure, and can ulcerate and become infected easily.</p>

                            <h3>Peripheral Vascular Disease</h3>
                            <p>Diabetes is strongly associated with atherosclerosis, which is the narrowing of the arteries due to fatty deposits (atheroma). Associated risk factors include hypertension, smoking and hyperlipidaemia. Blood flow is reduced, and skin with a poor blood supply is more prone to damage and does not heal well. It is estimated that 10 per cent of people with diabetes will have a diabetic foot ulcer at some point in their lives (NICE 2015).</p>
