                            <p>Working in a healthcare setting with members of the public is a very responsible role, and you must be aware of your legal obligations and your patients' rights. The three most important issues pertaining to the legal aspects of your role are confidentiality, consent and record-keeping. This chapter will unpick each of these concepts, and will provide a few useful tips to enable you to fulfil your legal obligations and to ultimately protect your patient and yourself. Legislation relevant to the topics to be discussed is listed in Box 7.1.</p>

                            <p>As a healthcare assistant, you will already have some understanding of the importance of confidentiality and of the potential repercussions for you and the patient when confidentiality is broken. Anyone with access to patient information must have a contract that clearly stipulates the principles of confidentiality and the resulting disciplinary action that could result where those principles are not adhered to. This chapter will consider how to maintain confidentiality when dealing with patient information.</p>

                            <h3>What is confidentiality and why is it so important?</h3>
                            <p>Confidentiality is a fundamental part of professional practice.</p>
                            <p>It is the legal obligation that is derived from statutory and case law, as well as forming part of the duty of care to a patient (Beech 2007).</p>
                            <p>Patients have a legal right to expect that any information they give to a healthcare professional will be used only for the purpose for which it was given and will not be disclosed to others without permission. It is important because the patient is in a vulnerable position and is dependent on the healthcare worker. There must be trust in this relationship if the patient is to offer vital information and comply with treatment.</p>
                            <p>There is a great deal of legislation that has been developed to protect this right (see Box 7.1).</p>

                            <h3>Disclosure</h3>
                            <p>Disclosure means the giving of information, and requires consent from the individual if it is to be lawful and ethical. If possible, consent should be freely and fully given by the information-giver. The only exception here is where there is a statutory obligation to disclose or if that disclosure can be justified as being in the public interest (DoH 2012).</p>
                            <p>This may be, for example, where there is a risk of significant harm to individuals or groups, or society in general (e.g. child abuse, drug trafficking or serious crime).</p>
                            <p>Sometimes information may be shared with other people or organisations not directly involved in the person's care on a 'need-to-know' basis. In this case, the patient must be aware that this information is to be shared, unless the health worker feels there may be a violent response (see Box 7.2).</p>
                            <p>In some cases, information may be withheld from a patient if the clinician considers that it would cause serious harm to the physical or mental health of the patient or would breach the confidentiality of another patient.</p>

                                    <p>Susan, the practice nurse, was consulting with Jenny, a patient who was three months pregnant. Jenny had attended for a blood test, but while there she confided that she was taking amphetamines. Susan was very concerned about the potential risk to the baby and advised the patient against taking such drugs. She documented the consultation carefully but did not explain to the patient that this information would now be available to other healthcare professionals. When consulting the doctor a week later, Jenny happened to see her notes on a poorly positioned computer screen and was very upset to see what had been written. She complained that this information was confidential and she had not thought it would be documented. In this case, the nurse was right to document the information because of the potential risk to the unborn child, but she should have made it clear to Jenny that she would have to disclose this information to other health professionals.</p>

                            <h3>The Caldicott Report</h3>
                            <p>The Caldicott Report (DoH 1997) was commissioned by the Chief Medical Officer when there was concern regarding the increasing use of information technology resulting in the easy dissemination of patient information. The report outlined several key principles:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker">✅</span>Justify the purpose for collecting the information.</li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker">✅</span>Do not use patient-identifiable information unless necessary.</li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker">✅</span>Access to patient-identifiable information should be on a strict 'need-to-know' basis.</li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker">✅</span>All health workers who have access to patient information should be aware of their responsibilities and should understand and comply with the law.</li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker">✅</span>Each organisation should have an appointed 'Caldicott Guardian' responsible for ensuring adherence to the above principles.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h3>Avoiding accidental breaches of confidentiality</h3>
                            <p>You may not mean to breach confidentiality, but when you're busy and distracted it is all too easy to do so without realising. Observing a few simple rules will help guard against this (see Figure 7.1).</p>
                            
                            <p>Never leave records (including those on the computer screen) unattended where they may be read by unauthorised persons. Clear your desk at the end of the day and turn off your computer or put it into password-protected mode.</p>
                            
                            <p>Never discuss matters relating to patients outside of the clinical setting or discuss a case with a colleague in public where it may be overheard or seen by others from outside the clinical setting, such as on social networking sites. Remember that anything you write on social networking sites is never private and can never be completely deleted. There have been well-documented cases of nurses who have made this mistake and lost their jobs as a result. Healthcare workers should never put confidential patient information online or post inappropriate comments about patients, and the NMC have produced a leaflet on social media guidance for nurses. It is worth a read (NMC 2017).</p>
                            
                            <p>Watch out for accidental breaches of confidentiality. For example, take care when talking to friends outside of work not to disclose the fact that you saw a mutual acquaintance in the surgery.</p>
                            
                            <p>Think about telephone confidentiality. Avoid talking to patients on the phone in areas where personal information can be overheard by other patients.</p>
                            
                            <p>Always gain the patient's consent before you leave messages on an answering machine or with other family members. It can be helpful to use code words to make sure you are talking to a specific person and not just someone who is claiming to be that person.</p>
                            
                            <p>Remember, if information is passed to another party without consent, the patient may be able to bring a civil claim for breach of confidentiality against the health worker's employer and demand compensation.</p>

                            <p>Before any examination and before providing any treatment or care, you must obtain consent. You can never assume a patient has given you informed consent just because they are sitting in front of you and appear to be implying that they consent. Do they understand what the procedure involves, why it is being done, and what the possible benefits, risks and alternatives are? Do they understand the consequences of not receiving the proposed treatment? If they don't understand the information, then they cannot give informed consent. If anything goes wrong following the procedure, you run the risk of being charged with battery (a form of assault) or you may be accused of negligence.</p>
                            
                            <p>The whole process of establishing consent must be rigorous and transparent (see Box 7.3).</p>

                                    <p>Carole the HCA was good at taking blood, but on one occasion the patient developed a large bruise following the procedure. He complained to the practice manager and threatened to seek compensation from the practice for injury. It was discussed as a critical incident, but there was no suggestion that Carole's technique was to blame in this instance. It was understood that bruising is always a potential complication following venepuncture, and may be due to inappropriate activity too soon afterwards as much as to problems during the procedure or poor technique. To avoid any problems in the future, it was decided that patients would be given a short information leaflet outlining possible risks, including possible bruising, and the aftercare required following the procedure to reduce this risk. This would ensure that the patient had the necessary information to be able to give informed consent, with an understanding of what was being done and the possible risks. It was also an opportunity to provide written information about the required aftercare to the venepuncture site, advising against heavy lifting or excessive movement within four hours.</p>
                                    <p>This could have resulted in a claim against the surgery because failure to warn of risk is considered as negligence. There is quite a high chance of bruising in this case, but the harm is usually minimal. From a legal point of view, such a claim would be unlikely to succeed as it is very likely that if told of the risk, the patient would have consented to having the blood test done anyway. Nevertheless, it has the potential to create a great deal of stress and anxiety for all involved.</p>

                            <p>Capacity is the term used to denote the patient's ability to use and understand information and to decide on whether they want to proceed, and then to communicate that decision.</p>

                                    <p>We assume that every adult has the capacity to give informed consent unless the following apply:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>They are unable to take in or retain the information.</li>
                                        <li>They are unable to understand the information.</li>
                                        <li>They are unable to use the information to decide on whether to proceed.</li>

                            </div>

                            <p>When giving information about a procedure, it must be given in a way that is understandable to that patient. They must have enough time to consider this information and be given the opportunity to ask questions if they want to. We should regard the patient as a partner in the caregiving process and uphold their right to make decisions about the type of care and treatment they receive. We must also respect their decision to decline treatment even if we feel this is not in their best interest. If your patient declines treatment, always refer them back to the nurse or doctor as they may need more detailed information to enable them to decide on which course of action to take.</p>
                            
                            <p>Consent must be given freely, and never under duress or under influence from the health professional or family or friends. It can be withdrawn at any time during the procedure, in which case the procedure must be stopped immediately.</p>
                            
                            <p>Make sure that you accurately document discussions that relate to obtaining consent.</p>

                            <h3>Types of consent</h3>
                            <p>Verbal consent is usually sufficient for tasks that will be performed by the HCA working at level 3.</p>
                            <p>Written consent is needed where the procedure is lengthy, risky or complex. This provides evidence of the fact that discussions have taken place and of the patient's decision, but it does not necessarily protect the clinician. If the patient can subsequently prove that they did not have an adequate explanation or they were coerced or rushed into signing the consent form, the consent may be considered invalid.</p>

                            <h3>Who cannot give consent?</h3>

                                    <h4 class="feature-title">Children under 16</h4>
                                    <p class="feature-text">Legally, a person is not considered an adult until they are aged 18 or over. However, people between the ages of 16 and 18 can consent to or refuse medical treatment.</p>
                                    <p class="feature-text">In England and Wales, children under the age of 16 cannot consent to or refuse treatment as they are considered to lack the capacity, and only the person with parental responsibility can give or refuse consent on their behalf. Sometimes, if the child is considered to have significant understanding and intelligence so that they can make an informed decision about their treatment, this rule may be overturned. For contraception and sexual health issues, there is a set of guidelines called the Gillick Competency and Fraser Guidelines (NSPCC 2012) that clearly set out the criteria required for children under the age of 16 to be able to consent to their own treatment without the involvement of their parent(s).</p>
                                    <p class="feature-text">In Scotland, the parent's consent cannot override the refusal of a child under the age of 16 to treatment when the medical practitioner considers that the child can understand the nature and potential consequences of the treatment.</p>

                                    <p class="feature-text">I have had many discussions with HCAs regarding whether it is appropriate for them to be performing procedures such as venepuncture or ear irrigation on children under the age of 16. Although this is not specifically related to consent, it is perhaps a good time to mention it. There are no hard and fast rules about this, and it will depend on your local protocol and on whether the child will cooperate. Whenever you are in any doubt, always refer to the nurse or doctor.</p>
                                </div>
                            </div>

                            <h4>Who can give consent for children under 16?</h4>
                            <p>In recent years, HCAs have started to assist with the administration of intranasal influenza vaccines to children aged from 2 years up, and if you are one of those who has received the appropriate training and will be performing this task, it is very important that you understand who can give consent for the child to have this.</p>
                            <p>Consent for younger children can be given by the person who has parental responsibility (if that person has capacity and is able to communicate their decision). When that person brings the child in response to an invitation for immunisation and presents that child for immunisation, then this is normally considered as evidence of consent. They will usually have had a discussion with the health visitor and/or GP previously and will have signed a consent form.</p>
                            <p>The mother will normally have parental responsibility, but the father will only have parental responsibility if he was married to the mother when the child was born, or if he subsequently marries her or he is named as the father on the child's birth certificate. Parental responsibility can also be granted to the father by the court, or there may be a Parental Responsibility Agreement signed by both parents witnessed by an officer of the court.</p>
                            <p>Immunisation should only be carried out if both parents agree or if there is a specific court approval that the immunisation is in the best interests of the child.</p>
                            <p>The person with parental responsibility does not need to be present. The child may be brought by someone else such as a grandparent or childminder, but take care in this case and make sure consent has been obtained previously from the person with parental responsibility. If unsure, then you should contact them to confirm their consent.</p>
                            <p>When you are in any doubt, always refer to the registered nurse for advice.</p>

                            <h3>People who are mentally incapacitated</h3>
                            <p>Never make assumptions that a person is unable to make decisions or give informed consent based on their diagnosis, appearance or behaviour. When there is any doubt, the medical practitioner in charge of that person's care should make the decision based on the person's best interests.</p>
                            <p>No one else can give consent for a person, although the medical practitioner will usually involve close relatives to try to determine what the wishes of the person may have been if they previously had capacity, for example where the person has dementia. Sometimes the patient may have made advance decisions on how they wish to be treated if they suffer loss of capacity. They may also choose to appoint another person to make these decisions for them, which involves completing a legal form called the health care power of attorney.</p>
                            <p>The Mental Capacity Act (2005) outlines the assessment required to determine if a person is mentally capable of decision-making, and the Mental Health Act (2007) describes the rare circumstances when a patient can be hospitalised or treated against their wishes.</p>

                            <p>Good documentation is an integral part of care. There is a legal requirement to 'do and document', and the law places an equal value on both. Too often, we consider documentation to be a chore and afford it a lower priority compared with the actual task, but instead we should use it as a tool to transmit and receive information, and thereby ensure good-quality safe care for our patients. Good record-keeping has many important functions.</p>

                                        <li>Registered nurses will be delegating the task of record-keeping, and may countersign entries made by trainee HCAs or APs (until that HCA/AP is deemed competent in record-keeping), but only if they have witnessed the activity.</li>

                            <p>When you record an event, think of the record being scrutinised in a court of law. If this ever happens, it probably won't be until a year or two after the event happened, so it will be difficult for you to remember details of the event. And remember, if it isn't documented, then in the eyes of the law it never happened!</p>
