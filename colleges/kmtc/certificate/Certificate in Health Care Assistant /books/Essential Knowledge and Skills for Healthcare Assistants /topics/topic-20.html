                            <p>In recent years, HCAs and APs have been taking on more complex tasks such as ear irrigation. Removal of earwax is one of those rare things you can do for your patient that can provide instant relief when their hearing has been compromised by a build-up of wax, but unfortunately it is a task that has provoked much controversy over the years. This is largely because the old method of syringing the ears using a metal syringe often resulted in problems afterwards, such as perforation or infection (Aung and Mullet 2002). This in turn resulted in litigation in many cases. By comparison, removal of wax using an electronic irrigator is a very safe procedure, providing it is done in accordance with the guidelines.</p>

                                    <p>However, although irrigation is relatively safe, there are risks associated with it, as with any procedure, so before agreeing to examine a patient's ear or irrigating it, you must complete a recognised ear irrigation course, such as the one offered by the Rotherham Primary Ear Care Centre (2017). These courses are available all over the UK and are delivered by trainers who are licensed to the Ear Care Centre. Other courses are available, but always make sure the course providers have a good reputation or can offer accredited training.</p>

This chapter will provide the background knowledge required and will describe the procedure in line with the Rotherham Primary Ear Care Centre guidelines.</p>

                            <p>The outer ear is made up of the pinna (see Figure 20.2) and the external auditory meatus (ear canal). The pinna is the external structure, and is designed to collect and direct the sound waves into the ear canal. The ear canal is a skin-lined channel ending at the outer surface of the tympanic membrane (TM or eardrum).</p>

                            <h3>The Middle Ear</h3>
                            <p>The middle ear is the area behind the eardrum where three little bones are located. These tiny bones, known by their Latin names as the malleus, the incus and the stapes, are collectively called the ossicles. These bones have joints between them in the same way as other groups of bones do, and they are the only bones in your body that should not grow from the moment you are born to the moment you die!</p>
                            
                            <p>Sound waves are channelled through the pinna into the ear canal, and they hit the eardrum, making it vibrate. This vibration is transmitted through the ossicles into the inner ear.</p>
                            
                            <p>The malleus is the bone that sits against the eardrum from behind and gives it the characteristic shape. It is the features of this bone that you look for during otoscopy. Remember, the eardrum is made up of a soft part - <strong>pars flaccida</strong> (seen above the short process of the malleus) and the taut part, which is stretched tightly over the long process of the malleus (also called the handle of the malleus), making it transparent and shiny - the <strong>pars tensa</strong> (seen below the short process of the malleus). The light reflex is created where the long process of the malleus creates a crease in the pars tensa, which picks up and reflects the light from the otoscope (see Figure 20.3).</p>

                            <h3>The Inner Ear</h3>
                            <p>The inner ear consists of the cochlea (organ of hearing) and the semicircular canals (organ of balance).</p>
                            
                            <p>The cochlea is a coiled structure with inner channels that are filled with fluid. Vibrations are transmitted from the ossicles, through the oval window (a membrane covered opening underneath the stapes) into the fluid filled channels, where they create ripples. The ripples pass over tiny hairs called cilia located deep within the cochlea, and the subsequent movement of the cilia sends a signal via the auditory nerve to the brain, where it is then interpreted as noise. The brain is usually able to determine where the noise is coming from and what is causing it. This whole process is very complex and delicate. If the sound waves are created by a very loud noise, then their amplitude will be greater, and this will cause bigger vibrations and bigger ripples. When the ripples become very big, instead of wafting the cilia gently, they will flatten them all, like a field of corn in a hurricane. Not all the cilia will recover from this, and those that do will recover at different rates. This can result in abnormal signals being sent to the brain, creating buzzing or ringing in the ears and a reduction in hearing for a while. Think of the last time you went to a music gig - what happened when you came out? You were probably shouting at each other for a while until your hearing recovered! If our ears are constantly exposed to loud noise, then early onset deafness is inevitable as more and more of those cilia are flattened and unable to recover.</p>
                            
                            <p>The semicircular canals operate in a similar way, except that the signal sent back to the brain is interpreted as a sense of position instead of noise.</p>

                            <p>Many patients seem to think that wax is dirty and should be cleaned out of the ear regardless of whether it is causing a problem or not. Wax is actually very important for protection, lubrication and for slowing down the growth of bacteria. It is made up of cerumen (a sweat-like substance), sebum (an oily substance), dead skin cells and debris. The composition of wax will vary from individual to individual, depending on age, diet and the environment. The ceruminous glands, where the cerumen is produced, are located just inside the ear canal. This is a fact worth pointing out to your patients when the wax is seen pushed up against their eardrum, usually because of poking cotton buds or other small items in the ear!</p>
                            
                            <p>Sometimes it may be necessary to remove wax by irrigation, but this should always be a last resort because putting water inside the ear canal increases the risk of infection.</p>

                            <h3>Softening the wax</h3>
                            <p>Olive oil drops at room temperature are the cheapest and most suitable way of softening the wax. The patient should be instructed to instil the drops every morning and evening for three to five days. They should lie on the unaffected side for 10 minutes after instilling the drops and avoid the use of cotton wool in the ear. An olive oil ear spray is available on prescription and can be bought over the counter, and this may be very useful for your elderly patients who live alone and find it difficult to instil the drops.</p>
                            
                            <p>It is always worth advising patients who have a frequent build-up of wax in their ears to instil olive oil drops regularly (once or twice a week) as this is sometimes all that is needed to soften the wax and facilitate the natural cleaning process of the ear without the need for irrigation.</p>
                            
                            <p>Sodium bicarbonate can also be used (Allen 2016), but this can have a drying effect, especially in the elderly who tend to have a dryer and thinner meatal skin.</p>

                            <p>Only those patients who have had the procedure done previously with no complications are suitable for the HCA to irrigate. Patients must be assessed by the doctor or nurse first to determine the presence of wax and their suitability for irrigation. If most of the eardrum is visible, then irrigation will not normally be necessary. The only exception to this will be if the patient is to have a hearing aid fitted, in which case the ear canal must be completely clear.</p>

Straighten out the ear canal by gently grasping the cartilaginous part of the pinna and pulling upwards and outwards. Hold the otoscope like a pen or dart and rest your little finger on the patient's cheek while you insert the speculum into the ear canal (see Figure 20.4). Use the right hand to view the right ear and the left hand to view the left ear if you feel you can do this safely. If the wax is obscuring the eardrum and is soft enough, proceed with irrigation.</span>

                            <p>Try typing 'home earwax removal' into images on your search engine and I think you will be amazed and horrified at what is available for people to buy and stick into their ears! Basically, we should be discouraging people from putting 'anything smaller than their elbow' into their ear when they are unable to see what they are doing. This is unsafe practice, and is likely to lead to impaction of wax or infection in some patients.</p>
                            
                            <h3>Hopi candling</h3>
                            <p>Hopi candling is an alternative therapy that may be useful as a relaxation therapy, but it should not be used at home alone and it does not remove earwax (see Figure 20.6).</p>

                            <p>The theory is that burning the candle softens the wax and creates a vacuum that sucks it out. This simply isn't true, and scientific evidence has clearly refuted this claim (Ernst 2004). The 'earwax' shown at the end is simply the remnants of the burnt cotton and beeswax.</p>
                            <p>Quite apart from the fact that this practice does not remove earwax, it is intrinsically dangerous, and there have been many ear injuries associated with candling.</p>
