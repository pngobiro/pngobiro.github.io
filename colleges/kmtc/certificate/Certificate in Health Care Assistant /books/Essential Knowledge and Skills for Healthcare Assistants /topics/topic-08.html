                            <p>Health is a very subjective thing and hard to define. One of the most quoted definitions of health is from the World Health Organization (WHO 1948). They describe it as being 'a state of complete physical, mental and social wellbeing and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity'. Some authors feel the use of the word 'complete' in this definition makes 'health' unachievable for most people in the world (Godlee 2011).</p>
                            
                            <p>O'Donnell (2009) defines optimal health as 'a balance of physical, emotional, social, spiritual and intellectual health', and health promotion as:</p>
                            
                            <blockquote style="border-left: 4px solid var(--color-primary); padding-left: var(--space-4); margin: var(--space-4) 0; font-style: italic; color: var(--color-text-secondary);">
                                "The art and science of helping people discover the synergies between their core passions and optimal health, enhancing their motivation to strive for optimal health, and supporting them in changing their lifestyle to move toward a state of optimal health."
                            </blockquote>

                            <p>As a healthcare assistant, you are well placed to offer healthy living advice to patients, to enable them to move towards that state of 'optimal health' (if that is what they want), but you must make sure that the advice is objective and based on current evidence. Use leaflets from objective sources, such as NICE guidelines, the British Heart Foundation, Patient.co.uk and so on. Avoid using leaflets that are endorsed by companies with products to sell, such as some cholesterol-lowering products or those produced by companies such as the Butter Council or the Sugar Council. By giving out such leaflets, you are inadvertently condoning the consumption of such products. When you have a uniform on and a badge that says Healthcare Assistant, patients will assume you know what you are talking about. Avoid the temptation to offer them advice if you don't have very good evidence to back up your information.</p>

It is an old model, but still widely used today, and most people involved in promoting health are very familiar with it (see Figure 8.1).</p>

                            <p>If the patient is in the pre-contemplative stage, then 'brief intervention advice' is recommended, raising awareness and offering help if required for the future. This is in accordance with the NICE guidance, which advises on the need to recognise when people may be more open to change, such as when recovering from a behaviour-related condition or when becoming a parent (NICE 2014a). Conversely, the health worker must also recognise when offering behavioural change may not be appropriate due to personal circumstances. NICE (2014a) recommends that primary care workers use brief interventions for health promotion advice to motivate people to change behaviours that may damage their health. For example, if the patient smokes, ask them how interested they are in quitting. If they want to stop, refer them to an evidence-based smoking cessation service.</p>
                            
                            <p>Even 'brief intervention advice' requires a degree of skill and training in health promotion techniques, and you should take care not to step out of your area of skill and competence.</p>
                            
                            <p>As health professionals, it is our role to offer advice when a patient wants or needs it. But even when we feel they need our advice, they still have the right to refuse it. We should aim to empower our patients by giving them the information, but remember their right to live their lives the way they choose.</p>
                            
                            <p>If the patient is moving into the contemplation stage or is preparing to change, this is when they are most likely to be receptive to healthy living messages.</p>

                            <p>There are many well-documented benefits of healthy eating (see Box 8.1). Most people are familiar with the Eat Well Guide (NHS Choices 2016a), which replaced the earlier Eat Well Plate.</p>
                            
                            <p>Foods higher in fat, salt and sugar, such as crisps, biscuits, cakes and sweets, have been taken off the plate because they are not needed in the diet and should be eaten in only very small amounts. The latest guide has attempted to simplify the healthy eating message and demonstrates a well-balanced diet with the emphasis on 'good' foods. The authors obviously took on board the information suggesting that sugar should not be represented on the plate at all because of the mounting evidence that clearly identifies its detrimental effects, particularly on dental health. Some authors are convinced that sugar is responsible for the obesity epidemic (Lustig 2012), and indeed a review of 20 studies demonstrated overwhelmingly that sugar consumption, specifically in the form of sugary drinks, is almost certainly linked to obesity in adults and children (Cohut 2018).</p>
                            
                            <p>It is certainly a political hot potato (maybe an unfortunate term in view of the carbohydrate in a potato!), and in April 2018 the UK introduced a sugar tax on soft drinks that contain high levels of sugar in direct response to the mounting evidence of the links with obesity.</p>

                                    <span class="list-content"><strong>Carbohydrates</strong> can be complex, such as that found in bread, pasta, rice and potatoes, or simple, such as that found in sweet sugary foods. Most guidelines currently recommend making up about one-third of our food with complex high-fibre carbohydrates, such as wholegrain cereals and wholemeal bread. However, keep a close eye on the guidelines over the next few years because information about the amount of carbohydrate we need is changing all the time, especially for some groups such as diabetics (see Chapter 16).</span>

Most people are familiar with the 'five a day' advice, but some authors suggest that eating at least seven or even ten portions of fruit and vegetables (with the emphasis on vegetables) reduces the risk of many illnesses, such as stroke, heart disease and some cancers (Aune et al. 2017). It may well be that some of this evidence is affected by the fact that most people who eat a lot of fruit and vegetables also tend to lead more healthy lifestyles, but even so it seems as if the more fruit and vegetables you can eat, the better it is for general health. The portions should be from a variety of sources. Aim to include at least two different vegetables with most main meals.</span>

                            <p>It seems as if the normalisation of 'plus-size' body shapes may be leading to an increasing number of people underestimating their weight, which is undermining the efforts to tackle the problem of obesity in England and presumably elsewhere (Muttarak 2018). First, you need to establish if your patient needs to lose weight (and persuade them of this!), and if so how much they need to lose. Measure their height, weight and waist (see Chapter 11). It is also useful to work out the basal metabolic rate for each patient to determine how many calories they need.</p>
                            <p>When your patient says that they have tried everything but nothing works, this probably isn't true. Any diet that involves eating fewer calories will work if it is maintained, so the secret is finding the 'diet', or better still finding the change in eating habits, that can be enjoyable and maintained.</p>

                            <h3>Activity Guidelines</h3>
                            <p>Public Health England has produced an evidence-based document outlining an approach to physical activity called <em>Everybody Active, Every Day</em> (PHE 2014a), and the information in this section is based on the Chief Medical Officer's guidelines.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Moderate-intensity activities</strong> include things that will make you breathe harder and increase your heart rate, such as brisk walking or cycling.</li>
                                <li><strong>Vigorous activity</strong> will make you warmer, breathe much harder, and will make your heart beat rapidly, and includes things such as running, swimming, skipping, playing football and climbing stairs (see Figure 8.3).</li>
                                <li><strong>Muscle- and bone-strengthening activities</strong> involve working against resistance or using body weight.</li>
                                <li><strong>For adults:</strong> Over a week, periods of activity should add up to at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity activity in bouts of ten minutes or more. One way to achieve this would be to do 30 minutes on at least five days a week. Alternatively, 75 minutes of vigorous activity can be spread across the week.</li>
                                <li>Include physical activity that will improve muscle strength at least two days a week.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>Some interesting facts and figures:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>There are approximately 9 million adult smokers in the UK (ASH 2017b), but the good news is that the proportion of the population who smoke has decreased from 45.6 per cent in 1974 to 16.8 per cent in 2017 (Office for National Statistics 2018).</li>
                                <li>Smoking is the single most preventable cause of premature death. About 96,000 people in the UK die each year due to smoking, and about half of all lifelong smokers will die prematurely, losing on average about ten years of life (ASH 2017b).</li>
                                <li>The estimated cost to society in England alone is approximately £12.9 billion a year (ASH 2017a).</li>
                                <li>Smoking is the main contributor to health inequalities in England. People in more deprived areas are more likely to smoke and less likely to quit (PHE 2015a; ASH 2016a).</li>
                                <li>Despite some concerns, nicotine replacement therapy (including e-cigarettes) is not as harmful as smoking, and is currently recommended by the NHS as a method of quitting.</li>
                            </ul>
