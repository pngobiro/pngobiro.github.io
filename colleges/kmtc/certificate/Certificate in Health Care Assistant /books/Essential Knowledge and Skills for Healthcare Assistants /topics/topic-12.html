                            <p>Arteries are the blood vessels that carry blood away from the heart. Every time the heart contracts, it squeezes blood through the arteries and the blood exerts a force on the artery walls. This force is the blood pressure.</p>
                            
                            <p>Human blood pressure was first recorded in 1847 by Carl Ludwig, who inserted a catheter into a patient's artery and connected the catheter to an invention called a kymograph. In 1896, the mercury-filled sphygmomanometer was developed by Scipione Riva-Rocci, and blood pressure was measured according to how high the pressure could lift a column of mercury (Welch Allyn 2008). We still refer to the measurement in millimetres of mercury (known by its chemical symbol of Hg).</p>

                            <p>The pressure in the arteries will depend on how hard the heart is pumping and how much resistance there is in the arteries.</p>

                            <h3>Types of Hypertension</h3>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Essential hypertension:</strong> where the cause is not known.</li>
                                <li><strong>Secondary hypertension:</strong> which may be due to medication (e.g. combined contraceptive pill, steroids), kidney disease or hormone problems.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>A patient may be diagnosed with hypertension if the blood pressure measurements show an isolated high systolic pressure (e.g. 180/70) or an isolated high diastolic pressure (e.g. 130/100) or both (e.g. 170/110).</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>Pulse pressure</strong> refers to the difference between the systolic and diastolic blood pressures, and this is often increased in older people, who may exhibit normal diastolic readings with isolated systolic hypertension, thought to be due to age-related stiffness of the arteries.</p>

                            <h3>Diagnosis</h3>
                            <p>Hypertension can only be diagnosed after several readings (usually a minimum of three) at different times of the day when the patient is relaxed. The phenomenon of white coat hypertension is well known, and refers to how some people will always have a higher blood pressure when they are in a clinical setting, probably due to anxiety (often without the patient realising). Because of this, the current guidelines now suggest that all patients should be offered ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) or home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM) if they cannot tolerate ABPM (NICE 2011).</p>
                            
                            <p>These patients will need to have a 24-hour monitor to make an accurate diagnosis or may be advised to purchase a home monitor to perform serial readings at home. In this case, they must be advised to buy a monitor that is validated by the British and Irish Hypertension Society (BIHS) or the British Heart Foundation (BHF) to ensure accuracy. The home monitor should be checked against the surgery monitor.</p>

                            <h3>Grades of hypertension</h3>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Grade 1 (mild hypertension):</strong> 140–159/90–99</li>
                                <li><strong>Grade 2 (moderate hypertension):</strong> 160–179/100–109</li>
                                <li><strong>Grade 3 (severe hypertension):</strong> greater than or equal to 180/110</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>Hypertension is often referred to as 'the silent killer' because it usually has no symptoms, but over time - if left untreated - it can cause strain on the heart and the arteries. It is one of the most important preventable causes of premature heart disease and death in the UK (NICE 2011). There are many possible complications, including angina, heart attacks, heart failure, stroke, peripheral vascular disease, kidney damage and eye damage. It is often under-diagnosed and inadequately treated.</p>

                            <p>Although many surgeries and wards have now disposed of mercury sphygmomanometers in line with European regulations on mercury control, blood pressure is still recorded in mmHg. Many hospital wards and surgeries now use automatic monitors, but these cannot be used on patients who have an irregular heartbeat such as in atrial fibrillation. It is therefore important that all HCAs have the training to enable them to take a blood pressure using the auscultatory (listening) method.</p>
                            
                            <p>To do this, the cuff is wrapped around the upper arm and inflated until it compresses the brachial artery. The blood cannot flow through, so no sounds are heard through the stethoscope, which is placed over the artery. Gradually, the cuff is deflated until the blood can just force its way through the artery each time the heart contracts and pushes the blood out. This opening and closing of the artery causes a tapping sound that can be heard through the stethoscope, and this is the systolic pressure. As the cuff is deflated still further, the artery opens and blood flows more easily so that the forced tapping sound muffles or disappears altogether. This change in the sound represents the diastolic pressure when the heart is relaxed. These sounds are called the <strong>Korotkoff sounds</strong> after the man who discovered them, and there are five possible sounds that can be detected.</p>

                                <li><strong>Korotkoff 5:</strong> When the sound disappears completely to denote the diastolic pressure.</li>
                                <li><strong>Korotkoff 4:</strong> Sometimes the tapping sound may continue, in which case you record the point at which the tapping sound becomes muffled.</li>
