                            <p>It is generally accepted that people who lay down fat around their abdomen (referred to as central adiposity, or more commonly the 'apple shape') are at greater risk of health problems such as type 2 diabetes or heart disease than those people who have a 'pear shape', with larger buttocks and thighs. This is because the type of fat that tends to accumulate around the abdomen appears to block the effect of insulin on the cells, making it harder for the cells to take in glucose. This is thought to create insulin resistance so that the body responds by producing more glucose, which may eventually result in type 2 diabetes. This theory has previously been controversial, but more recent research has provided new evidence that supports the original theory and shows a clear correlation between the 'apple shape' and insulin resistance (Shungin et al. 2015), as well as a link with an increased risk of myocardial infarction, particularly in women (Peters et al. 2018).</p>

                            <p>When the heart contracts, it pushes blood out through the elastic walled arteries. This is felt at various points of the body as a pulse, and if the arteries are in good condition the pulse should usually be felt at the same time as the heartbeat. The normal pulse rate is between 60 and 80 beats per minute, but can vary enormously from as low as 40 during sleep up to 220 or more during strenuous exercise.</p>
                            <p>An arrhythmia is an abnormal rate or rhythm of the heartbeat. Some are more serious than others. Some are intermittent and some will become permanent unless treated.</p>

                            <p>The respiratory rate is a key vital sign, and it is used to detect early changes when monitoring very ill patients.</p>
                            <p>We breathe in oxygen (required to produce energy) and breathe out carbon dioxide (a waste product of metabolism), and most of us will breathe at a rate of about 12-20 breaths per minute.

                            <p>The respiratory rate may be affected by:</p>

A person who has difficulty breathing will be using all their accessory muscles, sometimes lifting their shoulders up and down to help the lungs expand. There may be intercostal recession (sucking in of the skin between the ribs), and this is one of the key signs of respiratory distress. Some patients will also breathe out through pursed lips. This is very typical of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and is a method of trying to expel all the carbon dioxide slowly. Rapid expiration is more likely to force the diseased airways to collapse.</span>

Because of this, it is better to count the breaths per minute when holding the wrist as if still checking the pulse rate, so that the patient is unaware. As with measuring the pulse, you should count for 30 seconds and multiply by two to achieve the rate per minute. If the patient is breathing irregularly, you will need to count for a full minute.</span>

                            <p>A pulse oximeter provides a non-invasive method of measuring the oxygenation of a patient's blood. It works by shining an infrared light through the tissues of the body and detecting the colour difference between oxygenated and unoxygenated blood.</p>
                            <p>A beam of infrared light is passed through the chosen area, and the degree of absorption will depend on the amount of oxygen in the blood. Pulse oximeters will often give a reading of the pulse rate as well.</p>
                            <p>Pulse oximetry is used routinely in intensive care, operating theatres and recovery rooms.</p>
                            <p>It may be used in a doctor's surgery to monitor a patient's oxygen levels when they are having respiratory difficulty, such as during an asthma attack or worsening COPD or during a heart attack. Some patients who are receiving medication that may depress their respiration, such as strong opiate analgesics, may also need to have their oxygen levels monitored.</p>
                            <p>Accuracy can be affected by the thickness and temperature of the skin, so it is important to place the sensor in the best possible place. This will normally be on an area where the skin is relatively thin, such as the fingertip or earlobe. Other factors, such as nail varnish, dirt, foreign objects or bright lighting, can affect the light transmission, and therefore give erroneous results. Pulse detection may be affected by excessive movement, shivering, poor circulation and atrial fibrillation.</p>
                            <p>The normal level for oxygen saturation of the blood is between 96 and 100 per cent. Levels below 90 per cent can be life-threatening.</p>

                            <p>The temperature may be taken to check for an infection anywhere in the body when a patient is feeling unwell. It will also be checked routinely post-operatively to make sure a patient is not developing an infection. Patients with surgical wounds are more susceptible to infection, which can then delay healing.</p>
                            <p>When you consider the potential implications of an infection for any person, the importance of measuring the temperature accurately cannot be overemphasised. There are various devices for checking temperature, but the one used most commonly (and often incorrectly) is the tympanic thermometer. This uses an infrared light to detect the temperature at the tympanic membrane (eardrum).</p>

                                <li>Body surface thermometers are placed in the axilla or groin, but again will need to be held there for long enough, and may give a significantly lower result than the actual core body temperature.</li>
