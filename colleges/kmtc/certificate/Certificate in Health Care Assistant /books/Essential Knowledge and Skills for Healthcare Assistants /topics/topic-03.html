                            <p>In your role as HCA, you will constantly be asked to accept and perform tasks that have been delegated to you by the registered nurse or doctor. It is vital that you and the person delegating the task to you understand the individual roles in the process of delegation and what exactly each of you is accountable for.</p>
                            <p>When I first started delivering training for HCAs, I had many long, interesting and sometimes heated discussions with registered nurses who were understandably anxious about being held accountable for the actions of the HCA. Since then, HCAs have become so much a part of the team in most areas that I think nurses are more aware of the issues. It can, however, still be a controversial area, with some grey areas that are not always easy to resolve. In this chapter, there will be an attempt to explore and clarify some of the main issues.</p>

                            <p>Responsibility and authority require knowledge and the ability to understand the alternatives, reasons and consequences of a decision.</p>
                            <p>The NMC (2015) advises that registrants (i.e. registered nurses) have a responsibility to assess need and deliver or advise on treatment based on the best evidence available and best practice. Obviously, the registered nurse cannot perform every intervention for every patient, so they will need to delegate some tasks, and in this instance they become accountable for the appropriate delegation of the task.</p>
                            <p>There is very little guidance regarding which activities can or cannot be delegated, and this has meant that in some areas HCAs are performing quite complex tasks, while in others they are not allowed to do much at all. A good example that is still creating much debate in various areas of the UK is that of ear irrigation. Some local authorities have decided that HCAs should never be allowed to perform irrigation, while others have embraced it as a task very suitable for competent HCAs, providing they have had suitable training and have appropriate supervision in place.</p>

                            <p>Having considered these points and decided to proceed with the delegation, there are some basic rules that should be followed to ensure that both the person delegating the task and the HCA are protected, and that patient care and safety is not compromised in any way.</p>
                            
                            <p>Be clear about the task to be delegated and have clear ground rules. Check that the job description includes the new task, and make sure there are robust procedures or protocols in place. These protocols must be regularly reviewed and should specify when the HCA should seek further advice. Be sure there is appropriate insurance cover for the new task.</p>
                            
                            <p>Check that all members of the team are aware of the new task and the restrictions. Negotiate time for regular supervision and support, and ensure there is access to regular updates at appropriate intervals.</p>
                            
                            <p>There are some useful resources online for induction and as an adjunct to training. The RCN First Steps website is one such resource (RCN 2015a). This resource is mapped to the National Occupational Standards and the Care Certificate (Skills for Health 2015a, 2015b).</p>
                            
                            <p>Finally, any new task should be evaluated after an appropriate amount of time to assess the impact on all concerned.</p>
                            
                            <p>HCAs remain unregulated at present (as of 2018), so each case will have to be assessed individually, and some will be more willing and able to take on the various tasks than others.</p>

                                    <p>At the heart of this is the undisputed fact that the registered nurse or the doctor is accountable for the appropriateness of the delegation. In some cases, nurses have found themselves in a position where they disagree with a nurse or doctor colleague on the appropriateness of delegation to the HCA. In this instance, they should make it clear from the outset that they will not be held accountable for the delegation, and should put this in writing.</p>
                                </div>
                            </div>

                            <p>So where do you – as the HCA – fit in all of this? If you accept a task, are you accountable? As a HCA, you don't have a professional body such as the Nursing and Midwifery Council in the way that nurses do, but you are still accountable to yourself, your employer, your delegating nurse and – most importantly – your patient. So, if you feel you have been delegated a task for which you have not had appropriate training or whenever you are in any doubt about your competence, you should always say no until you have had further advice or clarification.</p>

                                    <p>You are working alone as the nurse is off sick and a patient comes in for a dressing change. They have an open wound that requires packing with ribbon gauze to avoid the wound healing over the top too quickly. You have never done this type of dressing before, and are not sure if you should go ahead and do it, but the patient is insistent as they are unable to get to the local hospital, which is some distance away, to have the dressing done, and it really needs doing today. You ring the doctor and check with him. He is busy with another patient, and says you will just have to do the best you can.</p>

You know you are not competent to perform this type of dressing and are not sure that the doctor would know how to do it either. There is no protocol to guide you for this and there is no care plan in place. You must be assertive enough to say no and find another way of helping instead. Perhaps you could book some transport for the patient to get to the hospital or prepare the equipment for the doctor to do the dressing instead.</p>
                                        <p>If you agree to go ahead and there is a problem afterwards, you will be accountable for accepting a task that you are not competent to do. You could be accused of negligence, although ultimately the GP would have to accept vicarious liability for this.</p>
