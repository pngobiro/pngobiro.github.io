                            <p>Throughout this book, you will see many references to procedures and protocols. You may wonder what protocols are and why they are so important. This chapter will discuss the issue of protocols in practice and provide a basic template for a protocol. I have used the word protocols in the chapter title as this is the term most nurses and HCAs are familiar with, but you may also use the term clinical guidelines, and the two terms will be used interchangeably.</p>
                            <p>For HCAs who perform nursing duties that have been delegated by a nurse and for the nurses who are delegating the care, there must be clear protocols in place to protect both parties and to ensure good-quality care for the patient. Without written protocols in place, you may unwittingly be performing tasks that are inappropriate for your role or competence. You may also be making clinical judgements or decisions that ultimately result in unsafe practice.</p>
                            <p>Care Quality Commission (CQC) inspectors (in England) will want to see that practices have robust systems in place to ensure patients receive safe, high-quality care during an inspection. Practice procedures and protocols will be key to their assessment of this (CQC 2016).</p>

                            <p>The protocol sets out clearly what actions should be taken, explaining the reason and justification for each action as it goes. It's like a 'guidebook' for healthcare staff, helping them to make sure they're taking the right action to get the best outcomes and avoid any possible problems (RCN 2016a).</p>
                            
                            <p>Protocols or guidelines exist at national and local levels. At the national level, we have guidelines created by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) and other healthcare organisations, such as the British Heart Foundation, the British Hypertension Society, the Royal College of Nursing and the British Thoracic Society. At the local level, guidelines can be produced by trusts, at ward level or within general practice. A nurse or HCA may be working within national and local guidelines.</p>
                            
                            <p>In this chapter, we will just consider local protocols or guidelines developed in the work setting. They can include the actual procedure, but should also include information about who is able to perform the procedure, the training required, the patient group with inclusion and exclusion criteria, materials to be used for the procedure, referral guidelines, review dates, and signatures of all the healthcare workers involved. They should always be based on current national guidelines, current available evidence or expert consensus, and should usually be reviewed annually. They may be reviewed sooner if the evidence or national guidelines change.</p>

                            <p>In each chapter on clinical skills in this book, the procedure for the task has been provided, and is always based on current evidence or national guidelines. You may want to use these in protocols that you develop with your nurse, but you should also include other information, as discussed previously.</p>
                            <p>Initially, the plan for this chapter was to provide a protocol for every clinical procedure outlined in this book. However, it felt more useful to have the guidance for the procedure outlined in the relevant chapters, so instead I have produced a template that you can adapt for each clinical procedure by inserting the step-by-step procedure in the appropriate place as indicated.</p>
                            
                            <p>Remember, if a guideline exists and the nurse [or HCA] has failed to follow it, this may be considered in a court of law when deciding if the legal duty of care has been breached (Tingle and McHale 2007).</p>

                                    <p>Joe the HCA (level 3) was taking a blood pressure (BP). He had no protocol to work to, but considered himself to be competent in the task. A patient attended for a blood pressure check and his blood pressure was 170/102. Joe had no protocol, and the doctor and nurse were both busy, so he didn't want to bother them. He thought it seemed reasonable to recheck the patient's BP in one month. When the patient returned a month later, his BP was 220/130 and he was admitted to hospital. The GP told Joe he should have referred the patient to him on the same day.</p>
                                    <p>In this instance, Joe had made a clinical judgement based on inadequate knowledge and training. He did not have a protocol, so when in doubt he had to make these decisions himself or constantly refer to the nurse or GP for advice. The protocol for blood pressure monitoring should clearly state the correct procedure as well as the parameters for action, including monitoring intervals and when to refer to the nurse or GP. This ensures that the HCA is never put in a position where they make a clinical decision. In a court of law, Joe could be held accountable for making a clinical decision for which he was not qualified. The nurse who delegated the task could also be held accountable, and both the HCA and the nurse could be accused of negligence. The GP employer would then accept liability under the vicarious liability principle.</p>
