                        </div>
                        
                        <div class="content-card">
                            <p>What happens when something goes wrong in work? Suppose, for example, that you take a blood sample but forget to label it, or a patient becomes angry and hostile after being kept waiting, or a colleague is critical of your work, or you are asked to do something that you feel is out of your sphere of competence. The list is endless, and I suspect many of you reading this will recognise at least one of the examples given. So, what do you do about it when it happens? Think about it for a while then forget about it until it happens again? Chat about it over a cup of coffee with a friend who is on your side and is very reassuring? Or carry on with your busy clinic and think of it as 'one of those things'? Or maybe it stays on your mind for a bit longer, at least until you get home, when it gets pushed to the bottom of the priority list, competing against collecting the children from school or deciding what to cook for tea? If this is what happens, then the chances are it wasn't a very useful learning experience, and as a result it is more likely to happen again.</p>
                            
                            <p>Alternatively, and just as importantly, you will have some very good experiences, such as a clinic that goes particularly well or positive feedback on your work from colleagues or patients. You need to learn from all these various experiences and can only do this if you can establish the factors that contributed to the outcome of that practice. Depending on whether the outcome was good or bad, you can then endeavour to change your practice or try to repeat it in the future.</p>
                            
                            <p>Sometimes it is also useful to question established and accepted practice to determine if that is the best way of doing something and consider if or how it could be improved.</p>
                            
                            <p>Reflection is the process we can use to look back on our work, and although it is usually thought of as a tool to learn from mistakes or poor practice, I hope you will discover that it can be so much more than this.</p>

                            <p>Reflection is a strategy to develop learning and understanding through experience. It allows the practitioner to understand the experience differently and move on to provide safer practice, less likely to repeat past mistakes. Reflection involves consciously thinking about the experience (as opposed to mulling it over for a few minutes) and actively making decisions. It does not need to be intrusive or time-consuming, and neither should the potential complexity of the skills involved be viewed as a barrier to the process. It can be as simple or as complicated as you want it to be. Reflection is thought to be a way of bridging the theory/practice gap (Bulman and Schutz 2004) and is important to enable us to transfer learning into practice (Chapman and Law 2009).</p>

                            <p>Writing the reflection down is especially useful (see Figure 2.1), and can help the process by allowing the writer to effectively freeze the film, reflect on it, rewind, and review a previous scene having reflected upon a later one (Bolton 2010). Jasper (2003) suggests that the process of writing things down enables us to unlock secrets that have puzzled us or learn things about ourselves and those around us. It is a way of discovering more about yourself and your subject (Bolton 2010). When appropriate, written records might then be discussed with a trusted supervisor so that you can share your collective experience to make sense of the challenges encountered.</p>

                            <p>Even for nurses with many years of experience, the process of writing meaningful reflection can still be a daunting task. Part of the problem lies in the fact that at times it can be an uncomfortable experience. You might begin to realise that what happened occurred as a direct result of your action, what you did and how you behaved. Jasper (2003) suggests that this is a very mature way of learning, to be able to revisit and take responsibility for actions and choices, but for this to occur you need to be self-aware and have considerable insight into your behaviour, and this can take time to develop. Writing the reflection down also becomes a way of 'knowing' and a method of discovery and analysis (Bolton 2010).</p>
                            
                            <p>Compiling a reflective diary is a good starting place for those of you who are new to reflective writing. There are also many frameworks or tools that have been developed to assist in the art of structured written reflection, and they may help as a reminder of the different dimensions of reflection and dissuade us from focusing on only that which seems comfortable or convenient. We are all good at telling stories, but all too often our stories are uncritical and self-protective, providing us with an acceptable explanation of what happened to make us feel better about ourselves. Our stories are an attempt to create order out of chaos, but they rarely provide us with the opportunity to develop as people. To do this, we need to try to look at the story from a different and maybe strange point of view. We need to re-examine the story from a different perspective. If we cannot do this, we risk only ever seeing the world from our own limited view, in line with our own 'truth'.</p>

                                    <p>I was asked to chaperone a locum doctor while he performed a breast examination. I had not had any chaperone training and was unsure of what to do or where to stand, so I stood quite awkwardly at the foot of the bed while he carefully examined both breasts. The doctor was unable to feel any lump, although the lady was quite sure she had felt a lump in her right breast. He then asked me to feel the breasts to see if I could feel anything. I was surprised and alarmed at his request, but thought I should try as he was the doctor and I didn't feel able to say no to his request. I have never been trained to examine breasts, so I had no idea how to do it and felt very embarrassed doing it. I think the patient could feel my embarrassment, and she herself seemed surprised that he had asked me to do it. She tried to point to where she could feel the lump, but I was unable to feel anything. The doctor then thanked me for my help and told the lady to redress, at which point I left the room.</p>
                                    <p>I was worried about this, but thought I might be making more of it than I needed to. Nevertheless, the next day I discussed it with my practice nurse, and together we went to see the practice manager and explained the situation to her. She also felt that the doctor should not have asked me to do the examination. The senior partner (Dr A) came into the room when we were talking and he got involved too. He was very shocked that I had been asked to do this. The locum doctor in question had only been employed on that one occasion and was unlikely to be employed by them again, but Dr A felt there should be something in place to prevent this sort of situation from arising again. Everybody was very supportive and understood why I didn't feel able to say no, but reassured me that in future if I was not happy to do something, I should say so, and that they would always support me in this, regardless of who had asked me to do it.</p>
                                    <p>Dr A suggested a list of surgery staff with their job roles/responsibilities be given to each locum/new member of staff so that everybody would understand each other's roles, and it would be easier to say no if a task you were being asked to do was not covered in your job description.</p>
                                    <p>We also discussed the issue of chaperoning, and I explained that I was unsure of what I was doing. It seemed as if a lot of non-clinical members of staff had also raised concerns about this to the practice manager, and she had arranged some training for us, so hopefully in future I will feel more comfortable with this role.</p>

                                    <p>Initially, I felt very awkward standing and watching the breast examination. I didn't know where to stand or where to look, so I looked the other way so I didn't add to the lady's embarrassment. When the doctor then asked me to examine the breasts, I didn't feel I could say no, so although I had no idea how to do it, I carried on and did the best I could. I felt that the doctor must want a second opinion and was confident in my ability to help him. This was quite flattering, but I didn't want to do it and felt very uncomfortable. I wished I had felt strong enough to say no. I didn't feel that he should have asked me to do this, and I don't think the lady was happy about it either. I did ask her if she was OK with me checking, but I don't think she felt she could say no either, so it didn't feel as if I was having proper informed consent, and this worried me.</p>

                                        <li>I felt unable to say no, and if I am honest I was a little bit flattered that he had enough confidence in me to ask me to do it, so I agreed to do something that I was not comfortable with, which compromised patient safety.</li>
                                        <li>I did not have proper informed consent, so I infringed the patient's rights and I was open to accusations of abuse from the patient.</li>
                                        <li>The patient might have been falsely reassured that she had no lump in her breast.</li>

                                        <li>I learnt a lot from this experience, namely that it is OK to say no to something, even if it is a doctor who is asking me, and that my colleagues in the surgery will always support me if my refusal is reasonable.</li>
                                        <li>In future, all new members of staff will be informed about what each person can and can't do, so there should be no more misunderstandings.</li>

                            <p>Try to restructure the reflection provided using one of the other frameworks. See if you can work out which bits of the reflection fit under the headings provided by Gibbs (1988) and Oelofsen (2012).</p>
                            <p>Now have a go at a reflection yourself using whichever framework you find the easiest to work with. You can even use a mixture of them, but make sure you have some structure to your reflection so that you avoid waffling and getting nowhere. Be honest about your feelings and how you think others may have felt. Your reflection can be about anything – big or small – that happened to you in work, and it can be about something that went well or badly. It may be something you still found yourself thinking about at the end of a busy day, but remember to keep it simple to begin with. It doesn’t have to be as lengthy as the example – sometimes very brief reflections can be just as useful!</p>
                            <p>I hope you will find reflection useful and that you will continue to use and develop this skill in the future. Throughout the book, there will be more opportunities for you to practise some structured reflection. Be sure to have a go!</p>
                            <p>You might also want to check out Chapter 6 on assertiveness skills and Chapter 10 on chaperoning if the reflective account raised any issues for you.</p>
