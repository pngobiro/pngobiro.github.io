                            <p>Many HCAs find themselves in a difficult position when they have previously been working as a receptionist or on the administrative team in the same place of work. They are used to doing work for the doctor or nurse, often without questioning, based on the supposition that in clinical matters, the nurse or doctor knows best. In their new role, they must be able to refuse to accept a task if they feel it is outside their sphere of competence. Some doctors and nurses may not always have a clear idea of what HCAs can and cannot do, and may not understand why the HCA might appear reticent to agree to a new task that may seem very simple and straightforward to them. It can also be very flattering when the doctor or nurse have such faith in their HCA and assume they will be more than happy and capable to take on a new role. The HCA might then feel that they are in some way letting down their medical colleagues or disappointing them if they are doubtful about their own ability and refuse to accept a delegated task. They may also find themselves in the same position with reception staff or patients who now see them in a clinical domain, and so view them as 'a nurse', and therefore assume them capable of advising on complex health issues. The HCA must develop the ability to say no assertively when necessary, without appearing awkward or lazy and without creating confrontation or confusion.</p>

                            <p>Let's think about what assertiveness is. Maybe you have heard the term directed at somebody who comes across as a bit bossy or overconfident. It is a term that is often misused and is even used as a term of abuse at times. This is because it is being confused with aggressiveness, but in fact it is quite different, and it is essential to understand that difference (see Figure 6.1).</p>

                                        <p class="definition-text">Aggression, by contrast, usually involves an attempt to dominate others, with the aggressor standing up for their own interests at the expense of the rights of others. Aggression ignores or dismisses the needs, wants and opinions of others. It can take many forms, including verbal abuse, physical abuse, manipulation, bullying, emotional blackmail, exclusion of others and judgemental attitudes, to name but a few.</p>

                            <p>The other end of the spectrum is when we act passively. In this case, we are failing to stand up for our rights or doing so ineffectively. We might express our needs or opinions in an apologetic, self-effacing way. We will try to avoid conflict and try to please others. This type of behaviour may be more of a problem for the HCA who is new to the role and anxious to please.</p>
                            
                            <p>In either case, whether we behave aggressively or passively, the results can be equally harmful to ourselves and those we are interacting with.</p>

                            <p>Perhaps the most important thing to learn first is how to say no. So, when a colleague or patient asks you to do something that you feel inadequately prepared for, try the following:</p>

If you feel unsure, then ask for more time to consider the request, but if this latter response is just playing for time when you know your answer should have been no, then don't prevaricate. Say so directly and calmly, without raising your voice (see Figure 6.2).</span>

For example, if a doctor asks you to do an injection when you are not competent to do so, refuse politely, but offer to fetch the injection for the doctor to do it or offer to make another appointment for the patient to come back for the nurse to do it.</span>

                            <p>This is an old but still very useful technique in many different situations, such as responding to cold-callers or salesmen, returning faulty goods, and refusing to take on an inappropriate task.</p>
                            <p>For example, if a patient asks you to break confidentiality, how will you say no?</p>
                            
                            <div style="background: var(--color-surface); padding: var(--space-4); border-radius: var(--radius-md); border-left: 4px solid var(--color-primary); margin: var(--space-4) 0;">
                                <p><strong>Mrs Brown:</strong> While I'm here, can you tell me the results of my husband's blood tests, please?</p>
                                <p><strong>Susan:</strong> I'm not able to give you any information without Mr Brown's consent.</p>
                                <p><strong>Mrs Brown:</strong> But that's ridiculous - we're married and don't keep any secrets from each other. Please give them to me.</p>
                                <p><strong>Susan:</strong> There are very clear rules on confidentiality, and I cannot break them, so I'm not able to give you that information without Mr Brown's consent.</p>
                                <p><strong>Mrs Brown:</strong> This is quite outrageous - I think I'll have to report you to the practice manager unless you give me the results.</p>
                                <p><strong>Susan:</strong> I am sorry if you're upset about this Mrs Brown, but I cannot give you that information without Mr Brown's consent. If you would like to speak to the practice manager about it, then perhaps we can come to some other arrangement with your husband's consent, so that we can give you his results in the future.</p>
                            </div>

                            <p>The same phrase, maybe with slight alterations or explanation, is repeated in a calm, relaxed manner. Take care to start with the mildest stance, only becoming more assertive if necessary. Avoid jumping in with an aggressive or passive stance. If you need time to think the request over, then say so. If you practise this technique on the next cold-caller, you will be amazed at how quickly they give up! But as with all assertiveness techniques, you need to practise.</p>

                            <p>One more assertiveness tip that is worth developing is the ability to accept and cope with criticism. This can help you in personal and work relationships.</p>
                            
                            <p>Accept that the other person has the right to criticise you. Now determine if the criticism is valid or invalid (Michel 2008). This is the whole point. If it is valid, then accept it and learn from it, regardless of how it may have been made. Separate the content (which may be valid) from the way it is given, and don't take it personally. If it is unclear, then ask for clarification: 'I'd like you to give me some examples of what you mean.'</p>
                            
                            <p>Most importantly, if it is invalid or unfair, then don't take it on board. Never beat yourself up and allow your self-esteem to be battered by unfair or invalid criticism. You might choose to respond by using an 'I' statement (e.g. 'As I see it . . .') or you might choose to ignore it. But however you respond, do not allow it to affect you.</p>
                            
                            <p>There is not enough space in this one chapter to go through all the different ways of developing and improving your assertiveness skills, but I hope this has given you some food for thought. Remember your rights and responsibilities and keep calm!</p>
                            
                            <p>There are lots of very good resources online that are worth exploring for more information on how to be assertive, and there is a wealth of books on the subject. Start with a few small changes and build on those. Remember, you also have the right to be non-assertive when it suits you, providing this doesn't violate anybody else's rights, of course!</p>

                                    <p>Penny has just taken on the role of HCA, having previously worked on reception. She is doing a busy blood clinic and notices that she has too many patients squeezed in so that she struggles to get her clinic finished on time for the samples to be collected. Later that day, the laboratory technician rings the surgery complaining that the samples have been incorrectly labelled. Over the course of the next month, the same thing keeps happening, but Penny does not like confrontation and is reluctant to complain about the situation. She puts her head down and soldiers on, and hopes that everyone will notice how hard she works without complaining. She feels terrible because she is constantly rushing and cannot do her job properly. She blames the girls on reception, who she feels must be jealous of her new role and are trying to make life difficult for her.</p>
                                    <p>The laboratory staff have complained three times about incorrect labelling, and because of this the practice manager asks Penny to explain herself. He criticises her for not pointing out how busy she was and not attempting to rectify the situation. Now she feels even worse and as if the whole world is against her.</p>
