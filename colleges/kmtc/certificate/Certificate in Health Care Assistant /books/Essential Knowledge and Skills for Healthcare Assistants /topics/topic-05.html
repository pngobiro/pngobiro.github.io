When the patient understands what is going on, and feels that they have been listened to and that they have some element of control over their fate, there are many potential benefits:</p>

                            <p>I have struggled to find a definition of communication that says or communicates exactly what I feel is important. There are many definitions available for the term in general and some more specific definitions for what it means in the realms of healthcare. Life itself depends on people communicating effectively with each other, whether it is verbal or non-verbal, and all healthcare must have good communication at its core. When we are with other people, we are constantly communicating either by talking, using the tone and volume of our voice as well as the actual words, or through our body language, gestures and facial expressions. We can also communicate a message or an impression through our choice of clothes and general appearance (see Box 5.1).</p>

                            <p>We all like to think of ourselves as good communicators but may be surprised to discover how often patients take the wrong message away with them. So, what are we doing wrong?</p>
                            <p>The actual understanding that takes place is perhaps the single most important factor in communication, so the effectiveness of the communication can be measured by the similarity behind the idea transmitted and the message that has been received. In other words, has the receiver (i.e. the other person or group of people) understood and taken away the message we want to convey?</p>

                                    <span class="list-content"><strong>Clear:</strong> Make sure that what you say is unambiguous so that the patient is left in no doubt about your instructions. Ask the patient if they understand and if they have any questions.</span>
                                </li>
                                <li class="list-item">

                            <h3>Non-verbal Communication</h3>
                            <p>How we say something is just as important, if not more so, than what we say. We must be aware of the potential effect non-verbal communication may have on our patients. It has been suggested that 93 per cent of 'emotional meaning' is found in a person's facial expressions and tone of voice, and only 7 per cent is from what a person says (Borg 2010).</p>

                            <p>Some points to think about:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Be aware of your facial expressions:</strong> Even a subtle movement in the facial muscles, such as a raised eyebrow, can imply surprise or criticism, and may make the patient feel uncomfortable because they may feel they are being judged.</li>
                                <li><strong>Think about body posture:</strong> If you fold your arms and cross your legs, this is called closed body posture, and will not encourage a patient to open up and talk, but if you adopt an open body posture or mirror the way your patient is sitting (see Figure 5.1), they will feel more comfortable and talk more freely. Try it out on your friends and see what happens! Of course, there may be times when closed body posture is necessary, if, for example, a patient is very chatty and you need to get on with your work.</li>
                                <li><strong>Watch your gestures:</strong> Pointing a finger can come across as very aggressive or patronising. There are some cultural differences to be aware of too. 'Thumbs up' is not necessarily a friendly gesture, and in Greece, for example, it may be considered quite rude.</li>
                                <li><strong>Consider your appearance:</strong> What are you communicating to your patients if you turn up at work with your hair untidy and with a dirty uniform on? You might have just been in a rush, but the chances are that your patient will conclude that you are uncaring or slapdash in your approach. This is not a good start in a consultation, and may not give your patient much confidence, and it may not actually convey the type of person you are at all (see Figure 5.2).</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h3>Active Listening</h3>
                            <p>Are you a good listener?</p>
                            <p>Have you ever had a conversation with someone who is not a good listener? They just seem to be waiting for you to finish so that they can make their own comments, and they are not actually listening to what you are saying. How does this make you feel? Do you enjoy talking to these people?</p>
                            <p>Really listening, or 'actively listening', to what someone is saying, and more importantly sometimes to what they are not saying, is a skill that takes practice. It is often difficult to listen properly when you are busy or distracted, but it is well worth it in terms of what you can learn about your patient. It also makes them feel that you care about them and that they are valued. Maintain eye contact and avoid the temptation to look at the computer or at your watch while the patient is talking. At intervals during the consultation, reflect and summarise back to the patient what you think they have told you to check that your information is accurate and to show that you have been listening:</p>

                                    <p>Jenny the HCA was helping the nurse run the diabetic clinic. She performed the physiological measurements before the patient saw the nurse. She would often be in the same room when the nurse was talking to her patients, and realised it made her feel quite uncomfortable. On one occasion, the nurse was telling the patient off. She spoke quite loudly and sounded like a teacher addressing a naughty child, rebuking him for indulging in a high-fat diet. The man sat back, folded his arms and crossed his legs. He was polite but said little throughout the consultation. At the end of the appointment, when the patient had left, the nurse sighed and said, 'How can we help these patients when they won't help themselves? I feel like I'm banging my head against a brick wall most of the time.'</p>
                                    <p>Jenny privately sympathised with the patient, and she wondered how much, if anything he had learnt or benefited from the appointment.</p>
                                    <p>In this situation, the nurse had created a barrier to effective communication by patronising the patient instead of engaging him as an equal partner in the consultation. It would have been helpful to explore why he chose to eat unhealthily and assess his readiness for change. If he indicated an awareness of his unhealthy diet and a willingness to change, she could then have provided him with the appropriate written information. By adopting an authoritative stance and treating him as if he was stupid, she alienated her patient and he clearly demonstrated disengagement by his closed body language. The message the nurse intended to send was not received and communication broke down.</p>

In the UK alone, it is estimated that around 850,000 people have dementia, and 40,000 of these are under the age of 65.

                            <p>My father had Alzheimer's (which is one type of dementia), and I saw first-hand how this illness can devastate not only the person who has it, but also the family, the carer and everyone involved. My father was a proud, kind and very intelligent man, and to see him reduced to a frightened and aggressive shadow of himself was a truly awful experience. I saw as well how ill it made my mother, who succeeded in caring for him at home against all the odds until the last two weeks of his life. It was so worrying when we finally had to concede defeat and have him admitted to a care home. We needed to know that the staff there understood what a lovely man there was underneath the man they saw, who was ravaged by his disease. We needed to know that they would preserve his dignity and speak to him as an intelligent man. I wrote a poem to try to make the staff in the home aware of my dad's various problems and foibles, and to make them aware of the person beneath the old man with dementia, which is unfortunately all they would see and know of him.</p>

                            <h3>Communicating with a person with dementia</h3>
                            <p>Considering how common the problem of dementia is now, you will almost certainly come across a patient with this disease at some stage in your career. Because of this, you really need to know how to care for and communicate with these patients. The best way to learn about this is to look out for and attend any workshops or training you can access on dementia. Understanding what it involves and how it affects the patient is a larger topic than I have room for in this book, but it will really help you when you communicate with these patients in the future.</p>
                            <p>There are lots of useful resources with tips about how to communicate with patients who have dementia. Two that I have found particularly useful are the Social Care Institute for Excellence (2015) and NHS Choices (2017a). They have produced some guidelines that may help you when communicating with the patient with dementia, and I've summarised them for you below.</p>

                            <h3>Some useful tips</h3>
