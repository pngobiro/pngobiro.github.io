                            <p>As with all other clinical procedures, before you can embark on basic wound care, you must attend a recognised training course, have written evidence of your competence and have a clear protocol in place with care plans that have been drawn up by the registered nurse for each patient. A care plan does not need to be a long, complicated document, but can be a simple set of instructions on the computer notes, identifying things such as the duration of treatment, the type of dressing to be used and when to refer to the nurse for advice.</p>
                            <p>You should have knowledge of the skin and how it heals, and you must understand the principles of the aseptic non-touch technique (ANTT), which is discussed later in this chapter.</p>

                            <p>It is worth stopping to think sometimes about everything that is going on in your body without you even realising. When you cut a finger or if you sustain a much larger wound, the body sets to work immediately to clean and heal the wound. It is quite amazing how efficient the body can be at looking after us, even when we may not be very good at it ourselves!</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>Haemostasis</strong> (meaning the stopping of blood flow) is the body's natural response to injury. The damaged blood vessels temporarily constrict to stop the bleeding. Activation of the clotting mechanism then occurs, resulting in the release of chemicals called clotting factors. Factor I, called fibrinogen, is converted to solid strands of protein called fibrin. The platelets become sticky and clump around the injured tissue. These are then reinforced by the strands of fibrin, forming platelet plugs, sealing the injury and initiating healing.</p>

                                Reducing Infection Risk

                            <p>Most healthcare-acquired infections are entirely preventable. The main infection risk to the patient is the health worker – that's you! The level of risk can be minimised by using an effective aseptic technique during any invasive procedure, such as when performing a wound dressing. The <strong>aseptic non-touch technique</strong>, referred to as <strong>ANTT</strong>, is a framework for aseptic practice.</p>
                            
                            <p>Asepsis is achieved by 'key part' and 'key site' protection:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Key parts:</strong> things such as the tip of a syringe or the wound side of a dressing.</li>
                                <li><strong>Key sites:</strong> things such as open wounds and surgical incisions or any portal of entry on a patient.</li>
                            </ul>
                            
                            <p><strong>Standard ANTT</strong> is suitable for the type of dressings most HCAs will be performing. The aseptic field is an important component of this to ensure a controlled safe working space. Use non-sterilised gloves if you can perform the procedure without touching key parts or key sites directly, and use sterilised gloves if you are likely to touch key parts or sites.</p>
