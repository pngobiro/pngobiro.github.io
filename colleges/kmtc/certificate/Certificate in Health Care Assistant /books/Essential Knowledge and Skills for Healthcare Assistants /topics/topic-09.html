                            <p>Many thousands of years ago, a Greek philosopher and physician called Hippocrates laid down the moral code of conduct for medical practitioners called the 'Hippocratic oath'. Within this oath are the words 'all patients have the right to receive care and come to no harm'.</p>
                            <p>As healthcare workers, we all have a responsibility to ensure that we uphold this ideal wherever we work and to keep our patients safe. This chapter will focus on hand hygiene, but remember to think about infection prevention and control in everything you do when dealing with patients. Check your local guidelines for information on dealing with sharps, wearing of personal protective equipment (PPE) and disposal of clinical waste.</p>

                            <p>In the nineteenth century, a Hungarian obstetrician called Semmelweis discovered that the likely cause of infection and subsequent death in his obstetric patients originated from medical students who had performed autopsies, resulting in hand contamination. By contrast, patients cared for by the midwives who had not performed autopsies had a much lower rate of infection and death. Semmelweis hypothesised that there must be something on the hands of the medical students that could not be seen, but when passed on to the patient could cause infection. He demonstrated a significant reduction in mortality among his patients when medical students washed their hands in a chlorinated lime solution. Despite this important finding, his medical colleagues would not believe him. He was later committed to a sanatorium, where he died at the age of 47. Twenty years on, Louis Pasteur provided the theoretical explanation, or 'germ theory', of disease.</p>
                            
                            <p>Now, many years later, we are still guilty of causing infections in patients because of a lack of basic infection control procedures, the most important of which is hand hygiene.</p>

                                    <p>Healthcare-associated infections (HCAIs) are infections that were not present before admission to hospital or contact with healthcare workers in the community. They can affect people of all ages, exacerbate existing or underlying conditions, delay recovery, and adversely affect quality of life (NICE 2014b). There has been a great deal of work done to raise awareness and to tackle the issues associated with infection prevention and control, and subsequently there has been some improvement in the numbers of some HCAIs, especially C. difficile infection, which has gone down by 42 per cent in the last ten years (RCN 2016b).</p>
                                    <p>However, over 6 per cent of patients in hospital in England still acquire some form of HCAI (NICE 2016). Three hundred thousand patients a year acquire a HCAI in England, with 9,000 deaths thought to occur as a result, and the cost to the NHS is £1 billion a year (NICE 2014b).</p>

                            <p>Infection is caused by microorganisms, usually bacteria, viruses or fungi. These are too small to be seen with the naked eye, but if fully active and present in sufficient quantity and in the appropriate environment, such microorganisms can become pathogens, and are then capable of causing infection. All microorganisms can become pathogenic. An example of this is a bacterium called S. aureus. This is one of the major causes of HCAI or community-acquired infection (CAI). Approximately 30 per cent of the population may be long-term carriers of this bacterium. It is frequently found in the nose and on the skin, and usually causes no problems. However, if the person (or host) has a cut or abrasion, the bacteria can become pathogenic and cause an infection. It can cause pimples, impetigo or cellulitis. If it gets into the bloodstream, it can cause pneumonia, endocarditis or severe inflammation of the bones (osteomyelitis). Similarly, many people may have methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) bacteria on their skin or in their respiratory tract. When they are healthy and their skin is intact, it does not cause a problem. However, if they have an open wound or if their immune system is compromised in some way, the MRSA can become pathogenic and cause an infection that is resistant to many types of antibiotics (Henderson 2016).</p>
                            
                            <p>S. aureus is a very resilient organism but can be removed by correct hand decontamination.</p>

                            <p>For an infection to occur, the chain of infection (see Table 9.1) must be unbroken, and so the aim of infection control is to break the chain. Good hand hygiene, or 'hand decontamination', is the most important way of breaking this chain and preventing the transmission of microorganisms.</p>
                            
                            <p>If infection is to occur because of indirect contact via the healthcare worker's hands, the organism must have been present on the skin, it must survive on the hands for at least several minutes, hand-washing or antisepsis by the healthcare worker must be inadequate or omitted entirely, and the pathogens on the caregiver's hands must come into contact with another patient, either directly or by being shed into the patient's immediate environment (Teare et al. 2001).</p>
                            
                            <p>Hand hygiene is the simplest and most important way in which we can reduce the spread of infection, and all healthcare workers — from cleaners through to consultants — have a personal responsibility to undertake adequate hand hygiene.</p>

                            <p>I have a bit of a thing about gloves! I get really annoyed when I see health workers typing on the computer keyboard or answering the phone with their gloves on. I think sometimes people think wearing gloves somehow makes them safer and eliminates the need to decontaminate the hands. Please remember that gloves are no substitute for effective hand decontamination and should only be used when necessary.</p>
