                            <p>In the nineteenth century, it became clear that the heart generated electricity. In 1924, Willem Einthoven discovered the electrocardiographic features of the heart and realised that these could be used to detect abnormalities. He assigned the letters PQRST to the various deflections, and was awarded the Nobel Prize for his discovery.</p>
                            <p>Before you can understand an ECG or how to perform the test accurately, you need to have a basic understanding of the heart and how it works.</p>

                            <p>The heart has four chambers, the right and left atria and the right and left ventricles (see Figure 13.2).</p>
                            
                            <p>The arteries carry blood away from the heart, and the veins bring blood back to the heart (remember, artery begins with 'a' for 'away'). The arteries are therefore under greater pressure and have thicker walls. You will also feel a pulse in the arteries corresponding with the heartbeat, but you will not be able to feel a pulse in a vein. This is because the pressure has dropped by the time the blood has travelled through the circulatory system from the heart via arteries to arterioles, then to capillaries and then to venuoles, before being transported back to the heart via the veins.</p>

                            <p>Blood that has been around the body and exhausted its supply of oxygen (deoxygenated blood) is transported back to the right side of the heart via the superior vena cava (coming from the upper body) and the inferior vena cava (from the lower body).</p>
                            
                            <p>It enters the right atrium and then travels through the tricuspid valve to the right ventricle. From here, it leaves the heart via the right and left pulmonary arteries to the corresponding right or left lung.</p>
                            
                            <p>In the lungs, the pulmonary arteries become smaller arterioles and then even smaller capillaries. The capillaries have walls that are one cell thick, and they form a mesh around the lower end of the airways where there are tiny dilated sacs called alveoli (see Figure 13.3). This is where inhaled oxygen can be transferred across the very thin walls of the airways and surrounding capillaries, into the bloodstream. The alveoli are shaped like bunches of grapes to increase the surface area across which the gases can be exchanged and this makes the process more efficient.</p>
                            
                            <p>Carbon Dioxide (the waste gas produced from metabolism in all the organs of the body) is also transferred from the blood back into the airways to be exhaled.</p>

                            <p>The reoxygenated blood is now transported back through the pulmonary veins to the left atrium. From here, it travels through the mitral valve into the left ventricle. This is the largest chamber in the heart, and when it contracts it squeezes the blood with its vital oxygen out through the aorta.</p>
                            
                            <p>The aorta divides into an ascending aorta, sending blood to the upper body, and the descending aorta, sending blood to the lower body.</p>
                            
                            <p>This vital transport system can only be maintained if the heart beats at an appropriate rate.</p>

                            <p>The heart is a muscle. Inside the right atrium, there is an area of specialised heart tissue called the sinus node or sino-atrial (SA) node (see Figure 13.2). This node produces an electrical impulse that travels down through the right atrium to another area of specialised tissue called the atrioventricular node. From here, the electrical impulses travel down through the bundle of His and spread out around the heart muscle, causing it to contract. When the ventricles contract, the blood is pushed out through the arteries.</p>
                            
                            <p>These electrical currents spread through the whole body. They can be picked up by applying electrodes to various parts of the body and connecting them to an electrocardiograph (ECG). The ECG is a graphic recording of electrical processes that make the heart muscle contract.</p>
                            
                            <p>Abnormalities result in changes in the ECG, and can help with diagnosis depending on the extent and position of the changes.</p>
                            
                            <p>The ECG detects the electrical current flowing through the heart, and depending on the size and state of the heart muscle, it will produce deflections on the ECG monitor. It also shows the heart rate and rhythm.</p>

                            <p>Various types of heart disease that affect the heart muscle or interfere with the rate or rhythm may be detected on an ECG.</p>

                            <h3>Ischaemic heart disease</h3>
                            <p>Remember, the heart is a muscle, so it also needs an independent blood supply to obtain its oxygen and nutrients. This is delivered via the right and left coronary arteries.</p>
                            <p>In heart disease, these arteries may be narrow or blocked by fatty deposits called atheroma. This restricts the flow of blood to the heart muscle (ischaemia). The restriction is initially more of a problem when the heart muscle is working hard as in exercise or exertion. The heart needs more blood for its supply of oxygen and nutrients, and if the blood supply is compromised, the heart muscle will not be able to work properly and will become painful. This is what causes the pain of angina, which is typically felt during exertion or stress. The pain will go after rest unless there is a complete blockage or clot. In this case, the pain will not go with rest as the affected muscle is completely deprived of oxygen and it dies (heart attack or myocardial infarction; see Figure 13.5). When this happens, the outcome will depend on where the blockage has occurred. If it is at the end of one of the tiny branches of the coronary artery, it may only be experienced as a feeling of indigestion for a while (a silent heart attack), and this may only be detected on a subsequent ECG. If the blockage is further up the coronary artery, it will affect a larger area of heart muscle, and may cause the heart to stop (cardiac arrest) depending on the amount of heart muscle involved.</p>

                            <p>The pain of angina or a heart attack may be felt in the chest, jaw or left arm. Occasionally, it may be felt in the right arm. This is because of the way in which the nerves are distributed in the chest wall. Other possible symptoms may include a feeling of pressure in the chest, indigestion, nausea, vomiting, sweating, shortness of breath, and feeling dizzy or faint.</p>
                            <p>The ECG recording may look different in someone who has ischaemic heart disease or who has had a heart attack. This is because the muscle may be damaged, so the flow of electric current through the muscle is altered and the deflections on the recording will be different.</p>

                            <h3>Atrial fibrillation (AF)</h3>
                            <p>This occurs when the sinus node fires erratic impulses, causing the atria to 'fibrillate' or quiver when they beat very rapidly and irregularly. Because the atria are beating so fast (sometimes over 300 beats per minute), the blood is not pumped through to the ventricles effectively and it may pool in the left atria, where it is then more likely to form clots. If the clots break loose and are pumped around the body, they can then lodge in blood vessels in the brain and cause a stroke, or they may block an artery supplying the heart and cause a heart attack.</p>
                            <p>The ECG recording will look different in atrial fibrillation. Because the atria are not beating properly, the P wave does not show up clearly on the ECG recording. It may only appear as a fibrillatory line like a series of small bumps. This is very characteristic of AF.</p>

                            <h3>Heart failure</h3>
                            <p>This is when the heart cannot pump the full amount of blood with each heartbeat, and is therefore unable to meet the needs of the body. It is classified as systolic and diastolic failure, and may affect only the right ventricle or the left ventricle, or both</p>
                            <p>It is commonly caused by heart disease, such as after a heart attack, or may occur because of uncontrolled hypertension. It may also be a complication of atrial fibrillation or valve disease.</p>
                            <p>It is estimated that about half a million people have heart failure in the UK (Townsend et al. 2015).</p>
                            <p>The incidence rises steeply with age and carries a poor prognosis that is worse than most cancers, with 30-40 per cent of patients diagnosed with heart failure dying within a year, usually because by the time it is diagnosed it is quite advanced (NICE 2010). Echocardiography is key to the diagnosis of heart failure, with earlier diagnosis helping to ensure that the problem can be treated more quickly to prevent early complications.</p>
                            <p>There are many possible symptoms, including shortness of breath, swelling of the feet and legs, a chronic lack of energy, difficulty sleeping due to breathing problems, a swollen or tender abdomen and a loss of appetite, a cough with frothy sputum, increased urination at night, and confusion or an impaired memory.</p>
                            <p>The ECG recording may show the possible cause of heart failure, such as AF or a previous myocardial infarction, and it may demonstrate possible signs of heart failure such as an enlarged left ventricle (left ventricular hypertrophy). It can be useful to signal the need for further investigations but it cannot provide a definitive diagnosis.</p>

                            <h3>So how does 6 + 4 = a 12-lead ECG?</h3>
                            <ul>
                                <li>A lead is a view of the electrical activity of the heart from a particular angle across the body, obtained by using signals from different combinations of electrodes.</li>
                                <li>To obtain a 12-lead ECG, you have one electrode attached to each of the limbs and six electrodes placed on the chest, ten in total, but you get 12 'leads', or pictures from the combinations of different electrodes.</li>
                                <li>For the chest, the six leads take their picture (or view) from an electrode each, and are referred to as unipolar (leads V1--V6).</li>
                                <li>Three of the limb leads are made up from the signals of two electrodes each, and are referred to as bipolar (leads I--III).</li>
                                <li>The other three limb leads are made up from signals of three electrodes each, and are called augmented leads (aVF, aVR, aVL).</li>
                                <li>The electrode placed on the right foot serves only as an earth, and does not play a part in the recording.</li>

                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker">4</span>The patient should be in a semi-recumbent position of approximately 45 degrees, and any significant variation from this should be recorded. The limbs should be supported.</li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker">5</span>There should be unrestricted access to the chest, arms and legs.

Similarly, if the patient has a lot of chest hair, it is sometimes necessary to shave those areas where the electrodes are to be stuck on. Always use a disposable single-use razor. If exfoliation is required, rub the skin lightly with a paper towel, gauze swab or abrasive tape designed for the purpose.</li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker">8</span>Discourage any talking or movement as this involves the use of other muscles. Make sure the patient's fists are not clenched. All muscles contract because of electrical stimulus, so there is the potential for this to interfere with the recording from the heart.</li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker">9</span>It is important to place the electrodes consistently and in the recommended positions to achieve the most accurate recording. Studies have shown that electrodes are frequently placed incorrectly, producing significant diagnostic differences (Kligfield et al. 2007; Kania et al. 2014). Because of this, there are recommended positions that should be adhered to whenever possible, or – if not possible – then the alternative positions used should be documented. Electrodes on the limbs and chest should be placed as in Table 13.1 (see also Figure 13.7).</li>

The red electrode is applied to the inside of the right wrist, the yellow electrode to the inside of the left wrist, the green electrode to the left foot, and the black electrode to the right foot.</p>
                                    <p>When a patient has a tremor or is an amputee, it may be necessary to position the limb lead on the corresponding shoulder or lower torso. Always document any variation from the regular position.</p>

                                    <p>To identify the fourth intercostal space for the chest leads, it may be helpful to slide a finger from the base of the throat downwards as far as a bony lump (angle of Louis). Then slide the finger to the left or right to identify the second intercostal space. From this position, run your fingers downward across the next rib and the next one. You are now in the fourth intercostal space.</p>
                                    <p>Alternatively, count the dips in between the ribs, starting at the clavicle and working downwards to the fourth dip, but take care not to count the very first small dip between the clavicle and first rib.</p>

                            <p>Observe correct hand decontamination before and after the procedure, and clean the couch between patients. Dispose of couch roll and disposable razors in line with your local policy.</p>

                            <h3>Health and safety</h3>
                            <p>Make sure the couch is at the correct height. Ideally, couches in the treatment room should be adjustable so that the patient can get on and off safely and the practitioner can attend to the patient without bending. Take care when helping patients on or off the couch.</p>
                            <p>All electrical equipment should be checked annually and the date recorded on the equipment. It should also be calibrated annually or as recommended by the manufacturer.</p>

                            <h3>Dextrocardia</h3>
                            <p>This is a common form of cardiac malposition where the heart is positioned on the right side rather than the left side. In this case, V1 and V2 can stay in the same position, but V3-V6 should be positioned on the right side of the chest using the same intercostal spacing and anatomical landmarks as previously described.</p>
