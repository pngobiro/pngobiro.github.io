                            <p>Venepuncture is a task that is often one of the first to be taken on by a HCA, and many will be extremely proficient in the procedure. It is, however, another one of those tasks where it is so essential to get it right to achieve the best and most accurate sample possible. This may sound obvious, but it is surprising how many errors 'competent' phlebotomists can make that can have significant implications for the patient. This chapter will provide some of the necessary underpinning knowledge in the physiological process and will outline the correct procedure to achieve accurate sampling.</p>

                            <p>When a hole is made in the vein by a needle, platelets (small fragments of blood cells) become sticky and clump around the injury. Activated platelets and injured tissue produce chemicals that react with clotting factors in the blood. These clotting factors are known by the Roman numerals I-XIII. Factor I (fibrinogen) is converted into thin strands of solid protein called fibrin. These strands trap the platelets and blood cells to form a solid clot or plug. This process may take several hours, so it is important to remind the patient not to do anything after the procedure that may interfere with this or they risk further bleeding and subsequent bruising.</p>

                            <h3>Order of Draw</h3>
                            <p>Blood samples should be drawn in the correct order to avoid cross-contamination of additives between tubes (WHO 2010).</p>
                            <p>Check with your local laboratory for current guidelines regarding which colour sample bottles to use for which test and the order of draw. A general rule is that blood glucose samples should be taken last in the order of draw as these bottles contain an enzyme that may adversely affect other tests if there is any cross-contamination.</p>

                            <h3>Factors Affecting Quality</h3>
                            <p>There are some factors that may affect the results of a blood sample that the blood-taker cannot do anything about, such as the patient's age, gender, race, pregnancy and so on.</p>
                            <p>There are other factors that may affect the quality that will depend very much on the competence of the blood-taker.</p>
                            <p>When a blood sample is analysed in the laboratory, the levels of various substances that are present in the fluid part of the blood are measured. <strong>Haemolysis</strong> is the term used to describe the damage of red blood cells, which results in leakage of their contents into the blood serum. Where a blood sample is haemolysed, the test may give falsely high reading for substances such as potassium. This is because most of the potassium in the body is intracellular (contained within the cells). When the cell is damaged, the potassium leaks out into the serum, so the blood sample will give a false high reading. Potassium is very important for muscle contraction, particularly of the heart muscle, so patients who have a high potassium level will always need to be retested promptly.</p>

                                A Bit About Tourniquets

                            <p>Some areas now recommend the use of single-use tourniquets, but if these are not available then you should use tourniquets with a quick and slow release mechanism. Position the tourniquet ten centimetres (a hand width) above the intended puncture site. It should be loosened or removed when the first tube starts to fill, and never left on for longer than is necessary.</p>
                            
                            <p>Always remove the tourniquet before removing the needle from the vein.</p>
                            
                            <p>If the vein is clearly visible and palpable, consider taking the blood without using a tourniquet. Prolonged use may be uncomfortable and can cause haemolysis, adversely affecting the quality of the sample.</p>
                            
                            <p>Some research has identified contamination with MRSA on multiple-use tourniquets (Elhassan and Dixon 2011). There is an ongoing debate about the need for disposable tourniquets. The problem with these is that many of them do not incorporate a slow release mechanism, so they are either on or off. There is therefore no way to easily retighten the tourniquet if the blood flow stops.</p>
                            
                            <p>If reusable tourniquets are used, then consider washing them at the end of every session and never use them if they are visibly contaminated. You must always use the type of tourniquet as stated in your local policy.</p>

                            <p>Avoid using the weak or paralysed arm if the patient has had a stroke. Any tight clothing should be removed. Support the patient's arm on a pad and advise the patient to keep the arm straight throughout the procedure. Look for the most visible and palpable or 'bouncy' vein. The median cubital vein is usually the easiest to puncture. The basilic vein may be used, but as it usually runs above the brachial artery and nerve there is a greater risk of an arterial stab or nerve damage, so it is best avoided if possible. Where there isn't a good visible vein, apply the tourniquet and take time to carefully palpate the area to identify the best vein. Time taken at this stage is time well spent! Try to avoid choosing a site where the veins are diverging as there is more risk of a bruise forming. Loosen the tourniquet once the vein is located.</p>

It is much better to do this than to have to go through the whole procedure again if it makes them faint! If they are not safe, take off the tourniquet and remove the needle. Advise the patient to lean forward with their head down or to lie down. Apply a dressing to the venepuncture site. Support the patient gently to the floor if necessary and elevate the legs. Recovery from a simple faint is usually quite quick, but they may need a glass of water and observation for a short while. If the blood has not been taken at this stage, refer them to a registered practitioner for further tests. Always have the patient checked over by a registered practitioner before they leave the surgery if they have been unwell.</p>

                                        <p>This is an uncommon event but can happen, especially when choosing a vein on the inner edge of the antecubital fossa. This is where the brachial artery is usually situated, but it is deeper and can be distinguished from a vein because the artery will have a pulse and will not 'plump up' when the tourniquet is applied. Blood from an artery will pump into the collection bottle in spurts and will be a brighter red colour than that from a vein. If this happens, take the tourniquet off and remove the needle. You should apply pressure for a minimum of five minutes and apply a pressure dressing when bleeding has stopped. Ask a registered practitioner to assess the patient before attempting venepuncture again or before the patient leaves the surgery.</p>

                            <p>This is useful when only a very small amount of blood is needed or when venepuncture is difficult. It is a convenient way of monitoring blood glucose, INR and cholesterol levels. It is not without potential pitfalls, however, and the person performing the test must ensure that it is done correctly to provide as accurate a result as possible.</p>
