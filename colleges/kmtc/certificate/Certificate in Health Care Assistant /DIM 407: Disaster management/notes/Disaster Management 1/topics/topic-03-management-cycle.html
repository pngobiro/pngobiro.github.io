                            <p>Disaster management is a cyclical process. The end of one phase is the beginning of another, although one phase of the cycle does not necessarily have to be completed in order for the next to take place. Often, several phases take place concurrently. Timely decision making during each phase results in greater preparedness, better warnings, reduced vulnerability and or the prevention of future disasters.</p>
                            <p>A complete disaster management cycle includes the shaping of public policies and plans that either addresses the causes of disasters or mitigates their effects on people, property, and infrastructure.</p>
