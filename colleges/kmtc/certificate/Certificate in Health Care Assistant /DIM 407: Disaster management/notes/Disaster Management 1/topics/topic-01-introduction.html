                                <p><strong>Disaster:</strong> The World Health Organization (WHO) defines a disaster as "a sudden ecological phenomenon of sufficient magnitude to require external assistance".</p>
                                <p>It is also defined as any event, typically occurring suddenly, that causes damage, ecological disruption, loss of human life, deterioration of health and health services, and which exceeds the capacity of the affected community on a scale sufficient to require outside assistance (Landsman, 2001).</p>
                                <p>It is an emergency of such severity and magnitude that the resultant combination of deaths, injuries, illness, and property damage cannot be effectively managed with routine procedures or resources.</p>
                                <p>Disaster is further defined as an event in which a society or a community undergoes acute deprivation of food and other basic necessities due to natural and man-made calamities to such an extent that the normal function of the society or the community is disrupted and that it cannot subsist without outside intervention.</p>
                                <p>World Bank, 2001; Defines "disaster; as a sudden, extremely unfortunate event that affects many people" to the scale that cannot be managed by the Local population.</p>
