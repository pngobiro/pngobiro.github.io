It refers to all the equipment, processes and mechanisms used to store and transport vaccines from the producer to the user (including vaccine carriers, cold-boxes, refrigerators, freezers and cold rooms) by air, road and over water bodies.

                                        The process by which an individual’s immune system becomes fortified against an agent (known as the immunogen). When this system is exposed to molecules that are foreign to the body, called non-self, it will orchestrate an immune response, and it will also develop the ability to quickly respond to a subsequent encounter because of immunological memory.

It warns the health worker as to when a vial of a vaccine should be discarded because the vaccine is likely to have been degraded by exposure to heat. VVMs measure cumulative heat exposure.

                                The Ministry of Health established The Kenya Expanded Programme on Immunization (KEPI) in 1980 with the main aim of providing immunization against six killer diseases of childhood, namely <strong>tuberculosis, polio, diphtheria, whooping cough, tetanus and measles</strong> to all children in the country before their first birthday, and <strong>tetanus toxoid</strong> vaccination to all pregnant women.
                            </p>

                                EPI was established in June, 1980 by the Kenya government to oversee and monitor vaccinations to all children in Kenya against five common diseases at that time. To improve outcomes, a number of vaccines have been added since then.

                            <p>Vitamin A, though not a vaccine was integrated into the infant immunization schedule in the 1980s due to its immune boosting effects and the obviously optimal opportunity for administration.</p>
                            <p>Vitamin A deficiency is a cause of preventable blindness in Kenya and therefore all efforts must be made to strengthen the supplementation of Vitamin A for all infants.</p>
                            <p>A key strategy for increasing Vitamin A supplementation coverage to all infants and young children is Regular Vitamin A supplementation of infants and young children up to their 5th year of life.</p>
