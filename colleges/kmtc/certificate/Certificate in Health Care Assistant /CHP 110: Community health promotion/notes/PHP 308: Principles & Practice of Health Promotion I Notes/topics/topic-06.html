                            <p>Advocacy is a combination of social actions designed to gain political commitment, policy support, social acceptance and systems support for a particular goal or program. It involves collecting and structuring information into a persuasive case; communicating the case to decision-makers and other potential supporters, including the public and consumers, through various interpersonal and media channels; and stimulating actions by social institutions, stakeholders and policy-makers in support of the goal or programme. Health promotion embraces advocacy in presenting health issues/problems as priority political and development agenda. The goal of advocacy is to make the issue a political or national priority that cannot be swept aside with a change in government.</p>

                            <p>Health Education is any combination of learning experiences designed to help individuals and communities improve their health, by increasing their knowledge or influencing their attitudes. WHO defines health education as "comprising of consciously constructed opportunities for learning involving some form of communication designed to improve health literacy, including improving knowledge and developing life skills which are conducive to individual and community health." Basic literacy is an essential building block for development and health promotion. Health literacy interventions need to be designed based on health, social and cultural needs. Purpose of health education is to positively influence health behavior of individuals and communities as well as their living and working condition.</p>

                            <p>Health promotion activities rely on a variety of well-designed and effective visual products to help ensure success. Every brochure, poster, videotape or other piece of IEC material is the product of a decision, supported by research, to deal with a specific health concern, and to be well received and persuasive among a specific audience.</p>
                            <p>The success and impact of visual products depends largely on the understanding of the target audience. Working with target audience members throughout the development of visual products, and in developing usage strategies for those materials, helps ensure that visual products meet the needs of the intended target audience.</p>
                            <p>This handbook offers a set of basic steps for developing visual products to follow in the planning, design (or adaptation) and production. It outlines a clear, six-step approach, with each step supporting the next, which design teams should endeavor to follow.</p>

                            <p>Social Mobilisation is a process whereby people are organised in order to enable them to collectively think and act upon their development. Social Mobilisation consists of the organising of communities in rural and peri-urban area.</p>
                            <p>Its about society you and me; Its about people taking action with the objective of making a change for a common good. Health promotion is a social process and so is social mobilization.</p>
                            <p>Social mobilization is the primary step of community development for recovery from conflicts and disasters. It allows people to think and understand their situation and to organize and initiate action for their recovery with their own initiative and creativity. Through mobilization, people can organize themselves to take action collectively by developing their own plan and strategy for recovery rather than being imposed from outside</p>
                            <p>Social mobilization is an important means to advance sustainable development policy by making it more responsive and accountable to people's needs and demands.</p>

                            <p>Capacity building is a name for the familiar concepts of community and workforce development. Capacity building taps into existing abilities of individuals, communities, organisations or systems to increase involvement, decision-making and ownership of issues. In a health promotion context, the notion of capacity building stems from the recognition that strategies can be more effective and sustainable if the effort extends beyond traditional health sector boundaries. The benefits are clear. By working across sectors, there is potential to build individual skills, strengthen community action, and empower organisations to promote sustainable health behaviours and support healthy environments. Capacity building incorporates advocacy and relies on partnerships.</p>
                            <p>Capacity building can start from the inside with the individual and then spread through the community and organisational levels to the outer systems level.</p>

                                    <p>With community mobilization, participation is about meeting the interests of the whole community. When every member of a community has the chance, directly or through representation, to participate in the design, implementation and monitoring of community-level initiatives, there is a higher likelihood that the program accurately reflects their real needs and interests. The approach takes into consideration the different experiences, needs and capabilities of various groups in a community – women and men, youth and the elderly, persons with disabilities and the able-bodied, ethnic/religious/language minorities and majorities. Rather than "passive participation," we aim to inspire "self-mobilization", where communities organize and take initiative independent of any external actors.</p>

                                    <p>Accountability is most basically the process of sharing information about actions or intentions. Groups and individuals in relationships, such as in communities, are accountable to each other when they honor their commitment to communicate plans and are responsible for what they actually do. In community mobilization, every community and all citizens have the right to know the procedures, decision-making processes and financial flows of the programs Mercy Corps implements, as well as the specific community-led projects. Mercy Corps and local partner organizations sign contracts, have open selection criteria and processes for projects, and require documentation and tracking of all information to keep the exchange of information open. Transparency helps ensure that decisions that affect the community are made in a socially responsible way – that particular groups, such as ethnic minorities or persons with disabilities, are not excluded from the benefits of projects or activities.</p>

                                    <p>Governance, in general, relates to the process of decision-making and how those decisions are implemented. Accountability is an essential characteristic of good governance, where leaders are accountable for their decisions to people affected by those decisions. When these processes are institutionalized they become a system of government. Governance is good when it is accountable, transparent, just, responsive and participatory. Good governance is a goal of community mobilization, plus a condition for all development initiatives to be sustainable. In a country like Indonesia, established and functioning government structures exist throughout the country. Long-term programs work with local government or national agencies as full partners in all Mercy Corps-Indonesia mobilization programs. By contrast, in Somalia, where there is not a functioning government presence in much of the country, Mercy Corps works closely with local leaders acknowledged by the community for the role they play in decision-making. Mobilization activities in these contexts can build the foundation for good governance.</p>

                                    <p>By focusing on societies in transition, Mercy Corps is often working in conflict-affected contexts and those undergoing significant socio-economic change. Community mobilization efforts must take conflict dynamics and even positive tensions into account. Which projects can best build on connections across communities instead of fuelling tensions? How does a project impact perceptions of disparity and access? What precautions do we need to take? Dialogue and transparency promote a certain degree of confidence and reduce friction. However, care must be taken to mitigate the potential negative impacts of all community mobilization activities. These are the main points of the "Do No Harm" concept and apply to all communities. It is Mercy Corps' responsibility to avoid the pitfalls of jealousy and competition over scarce resources within communities, which can happen when aid or development opportunities are not carefully planned and communicated.</p>
