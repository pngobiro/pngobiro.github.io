                            <p>The term "health promotion" (HP) refers to a broad social and political process that includes both actions intended to improve people's abilities and skills and actions intended to alter social, environmental, and economic conditions in order to lessen their negative effects on both public and individual health. The purpose of HP practice is to create and sustain environments that enable individuals to make healthy decisions and promote social contexts that support healthy behaviors.</p>

                            <p>This logo was established in 1986 during the First International Conference on Health Promotion in Ottawa, Canada. WHO has used this symbol as the Health Promotion logo ever since.</p>
                            <p>The logo is a circle with three wings. It includes five main HP action areas: establishing supportive settings for health, increasing community action for health, developing personal skills, and re-orienting health services, as well as three fundamental HP strategies: empower, mediate, and advocate.</p>

One of the prerequisites "for HP to be effective" (Jakarta Declaration 1997) is HP's integration of many strategies and methodologies.

In this sense, it is a resource for everyday life, not the object of living. It is a positive concept emphasizing social and personal resources as well as physical capabilities.

                                    <p>The early civilization is the starting point for research into the history of health promotion and education. The writings of the Babylonians, Egyptians, and the Old Testament reveal the use of a variety of health promotion strategies in connection to food, shelter, water, and safety. There were mechanisms in place in the neighborhood to collect rainwater or supply clean water. The usage of earth closets was one of several sewage disposal techniques. Personal hygiene was encouraged. It was acknowledged that intoxication was problematic. Numerous dietary restrictions and different hygienic regulations restricted food production and supply. Exercise was advocated. In some settings building regulations were set, and garbage removal and street cleaning began to occur regularly. Mental Health and spiritual health were advocated.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>The majority of Early Civilizations merged health and religion. Many of the early hospitals and practitioners of the healing arts were supported by organized religion. The early temples were also the first hospitals in various cultures. In the history of medicine, health promotion, and health education, religious practitioners' desire to enhance the health and well-being of others has been a major factor.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>Histories of public health reveal that cultures have always employed some type of collective public health initiatives, even if they were not labeled as health promotion. Here are several examples: The public Roman baths, Roman regulations controlling the burial of the dead as well as the regulation of harmful animals and defective commodities, Prostitution was regulated in Ancient Rome and Greece, Smallpox vaccinations in India and China prior to the Christian period, People with leprosy were isolated in Europe during the middle Ages and The Venetians' quarantining of ships.</p>

                                    <p>Technology and research have significantly influenced prevention by enabling us to comprehend the causal roles of pathogens and the effectiveness of immunization. Similar to how the development and advancement of preventative programs were influenced by the discovery of the impact of food, exercise, and drug misuse on chronic illness.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>In Northern Europe, the Industrial revolution (late 18th century in Britain), resulted in massive changes in population patterns and in the physical environment in which people lived. In the United Kingdom, the poor's overcrowded and unclean living circumstances, along with the increase of typhoid and cholera as major causes of mortality, put pressure on the government to enact changes or legislation to enhance public health. In 1842, Edwin Chadwick, who was in charge of heading a "Health of Towns commission" and lobbying for the first public health reforms, proposed that impoverished people's bad health was caused by inadequate housing, sanitation, and filthy water. The 1848 Public Health Act was the outcome of their efforts.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>Around this period (1854), John Snow, one of the earliest epidemiologists, was involved in the now-famous episode. Snow tracked an epidemic to a water pump in Broad Street, Soho, and London, proving that cholera was a watery illness. The epidemic was terminated when the water pump was not used. Experiences like this and public health regulations prompted local administrations to employ medical officers to uphold public health legislation and provide advice on suitable remedies.</p>

                                    <p>At the end of the nineteenth century, the emphasis on improving environmental and social circumstances to avoid illness was eclipsed by the growing popularity and investment in medical (or curative) approaches to illness.</p>
                                    <p>However, activism, protest, and questioning the status quo or existing circumstances were characteristics of the social atmosphere of the 1960s and 1970s. Additionally, the early 1970s saw a crisis in the expense of healthcare in many nations. People started to realize that while medicine could be effective in treating short-term ailments like TB or pneumonia, it did not seem to have much to offer in treating chronic diseases like cancer. There was still no cure for the sickness, and cancer rates remained the same. As a result, it looked that the value or returns from the investment in medical technology were declining. Thomas McKeown's (1976) major hypothesis or theory reaffirmed the significance of non-medical variables in enhancing community health in industrialized countries.</p>
                                    <p>Thomas McKeown, a physician and demographic historian, advanced the theory in the body of knowledge that the improvement in general standards of living—especially diet and nutrition status—resulting from better economic conditions, rather than life-saving advances in the fields of medicine or public health, was responsible for the growth in population in the industrial world from the late 1700s to the present. Many researchers' questions and research hypotheses were influenced by "The McKeown thesis," which also gave rise to a protracted debate.</p>

                                    <p>Traditionally, health education has been used to refer to educational intervention. The fundamental attitude shifted from moralistic ("don't do it because God or the church don't want you to") to legalistic ("don't do it because it's against the law").</p>
                                    <p>As a result of this transition, educational programs began to emphasize on the potentially detrimental effects of various substances or activities, as well as why they were forbidden. Of course, one goal was to describe what would happen if lawbreakers were apprehended. Another was to persuade politicians and others to participate in social engineering, such as enacting legislation requiring the adoption of safety-related devices like as air bags.</p>
                                    <p>The education process has changed as well. The original model were cognitive (presenting facts), but were replaced by affective models (changing- attitudes), peer- counselling and peer support models, decision-making models and recently behavioral models.</p>
