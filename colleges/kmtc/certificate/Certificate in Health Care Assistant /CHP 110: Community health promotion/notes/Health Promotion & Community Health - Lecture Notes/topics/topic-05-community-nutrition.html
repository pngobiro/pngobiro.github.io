                            <p>Community nutrition is the process of helping individuals and groups develop healthy eating habits in order to promote wellness and prevent disease.</p>

                            <h3 class="card-title">Purpose</h3>
                            <p>Americans increasingly eat a diet that is high in saturated fat and refined sugars and lacking in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Poor dietary habits are linked to health conditions such as obesity, diabetes, heart disease, strokes, and some forms of cancer. With more than half of Americans classified as overweight or obese, organizations including the American Dietetic Association strive to increase awareness about the importance of a healthy diet and exercise. The goal of community nutrition is to educate individuals and groups so that they adopt healthy eating habits. Dieticians and nutritionists work with many other health care professionals in promoting improved community nutrition. Their efforts emphasize a preventive approach in educating individuals in how a change in dietary habits will reduce the risk of illness.</p>

                                    <p>Obesity is an issue for many age groups. Causes include lack of physical education programs in schools and an overly busy lifestyle for adults. The availability of fast food and "supersized" items are regarded positively because of their cost and convenience. Their accessibility and convenience often prompts people to make unhealthy food choices. In a school cafeteria, for example, a child may bypass a salad in favor of fries and a soda. A moviegoer may choose to buy a tub of buttered popcorn because the purchase price includes a free refill.</p>

While sweet, high fat foods may be an occasional treat, community nutrition emphasizes a lifetime of routine healthy eating.</p>

Some individuals such as those with diabetes who participate in community nutrition programs may have special dietary needs.</p>

Community nutrition programs strive to improve eating habits through food banks that distribute food as needed. Some cities have monthly food distribution programs. Distributors provide discounted packages that contain healthy foods such as meat, eggs, vegetables, fruit, bread and rice.</p>

                            <p>Preparation for participating in a community nutrition program varies from program to program. An individual with a medical condition may need to consult a physician before entering a program. Registration is required for some community nutrition projects, and an assessment interview is often required to determine eligibility to participate in some programs.</p>

                            <h3 class="card-title mt-6">Aftercare</h3>
                            <p>Some programs require follow-up classes or meetings. A nutritionist may do an assessment interview to determine whether or not a program is effective. Surveying is one method of determining whether participants understood concepts and helps determine if they have adopted healthier eating habits.</p>
                            <p>In addition, some weight-loss programs offer maintenance classes. Health care providers may offer ongoing support groups or cooking classes that feature healthy recipes.</p>
