                            <p>Infection is the entry and development or multiplication of an infectious agent in the body of man or animals. <strong>An infection does not always cause illness.</strong> A person can be infected without showing clinical signs or symptoms.</p>
                            
                            <h3>Contamination</h3>
                            <p>The presence of an infectious agent on a body surface, on or in clothes, beddings, surgical instruments or dressings, or other articles or substances including water and food. Contamination does not necessarily mean infection has occurred.</p>

                            <h3>Infestation</h3>
                            <p>It is the lodgment, development and reproduction of arthropods on the surface of the body or in the clothing, e.g. lice, itch mite. This term could also be used to describe the invasion of the gut by parasitic worms, e.g. Ascariasis.</p>

                            <h3>Contagious Disease</h3>
                            <p>A disease that is transmitted through contact. Examples include scabies, trachoma, sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and leprosy.</p>

                            <p>A person or an animal that affords subsistence or lodgement to an infectious agent under natural conditions. An animal or an organism, or human being that harbours an infectious agent or disease.</p>

                            <h3>Vector</h3>
                            <p>An insect or any living carrier that transports an infectious agent from an infected individual or its wastes to a susceptible individual or its food or immediate surroundings. Vectors are crucial in the transmission of many diseases like malaria, dengue, and filariasis.</p>

                            <h3>Reservoir</h3>
                            <p>Any person, animal, arthropod, plant, soil, or substance, or a combination of these, in which an infectious agent normally lives and multiplies, on which it depends primarily for survival, and where it reproduces itself in such a manner that it can be transmitted to a susceptible host. It is the natural habitat of the infectious agent.</p>

                            <h3>Epidemic</h3>
                            <p>The unusual occurrence in a community of disease, specific health related behavior, or other health related events clearly in excess of expected occurrence. An epidemic indicates a sudden increase in cases above the expected level.</p>

                            <h3>Endemic</h3>
                            <p>It refers to the constant presence of a disease or infectious agent within a given geographic area or population group. It is the usual or expected frequency of disease within a population. Endemic diseases are always present in a community at a relatively stable level.</p>

                            <h3>Pandemic</h3>
                            <p>An epidemic usually affecting a large proportion of the population, occurring over a wide geographic area such as a section of a nation, the entire nation, a continent or the world. Examples include influenza pandemics and COVID-19.</p>

                            <h3>Exotic Disease</h3>
                            <p>Diseases which are imported into a country in which they do not otherwise occur. For example, rabies in the UK is considered an exotic disease as it is not endemic there.</p>

                            <h3>Sporadic</h3>
                            <p>The word sporadic means "scattered about." The cases occur irregularly, haphazardly from time to time, and generally infrequently. The cases are few and separated widely in time and place that they show no or little connection with each other, nor a recognizable common source of infection. Examples include polio, meningococcal meningitis, and tetanus.</p>

                            <p>Infection by organisms that take the opportunity provided by a defect in host defense (e.g., immunity) to infect the host and thus cause disease. Opportunistic infections are very common in AIDS patients. Organisms include Herpes simplex, cytomegalovirus, and Pneumocystis jirovecii.</p>

                            <p>Termination of all transmission of infection by the extermination of the infectious agent through surveillance and containment. Eradication is an absolute process, an "all or none" phenomenon, restricted to termination of infection from the whole world. Smallpox is the only human disease that has been eradicated.</p>

                            <h3>Elimination</h3>
                            <p>Sometimes used to describe eradication of a disease from a large geographic region. Diseases which are amenable to elimination in the meantime include polio, measles, and diphtheria. While not yet eradicated globally, these diseases have been eliminated from many regions.</p>
