                                    <strong>Nano Banana says:</strong> A "group" isn't just a crowd on the street! It needs interaction, shared goals, and structure.

                            </div>

                            <h3>What is a Group? A Working Definition</h3>
                            <p>A group is a collection of two or more interacting individuals in a stable pattern of relationships, provides rewards to its members, who share goals, and perceive themselves as a group.</p>
                            
                            <h4>Group characteristics:</h4>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">two or more people in social interaction.</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">rewards to members.</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">stable structure.</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">members share common interests or goals.</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">individuals must perceive themselves as a group.</span></li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Mere aggregates of people do not fit this definition because they do not interact and do not perceive themselves to be a group even if they are aware of each other as, for instance, a crowd on a street comer watching some event (nominal groups). True groups possess all of the qualities of groups, especially the quality of interaction (interacting groups).</p>

                            <h3>Formal and Informal Groups</h3>
                            <p>Individuals join groups, or are assigned to groups, to accomplish various purposes. If the group is formed by a manager to help the organization accomplish its goals, then it qualifies as a formal group. Formal groups typically wear such labels as work group, team, committee, quality circle, or task force. An informal group exists when the members' overriding purpose of getting together is friendship. Although formal and informal groups often overlap, such as a team of corporate auditors heading for the tennis courts after work, some employees are not friends with their co-workers.</p>

                            <h3>Functions of Formal Groups</h3>
                            <p>Researchers point out that formal groups fulfill two basic functions: organizational and individual. Complex combinations of these functions can be found in formal groups at any given time.</p>

                            <h3>Why Do People Join Groups?</h3>
                            <p>People join groups for a variety of reasons.</p>

                            <p>How many group members is too many? The answer to this deceptively simple question has intrigued managers and academics for years. Folk wisdom says "two heads are better than one" but that "too many cooks spoil the broth." So where should a manager draw the line when staffing a committee? At 3? At 5 or 6? At 10 or more? Researchers have taken two different approaches to pinpointing optimum group size: mathematical modeling and laboratory simulations. Let us briefly review recent findings from these two approaches.</p>

                            <h4>Task versus Maintenance Roles</h4>
                            <p>Task roles enable the work group to define, clarify, and pursue a common purpose. Meanwhile, maintenance roles foster supportive and constructive interpersonal relationships. In short, task roles keep the group on track while maintenance roles keep the group together. A fraternity or sorority member is performing a task function when he or she stands at a business meeting and says: "What is the real issue here? We don't seem to be getting anywhere." Another individual who says, "Let's hear from those who oppose this plan," is performing a maintenance function. Importantly, each of the various task and maintenance roles may be played in varying combinations and sequences by either the group's leader or any of its members.</p>

                                <li>when someone performs differently, either more effectively or less effectively, in the presence of others than when alone, they are experiencing social facilitation. This phenomenon is explained by several psychological processes.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Individuals experience heightened emotional arousal. Then when aroused they have a tendency to perform the most dominant response, what comes normally. If the dominant response is appropriate, performance will be enhanced. If the dominant response is inappropriate, as in a new situation, performance will be impaired.</p>
                            <p>While there is a lot of research to support this theory, the "why" of it is still unclear. Social facilitation may result in evaluation apprehension, the fear of being evaluated or judged by another. Another explanation is the distraction-conflict model which recognizes that the presence of others creates a conflict as to where attention is directed.</p>

                            <h3>Social Loafing: "Free Riding" When Working with Others</h3>
                            <p>Additive tasks are those in which each person's contributions are added together to another's. Unfortunately, as people work together, some in the group may ride on the efforts of others. This is social loafing.</p>
                            <p>Some explain social loafing through social impact theory, that the impact of any social force acting on a group is divided equally among its members. As a result, each member feels less than fully responsible for the outcome and puts in less effort.</p>
                            <p>Another explanation is that the contributions of others makes each individual feel that his/her contribution is less important.</p>
                            <p>A contributing issue is that some members of a group may be more interested in getting something for themselves than getting something for the group.</p>

                            <p>The study of social groups is a main focus of many sociologists. In this lesson, we define social groups and differentiate between several different types including primary, secondary, and reference groups.</p>
                            
                            <h3>Social Groups</h3>
                            <p>Social groups are everywhere and are a basic part of human life; everywhere you look there seem to be groups of people! A main focus of sociology is the study of these social groups. A social group consists of two or more people who regularly interact and share a sense of unity and common identity. In other words, it's a group of people who see each other frequently and consider themselves a part of the group. Except in rare cases, we all typically belong to many different types of social groups. For example, you could be a member of a sports team, club, church group, college class, workplace, and more.</p>

                            <h3>Primary Groups</h3>
                            <p>No two groups are created equal. Each typically has its own purpose, culture, norms, etc. Sociologists differentiate between several different types of social groups. In this lesson, we'll discuss primary groups, secondary groups, and reference groups. Primary groups are those that are close-knit. They are typically small scale, include intimate relationships, and are usually long lasting. The members of primary groups feel a strong personal identity with the group.</p>
                            <p>Although the nuclear family is considered the ideal primary group by some sociologists, it is not the only example. Many people are also a member of a group of close friends. This group is usually small, and the relationships are still close-knit and enduring, so it is also a primary group. The term 'primary' is used with these groups because they are the primary source of relationships and socialization. The relationships in our primary groups give us love, security, and companionship. We also learn values and norms from our family and friends that stay with us for most, if not all, of our lives.</p>

                            <h3>Secondary Groups</h3>
                            <p><strong>Secondary groups</strong> are another type of social group. They have the opposite characteristics of primary groups. They can be small or large and are mostly impersonal and usually short term. These groups are typically found at work and school. An example of a secondary group is a committee organized to plan a holiday party at work. Members of the committee meet infrequently and for only a short period of time. Although group members may have some similar interests, the purpose of the group is about the task instead of the relationships. Sometimes, secondary groups become pretty informal, and the members get to know each other fairly well. Even so, their friendships exist in a limited context; they won't necessarily remain close beyond the holiday party.</p>

                            <h3>Reference Groups</h3>
                            <p>The last type of group we'll discuss in this lesson is a <strong>reference group</strong>. Reference groups are groups that we look to for guidance in order to evaluate our behaviors and attitudes. They are basically generalized versions of role models. You may or may not belong to the group, but you use its standards of measurement as a frame of reference. For example, if a teenager wants to know if she is slim enough, she may use supermodels as a reference. Or, if a recent college graduate is unsure if an offered salary is fair, he may use the average starting salary of graduates from his school as a reference.</p>

                            <p>Forming a team takes time, and members often go through recognizable stages as they change from being a collection of strangers to a united group with common goals. Bruce Tuckman's Forming, Storming, Norming, and Performing model describes these stages. When you understand it, you can help your new team become effective more quickly.</p>

                            <h3>About the Model</h3>
                            <p>Psychologist Bruce Tuckman first came up with the memorable phrase "forming, storming, norming, and performing" in his 1965 article, "Developmental Sequence in Small Groups." He used it to describe the path that most teams follow on their way to high performance. Later, he added a fifth stage, "adjourning" (which is sometimes known as "mourning"). Let's look at each stage in more detail.</p>

                                        <p class="step-text">Next, the team moves into the storming phase, where people start to push against the boundaries established in the forming stage. This is the stage where many teams fail.</p>
                                        <p class="step-text">Storming often starts where there is a conflict between team members' natural working styles. People may work in different ways for all sorts of reasons but, if differing working styles cause unforeseen problems, they may become frustrated.</p>
                                        <p class="step-text">Storming can also happen in other situations. For example, team members may challenge your authority, or jockey for position as their roles are clarified. Or, if you haven't defined clearly how the team will work, people may feel overwhelmed by their workload, or they could be uncomfortable with the approach you're using.</p>
                                        <p class="step-text">Some may question the worth of the team's goal, and they may resist taking on tasks.</p>
                                        <p class="step-text">Team members who stick with the task at hand may experience stress, particularly as they don't have the support of established processes or strong relationships with their colleagues.</p>

                                        <p class="step-text">Gradually, the team moves into the norming stage. This is when people start to resolve their differences, appreciate colleagues' strengths, and respect your authority as a leader.</p>
                                        <p class="step-text">Now that your team members know one another better, they may socialize together, and they are able to ask one another for help and provide constructive feedback. People develop a stronger commitment to the team goal, and you start to see good progress towards it.</p>
                                        <p class="step-text">There is often a prolonged overlap between storming and norming, because, as new tasks come up, the team may lapse back into behavior from the storming stage.</p>

                            <p>"He's Not a Patient, but Plays One for Class," the headline said. For 12 days in July 2010, a 24-year-old medical student named Matt entered a nursing home in Chelsea, Massachusetts, to play the role of an 85-year-old man bound to a wheelchair and suffering from several serious health problems. He and five other medical students were staying in the facility to get a better idea of how to care for the elderly.</p>
                            <p>Matt kept a daily journal and wrote regularly of the problems of using his wheelchair, among other topics. One day he wrote, "I never really noticed how hard it is to live like this. I just always thought of old people as grumpy people who are easily upset." He had trouble reaching a TV remote control or reading a notice that was posted too high. When he first showered in his wheelchair, he was unable to turn it to be able to wash the right side of his body. He was so embarrassed to ask for help in going to the bathroom that he tried to spread out his bathroom trips so that the same nurse would not have to help him twice in a row.</p>
                            <p>The experience taught Matt a lot about how to care not only for older patients but also for patients in general. The emotional bonds he developed with other patients during his time in the nursing home particularly made him realize how he should interact with patients. As Matt wrote in his journal, "There is a face and story behind every patient. The patient should not be viewed by the conditions that all them, but by the person beneath the disease." (Wu, 2010) Wu, J. Q. (2010, July 19). He's not a patient, but plays one for class. The Boston Globe, p. B1.</p>
                            <p>The status of an 85-year-old man bound to a wheelchair is very different from that of a medical student. So are our views of people in each status and our expectations of their behavior. Matt quickly learned what life in a wheelchair is like and realized that his stereotypical views of older people could easily complicate his medical interactions with them. The setting in which he played the role of a very old man was an institutional setting, but this setting was also one tiny component of the vast social institution that sociologists call medicine.</p>
                            <p>In all these ways, Matt’s brief experience in the nursing home illuminates important aspects of social structure and social interaction in today’s society. The statuses we occupy and the roles we play in these statuses shape our lives in fundamental ways and affect our daily interactions with other people. The many social institutions that are so important in modern society affect our lives profoundly from the moment we are born. This chapter examines major aspects of social structure and social interaction. As with Chapter 3 "Culture" and Chapter 4 "Socialization", this chapter should help you further understand yourself as a social being and not just as an individual. This in turn means it should further help you understand how and why you came to be the person you are.</p>

                                Social Structure: The Building Blocks of Social Life
                            </h2>
                        </div>
                        <div class="content-card">
                            <p>Social life is composed of many levels of building blocks, from the very micro to the very macro. These building blocks combine to form the social structure. As Chapter 1 "Sociology and the Sociological Perspective" explained, social structure refers to the social patterns through which a society is organized and can be horizontal or vertical. To recall, horizontal social structure refers to the social relationships and the social and physical characteristics of communities to which individuals belong, while vertical social structure, more commonly called social inequality, refers to ways in which a society or group ranks people in a hierarchy. This chapter’s discussion of social structure focuses primarily on horizontal social structure, while Chapter 8 "Social Stratification" through Chapter 12 "Aging and the Elderly", as well as much material in other chapters, examine dimensions of social inequality. The (horizontal) social structure comprises several components, to which we now turn, starting with the most micro and ending with the most macro. Our discussion of social interaction in the second half of this chapter incorporates several of these components.</p>
                            
                            <h3>Statuses</h3>
                            <p>Status has many meanings in the dictionary and also within sociology, but for now we will define it as the position that someone occupies in society. This position is often a job title, but many other types of positions exist: student, parent, sibling, relative, friend, and so forth. It should be clear that <em>status</em> as used in this way conveys nothing about the prestige of the position, to use a common synonym for status. A physician’s job is a status with much prestige, but a shoeshiner’s job is a status with no prestige.</p>
                            <p>Any one individual often occupies several different statuses at the same time, and someone can simultaneously be a banker, Girl Scout troop leader, mother, school board member, volunteer at a homeless shelter, and spouse. This someone would be very busy! We call all the positions an individual occupies that person’s status set (see Figure 5.1 "Example of a Status Set").</p>

                            <h3>Social Status</h3>
                            <p>Social status refers to one’s standing in the community and his position in the social hierarchy.</p>
                            <p>Social status may be achieved (earned) or ascribed (assigned at birth). Both achieved and ascribed statuses influence one another. Social mobility allows an individual to move between social levels in the general social hierarchy.</p>

                                    <h4 class="callout-title">The Rosenhan Study (Being Sane in Insane Places)</h4>
                                </div>
                                <div class="callout-content">
                                    <p>In a study by Rosenhan, eight pseudopatients who were actually research investigators gained entry into mental hospitals by claiming to hear voices. During the intake interviews, the pseudopatients gave true accounts of their backgrounds, life experiences, and present (quite ordinary) psychological condition. They falsified only their names and their complaint of hearing voices. Once in the psychiatric ward, they ceased simulating any signs of abnormality. They reported that the voices had stopped, talked normally with other patients, and made observations in their notebooks. Although some of the other patients suspected that the investigators were not really ill, the staff did not. Even upon discharge, they were still diagnosed as schizophrenic, though now it was "schizophrenia in remission".</p>
                                    <p>Rosenhan described his results to other mental hospitals, and their administrators said they could not be taken in by such a ruse. Rosenhan then told them that they would be visited by a pseudopatient in the next 3 months, and he challenged them to identify who it was. During the 3 month period, 193 patients were admitted, and the psychologists identified 41 they thought were pseudopatients. In reality, Rosenhan had not sent anybody!</p>

                            </div>

                            <p>In deciding how to classify the patients, the staff doctors were engaged in social perception. Social perception refers to the processes through which we use available information to form impressions of other people, to assess what they are like.</p>
                            <p>Social perceptions can obviously be flawed - even skilled observers can misperceive, misjudge, and reach the wrong conclusions. Once we form wrong impressions, they are likely to persist.</p>
                            
                            <h3>Attribution Theory</h3>
                            <p>Attribution is the process through which we link behavior to its causes - to the intentions, dispositions and events that explain why people act the way they do.</p>
