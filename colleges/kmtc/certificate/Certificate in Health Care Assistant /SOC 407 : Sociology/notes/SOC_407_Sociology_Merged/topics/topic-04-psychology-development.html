                            <h3>Meaning of Growth</h3>
                            <p>Growth refers to the process of growing up including development of the human body as it gets older and the psychology development of person as he / she matures.</p>
                            <p>Growth - can also be referred as the quantitative or measurable changes in individual in relation to size and the structure as a result of biological process in the living organism.</p>

                            <h3>Development</h3>
                            <p>According to Mosby’s dental dictionary development refers to the process by which an individual reaches the maturity.</p>
                            <p>Development can also be the qualitative change or the complexity of a particular aspect for example the increase in the language vocabulary is viewed as development.</p>
                            <p>Development can also be looked as a progressive series of changes that occurs in predictable pattern as the result of interaction between biological and environment factors.</p>

                            <p>According to novella, Ruffin in the article of human growth and development a matter of principles that characterized the pattern and process of growth and development.</p>
                            <p>These principles or characteristic describes typical development as a predicatable and orderly process the is we can predict how most children will develop at the same rate and at about same time as other children.</p>
                            <p>Although there are individual different in children personalities, actively level and timing of development. Milestone such as age and stages the principle and characteristic of development are universal patterns.</p>
                            <p>These are the causes of development according to these principles. Infant development control of head and pace movement within the 1st two months.</p>
                            <p>They are able to lift themselves up by using their arms by 6-12 months of age. Infant starts to gain leg control and may be able to crawl, stand and walk.</p>
                            <p>Coordination of arms always proceeds co-ordination of legs.</p>

This means that the spinal cord develops before the outer parts of the body. The Childs arms develop by the hand and feet develop by the fingers and toes.

                                    <p>These changes in the brain and nervures system help children to improve in thinking (cognitive) and motor (physical skill). Also children must mature to a certain point before they can progress to new skills (re adness) for example. For a month old cannot use language because the infant brain has not matured enough to allow the child to talk</p>

Trust is denied from warm care and discipline from caregiver the manner in which the needs of the infant are satisfied will determine the kind of emotion that the child will have stronger sense of trust not only to nurturing person but to other social figures in the life of a child. A child stronger sense of mistrust become very pessimistic doubtful of social relationship. The child is likely to develop a high sense of mistrust in the other hand he/she feels that the nurturing person is not concerned about its needs the feeling of mistrust is only extended to social figure in child's life. The infant will develop a health balance between trust and mistrust if feels cared for and no over-indulged or over protected</p>

                                The Twelve Stages of the Human Life Cycle
                            </h2>
                        </div>
                        <div class="content-card">
                            <p>Which stage of life is the most important? Some might claim that infancy is the key stage, when a baby's brain is wide open to new experiences that will influence all the rest of its later life. Others might argue that it's adolescence or young adulthood, when physical health is at its peak. Many cultures around the world value late adulthood more than any other, arguing that it is at this stage that the human being has finally acquired the wisdom necessary to guide others. Who is right? The truth of the matter is that every stage of life is equally significant and necessary for the welfare of humanity. In my book <em>The Human Odyssey: Navigating the Twelve Stages of Life</em>, I've written that each stage of life has its own unique "gift" to contribute to the world. We need to value each one of these gifts if we are to truly support the deepest needs of human life. Here are what I call the twelve gifts of the human life cycle:</p>

                            <ol class="enhanced-list">
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content"><strong>Prebirth: Potential</strong> – The child who has not yet been born could become anything – a Michaelangelo, a Shakespeare, a Martin Luther King – and thus holds for all of humanity the principle of what we all may yet become in our lives.</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content"><strong>Birth: Hope</strong> – When a child is born, it instills in its parents and other caregivers a sense of optimism; a sense that this new life may bring something new and special into the world. Hence, the newborn represents the sense of hope that we all nourish inside of ourselves to make the world a better place.</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content"><strong>Infancy (Ages 0-3): Vitality</strong> – The infant is a vibrant and seemingly unlimited source of energy. Babies thus represent the inner dynamo of humanity, ever fueling the fires of the human life cycle with new channels of psychic power.</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content"><strong>Early Childhood (Ages 3-6): Playfulness</strong> – When young children play, they recreate the world anew. They take what is and combine it with the what is possible to fashion events that have never been seen before in the history of the world. As such, they embody the principle of innovation and transformation that underlies every single creative act that has occurred in the course of civilization.</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content"><strong>Middle Childhood (Ages 6-8): Imagination</strong> – In middle childhood, the sense of an inner subjective self develops for the first time, and this self is alive with images taken in from the outer world, and brought up from the depths of the unconscious. This imagination serves as a source of creative inspiration in later life for artists, writers, scientists, and anyone else who finds their days and nights enriched for having nurtured a deep inner life.</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content"><strong>Late Childhood (Ages 9-11): Ingenuity</strong> – Older children have acquired a wide range of social and technical skills that enable them to come up with marvelous strategies and inventive solutions for dealing with the increasing pressures that society places on them. This principle of ingenuity lives on in that part of ourselves that ever seeks new ways to solve practical problems and cope with everyday responsibilities.</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content"><strong>Adolescence (Ages 12-20): Passion</strong> – The biological event of puberty unleashes a powerful set of changes in the adolescent body that reflect themselves in a teenager’s sexual, emotional, cultural, and/or spiritual passion. Adolescence passion thus represents a significant touchstone for anyone who is seeking to reconnect with their deepest inner zeal for life.</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content"><strong>Early Adulthood (Ages 20-35): Enterprise</strong> – It takes enterprise for young adults to accomplish their many responsibilities, including finding a home and mate, establishing a family or circle of friends, and/or getting a good job. This principle of enterprise thus serves as an any stage of life when we need to go out into the world and make our mark.</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content"><strong>Midlife (Ages 35-50): Contemplation</strong> – After many years in young adulthood of following society’s scripts for creating a life, people in midlife often take a break from worldly responsibilities to reflect upon the deeper meaning of their lives, the better to forge ahead with new understanding. This element of contemplation represents an important resource that we can all draw upon to deepen and enrich our lives at any age.</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content"><strong>Mature Adulthood (Ages 50-80): Benevolence</strong> – Those in mature adulthood have raised families, established themselves in their work life, and become contributors to the betterment of society through volunteerism, mentorships, and other forms of philanthropy. All of humanity benefits from their benevolence. Moreover, we all can learn from their example to give more of ourselves to others.</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content"><strong>Late Adulthood (Age 80+): Wisdom</strong> – Those with long lives have acquired a rich repository of experiences that they can use to help guide others. Elders thus represent the source of wisdom that exists in each of us, helping us to avoid the mistakes of the past while reaping the benefits of life’s lessons.</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content"><strong>Death & Dying: Life</strong> – Those in our lives who are dying, or who have died, teach us about the value of living. They remind us not to take our lives for granted, but to live each moment of life to its fullest, and to remember that our own small lives form of a part of a greater whole.</span></li>
                            </ol>

                            <p>Since each stage of life has its own unique gift to give to humanity, we need to do whatever we can to support each stage, and to protect each stage from attempts to suppress its individual contribution to the human life cycle. Thus, we need to be wary, for example, of attempts to thwart a young child’s need to play through the establishment high-pressure formal academic preschools. We should protect the wisdom of aged from elder abuse. We need to do what we can to help our adolescents at risk. We need to advocate for prenatal education and services for poor mothers, and support safe and healthy birthing methods in third world countries. We ought to take the same attitude toward nurturing the human life cycle as we do toward saving the environment from global warming and industrial pollutants. For by supporting each stage of the human life cycle, we will help to ensure that all of its members are given care and helped to blossom to their fullest degree.</p>

                            <p>Child development theories focus on explaining how children change and grow over the course of childhood. Such theories center on various aspects of development including social, emotional and cognitive growth.</p>
                            <p>The study of human development is a rich and varied subject. We all have personal experience with development, but it is sometimes difficult to understand how and why people grow, learn, and act as they do.</p>
                            <p>Why do children behave in certain ways? Is their behavior related to their age, family relationships, or individual temperament? Developmental psychologists strive to answer such questions as well as to understand, explain, and predict behaviors that occur throughout the lifespan. In order to understand human development, a number of different theories of child development have arisen to explain various aspects of human growth.</p>

                            <h3>Child Development Theories: A Background</h3>
                            <p>Theories of development provide a framework for thinking about human growth and learning. But why do we study development? What can we learn from psychological theories of development? If you have ever wondered about what motivates human thought and behavior, understanding these theories can provide useful insight into individuals and society.</p>
                            <p>Child development that occurs from birth to adulthood was largely ignored throughout much of human history.</p>
                            <p>Children were often viewed simply as small versions of adults and little attention was paid to the many advances in cognitive abilities, language usage, and physical growth that occur during childhood and adolescence.</p>
                            <p>Interest in the field of child development finally began to emerge early in the 20th century, but it tended to focus on abnormal behavior.</p>
                            <p>Eventually, researchers became increasingly interested in other topics including typical child development as well as the influences on development.</p>
                            <p>Why is it important to study how children grow, learn and change? An understanding of child development is essential because it allows us to fully appreciate the cognitive, emotional, physical, social, and educational growth that children go through from birth and into early adulthood.</p>
                            <p>Some of the major theories of child development are known as grand theories; they attempt to describe every aspect of development, often using a stage approach. Others are known as mini-theories; they instead focus only on a fairly limited aspect of development such as cognitive or social growth.</p>
                            <p>The following are just a few of the many child development theories that have been proposed by theorists and researchers. More recent theories outline the developmental stages of children and identify the typical ages at which these growth milestones occur.</p>

                            <div class="theory-card">
                                <h4>Freud's Psychosexual Developmental Theory</h4>
                                <p>Psychoanalytic theory originated with the work of Sigmund Freud. Through his clinical work with patients suffering from mental illness, Freud came to believe that childhood experiences and unconscious desires influenced behavior.</p>
                                <p>According to Freud, conflicts that occur during each of these stages can have a lifelong influence on personality and behavior.</p>
                                <p>Freud proposed one of the best-known grand theories of child development. According to Freud's psychosexual theory, child development occurs in a series of stages focused on different pleasure areas of the body. During each stage, the child encounters conflicts that play a significant role in the course of development.</p>
                                <p>His theory suggested that the energy of the libido was focused on different erogenous zones at specific stages. Failure to progress through a stage can result in a fixation at that point in development, which Freud believed could have an influence on adult behavior.</p>
                                <p>So what happens as children complete each stage? And what might result if a child does poorly during a particular point in development? Successfully completing each stage leads to the development of a healthy adult personality. Failing to resolve the conflicts of a particular stage can result in fixations that can then have an influence on adult behavior.</p>
                                <p>While some other child development theories suggest that personality continues to change and grow over the entire lifetime, Freud believed that it was early experiences that played the greatest role in shaping development. According to Freud, personality is largely set in stone by the age of five.</p>

                                <h4>Erikson's Psychosocial Developmental Theory</h4>
                                <p>Psychoanalytic theory was an enormously influential force during the first half of the twentieth century. Those inspired and influenced by Freud went on to expand upon Freud's ideas and develop theories of their own. Of these neo-Freudians, Erik Erikson's ideas have become perhaps the best known.</p>
                                <p>Erikson's eight-stage theory of psychosocial development describes growth and change throughout life, focusing on social interaction and conflicts that arise during different stages of development.</p>
                                <p>While Erikson’s theory of psychosocial development shared some similarities with Freud's, it is dramatically different in many ways. Rather than focusing on sexual interest as a driving force in development, Erikson believed that social interaction and experience played decisive roles.</p>
                                <p>His eight-stage theory of human development described this process from infancy through death. During each stage, people are faced with a developmental conflict that impacts later functioning and further growth.</p>
                                <p>Unlike many other developmental theories, Erik Erikson's psychosocial theory focuses on development across the entire lifespan. At each stage, children and adults face a developmental crisis that serves as a major turning point. Successfully managing the challenges of each stage leads to the emergence of a lifelong psychological virtue.</p>

                                <h4>Behavioral Child Development Theories</h4>
                                <p>During the first half of the twentieth century, a new school of thought known as behaviorism rose to become a dominant force within psychology. Behaviorists believed that psychology needed to focus only on observable and quantifiable behaviors in order to become a more scientific discipline.</p>
                                <p>According to the behavioral perspective, all human behavior can be described in terms of environmental influences. Some behaviorists, such as John B. Watson and B.F. Skinner, insisted that learning occurs purely through processes of association and reinforcement.</p>
                                <p>Behavioral theories of child development focus on how environmental interaction influences behavior and are based on the theories of theorists such as John B. Watson, Ivan Pavlov, and B. F. Skinner. These theories deal only with observable behaviors. Development is considered a reaction to rewards, punishments, stimuli and reinforcement.</p>
                                <p>This theory differs considerably from other child development theories because it gives no consideration to internal thoughts or feelings. Instead, it focuses purely on how experience shapes who we are.</p>
                                <p>Two important types of learning that emerged from this approach to development are that classical conditioning and operant conditioning. Classical conditioning involves learning by pairing a naturally occurring stimulus with a previously neutral stimulus. Operant conditioning utilizes reinforcement and punishment to modify behaviors.</p>

                                <h4>Piaget's Cognitive Developmental Theory</h4>
                                <p>Cognitive theory is concerned with the development of a person's thought processes. It also looks at how these thought processes influence how we understand and interact with the world. Piaget proposed an idea that seems obvious now, but helped revolutionize how we think about child development: <em>Children think differently than adults</em>.</p>
                                <p>Theorist Jean Piaget proposed one of the most influential theories of cognitive development. His cognitive theory seeks to describe and explain the development of thought processes and mental states. It also looks at how these thought processes influence the way we understand and interact with the world.</p>
                                <p>Piaget then proposed a theory of cognitive development to account for the steps and sequence of children's intellectual development.</p>

                                    <li>The Sensorimotor Stage: A period of time between birth and age two during which an infant's knowledge of the world is limited to his or her sensory perceptions and motor activities. Behaviors are limited to simple motor responses caused by sensory stimuli.</li>
                                    <li>The Preoperational Stage: A period between ages 2 and 6 during which a child learns to use language. During this stage, children do not yet understand concrete logic, cannot mentally manipulate information and are unable to take the point of view of other people.</li>
                                    <li>The Concrete Operational Stage: A period between ages 7 and 11 during which children gain a better understanding of mental operations. Children begin thinking logically about concrete events, but have difficulty understanding abstract or hypothetical concepts.</li>
                                    <li>The Formal Operational Stage: A period between age 12 to adulthood when people develop the ability to think about abstract concepts. Skills such as logical thought, deductive reasoning, and systematic planning also emerge during this stage.</li>

                                <h4>Bowlby's Attachment Theory</h4>
                                <p>There is a great deal of research on the social development of children. John Bowbly proposed one of the earliest theories of social development. Bowlby believed that early relationships with caregivers play a major role in child development and continue to influence social relationships throughout life.</p>
                                <p>Bowlby's attachment theory suggested that children are born with an innate need to form attachments. Such attachments aid in survival by ensuring that the child receives care and protection. Not only that, but these attachments are characterized by clear behavioral and motivational patterns. In other words, both children and caregivers engage in behaviors designed to ensure proximity. Children strive to stay close and connected to their caregivers who in turn provide safe haven and a secure base for exploration.</p>
                                <p>Researchers have also expanded upon Bowlby's original work and have suggested that a number of different attachment styles exist. Children who receive consistent support and care are more likely to develop a secure attachment style, while those who receive less reliable care may develop an ambivalent, avoidant, or disorganized style.</p>

                                <h4>Bandura's Social Learning Theory</h4>
                                <p>Social learning theory is based on the work of psychologist Albert Bandura. Bandura believed that the conditioning and reinforcement process could not sufficiently explain all of human learning. For example, how can the conditioning process account for learned behaviors that have not been reinforced through classical conditioning or operant conditioning?</p>
                                <p>According to social learning theory, behaviors can also be learned through observation and modeling. By observing the actions of others, including parents and peers, children develop new skills and acquire new information.</p>
                                <p>Bandura's child development theory suggests that observation plays a critical role in learning, but this observation does not necessarily need to take the form of watching a live model. Instead, people can also learn by listening to verbal instructions about how to perform a behavior as well as through observing either real or fictional characters display behaviors in books or films.</p>

                                <h4>Vygotsky's Sociocultural Theory</h4>
                                <p>Another psychologist named Lev Vygotsky proposed a seminal learning theory that has gone on to become very influential, especially in the field of education. Like Piaget, Vygotsky believed that children learn actively and through hands-on experiences. His sociocultural theory also suggested that parents, caregivers, peers and the culture at large were responsible for developing higher order functions.</p>
                                <p>In Vygotsky's view, learning is an inherently social process. Through interacting with others, learning becomes integrated into an individual's understanding of the world. This child development theory also introduced the concept of the zone of proximal development, which is the gap between what a person can do with help and what they can do on their own. It is with the help of more knowledgeable others that people are able to progressively learn and increase their skills and scope of understanding.</p>

                            <h3>A Word From Verywell</h3>
                            <p>As you can see, some of psychology's best-known thinkers have developed theories to help explore and explain different aspects of child development. While not all of these theories are fully accepted today, they all had an important influence on our understanding of child development. Today, contemporary psychologists often draw on a variety of theories and perspectives in order to understand how kids grow, behave, and think.</p>
                            <p>These theories represent just a few of the different ways of thinking about child development. In reality, fully understanding how children change and grow over the course of childhood requires looking at many different factors that influence physical and psychological growth. Genes, the environment, and the interactions between these two forces determine how kids grow physically as well as mentally.</p>

                            <p>Psychology is the science of the mind and behavior. The word "psychology" comes from the Greek word psyche meaning "breath, spirit, soul", and the Greek word logia meaning the study of something.</p>
                            <p>According to Medilexicon's medical dictionary, psychology is "The profession (clinical psychology), scholarly discipline (academic psychology), and science (research psychology) concerned with the behavior of humans and animals, and related mental and physiologic processes." Although psychology may also include the study of the mind and behavior of animals, in this article psychology refers to humans.</p>

                            <p>It's all in the mind.</p>
                            <p>— George Harrison</p>
                            <p>In its primary form, psychology studies people—who and what they are. It looks into why they act and think the way they do and how someone can improve himself or herself. Therefore, everything a person does is connected to the subject.</p>
                            <p>Psychology allows people to understand more about how the body and mind work together. This knowledge can help with decision-making and avoiding stressful situations. It can help with time management, setting and achieving goals, and living effectively.</p>
                            <p>The science not only allows people to be more successful, but it can also impact their health. It helps many tackle their mental illnesses so that they can continue living their lives.</p>
                            <p>Psychological studies have also aided in drug development and the ability to diagnose various diseases (such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's).</p>
                            <p>I can personally testify to the importance of the subject. Psychology has helped me as a writer because I have become more determined to do the things I will enjoy and write on the topics that I like. I can understand who I am and look at events on a more positive aspect. Whenever I have a problem, I can handle it better. Down to the choices over the projects I will work on and the way I will handle my time, psychology helps me make better decisions within my life.</p>
                            <p>Through pride we are ever deceiving ourselves. But deep down below the surface of the average conscience a still, small voice says to us, something is out of tune.</p>

                            <h3>FEB 9 2017</h3>
                            <p>Psychology is dedicated to improving the human condition by a deep understanding of how the mind works through research and practice. So, it makes sense that as our society grows and evolves, the psychology field needs to change and adapt. With mental illness constituting 7.4 percent of the world's measurable burden of disease, it's more important than ever to look at new and emerging trends in psychology.</p>
                            <p>One major trend in psychology to watch is the development of more Master of Science, rather than Master of Arts, degrees in psychology.</p>
                            <p>"We are changing many of our MA programs to MS programs in the future," said Dr. Bettina Shapira, Department Chair, Department of Psychology in the School of Social and Behavioral Sciences at Northcentral University. "An emerging trend in the psychology profession is a movement more toward MS programs. Students feel they can be more marketable with an MS."</p>
                            <p>The Master of Science in Forensic Psychology is one of NCU's first MS programs offered to fit the growing needs of these students.</p>
                            <p>"It's still a very new program," said Dr. James Billings, Northcentral University's Dean, School of Social and Behavioral Sciences, of the field that incorporates criminal investigation and law. While reality and TV obviously diverge, the fact is that popular culture is influencing a new generation of students to consider a forensic psychology career.</p>
                            <p>According to Shapira, another major trend in psychology to watch is focusing on societal issues related to race.</p>
                            <p>"At NCU, we have diversity-related programs and fields of study," she said. "There are University-wide committees that keep us updated on issues as it affects curriculum, and subcommittees review all of our courses to ensure that each and every course has topics related to diversity and culture."</p>
                            <p>As the world’s population ages, gerontology is gaining traction as a popular psychology field now.</p>
                            <p>“Gerontology looks at the many emotional and physical challenges of aging,” said Billings. “While this may not be a new field, it’s certainly a field that continues to grow.”</p>
                            <p>On the opposite side of the spectrum, obesity in young adults and children appears to be another emerging trend in psychology.</p>
                            <p>“Obesity, and the issues surrounding the effects on young brains, is an emerging area,” said Shapira. “Health psychology courses and gender development, prenatal and early childhood coursework explores brain development as well as healthy behavior and related issues.”</p>
                            <p>One of the most important trends in psychology is the emphasis on context. Some of the most highly valued personality traits such as compassion, mindfulness, forgiveness, and agreeableness are predictably counterproductive in specific situations. Some of the most highly valued aspirations such as happiness can be counterproductive and recent research has pointed out alternatives. In the same vein, we are learning that so-called negative emotions such as sadness, anxiety, guilt, envy, and anger are exactly what we want to experience and express to get the best possible outcome in a given situation. We are learning how to express negative emotions in the most effective manner. This research on the downside of positives and the upside of negatives is allowing us to understand how to appreciate the full spectrum of our personality and best navigate the complex, uncertain world that we confront each day. Emotional and social agility is where the action is...finally.</p>
