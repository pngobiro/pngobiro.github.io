                            <p><strong>Subcultures</strong> exist in large, complex societies. They are smaller cultures inside of larger cultures. For example, musicians, professional athletes, the Catholic community, etc.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>Counterculture</strong> is a subculture that is against or opposed to the main beliefs and attitudes of a larger culture. Example Gothic scene, white supremacist groups, hippies.</p>
                            
                            <p>When people judge other cultures based on their own cultural standards this is called <strong>ethnocentrism</strong>. We are all probably guilty of doing this at some point. Example man running across cows to gain manhood.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>Cultural universals</strong> are traits that exist in all cultures. Example sports, cooking, religion, funerals, language, etc.</p>

The difference is called <strong>cultural particulars</strong>. For example, child rearing is a cultural universal. However, in the U.S. women are mostly given the responsibility of taking care of the child, but in New Guinea the man is completely in charge of child rearing.</span>

However, when culture comes into contact with other cultures, it can change. However, culture changes not only because of direct or indirect contact between cultures, but also through innovation and adaptation to new circumstances.</span>

Individuals get cultural knowledge of the group through socialization. However, we should note that all things shared among people might not be cultural, as there are many biological attributes which people share among themselves.</span>

Symbolic thought is unique and crucial to humans and to culture. Symbolic thought is the human ability to give a thing or event an arbitrary meaning and grasp and appreciate that meaning. Symbols are the central components of culture. Symbols refer to anything to which people attach meaning and which they use to communicate with others. More specifically, symbols are words, objects, gestures, sounds or images that represent something else rather than themselves. Symbolic thought is unique and crucial to humans and to culture. It is the human ability to give a thing or event an arbitrary meaning and grasp and appreciate that meaning.

                            <p>Culture thus works in the symbolic domain emphasizing meaning, rather than the technical/practical rational side of human behavior. All actions have symbolic content as well as being action in and of themselves. Things, actions, behaviors, etc, always stand for something else than merely, the thing itself.</p>

Culture encompasses language, and through language, culture is communicated and transmitted. Without language it would be impossible to develop, elaborate and transmit culture to the future generation.</p>

                                        <h4 class="definition-term">Values</h4>
                                        <p class="definition-text">Values are essential elements of non-material culture. They may be defined as general, abstract guidelines for our lives, decisions, goals, choices, and actions. They are shared ideas of a groups or a society as to what is right or wrong, correct or incorrect, desirable or undesirable, acceptable or unacceptable, ethical or unethical, etc., regarding something. They are general road maps for our lives. Values are shared and are learned in group. They can be positive or negative. For example, honesty, truth – telling, respect for others, hospitality, helping those in need, etc are positive values. Examples of negative values include theft, indecency, disrespect, dishonesty, falsehood, frugality, etc. The Hippocratic Oath in medical profession dictates that practitioners should among other things, keep the secrets of patients, provide them whatever help they can, do no harm to patients willingly, etc. This is an example of positive value</p>
                                        <p class="definition-text">Values are dynamic, meaning they change over time. They are also static, meaning they tend to persist without any significant modification. Values are also diversified, meaning they vary from place to place and culture to culture. Some values are universal because there is bio-psychological unity among people everywhere and all times. In other words, they emanate from the basic similarity of mankind's origins, nature and desires. For example, dislike for killing people, concepts and practices of disease management, cleanliness, personal hygiene, cosmetics, incest taboo, etc.</p>

                                        <p class="definition-text">Norms are also essential elements of culture. They are implicit principles for social life, relationship and interaction. Norms are detailed and specific rules for specific situations. They tell us how to do something, what to do, what not to do, when to do it, why to do it, etc.</p>
                                        <p class="definition-text">Norms are derived from values. That means, for every specific norm, there is a general value that determines its content.</p>
                                        <p class="definition-text">Individuals may not act according to the defined values and norms of the group. Therefore, violation of values and norms and deviating from the standard values and norms are often common. Social norms may be divided into two.

                                <h4 class="card-title">Mores vs Folkways</h4>
                                
                                <p><strong>Mores:</strong> Are important and stronger social norms for existence, safety, well-being and continuity of the society or the group or society. Violation of, and deviation from these kinds of norms, may result in serious reactions form the groups. The strongest norms are regarded as the formal <em>laws</em> of a society or a group. Formal laws are written and codified social norms. The other kinds of mores are called conventions. Conventions are established rules governing behavior; they are generally accepted ideals by the society. Conventions may also be regarded as written and signed agreements between nations to govern the behaviors of individuals, groups and nations.</p>
                                
                                <p><strong>Folkways:</strong> Are the ways of life developed by a group of people. They are detailed and minor instructions, traditions or rules for day-to-day life that help us function effectively and smoothly as members of a group. Here, violating such kinds of norms may not result in a serious punishment unlike violating mores. They are less morally binding. In other words, folkways are appropriate ways of behaving and doing things. Examples may include table etiquette, dressing rules, walking, talking, etc.</p>
                                
                                <p>Conformity to folkways usually occurs automatically without any national analysis and is based upon custom passed from generation to generation. They are not enforced by law, but by informal social control. They are not held to be important or obligatory as mores, or moral standards, and their violation is not as such severely sanctioned. Although folkways are less binding, people have to behave according to accepted standards. Some exceptional behaviors are regarded eccentric behaviors.</p>
                                
                                <p>Folkways are distinguished from laws and mores in that they are designed, maintained and enforced by public sentiment, or custom, whereas laws are institutionalized, designed, maintained and enforced by the political authority of the society. Folkways in turn may be divided into two sub types: fashion and custom.</p>
                                
                                <p><strong>Fashion:</strong> Is a form of behavior, type of folkways that is socially approved at a given time but subject to periodic change. Adherents combine both deviation and conformity to norm of a certain group.</p>
                                
                                <p><strong>Custom:</strong> Is a folkway or form of social behavior that, having persisted a long period of time, has become traditional and well established in a society and has received some degree of formal recognition.</p>
                            </div>

                            <p>Culture is dynamic. When culture change occurs, the change is usually not evenly distributed across material and non-material dimensions of culture. The rate of change is not balanced. Material culture may change at a faster rate than non-material culture. The growth in science and technology in western, industrialized societies for example, does not seem to be matched by the necessary changes and appropriate adjustment of adaptive culture. That is non-material culture changes slowly. This condition is termed as culture lag. Associated with the rapid growth in material culture are usually crisis in the realm of amorality, social and cultural dilemmas, which in turn result in various social pathologies such as extreme form of individualism, alienation, the state of normlessness, suicide.</p>
                            <p>On the other hand, in some less developed societies, the change of non-material culture may outpace the material culture. When this occurs, it is called culture lead. Due to the effect of globalization and rapid assimilation processes, people in the Third World are accustomed to the ideology and cultures of the Western World, though their material culture is not changing keeping pace with non-material culture.</p>

But man has greater intelligence and learning capacity with the help of these he has been able to adapt himself with the environment or modify it to suit 31 his convenience. Culture has made such an adaptation and modification possible and easier by providing man the necessary skills and knowledge. Culture preserves knowledge and helps its transmission from generation to generation through its element that is language. Language helps not only the transmission of knowledge but also its preservation, accumulation and diffusion. On the contrary, animals do not have this advantage, because, culture does not exist at sub-human level.</span>

No child can develop human qualities in the absence of a cultural environment. Culture prepares man for group life and provides him the design of living. It is culture that provides opportunities for the development of personality and sets limits on its growth. As Ruth Benedict has pointed out, every culture will produce its, special type or types of personality. This fact has been stressed by her in her “Patterns of Culture” an analysis of the culture of three primitive societies. Yet another anthropologist by name Margaret Mead has stated that a culture shapes the character and behaviors of individual living in it... This fact she has established in her “Sex and Temperament in Three Primitive Societies- A study of New Guinea tribal life.</span>

This can lead to moral and ethical dilemmas for individuals as the new social norms are developed.</p>

                            <p>Any systematic difference between two cultures which hinders mutual understanding or relations. Such differences include the values, behaviour, education, and customs of the respective cultures. Culture gaps can relate to religion, ethnicity, age, or social class.</p>
                            <p>Cultural differences that may lead to gaps include social norms and gender roles. The term can also be used to refer to misunderstandings within a society, such as between different scientific specialties. It has since been used more broadly to refer to mutual misunderstandings and incomprehension arising with people from differing backgrounds and experiences.</p>

Many children, even at very young ages, have tablets on which they play regularly. However, research is increasingly supporting the idea of limiting these activities because of proof that children's long term overuse of technology is negatively impacting the development of some motor skills and social skills. The development of games and technology far outpaced the development of research regarding the impact of use of that technology. That lag has, possibly, resulted in stunted development in early childhood for many children.</li>

                        <div class="content-card">
                            <p>Socialization is the process by which norms and other behavioral regulators are transformed into personality elements. This is the process of internalizing the norms and ideologies of society. It is a means by which social and cultural continuity are attained. It is the process of learning to behave in a way that is acceptable to society.</p>
                            
                            <p>Every society is faced with the necessity of making a responsible member out of each child born into it. The child must learn the expectations of the society so that his behaviour can be relied upon. He must acquire the group norms. The society must socialise each member so that his behaviour will be meaningful in terms of the group norms. In the process of socialisation the individual learns the reciprocal responses of the society.</p>

                            <p>Socialisation is a processes with the help of which a living organism is changed into a social being. It is a process through which the younger generation learns the adult role which it has to play subsequently. It is a continuous process in the life of an individual and it continues from generation to generation.</p>

                            <h3>Meaning of Socialisation:</h3>
                            <p>The newborn is merely an organism. Socialisation makes him responsive to the society. He is socially active. He becomes a ‘Purush’ and the culture that his group inculcates in him, humanises him, and makes him ‘Manusha’. The process indeed, is endless. The cultural pattern of his group, in the process gets incorporated in the personality of a child. It prepares him to fit in the group and to perform the social roles. It sets the infant on the line of social order and enables an adult to fit into the new group. It enables the man to adjust himself to the new social order.</p>

                            <p>Socialisation stands for the development of the human brain, body, attitude, behaviour and so forth. Socialisation is known as the process of inducting the individual into the social world. The term socialisation refers to the process of interaction through which the growing individual learns the habits, attitudes, values and beliefs of the social group into which he has been born.</p>

                            <p>From the point of view of society, socialisation is the way through which society transmits its culture from generation to generation and maintains itself. From the point of view of the individual, socialisation is the process by which the individual learns social behaviour, develops his 'self'.</p>

                            <p>The process operates at two levels, one within the infant which is called the internalisation of objects around and the other from the outside. Socialisation may be viewed as the "internalisation of social norms. Social rules become internal to the individual, in the sense that they are self-imposed rather than imposed by means of external regulation and are thus part of individual's own personality.</p>

                            <p>The individual therefore feels an urge to conform. Secondly, it may be viewed as essential element of social interaction. In this case, individuals become socialised as they act in accordance with the expectations of others. The underlying process of socialisation is bound up with social interaction.</p>

                                        <li>According to Horton and Hunt, Socialisation is the process whereby one internalises the norms of his groups, so that a distinct 'self emerges, unique to this individual.</li>
                                        <li>Green defined socialisation "as the process by which the child acquires a cultural content, along with selfhood and personality".</li>
                                        <li>According to Lundberg, socialisation consists of the "complex processes of interaction through which the individual learns the habits, skills, beliefs and standard of judgement that are necessary for his effective participation in social groups and communities".</li>
                                        <li>Peter Worsley explains socialisation "as the process of "transmission of culture, the process whereby men learn the rules and practices of social groups".</li>
                                        <li>H.M. Johnson defines socialisation as "learning that enables the learner to perform social roles". He further says that it is a "process by which individuals acquire the already existing culture of groups they come into".</li>
                                        <li>The heart of socialisation", to quote kingsley Davis." is the emergence and gradual development of the self or ego. It is in terms of the self that personality takes shape and the mind comes to function".</li>

Brim (Jr) described socialisation as a life-long process. He maintains that socialisation of adults differ from childhood socialisation. In this context it can be said that there are various types of socilisation.</p>

                                    <p class="feature-text">Primary socialisation refers to socialisation of the infant in the primary or earliest years of his life. It is a process by which the infant learns language and cognitive skills, internalises norms and values. The infant learns the ways of a given grouping and is moulded into an effective social participant of that group.</p>
                                    <p class="feature-text">The norms of society become part of the personality of the individual. The child does not have a sense of wrong and right. By direct and indirect observation and experience, he gradually learns the norms relating to wrong and right things. The primary socialisation takes place in the family.</p>

                                    <p class="feature-text">The process can be seen at work outside the immediate family, in the ‘peer group’. The growing child learns very important lessons in social conduct from his peers. He also learns lessons in the school. Hence, socialisation continues beyond and outside the family environment. Secondary socialisation generally refers to the social training received by the child in institutional or formal settings and continues throughout the rest of his life.</p>

                                    <p class="feature-text">In the adult socialisation, actors enter roles (for example, becoming an employee, a husband or wife) for which primary and secondary socialisation may not have prepared them fully. Adult socialisation teaches people to take on new duties. The aim of adult socialisation is to bring change in the views of the individual. Adult socialisation is more likely to change overt behaviour, whereas child socialisation moulds basic values.</p>

                                    <p class="feature-text">Anticipatory socialisation refers to a process by which men learn the culture of a group with the anticipation of joining that group. As a person learns the proper beliefs, values and norms of a status or group to which he aspires, he is learning how to act in his new role.</p>

                                    <p class="feature-text">Re-Socialisation refers to the process of discarding former behaviour patterns and accepting new ones as part of a transition in one’s life. Such re-socialisation takes place mostly when a social role is radically changed. It involves abandonment of one way of life for another which is not only different from the former but incompatible with it. For example, when a criminal is rehabilitated, he has to change his role radically.</p>

                            <p>Socialisation is a process by which culture is transmitted to the younger generation and men learn the rules and practices of social groups to which they belong. Through it that a society maintains its social system. Personalities do not come ready-made. The process that transforms a child into a reasonably respectable human being is a long process.</p>
                            <p>Hence, every society builds an institutional framework within which socialisation of the child takes place. Culture is transmitted through the communication they have with one another and communication thus comes to be the essence of the process of culture transmission. In a society there exists a number of agencies to socialise the child.</p>
                            <p>To facilitate socialisation different agencies play important roles. These agencies are however interrelated.</p>

                                        <strong>1. Family:</strong>
                                        <p>The family plays an outstanding role in the socialisation process. In all societies other agencies besides the family contribute to socialisation such as educational institutions, the peer group etc. But family plays the most important role in the formation of personality. By the time other agencies contribute to this process family has already left an imprint on the personality of the child. The parents use both reward and punishment to imbibe what is socially required from a child.</p>
                                        <p>The family has informal control over its members. Family being a mini society acts as a transmission belt between the individual and society. It trains the younger generation in such a way that it can take the adult roles in proper manner. As family is primary and intimate group, it uses informal methods of social control to check the undesirable behaviour on the part of its members. The process of socialisation remains a process because of the interplay between individual life cycle and family life cycle.</p>
                                        <p>According to Robert. K. Merton, "it is the family which is a major transmission belt for the diffusion of cultural standards to the oncoming generation". The family serves as "the natural and convenient channel of social continuity.</p>

                                        <strong>2. Peer Group:</strong>
                                        <p>Peer Group means a group in which the members share some common characteristics such as age or sex etc. It is made up of the contemporaries of the child, his associates in school, in playground and in street. The growing child learns some very important lessons from his peer group. Since members of the peer group are at the same stage of socialisation, they freely and spontaneously interact with each other.</p>
                                        <p>The members of peer groups have other sources of information about the culture and thus the acquisition of culture goes on. They view the world through the same eyes and share the same subjective attitudes. In order to be accepted by his peer group, the child must exhibit the characteristic attitudes, the likes and dislikes.</p>
                                        <p>Conflict arises when standards of the peer group differ from the standards of the child's family. He may consequently attempt to withdraw from the family environment. The peer group surpasses the parental influence as time goes on. This seems to be an inevitable occurrence in rapidly changing societies.</p>

                                        <p>Religion play a very important role in socialisation. Religion instills the fear of hell in the individual so that he should refrain from bad and undesirable activities. Religion not only makes people religious but socialises them into the secular order.</p>

                                        <strong>4. Educational Institutions:</strong>
                                        <p>Parents and peer groups are not the only agencies of the socialisation in modern societies. Every civilised society therefore has developed a set of formalised agencies of education (schools, colleges and universities) which have a great bearing on the socialisation process. It is in the educational institutions that the culture is formally transmitted and acquired in which the science and the art of one generation is passed on to the next.</p>
                                        <p>The educational institutions not only help the growing child in learning language and other subjects but also instill the concept of time, discipline, team work, cooperation and competition.</p>
                                        <p>Through the means of reward and punishment the desired behaviour pattern is reinforced whereas undesirable behaviour pattern meets with disapproval, ridicule and punishment.</p>
                                        <p>In this way, the educational institutions come next to the family for the purpose of socialisation of the growing child. Educational institution is a very important socialiser and the means by which individual acquires social norms and values (values of achievement, civic ideals, solidarity and group loyalty etc) beyond those which are available for learning in the family and other groups.</p>

                                        <p>In the occupational world the individual finds himself with new shared interests and goals. He makes adjustments with the position he holds and also learns to make adjustment with other workers who may occupy equal or higher or lower position.</p>
                                        <p>While working, the individual enters into relations of cooperation, involving specialisation of tasks and at the same time learns the nature of class divisions. Work, for him, is a source of income but at the same time it gives identity and status within society as a whole.</p>
                                        <p>Wilbert Moore has divided occupational socialisation into four phases:</p>
                                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                            <li class="list-item">

                                                <span class="list-content"><strong>(a) Career Choice:</strong> The first phase is career choice, which involves selection of academic or vocational training appropriate for the desired job.</span>
                                            </li>
                                            <li class="list-item">
                                                <span class="list-marker"></span>
                                                <span class="list-content"><strong>(b) Anticipatory Socialisation:</strong> The next phase is anticipatory socialisation, which may last only a few months or extent for years. Some children inherit their occupations. These young people experience anticipatory socialisation throughout childhood and adolescence as they observe their parents at work. Certain individuals decide on occupational goals at relatively early ages. The entire adolescent period for them may focus on training for that future.</span>
                                            </li>
                                            <li class="list-item">
                                                <span class="list-marker"></span>
                                                <span class="list-content"><strong>(c) Conditioning and Commitment:</strong> The third phase of occupational socialisation takes places while one actually performs the work-related Role. Conditioning consists of reluctantly adjusting to the more unpleasant aspects of one's job. Most people find that the novelty of new daily schedule quickly wears off and realise that the parts of the work experience are rather tedious. Moore uses the term commitment to refer to the enthusiastic acceptance of pleasurable duties that come as the recruit identifies the positive task of an occupation.</span>
                                            </li>
                                            <li class="list-item">

                                                <span class="list-content"><strong>(d) Continues Commitment:</strong> According to Moore, if a job proves to be satisfactory, the person will enter a fourth stage of socialisation. At this stage the job becomes an indispensable) art of the person’s self identity. Violation of proper conduct becomes unthinkable. A person may choose to join professional associations, unions or other groups which represent his or her occupation in the larger society.</span>

                                        <p>Political parties attempt to seize political power and maintain it. They try to win the support of the members of the society on the basis of a socio-economic policy and programme. In the process they disseminate political values and norms and socialise the citizen. The political parties socialise the citizen for stability and change of political system.</p>

                                        <strong>7. Mass Media:</strong>
                                        <p>The mass media of communication, particularly television, play an important role in the process of socialisation. The mass media of communication transmit informations and messages which influence the personality of an individual to a great extent.</p>
                                        <p>In addition to this, communication media has an important effect in encouraging individuals to support the existing norms and values or oppose or change them. They are the instrument of social power. They influence us with their messages. The words are always written by someone and these people too – authors and editors and advertisers – join the teachers, the peers and the parents in the socialisation process.</p>
                                    </div>
                                </li>
                            </ol>

                            <p>To conclude, environment stimuli often determine the growth of human personality. A proper environment may greatly determine whether the social or the self-centered forces will become supreme. Individual’s social environment facilitates socialisation. If his mental and physical capacities are not good, he may not be able to make proper use of environment. However, the family plays perhaps the important part in the process of socialisation.</p>
                            <p>The child learns much from the family. After family his playmates and school wield influence on his socialisation. After his education is over, he enters into a profession. Marriage initiates a person into social responsibility, which is one of aims of socialisation. In short the socialisation is a process which begins at birth and a continues unceasingly until the death of individual.</p>
