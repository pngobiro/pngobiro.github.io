                            <p>There are four main types of disasters:</p>
                            <ol class="enhanced-list">
                                <li><strong>Natural disasters</strong>- These include drought, floods, hurricanes, earthquakes and volcano eruptions that can have immediate impacts on human health as well as secondary impacts causing further death and suffering from floods causing landslides, earthquakes resulting in fires, tsunamis causing widespread flooding and typhoons sinking ferries.</li>
                                <li><strong>Environmental emergencies</strong>- These include technological or industrial accidents usually involving hazardous material and occur where these materials are produced, used or transported. Forest fires are generally included in this definition because they tend to be caused by humans.</li>
                                <li><strong>Complex emergencies</strong>- These emergencies involve a break-down of authority, looting and attacks on strategic installations. Complex emergencies include conflict situations and war.</li>
                                <li><strong>Epidemics and pandemic</strong>- These emergencies involve a sudden onset of a disease that raises well beyond the expected numbers that the health system can handle. An epidemic is specific to one city, region or country while a pandemic covers a much wider geographical area and goes much further than national borders often worldwide. A pandemic also infects many more people than an epidemic. These affect and disrupt health services and businesses leading to economic and social costs.</li>
                            </ol>

                                    <p class="feature-text">The increasing numbers of accidents that take place during road, air and water, and railway transportation are occasionally fatal and hazardous. Currently, road accidents are more frequent because road transportation is used more often than air, railway and water transport. In addition, motorcycle (boda-boda) accidents have become notoriously rampart and fatal. Occasionally, there are reported incidents of boats that capsize. On some occasions, crocodiles attack people who use small canoes.</p>

Among the many factors that cause fire hazards are poor electric wiring, power outage, poor construction standards, accidents, arson and uncontrolled burning of bush or waste materials. Fires are most common in industries and congested human settlements. Road transportation of oil, gas and petroleum resources which are highly inflammable increase the risk of fires in the event of road accidents followed by people trying to illegally siphon the products.</p>

                            <p>Disaster management is a cyclical process. The end of one phase is the beginning of another, although one phase of the cycle does not necessarily have to be completed in order for the next to take place. Often, several phases take place concurrently. Timely decision making during each phase results in greater preparedness, better warnings, reduced vulnerability and or the prevention of future disasters.</p>
                            <p>A complete disaster management cycle includes the shaping of public policies and plans that either addresses the causes of disasters or mitigates their effects on people, property, and infrastructure.</p>

                            <p><strong>Mitigation</strong>- Measures put in place to minimise the results from a disaster e.g. building codes and zoning, vulnerability analyses and public education.</p>

                            <p><strong>Response</strong>- Initial actions taken as the event takes place. It involves efforts to minimise the hazards created by a disaster e.g. evacuation, search and rescue, and emergency relief.</p>
                            <p><strong>Recovery</strong>- Returning the community to normal. Ideally, the affected area should be put in a condition equal to or better than it was before the disaster took place e.g. temporary housing, financial support and medical care.</p>

                            <h3 class="card-title" style="margin-top: var(--space-6);">Disaster Risk Management</h3>
                            <p>Disaster management is an enormous task that is not confined to any particular location. Neither do they disappear as quickly as they appear. Therefore, it is imperative that there is proper management to optimise efficiency of planning and response. Due to limited resources, collaborative efforts at the governmental, private and community levels are necessary. This level of collaboration requires a coordinated and organised multi-sectoral effort to mitigate against, prepare for, respond to, and recover from emergencies and their effects in the shortest time possible. The health system has a responsibility to protect the health of affected persons or communities in the event of a disaster or hazard. This function is fulfilled through effective disaster risk management.</p>
                            <p>Disaster risk management is a proactive and systematic process based on the key management principles of planning, organising, leading, coordinating and controlling. Its aim is to reduce the negative impact or consequences of adverse events. Disasters cannot always be prevented, but the adverse effects can be minimised. As a system, disaster risk management has many components.</p>

                            <h3 class="card-title" style="margin-top: var(--space-6);">Disaster Risk Management Plan</h3>
                            <p>An effective disaster risk management plan includes:</p>
                            
                            <h4 class="card-title">i. Prevention</h4>
                            <p>Prevention includes activities designed to provide permanent protection from disaster. Disaster prevention plans are designed to provide permanent protection from disasters. Not all disasters, particularly natural disasters can be prevented, but the risk of loss of life and injury can be mitigated with good evacuation plans, environmental planning and design standards.</p>

                            <h4 class="card-title">ii. Preparedness</h4>
                            <p>These are activities designed to minimise loss of life and damage e.g. by removing people and property from a threatened location and by facilitating timely and effective rescue, relief and rehabilitation. Preparedness is the main way of reducing the impact of disasters. Community-based preparedness and management should be a high priority in health systems management. Appropriate preparedness results in persons knowing what to do and how to respond after disaster has occurred.</p>

                            <h4 class="card-title">iii. Mitigation</h4>
                            <p>This is a coordinated multi-sectoral response to reduce the impact of a disaster and its long-term results. Relief activities include rescue, relocation, providing food and water, preventing disease and disability, repairing vital services such as telecommunications and transport, providing temporary shelter and emergency health care.</p>

                            <h4 class="card-title">iv. Recovery</h4>
                            <p>Once emergency needs have been met and the initial crisis is over, the people affected and the communities that support them are still vulnerable. Recovery activities include rebuilding infrastructure, health care and rehabilitation. These should blend with development activities, such as building human resources for health and developing policies and practices to avoid similar situations in future.</p>

                            <h3 class="card-title" style="margin-top: var(--space-6);">Disaster Associated Health Issues</h3>
                            <p>When a disaster occurs, the general population expects the government and other agencies to rapidly mobilise the needed services with urgency. Preservation of life and health are of paramount importance to casualties. Immediately a disaster occurs, medical professionals, first aid and emergency medicine should be made available. As a consequence of disasters, it is also important to identify risk factors for communicable diseases and determine ways of minimising these risks.</p>

                            <h4 class="card-title">Emergency Health Services in Disasters</h4>
                            <p>During the first few hours/days following a disaster, the priority is usually to treat casualties and the sick or injured. Disasters like earthquakes, and collapsed buildings often involve the management of mass casualties which normally requires the following activities: Search, rescue and first aid; transport of health facilities and treatment; triage; tagging; and redistribution of patients between hospitals when necessary.</p>
                            <p>The demand for curative care is highest during the acute emergency stage, when the affected population is most vulnerable in their new environment and before basic public health measures e.g., water, sanitation and shelter have been provided. Thereafter, the priority should shift toward preventive measures. Any prolonged interruption in routine immunisations and other disease-control measures may result in serious outbreaks of diseases like measles, cholera etc.</p>
                            <p>Disasters call for a coordinated response between curative and preventive health services, including food supply, water and sanitation, etc. In order to minimise mortality and morbidity it is also necessary to organise the relief response according to three levels of preventive health measures, namely primary, secondary and tertiary prevention.</p>

                            <h3 class="card-title" style="margin-top: var(--space-6);">Infrastructure and Procedures in Accessing Emergency Situations</h3>
                            
                            <h4 class="card-title">Managing a Mass Casualty Incident (MCI)</h4>
                            <p>A MCI is any event producing a large number of victims such that the normal capacity of local health services is disrupted. Common causes of an MCI include road accidents, floods, fires, explosions, industrial accidents, or conflict situations.</p>
                            <p>The response may be delayed after a MCI due to poor communication. Inadequate transportation may decrease the survival of victims in critical condition. Normally, the following groups of patients reach the health facility first:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Those nearest to the arriving ambulances;</li>
                                <li>Those who are first to be rescued; and</li>
                                <li>Those who are the most gravely injured.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>If there is only one first referral health facility, it may quickly become overwhelmed. Limited resources are used to care for victims arriving first, even though most of them may have minor injuries. As a result, they tie up the personnel, examining rooms, supplies, etc. increasing the risk of death for the critically ill victims whose survival depends on receiving prompt medical attention.</p>

                            <h4 class="card-title">Triaging</h4>
                            <p>Triage is defined simply as sorting and prioritising patients for medical attention according to the degree of injury or illness and expectations for survival. Triage is carried out to reduce the burden on health facilities and is normally done by the most experienced health worker assisted by competent staff on the triage team.</p>
                            <p>Triage is a continuous process that begins when patients arrive at the medical post and continues as their condition evolves until they are evacuated to hospital. By providing care to victims with minor or localised injuries, health facilities are freed to attend to more critical tasks. Triage is necessary where health facilities cannot meet the needs of all victims immediately, particularly following an MCI.</p>
                            <p>The goal of managing a MCI is to minimise the loss of life or disability of disaster victims by first meeting the needs of those most likely to benefit from services. This goal can be achieved by setting the following priorities for triage:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Priority for transportation to the hospital is based upon referrals of priority needs of patients.</li>
                                <li>Priorities for care in the field are often identified by visible colour-coded tags that categorise patient needs.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>However it is important to note that different jurisdictions use varying systems and the use of colour-coded tags may cause some confusion (Nocera and Garner, 1999).</p>
                            <p>Management of MCI begins with being prepared to mobilise resources and follow standard procedures in the field and at the hospital. Hospitals with a limited number of emergency workers may find it difficult to hold regular training sessions on MCI management. Health facilities with limited resources should focus on the following:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Improving routine emergency services for sudden-impact, small-scale incidents e.g., car accidents or accidents in the home. To avoid confusion, the same procedures that are necessary to save lives during an MCI should be performed as routine emergency services;</li>
                                <li>Coordinating activities that involve more than an emergency medical unit e.g. police, fire fighters, ambulances, hospitals etc and ensuring a quick transition from routine emergency services to mass casualty management establishing standard procedures for managing all incidents (small or large scale) such as search and rescue, first aid, triage, transfer to hospital and hospital care.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h3 class="card-title" style="margin-top: var(--space-6);">Transportation of Casualties</h3>
                            <p>Evacuations of casualties may be organised when they are gathered at a first aid post, a dispensary or any facility of the casualty-care chain, in which case they would have already been triaged and a priority category for evacuation has been assigned to each.</p>
                            <ol class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Evacuation is contemplated when means are available and reliable, routes and timeframes are known and security has been ensured. Prior to the moving of casualties, it is imperative that personnel at destinations have been informed and are ready to receive the casualty or casualties.</li>
                                <li>Evacuation vehicles assigned for medical purposes must be used exclusively for the latter. Their availability and hygiene should be respected. Other vehicles should preferably be used to transport the dead bodies if at all possible. In all cases, priority should be given to the living casualties.</li>
                                <li>Proper lifting techniques are used to ensure comfort of the casualty and personnel responsible for lifting should be in good physical condition.</li>
                                <li>All departures of evacuation vehicles should be reported to supervisors in charge of managing evacuations providing the following information: departure time, number and condition of casualties, destination, estimated travel time and route, and number of first aiders aboard.</li>
                                <li>The means of transport should ideally be such that emergency and stabilisation measures can continue and should be as safe as possible as it is important that the trip is not traumatic for the casualties.</li>
                                <li>It should also be such that casualty can be accommodated in different lying or sitting positions depending on their condition. Furthermore, it should be able to accommodate for a provider of care or a first-aider to accompany the casualty.</li>
                                <li>The means of transport should provide adequate protection against the elements e.g. extreme temperatures, sun, rain, wind, etc..</li>
                                <li>Driving needs to be smooth and safe. Once a casualty has been stabilised it is unnecessary to drive at high speed and risk a road traffic accident. Extra care should be taken especially if the roads are bumpy or have potholes as hitting into them causes more pain to the casualty, may increase bleeding and displace traumatised limbs hence causing more complications.</li>
                                <li>Casualties found on the roadside should be taken on board only if there is adequate space and no other alternative.</li>
                                <li>On arrival at the hospital, every injured person should be reassessed, stabilised, and given definitive care. The colour-coded tags are strictly for field triage and field use. They should not be used for documenting health care in the hospital.</li>
                                <li>Hospitals should also regularly advise the incident commander about their health care capability and capacity so that the transfer of MCI victims is well organised. If the hospital's capacity or capability is low, patients and victims may have to wait a long time for treatment in surgical or intensive care units.</li>
                            </ol>

                            <h3 class="card-title" style="margin-top: var(--space-6);">Communicable diseases common in disaster situations</h3>
                            <p>The main communicable diseases are:</p>
                            <ol class="enhanced-list">
                                <li><strong>Diseases transmitted by contact</strong> – Acute respiratory infections (ARI) which are common among people after a disaster especially among the children. These are spread through personal contact or being around people who are infected already. These include the common cold, influenza, bronchitis, diphtheria and pneumonia.</li>
                                <li><strong>Vector transmitted diseases</strong>- These include malaria, yellow fever, dengue and leptospirosis. These infections become prominent when the balance of nature is disturbed as is the case in a disaster.</li>
                                <li>Disease can also be transmitted through faecal matter ingested orally as a result of drinking contaminated water or eating food and fruits that are contaminated. These diseases include cholera, typhoid fever, diarrhoea diseases, and leptospirosis. They can also be transmitted through poor personal hygiene or from a contaminated environment.</li>
                                <li>Diseases transmitted through breathing contaminated air or from germs that are airborne can be problematic after a disaster. These diseases include tuberculosis, measles, meningococcal meningitis and whooping cough.</li>
                                <li>Sexually transmitted diseases are on the rise in peaceful times let alone being in disaster mode. These diseases are transmitted through sexual contact with infected people such as HIV and AIDS, gonorrhoea, syphilis, Chlamydia and trichomonas among others.</li>
                            </ol>

                            <p>Disaster preparedness is an ongoing multi-sectoral activity. It requires coordination and organisation by different departments of the government to facilitate assessment of a country's disaster risk, adoption of standards and regulations, and action to ensure that resources can be mobilised rapidly in disaster situations.</p>
                            <p>The health objectives of disaster preparedness are to:</p>
                            <ol class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Prevent morbidity and mortality;</li>
                                <li>Provide care for casualties;</li>
                                <li>Manage adverse climatic and environmental conditions;</li>
                                <li>Ensure restoration of normal health;</li>
                                <li>Re-establish health services;</li>
                                <li>Protect staff; and</li>
                                <li>Protect public health and medical assets.</li>
                            </ol>
                            <p>The preparedness process includes policy development, vulnerability assessments, disaster planning, training and education, and monitoring and evaluation.</p>

                            <h3 class="card-title" style="margin-top: var(--space-6);">Policy development</h3>
                            <p>National governments must designate a branch of the ministry or organisation with the responsibility to develop, organise and manage an emergency preparedness programme for the country. This group must work with central government, county, provincial and community organisations and NGOs whether local or international to develop a set of policies agreed upon by all. This process is vital for a well-coordinated response and a sustainable policy. The policies' endpoint must allow quick decision making, ensure the actions are legal and free from liability and ensure that appropriate pre-defined actions are taken during a state of emergency.</p>

                            <h3 class="card-title" style="margin-top: var(--space-6);">Disaster Preparedness Process</h3>
                            
                            <h4 class="card-title">i. Vulnerability assessment</h4>
                            <p>Potential hazards at all levels of society are identified and prioritised in a vulnerability assessment. The community's capacity can be determined by the availability of resources of the community and how the community is able to utilise these resources.</p>

                            <h4 class="card-title">ii. Disaster planning</h4>
                            <p>Planning is only one component of preparedness. A disaster's outputs plan should provide:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Provide an understanding of organisational responsibilities in response and recovery;</li>
                                <li>Provide stronger emergency management networks;</li>
                                <li>Improve society awareness and participation;</li>
                                <li>Effective response and recovery strategies; and</li>
                                <li>Be documented.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h4 class="card-title">iii. Training and education</h4>
                            <p>An important component of preparedness is to train and educate public health officials and other stakeholders (responders) about the disaster plan. Training at all levels should ensure adequate distribution of important skills and knowledge needed for an effective disaster response.</p>

                            <p>WHO recommends that an effective risk reduction and emergency preparedness strategy be based on an ‘All-hazard/Whole-health’ concept:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li><strong>All-hazard</strong> entails developing and implementing emergency management strategies for the full range of likely risks and emergencies- natural, biological, technological and societal. Different hazards and emergencies can cause similar problems in a community and such measures as planning, early warning, intersectoral and intrasectoral coordination, evacuation, health services and community recovery should be implemented along the same model regardless of cause.</li>
                                <li><strong>A whole-health approach</strong> should be in place in a country. There should not be parallel planning and coordination systems for each category of health risks. While technical leadership may vary, emergency planning processes, overall coordination procedures, surge and operational platforms should be unified under one emergency preparedness and response unit. Plans of the health sector can then be effectively coordinated with other sectors as well as with the designated national multi-sectoral emergency management agency.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>In addition to disaster preparedness, plans must should include common coordination, information tools and support services such as environmental health (water, sanitation and hygiene); management of chronic diseases (e.g. mental health); maternal, newborn and child health; communicable diseases control; nutrition; pharmaceuticals and biological and health care delivery services (e.g. health infrastructure). Other specialised services may be included for preparedness and management of specific risks.</p>

                            <p>Under Policy Objectives 4 and 5, the Kenya Health Policy commits to provide and ensure free access to trauma care, critical care, emergency care and disaster care services and an adequate response to health effects of disasters and emergencies and including putting in place appropriate financing mechanisms for emergency health services. Risk reduction and emergency preparedness are the responsibility of all sectors and stakeholders at all levels of society (country, county, community). At the national level, the Ministry of Health is the lead agency of the health sector.</p>
                            <p>The National Policy For Disaster Management in Kenya (2010) has four key objectives:</p>
                            <ol class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>To establish a policy/legal and institutional framework for management of disasters, including promotion of a culture of disaster awareness and for building the capacity for disaster risk reduction, at all levels;</li>
                                <li>To ensure that institutions and activities for disaster risk management are coordinated, focused to foster participatory partnerships between the government and other stakeholders, at all levels, including international, regional, sub-regional, national and sub-national bodies;</li>
                                <li>To promote linkages between disaster risk management and sustainable development for reduction of vulnerability to hazards and disasters.</li>
                                <li>To mobilise resources, including establishment of specific funds for disaster risk reduction strategies and programmes.</li>

                            <p>An emergency occurs when a health facility does not have enough resources to cope with an abrupt demand for services. In such situations, normal procedures should be abandoned and resources increased to expand capacity. When a hospital receives an overwhelming number of emergency cases, it must plan a simplified treatment system to immediately address prevention of loss of life, complications, deformities, infection and delayed treatment.</p>
                            <p>All health facilities within the structure of national health system should have an emergency action plan that take into consideration the rank of the hospital within the system based on its size, location and disaster vulnerability.</p>

                            <h3 class="card-title" style="margin-top: var(--space-6);">Handling Disaster Occurring Inside the Facility</h3>
                            <p>Disasters may occur rendering the facility non-functional. Prior planning is therefore required to ensure the continuity of service during such occurrences. All facilities should have internal disaster plan for fire and other common disasters within the areas should be developed with input from the fire department.</p>
                            <p>The plan should cover such operational matters as:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Allocations duties and responsibilities;</li>
                                <li>Instruction on the use of alarm and other security systems;</li>
                                <li>Instruction on fire fighting methods;</li>
                                <li>Location of fire fighting equipment;</li>
                                <li>System for notifying trained personnel;</li>
                                <li>Specification of evacuation procedures.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>All staff should be acquainted with the plan. Fire drills and internal emergency exercises should be carried out at least once a year to ensure staff is trained to carry out assigned duties and assess the efficacy of the plan.</p>
