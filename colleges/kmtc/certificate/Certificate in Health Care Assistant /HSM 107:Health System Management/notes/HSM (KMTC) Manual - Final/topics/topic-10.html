                            <p>Health policy refers to decisions, plans, and actions that are undertaken to achieve specific health care goals within a society. The purpose of a broad public health policy is to protect the health of populations. According to the World Health Organisation (1978), health is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity. WHO has further proclaimed that “the health of all the people is fundamental to the attainment of peace and security and is dependent upon the fullest cooperation of individuals and states”, and that “the enjoyment of the highest attainable standards of health” is one of the fundamental rights of every human being.</p>
                            <p>On attaining independence, the government committed itself to providing free- health services as part of its development strategy to alleviate poverty and improve the welfare and productivity of the nation. The aim of the health sector policy and reforms is to develop and expand health services and facilities in terms of spatial coverage, training of personnel and tertiary health care delivery services.</p>

                        <div class="content-card">
                            <p>The health status of the population can be assessed by a number of indicators including infant, child and maternal mortality and morbidity rates, crude death rate, life expectancy at birth, and the number of medical staff and facilities available per unit of population. These are the basic indicators of a country's health, socio-economic situation and quality of life.</p>
                            
                            <h3 class="card-title" style="margin-top: var(--space-6);">Infant Mortality Rate</h3>
                            <p>Infant mortality rate is the probability of dying between birth and exactly one year of age, expressed per 1,000 live births. Under-five mortality rate is the probability of dying between birth and exactly five years of age, expressed per 1,000 live births.</p>

                            <h3 class="card-title" style="margin-top: var(--space-6);">Life Expectancy</h3>
                            <p>Life expectancy at birth is the number of years a new born infant would live if prevailing factors of mortality at the time of birth were to stay the same throughout the child's life.</p>

                            <h3 class="card-title" style="margin-top: var(--space-6);">Crude Birth and Death Rates</h3>
                            <p>Crude birth rate is the number of births per 1,000. Crude death rate is defined as the number of deaths per 1,000 and is calculated as follows:</p>
                            
                            <div class="equation">
                                $$ \text{Crude death rate} = \frac{\text{Number of deaths}}{\text{Estimated midyear population}} \times 1000 $$
                            </div>
                            
                            <p>Both crude birth and death rates are important determinants of population size. An increase in crude birth rate may lead to an increase in population size if the crude death rate remains constant.</p>

                            <h3 class="card-title" style="margin-top: var(--space-6);">Fertility Rates</h3>
                            <p>Total fertility rate is the number of children a woman would have by the end of her childbearing years if she were to pass through those years bearing children. Analysis of fertility rates plays an important role in determining population growth rate, which in turn helps in planning for social provisioning.</p>

                            <h3 class="card-title" style="margin-top: var(--space-6);">Nutritional Status</h3>
                            <p>The nutritional well-being of young children reflects household, community and national investments in family health and contributes in both direct and indirect ways to the country's development. The nutritional status of children is summarised using anthropometric indices (height and weight) which reflect past deprivation.</p>
                            <p>Malnutrition is a major source of ill health and premature death. Undernourished people are those whose food intake is insufficient to meet their minimum energy requirements. Stunting (insufficient height for age) is an indication of cumulative deficient growth linked to long-term deprivation of both food and non-food requirements. Wasting (insufficient weight for height) associated with short-term deprivations changes rapidly and is sensitive to acute food deprivation and morbidity. Low weight for age indicates chronic and acute under nutrition.</p>

                            <p>The level of a nation’s development depends upon the economic and social conditions and the extent and quality of health services provided to the population. Therefore, the health care we have today is a result of policies made some years ago. The development of health care system in Kenya goes back to the pre-colonial era.</p>
                            <p>In 1901, a medical department was created as one of the civil departments of the central administration. This was the first step towards establishment of colonial medical organisations supported and controlled by the state. In 1903, medical administrators were requested, first, to preserve the health of the European Community, second, to keep the African and Asiatic labour force in good working condition and third, to prevent the spread of tropical diseases.</p>
                            <p>Medical education in Kenya started in 1967 when the University of East Africa established a faculty of medicine at University College, Nairobi, which in 1970 became the University of Nairobi. After independence, the government continued to expand health facilities in the country. At independence, Kenya inherited a three-tier health system in which the central government provided services at district, provincial and national levels; missionaries provided health services at sub-district levels; and local government provided services in urban areas. This system operated until 1970 when the government established a system of comprehensive rural health services in which health centres became the focal points for comprehensive provision of preventive, promotive and curative services.</p>
                            <p>Today, alongside government services, non-profit and FBOs organisations and NGOs provide health services at delivery points that range from dispensaries to hospitals. The government’s health care delivery system is pyramidal, with the national referral facilities at Kenyatta National Hospital (Nairobi) and Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital (Eldoret) forming the peak, followed by provincial, district and sub-district hospitals, with health centres and dispensaries forming the base.</p>

                            <p>The main mandate of a health system is to ensure that people enjoy long lives that are relatively free from the burden of disease and ill health. Health policies and strategies are aimed at reducing incidence of disease and improving the health status of Kenyans. Health policy in Kenya revolves around two critical issues, namely: how to deliver a basic package of quality health services to a growing workforce and their dependants and how to finance and manage those services in a way that guarantees their availability, accessibility and affordability to those in most need. The overall goal of the government is to promote and improve the health status of all Kenyans by making all health services more effective, accessible and affordable.</p>
                            <p>In all its development and sectoral plans, the government’s main objectives for development of health services since independence have been:</p>

                                <li>Strengthening and carrying out measures for eradication, prevention and control of disease.

                                <li>Provision for adequate and effective diagnostic, therapeutic and rehabilitative services for the whole population at hospitals, health centres, dispensaries and mobile units;</li>
                                <li>Promotion and development of biomedical and health services’ research as a means of identifying improved and cost effective methods for the protection of the health of the people.</li>

                            <p>The Constitution of Kenya 2010 provides an overarching conducive legal framework for ensuring a comprehensive and people-driven health services delivery. It provides for a rights-based approach to health whereby every person has the right to the highest attainable standard of health. It further indicates that a person shall not be denied emergency medical treatment and that the State shall provide appropriate social security to persons who are unable to support themselves and their dependants.</p>
                            <p>The Constitution singles out health care for specific groups such as children and persons living with disabilities. In addition, the underlying determinants of the right to health such as adequate housing, food, clean safe water, social security and education are also guaranteed in the Constitution. The current Health Policy therefore seeks to make the realisation of the right to health by all Kenyans a reality.</p>

                            <p>The Kenya Health Policy 2012-2030 provides guidance to the health sector in terms of identifying and outlining the requisite activities in achieving the government's health goals. The policy is aligned to Kenya's Vision 2030 (Kenya's national development agenda), the Constitution of Kenya and global health commitments and uses a three-pronged framework (comprehensive, balanced and coherent) to define policy direction as shown in Figure 10.2.</p>
                            <p>The goal of Kenya Health Policy 2012-2030 is ‘attaining the highest possible standard of health in a manner responsive to the needs of the population’.

The implementation of the policy will be done through five-year medium-term strategic plans.</p>
