                            <h3 class="card-title">What is TOR?</h3>
                            <p>TOR refers to the definition and structured description of the scope of work and the schedule that must be carried out by the person, company or evaluation team undertaking an evaluation.</p>

                            <h3 class="card-title">Characteristics of TORs</h3>
                            <p>The terms of reference recalls the background and specifies the scope of the evaluation, process, products, technical aspects, and states the main motives for an evaluation and the questions asked. It sums up available knowledge and outlines an evaluation methodology describing the distribution of work, schedule and the responsibilities among the people participating in an evaluation process. It also specifies the qualifications required from candidate teams or individuals as well as the criteria to be used to select an evaluation team.</p>
                            <p>TOR serves as a ‘contract’ between project/institution and evaluators, outlining key elements and should reflect strategic choices on what to focus on. The optimal type of TOR is one that satisfies the interests of all stakeholders concerned. This is not always possible. However, given the range of motivations for undertaking an evaluation, it requires the TOR to retain enough flexibility for the evaluation team to determine the best approach for collecting and analysing data.</p>

                            <h3 class="card-title">Components of TOR</h3>
                            <p>At a minimum, it is expected that ToRs for all evaluations will address the following sections.</p>

                            <p>A work plan is an annual or multi-year summary of tasks, timeframes and responsibilities that is used to support the implementation and evaluation of programme implementation. It is a valuable tool with a detailed account of how employees propose to accomplish their goals during project implementation—what actions need to happen, who will do them, when they will be completed and what resources will be required. A work plan is also used as a monitoring tool to ensure that production of outputs and progress towards outcomes and impact is timely and reflects project goals.</p>
                            
                            <h3 class="card-title">Key elements of a work plan</h3>
                            <p>i. Clearly defined goals, outputs and outcomes;<br>
                            ii. Activities – tasks to achieve outputs, outcomes;<br>
                            iii. Costs (budget) – indication of the activity’s cost;<br>
                            iv. Monitoring and evaluation – ensures that measures to monitor and assess the effectiveness of an activity are included such as recording achievements, collecting data, and assessments.</p>
                            
                            <h3 class="card-title">Developing a work plan</h3>
                            <p>The overall process of work planning is a comprehensive tool that helps programme staff to translate project/programme goals into operational terms on an annual basis. Monitoring and evaluation are integral parts of a work plan and will provide a basis for tracking achievements and revising strategies on how to best achieve project goals.</p>
                            <p>Work plans set out how a project will achieve its clearly defined goals by converting project goals into smaller, manageable outcomes and tasks that will ensure that the skills, experience and resources available are used efficiently and sustainably. A work plan will also help a supervisor know what projects and activities supervisees will be working on over the next several months,</p>
                            <p>A work plan generally includes a brief introduction or overview of a project and a breakdown of how individual project-related tasks will be accomplished through activities. The detailed breakdown is usually tabulated with columns capturing specific activity descriptions, outputs/outcomes, a timeline for completion, cost projections for implementation and staff responsible (Table 17.2). It is mandatory to include monitoring and evaluation activities in the work plan.</p>

                            <p>Implementation is the process of taking a work plan and its concepts and putting it into action. The work plan will serve as a guide for what needs to be accomplished, by whom, and in what specific timeframe. However, surprises do come up and changes in the work plan may be necessary. It is critically important that staffs involved in work plan implementation are made aware of such changes and how the changes may affect their role in the implementation process.</p>
                            <p>Throughout the implementation process, data related to the measures identified should be collected. These data will be important in the monitoring and evaluation process to determine whether or not the programme had the intended outcome.</p>

                            <h3 class="card-title" style="margin-top: var(--space-6);">Monitoring and Evaluating Work Plans</h3>
                            <p>Monitoring the work plan will be done by assessing whether activities were implemented as initially planned. This is usually done through monthly/quarterly activity implementation reviews. Enhanced process evaluation will entail an examination of whether activities are being carried out correctly, on time and within budget. Results of the evaluation should be used to enhance or review implementation.</p>
