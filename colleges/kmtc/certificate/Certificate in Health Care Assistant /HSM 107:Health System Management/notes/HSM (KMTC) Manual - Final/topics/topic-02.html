                            <p>Communication can be defined as the act of conveying thoughts or information. It can also be defined as the exchange of information between people. Being able to communicate well is essential to effective health services delivery. Good communication skills are vital for health professionals because they help them to:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Develop positive relationships with people using health services and their families and friends, so they can understand and meet their needs;</li>
                                <li>Develop positive relationships with work colleagues and other professionals;</li>
                                <li>Share information with people using their services by providing and receiving information;</li>
                                <li>Report on the work they do.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h3 class="card-title" style="margin-top: var(--space-6);">Communication Context</h3>
                            <p>Context refers to the circumstances in which an event occurs, a setting.</p>

                            <h4 class="card-title">One-to-one communication</h4>
                            <p>One-to-one means one person communicating with another person with no other people joining in. It is important to create the right atmosphere by being friendly and showing interest in and respect for the other person. The conversation needs a start, e.g. ‘Good morning’, a middle, when you both discuss what you need to talk about, and an ending, e.g. ‘See you on your next appointment.’</p>

                            <h4 class="card-title">Group communication</h4>
                            <p>Group communication is difficult because it only works properly if everyone gets involved. In most groups, there are people who speak a lot and others who rarely speak, if at all, because they feel uncomfortable speaking in front of a group of people or they are just not interested. Groups work best if there is a team leader who encourages everyone to have a say in turn, rather than everyone trying to speak at once.</p>

                            <h4 class="card-title">Formal and informal communication</h4>
                            <p>Formal communication tends to start with a greeting such as ‘Good afternoon. How are you feeling today?’ It can be used to show respect for others. Formal conversation is often used when a professional person, such as a health worker, speaks to someone using a service. It is clear, correct and avoids misunderstanding. Communication with a supervisor is usually formal. A supervisor is usually more distant from those they manage so that if they need to, for example, issue a formal warning to someone, it is less awkward for both parties than if they are friends.</p>
                            <p>Informal communication is often used between people who know each other well, like friends and family is more likely to start with ‘Hi, how are you?’ and allows for more variety according to the area someone lives in or culture. For example, in some places, it is common for people to call other people ‘brother or sister’ even if they have only just met. People usually communicate more informally with friends, including those they work closely with on a day-to-day basis.</p>

                            <h3 class="card-title" style="margin-top: var(--space-6);">Forms of communication</h3>
                            <p>There are three main forms of communication namely: verbal, non-verbal and written. We can also use technology to communicate.</p>

                            <h4 class="card-title">Verbal communication</h4>
                            <p>Verbal communication uses words to present ideas, thoughts and feelings. Good verbal communication is the ability to both explain and present your ideas clearly through the spoken word and to listen carefully to other people. This involves using a variety of approaches and styles appropriate to the audience you are addressing.</p>

                            <h4 class="card-title">Non-verbal communication</h4>
                            <p>This refers to the messages we send out to express ideas and opinions without talking. This might be through the use of body language, facial expressions, gestures, tone of voice, touch or contact, signs, symbols, pictures, objects and other visual aids. It is very important to be able to recognise what a person's body language is saying, especially when, as a health worker, you are dealing with someone who is in pain, worried or upset. You must also be able to understand the messages you send with your own body when working with other people.</p>

                            <p><strong>Body language</strong> – The way we sit or stand, which is called posture, can send messages. Slouching on a chair can show a lack of interest in what is going on. Folded arms can suggest that you are feeling negative or defensive about a person or situation. Even the way we move can give out messages. For example, shaking your head while someone else is talking might indicate that you disagree with them or waving your arms around can indicate you are excited.</p>
                            <p><strong>Facial expression</strong> – We can often tell what someone is feeling by looking at their eyes. Our eyes become wider when we are excited or happy, attracted to, or interested in someone. A smile shows we are happy and a frown shows we are annoyed.</p>
                            <p><strong>Touch or contact</strong> – Touching another person can send messages of care, affection, power or sexual interest. It is important to think about the setting you are in and what you are trying to convey before touching a person in a health environment. An arm around a child who is upset about something in hospital or a nursery can go a long way to making them feel better. On the other hand, however, a teenager might feel intimidated by such contact from an older person.</p>
                            <p><strong>Signs, symbols and pictures</strong> – There are certain common signs or gestures that most people automatically recognise. For example, a wave of the hand can mean hello or goodbye. Thumbs up can mean that all is well. Pictures of all forms and objects also communicate messages. An X-ray and a model of a knee joint can more easily communicate to someone needing a knee replacement exactly what is involved.</p>

                            <h3 class="card-title" style="margin-top: var(--space-6);">Written Communication</h3>
                            <p>This is central to the work of any person providing a service in a health environment. This is important for records and writing reports. Different types of communication need different styles of writing but all require literacy skills. A more formal style of writing is needed when recording information about a patient. It would be unacceptable to use text message abbreviations.</p>

                            <h3 class="card-title" style="margin-top: var(--space-6);">Technological Aids</h3>
                            <p>Technology is moving so quickly now that we have many electronic aids to help us communicate. For example, mobile phones can be used to make calls. We can also use them to send text messages and emails. We have computers on which we can record, store and communicate health information very quickly and efficiently over long distances. Through video link, a health professional can participate in, or guide an operation taking place in a different physical location.</p>

                            <h3 class="card-title" style="margin-top: var(--space-6);">Communication Cycle</h3>
                            <p>Communication is a process. In order to effectively communicate, the parties involved must go through a communication process.</p>

                            <p>The communication cycle happens very quickly and subconsciously because we think three times faster than we speak. In reality, the stages of the communication cycle do not happen in sequence. The communication process is repeated backwards and forwards as long as the conversation goes on. The sender of the message becomes the receiver of a message sent back, the receiver becomes the sender and so on. Each person continues the conversation because they have to check that they have understood what the other person meant. They do this by listening to what the person says and asking questions about it or putting it in their own words and repeating them back, so reflecting what has been said. A conversation can therefore also be called an interaction.</p>

                            <p>Some things stop communication from being effective. People who work in a health environment need to understand the barriers so they can overcome them. It is very important to be able to communicate effectively in a health or social care setting. A service user will not be able to take part in a discussion about their care or planning their future if they do not understand what is being said. Equally, the person providing the service cannot help if they cannot find a way to understand what the service user is trying to ask for. There are many factors that affect communication as illustrated in the table below.</p>

                            <p>Aggression is behaviour that is unpleasant, frightening or intimidating. It takes a variety of forms and can be physical, mental or verbal. It can cause physical pain or emotional harm to those it is directed at. It is caused by a range of factors such as substance abuse, mental health, a personality problem, fear or an attempt to dominate someone else. People who are aggressive towards other people are often bullies.</p>
                            <p>Aggression is a form of communication. It communicates a person’s state of mind, such as annoyance. It is also a barrier to communication. Aggression is often emotion that is out of control. It can be destructive. When someone shouts at someone else, the other person can be afraid and will either shout back or shut the aggressive person out.</p>
                            <p>If someone working in a health environment is annoyed, frustrated or irritated (breaths quickly, shouts, has a clenched jaw and/or rigid body language) the person they are attending to may feel dominated, threatened and unable to respond. This may lead to poorer service due to a breakdown in communication.</p>

                            <h4 class="card-title">Assertion</h4>
                            <p>Assertion is the skill of being calm and firm but not aggressive in the way you communicate with others. It helps you to communicate your needs, feelings and thoughts in a clear and confident way while taking into account the feelings of others and respecting their right to an opinion as well.</p>

                            <h4 class="card-title">How to be assertive</h4>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Plan what you are going to say. Be polite, state the nature of the problem, how it affects you, how you feel about it and what you want to happen. Make it clear that you see the other person's point of view and be prepared to compromise if it leads to what you want.</li>
                                <li>Control your emotions, such as anger or tearfulness and be calm and authoritative in your interactions with others. You need to be clear and prepared to defend your position and be able to say no. This will not cause offence if it is said firmly and calmly.</li>
                                <li>Use questions such as, 'How can we solve this problem?' Use the 'broken record' technique where you just keep repeating your statement softly, calmly and persistently. At the same time, use body language that shows you are relaxed, e.g. make firm, direct eye contact with relaxed facial features and use open hand gestures.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h3 class="card-title" style="margin-top: var(--space-6);">Using Verbal Skills to Overcome Barriers</h3>
                            <p>When you use your verbal skills effectively, you can help overcome barriers that may hinder communication. Some of the skills health service providers need when communicating verbally and assertively when need be, with service users are shown in the diagram below. They are useful tools in checking the understanding part of the communication cycle.</p>

                            <p><strong>Paraphrasing</strong> means repeating something a person has said in a different way to make sure you have understood the message. For example, someone may say, 'I have been sick since Sunday' and you respond by saying, 'You have been feeling this way for 4 days now?'</p>
                            <p><strong>Closed questions</strong> are questions that can be answered with either a single word or short phrase. For example, 'Do you like cabbage?' could be answered, 'No' or, 'No, I can't stand them.' Closed questions give facts, are easy and quick to answer and keep control of the conversation. They are useful as an opening question, such as 'Are you feeling better today?"; for testing understanding, such as, 'So you want to go on the pill?'; and for bringing a conversation to an end, such as, 'So that's your final decision?'</p>
                            <p><strong>Open questions</strong> may require a longer answer. For example, 'Why don't you like cabbages?' might be answered by, 'I haven't liked the taste or smell of them since I was made to eat them all the time when I was a child...' Open questions give control of the conversation to the person you are speaking to. They ask the person to think and reflect, give opinions and feelings. They are useful as a follow-up to a closed question, to find out more, to help someone realise or face their problems and to show concern.</p>
                            <p><strong>Clarification</strong> means to make something clear and understandable.</p>
                            <p><strong>Summarising</strong> means to sum up what has been said in a short, clear way.</p>

                            <h3 class="card-title" style="margin-top: var(--space-6);">Overcoming Barriers to Communication</h3>
                            <p>Communication difficulties can isolate a person, making them feel cut off. So it is particularly important in a health environment to overcome these difficulties. Barriers to communication can be minimised in several ways.</p>

                            <h4 class="card-title">i. Adapting the environment</h4>
                            <p>This can be done in a number of ways, such as improving lighting for those with sight impairments and reducing background noise for those with hearing impairments. Lifts can be installed with a voice giving information such as when the doors are opening and closing and which floor the lift is on for those who cannot see. Ramps can be added, reception desks lowered and signs put lower down on walls so that people with physical disabilities can access the people and information they need.</p>

                            <h4 class="card-title">ii. Understanding language needs and preferences</h4>
                            <p>Service providers need to understand language needs and preferences of the people they are serving. They may have to re-word messages so that they are in short, clear sentences. They should avoid slang, jargon and dialect as much as possible. They should explain details to people who cannot see and encourage them to touch things such as their face.</p>
                            <p>They should not shout at those who cannot hear very well. They should use normal, clear speech and make sure their face is visible. They should employ a communicator or interpreter for spoken or signed language and show pictures or write messages, depending on what is best for the service user.</p>

                            <h4 class="card-title">iii. Using individual preferred language</h4>
                            <p>Most leaflets produced by public bodies such as the Ministry of Health are now written in the two official languages in Kenya –English and Kiswahili – so that people who do not speak one of the languages can still access the information. If there is a member of staff who speaks the preferred language of a service user they will help translate. However, it is always important to ask a service user what their preferred language is for written and verbal communication.</p>

                            <h4 class="card-title">iv. Timing</h4>
                            <p>It is important to pick the right time to communicate important information to a service user. E.g. If, a doctor has just told a patient that they have a life threatening illness the patient needs time to absorb the information. If the doctor tells them all about the treatment straight away, chances are the patient may not really hear much of what is said because they are in shock. It may be better to see the patient once they have processed the information and are receptive to hearing additional information.</p>

                            <h4 class="card-title">v. Electronic devices</h4>
                            <p>There are many electronic devices that help overcome barriers to communication. These include:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li><strong>Mobile phones</strong>- These are generally affordable and available to the population at large, making them more accessible than computers. They have many uses in health care. For example, they enable emergency response teams to coordinate their efforts, allow a medical team to contact someone awaiting an operation, coordinate a support group, gather and send information etc.</li>
                                <li><strong>Telephone amplifiers</strong>- These are devices that amplify, or make louder, the ring tone of a phone so that people who are hard of hearing and those who use a hearing aid can hear the phone more clearly. They also amplify the volume of the person speaking on the other end by up to 100%.</li>
                                <li><strong>Other devices on telephones</strong> - include flashing lights for those who are hard of hearing to see that the phone is ringing.</li>
                                <li><strong>Hearing loops</strong>- A hearing loop system helps deaf people who use a hearing aid or loop listener hear sounds more clearly because it reduces or cuts out background noise. At home, for example, one can use a loop to listen to what is on television. You can also set up a loop with a microphone to help you hear conversations in noisy places like public transport vehicles. A hearing impaired student can wear a loop and the teacher a microphone to help the student listen to the teacher.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>Sign language uses visual signs. These are made up of the shapes, positions and movement of the hands, arms or body and facial expressions to express a speaker's thoughts. Sign language is commonly used in communities which include the friends and families of deaf people as well as people who are deaf or hard of hearing themselves.</p>
                            <p>Kenyan Sign language (KSL) is a visual language comprising specific gestures (signs), handshapes and facial expressions. The signs follow grammatical rules. It is the official language of the Deaf community in Kenya.</p>

                            <h3 class="card-title" style="margin-top: var(--space-6);">Lip Reading</h3>
                            <p>People with normal hearing subconsciously use information from the lips and face to help understand what is being said. Many people misunderstand deafness, thinking that if someone cannot hear very well, they are being rude or stupid. This can leave a deaf person feeling isolated, excluded from everyday activity and conversations, frustrated and lacking in confidence. Lip reading is a technique of interpreting the movements of a person's lips, face and tongue, along with information provided by any remaining hearing. It is used by someone who is deaf or hard of hearing. It is therefore important that you look directly at someone who is lip reading and stand in a well-lit area when speaking.</p>

                            <h3 class="card-title" style="margin-top: var(--space-6);">Makaton</h3>
                            <p>Makaton is a method of communication using signs and symbols and is often used as a communication process for those with learning difficulties. It was first developed in the UK in the 1970s. Unlike sign language, Makaton uses speech as well as actions and symbols. It uses picture cards and ties in facial expressions with the word to make the word easily recognisable by those with learning difficulties.</p>

                            <h3 class="card-title" style="margin-top: var(--space-6);">Braille</h3>
                            <p>The Braille system is a method widely used by blind people to read and write. Braille was devised in 1821 by Louis Braille, a Frenchman. Each Braille character is made up of six dot positions, arranged in a rectangle. A dot may be raised at any of the six positions to form sixty-four possible combinations and these raised dots are read by touch.</p>

                            <p>These have already been mentioned earlier as a way of overcoming barriers to communication. They are also alternative forms of communication.</p>

                                <li><strong>Interpreters</strong>- People who communicate a conversation whether it be spoken or signed, to someone in a different language they will understand. This is not easy because they not only have to interpret the words or signs but also have to find a way of expressing the meaning of the words clearly.</li>
                                <li><strong>Translators</strong>- People who change recorded information, such as the written word, into another language. Again, they have to convey the meaning as well as the words.</li>
                                <li><strong>Signers</strong>- People who can communicate using a sign language.</li>

                        <div class="content-card">
                            <p>This topic introduces students to more skills for effective communication. These include active listening, body language, facial expressions and eye contact. Some of these have already been covered at the beginning of this unit.</p>

                            <h3 class="card-title">Active Listening and Body Language</h3>
                            <p>Listening to people involves more than just hearing what they say. To listen well, you need to hear the words being spoken, thinking about what they mean and then thinking what to say back to the person. You can also show that you are listening and what you think about what is being said by your body language, facial expressions and eye contact. By yawning or looking at your notes when someone is talking, you give the impression of being bored by what is being said. By shaking your head and frowning, you are showing that you disagree with or approve of what they are saying.</p>
                            <p>The process of active listening involves:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Allowing the person talking time to explain and not interrupting;</li>
                                <li>Giving encouragement by smiling, nodding and making encouraging remarks such as, 'that's interesting' and, 'really?';</li>
                                <li>Asking questions for clarification, such as, 'can you explain that again please?';</li>
                                <li>Showing empathy by making comments such as, 'that must be making life really hard for you';</li>
                                <li>Looking interested by maintaining eye contact and not looking at your watch;</li>
                                <li>Not being distracted by anything else, such as an interruption on your mobile – switch it off or say you will ring back;</li>
                                <li>Summarising to check that you have understood the other person. You can do this by saying, 'so what you mean is ...?';</li>
                                <li>Use of appropriate language.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <div class="callout callout--tip">
                                <div class="callout-header">
                                    <span class="callout-icon">❓</span>
                                    <h4 class="callout-title">Ask students</h4>
                                </div>
                                <div class="callout-content">
                                    <p>How would you feel if your supervisor suddenly started using swear words while they were addressing you? Why would you feel that way?</p>
                                </div>
                            </div>

                            <p>We adjust how we speak depending on who we are with and who is listening to us. Things that are said with a group of friends or at a family gathering might not be understood by others because we use different types of language in different situations. People, even unconsciously, change their tone or use of dialect depending on whom they are speaking to. A person's accent or dialect may become more pronounced when they are speaking to someone from their family or from the area they grew up in.</p>

                            <h3 class="card-title" style="margin-top: var(--space-6);">Tone of voice</h3>
                            <p>If you talk to someone in a loud voice with a fixed tone, the person you are speaking to will think you are angry with them. On the other hand, if you speak calmly and quietly with a varying tone, the other person will think you are being friendly and kind. So it is important to remember that it is not just what you say, but also the way you say it that matters.</p>

                            <h3 class="card-title" style="margin-top: var(--space-6);">Pace</h3>
                            <p>If you speak really quickly and excitedly, the person listening to you will not be able to hear everything you say. If you keep hesitating or saying 'um' or 'er' it makes it harder for people to concentrate on what you are saying. If you speak at a steady pace, however, you will be able to deliver your message more clearly and the other person will be able to hear every word you say.</p>

                            <h3 class="card-title" style="margin-top: var(--space-6);">Proximity</h3>
                            <p>The space around a person is called their personal space. In a formal situation, such as a doctor talking to a patient, the doctor does not sit close enough to the patient to invade their personal space. In an informal situation, people who are friends or intimate with each other will often sit closer to each other. People usually sit or stand so they are eye-to-eye if they are in a formal or aggressive situation. Sitting at an angle to each other creates a more relaxed, friendly and less formal feeling.</p>

                            <h3 class="card-title" style="margin-top: var(--space-6);">Written communication</h3>
                            <p>Health workers need to be able to communicate well with the written word. This could be by writing something themselves, such as a letter to refer a client to a different service, a record of a person's condition and treatment or a prescription. This means they need to be able to use different ways of presenting information, such as letters, memos, emails, reports or forms. They need to make their meaning absolutely clear and structure the information well and in an appropriate manner so that mistakes do not happen. It is also necessary to use grammar, spelling and punctuation correctly. Handwriting should also be legible so that the person the information is intended for can actually read it. It is also important that the language used is appropriate. Health professionals should not use a lot of technical words, acronyms or jargon if they are writing to someone who will not understand it. They should read information provided by other health workers thoroughly. They need to be able to identify the main points and be able to find other information from a wide variety of sources. They also need ICT skills to update records and access information.</p>

                            <h3 class="card-title" style="margin-top: var(--space-6);">Knowing the Barriers of Communication</h3>
                            <p>Effective communication, including active listening, can be hard work. People who work in health care environments tend to enjoy learning about other people and their lives. Things can go wrong, however, if:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>The context is wrong, e.g. the surroundings are unsuitable due to lack of privacy;</li>
                                <li>The service provider and service user are mismatched. Sometimes communication breaks down because of factors such as age, education level, gender and ethnic background;</li>
                                <li>A person withholds information because they fear being judged, example.g., because they have taken illegal drugs or procured an abortion;</li>
                                <li>A person fears that confidentiality will be broken even though this should never happen, e.g. about their sexual orientation;</li>
                                <li>The service user thinks that the advice given is too vague and has not asked for clarification;</li>
                                <li>The subject matter is embarrassing, such as talking about sex or intimate body parts;</li>
                                <li>A person fears they are going to hear bad news so avoids going to a service provider until it is too late to help.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>If health workers do not develop good communication skills, the effectiveness of their work will be affected and things can go wrong. This will not help service users feel good about themselves, leading to negative consequences. Remember, it is important to overcome problems such as those listed above, communicate effectively, including checking understanding, so that you get the best out of your interactions with colleagues and service users.</p>
