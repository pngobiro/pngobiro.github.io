                            <p>A “system” is an arrangement of parts which are connected together for a purpose. A health system is concerned with people’s health. A health system has many parts that include patients, families and communities, Ministry of Health, health providers, health services organisations, pharmaceutical companies, professional societies and health financing bodies, and other organisations. The interconnections of the health system can be viewed as the functions and roles played by these parts.</p>
                            <p>The World Health Organisation (WHO) defines health systems as all organisations, institutions, and resources that are devoted to producing health actions. This definition includes the full range of players engaged in the provision and financing of health services including the public, private sector, NGO, FBO as well as international and bilateral donors, foundations, and voluntary organisations involved in funding or implementing health activities.</p>

                            <p>Governance in health refers the actions and means adopted by a country to organise, promote and protect the health of its population. The governance framework and its functioning can be formal e.g. Public Health Act, International Health Regulations or informal e.g. Hippocratic Oath to prescribe and proscribe behaviour. The health governance framework in Kenya is a devolved system. Good governance is also closely linked with effective leadership and efficient management which are covered in Module One.</p>

                            <h3 class="card-title" style="margin-top: var(--space-6);">Objective</h3>
                            <p>The objective of health governance is to promote and protect the health of a population at the individual, community, county and national level. An effective health governance system is therefore one which competently directs health system resources, performance, and stakeholder participation toward the goal of reducing illness, saving lives and doing so in ways that are open, transparent, accountable, equitable, and responsive to the needs of the people.</p>

                            <p>The Kenya health sector operates in the context of a number of policy frameworks and within a policy environment that is subject to both internal and external influences. The MDGs, and other global initiatives, and Vision 2030 Sector Plan for Health comprise the major external influences on the Kenyan health sector system. The health sector strategic plan and the community health strategy are some of the factors within the institutional and organisational context which shape the internal environment.</p>

                            <p>From a health perspective, the MDGs are important because:</p>
                            <ol class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>They provide a common set of priorities for addressing poverty;</li>
                                <li>Health is at the heart of the MDGs. This recognition signifies that health is central to the global agenda of reducing poverty as well as an important measure of human well-being;</li>
                                <li>They set quantifiable and ambitious targets against which to measure progress. These provide an indication of whether efforts are on track, and a means of holding decision-makers to account;</li>
                                <li>It is possible to calculate what it would cost to achieve the MDGs. This draws attention to the funding gap between available and needed resources, thus providing support to health sector calls for increased funding;</li>
                                <li>MDGs have helped to crystallise the challenges in health. If a country looks seriously at what it would take to achieve the health MDGs, the bottlenecks to progress become clearer.</li>
                            </ol>
                            <p>The challenges to health brought out in the MDGs are the need to strengthen health systems, ensure that health is prioritised within overall development and economic policies develop health strategies that respond to the diverse and evolving needs of the population, mobilise more resources for health at the national and county level, and improve the quality of health data.</p>

                            <p>All these statutes have an impact on the health sector. For instance, the Finance Act directly affects the budgetary allocation to the Ministry of Health. The Public Procurement and Disposal Act affects the manner in which the Ministry of Health acquires its supplies. The Education Act and various legislation governing public universities affect the quality of training given to health workers in those institutions. The Public Service Commission Act affects the Ministry of Health’s organisational structure, appointments, promotions and staff discipline. The Penal Code provides for criminal liability for health workers who facilitate abortions. The National Commission on Gender and Development is mandated to promote gender equity in health. The Public Health Act, section 3(1) establishes a Central Board of Health whose function is to advise the minister on all matters affecting public health. The Constitution of Kenya 2010 provides for equality and freedom from discrimination (Art 27) and the right to health and reproductive health (Art 43).</p>
                            <p>In the current legal framework, there are over twenty statutes dealing with the health sector in the country. The legal framework of the health sector is not under a single institution but spread within a number of ministries and departments of the government. Within the Ministry of Health, there are divisions, departments and specialised agencies responsible for different aspects of health regulations. In the devolved system of governance, this scenario is replicated at the county level.</p>
                            <p>The health sector policy focus is guided by Vision 2030. The strategic focus is well defined and elaborated in the Kenya Health Policy with clear goals on the long-term policy directions the country intends to achieve in pursuit of the imperatives of the Vision 2030, and the 2010 Constitution.</p>
                            <p>Governance of the health sector is anchored on current key policy, legal and legislative frameworks. The Kenya Health policy 2012-2030, Health Act 2012 and Kenya Health Sector Strategic and Investment Plan 2012-2017 are the key instruments which align the sector with the Constitution of Kenya 2010 and the social pillar of Vision 2030. These and other policy documents guide the two levels of Governments (National and County) and the health sector as a whole.</p>

                            <p>The right to health cannot be achieved without the active involvement of other stakeholders. Health sector stakeholders include:</p>
                            <p><strong>Clients</strong>- The individuals, households, and communities whose health is the focus of this strategic plan;</p>
                            <p><strong>State actors</strong>- The public sector (MoH – National and County, SAGAs, other ministries and the state department responsible for devolution), constitutional Commissions, regulatory bodies (boards and councils) and professional bodies/associations whose mandate is drawn from that of the state, and have an effect on health;</p>
                            <p><strong>Non-state actors</strong>- The Private sector NGOs, Civil Society Organizations (CSOs), FBOs, traditional practitioners, media, and all other persons whose actions have an impact on health, but do not draw their mandate from the state;</p>
                            <p><strong>External actors</strong>- The bilateral, multilateral, or philanthropic actors that draw their mandate from out of Kenya, but support national programmes.</p>

                            <h3 class="card-title" style="margin-top: var(--space-6);">Health Sector Intergovernmental Relations and Coordination Framework</h3>
                            <p>Effective governance is achieved through active engagement, consultation, cooperation and mutual accountability between the national department responsible for health and the county departments of health, as well engagement among the county departments of health. The Intergovernmental Relations Act 2012, Kenya Health Policy (2012-2030) and KHSSP 2013-2017 provide for a sound basis for intergovernmental relations framework in health.</p>
