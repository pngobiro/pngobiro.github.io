                            <p>The personality traits of successful entrepreneurs have been analysed by many experts. But as many of them are quick to point out, the problem with any formula for success as an entrepreneur is that success relies on a unique ability to see ‘new’ patterns.

                            <p>Sole proprietorships are by far the most common business form. The businesses are owned by one person and there is no legal distinction between the owner and the business. They are easy to create, operate and terminate since few formalities are involved. Most sole proprietorships are ready for business as soon as they set up operations.</p>
                            <p>The businesses are usually small in size and require minimal capital to start and operate. Their sponsors are essentially individuals who go into business for themselves. It is the only form where the sponsor is truly independent and is his own boss.</p>

                                        <li>The proprietor of a sole proprietorship is independent and is his or her own boss. There can be no arguments about policy and decisions. More and more women are becoming entrepreneurs;</li>
                                        <li>Sole proprietorships require relatively low start-up and working capital;</li>
                                        <li>There are minimal legal formalities and requirements to start and operate. They are easy to establish and dissolve. Once the owner obtains the start-up funds and necessary licenses and permits, he or she, can start the business. Termination is equally easy;</li>
                                        <li>There is limited government regulation in Kenya. Although all businesses are subject to some government controls, sole proprietorships have more freedom than other forms of business;</li>
                                        <li>There is greater self-interest and satisfaction due to the sense of ownership associated with this form of business;</li>
                                        <li>Decision-making and implementation are fast since the owner is not required to consult others in doing so;</li>
                                        <li>Sole proprietorships can respond quickly to changes in the external business environment conditions since the proprietor has direct and total control of decision the making process;</li>
                                        <li>The proprietor is in close contact with all stakeholders including employees, customers, suppliers and distributors. The proprietor can easily get essential feedback and address individual needs;</li>
                                        <li>The proprietor gets all the after tax profits of the business which serves as an incentive to work hard and be efficient. The harder and more efficient one is, the higher the profits;</li>
                                        <li>Sole proprietorships that start out small-scale are an ideal way of testing one’s business idea. Failure does not result in heavy losses as would be the case with large businesses.</li>

                                        <li>In sole proprietorships, the sponsor has unlimited liability hence they bear all the risks, liabilities and obligations of the business. In law, the proprietor and the business are identical. The owner is therefore personally responsible for all the debts, and other obligations of the business, even when they are more than the business is worth. The owner may have to sell personal property such as cars, houses, or furniture to satisfy claims against the business.</li>
                                        <li>Sole proprietorships may not afford to employ experts or professionals. These businesses also have difficulties finding and keeping good employees since professionals prefer employment in businesses where liabilities are limited. Furthermore, small businesses often cannot offer employees the same fringe benefits and opportunities for advancement as large companies;</li>
                                        <li>They have difficulties in raising additional capital since their sources of financial resources are more limited. Business lenders view the owner’s unlimited liability as a high risk since business assets are not protected from claims of personal creditors. Owners must use personal funds to finance the business;</li>
                                        <li>The inability of sole proprietorships to raise additional funds may curtail the business expansion plans;</li>
                                        <li>They may not take advantage of offers and discounts that may arise due to inability to buy in bulk;</li>
                                        <li>Sole proprietorships often have limited managerial expertise. Their success depends entirely on the owner's skills and talents. The owner is fully responsible for all business decisions, and must be a jack-of-all-trades. Not all owners are equally skilled in all areas. An investor who creates a new product may not be a good marketer, production manager, human resource manager, or accountant. Such an investor would have limited range of ideas required for decision-making;</li>
                                        <li>Decisions can be hasty due to lack of moderating voices;</li>
                                        <li>Running a sole proprietorship requires a huge time commitment and often dominates the owner's life. The owner must be willing to make sacrifices, often working 18 or more hours a day, six or seven days a week, with little time for leisure;</li>
                                        <li>There is no one to fill in when the proprietor is absent due to illness, family or social functions and holidays;</li>
                                        <li>Sole proprietorships lack continuity of existence; these businesses have uncertain life. If the owner loses interest, retires, dies, is disabled or becomes a lunatic, the business will cease to exist unless the owner finds a buyer. Sale of the business may result in loss of goodwill.</li>

                            <h3 class="card-title">Partnerships</h3>
                            <p>A partnership is owned by between 2 and 20 people or 50 in the case of professional partnership. There is no legal separation between ordinary partners. Some partners may have limited liability if it is a limited partnership. Ordinary partnerships are like sole proprietorships, easy to create, operate and terminate since few formalities are involved. Most of them are ready for business as soon as they set up operations. If one partner makes a business mistake without the knowledge or consent of others, all the other partners too must shoulder the consequences. Personal assets could be taken to pay the creditors even though the mistake was no fault of these other partners.</p>
                            <p>If your partner goes bankrupt in his or her personal capacity, for whatever reason, his or her creditors can seize his or her shares in the partnership. Even death may not release a partner from partnership obligations and in some circumstances the partner's estate can remain liable. However, limited partners would lose their right to manage the business. Moreover, at least one of the partners must remain an ordinary partner with unlimited liability.</p>
                            <p>Partnerships are prone to disputes and disagreements hence it would be well advised to negotiate a written partnership agreement or deed that states the terms and conditions for their partnership. Such written contract can avoid confusion disputes, and litigation later. The deed would normally specify issues such as arrangements between the partners, such as their financial contributions, management, how profits and losses will be shared, method of taking into business future additional partners and issues of dissolution.</p>
                            <p>The partners' contribution to the firm may come in various forms: services, skills, property or cash. And since partners are co-owners, the law presumes that they would share profits and losses equally, unless they specify in the deed otherwise.</p>

                                        <li>Partnerships are easy to form. Like sole proprietorships, partnerships can be established quickly and cheaply, and with few legal formalities. The partners agree to do business together, and develop a partnership agreement;</li>
                                        <li>Most partnerships require relatively low start-up capital. Like sole proprietorships, they are relatively inexpensive to form. Once the owner obtains the start-up funds and necessary licenses and permits, he or she can start the business;</li>
                                        <li>They provide additional sources of investment capital. Because two or more people contribute financial resources, partnerships can raise funds more easily for starting, operating and business expansion. The partners' combined financial strength also increases the firm's ability to raise funds from outside sources;</li>
                                        <li>Synergy. Partners can share the responsibility for managing, and operating the business. The costs of running the business is cheaper for individual partners due to the pooling of resources;</li>
                                        <li>There can be diversity of skills and expertise. Ideal partnerships bring together people with complementary backgrounds, rather than those with similar experiences. Combining partner skills to set goals and objectives, manage the overall direction of firm, and solve problems, increases the likelihood of the partnership's success. Finding the right partners entails looking at your own strengths and weaknesses, and examining what you are looking for in a partner;</li>
                                        <li>Discussions are possible whereby new and more ideas may develop as a result;</li>
                                        <li>Personal contact with customers, employees, suppliers and other people associated with the business is still possible as in sole proprietorships;</li>
                                        <li>There is flexibility since some partners can have limited liability;</li>
                                        <li>General partners take active role in managing their firms/ventures, and can respond relatively quickly to changes in the external business environment;</li>
                                        <li>Business continuity. Absence due to illness, family and social functions, and holidays can be covered for by other partners;</li>
                                        <li>Business losses, liabilities and other obligations are shared by the partners and are not shouldered by one individual;</li>
                                        <li>There is limited government regulation. Except for local by-laws, rules for licensing, and permits, the government has little control over partnership activities.</li>

                                        <li>Some partners have unlimited liability. In fact, any one partner can be held personally liable for all partnership debts and legal judgments, like malpractice, regardless of who caused them. As in sole proprietorships, business failure can lead to loss of the general partners’ personal assets. To overcome this disadvantage, there is provision for the formation of limited partnerships which allows some partners to have limited liability;</li>

                            <p>A limited company is owned by between 2 and 50 people. The business has a legal identity of its own separate from the people who own it. It can own assets, sue and be sued. Creditors and other claims are restricted to the assets of the business hence a shareholder’s liability is limited to the amount you have contributed by way of share capital. The business has perpetual life. There is a legal requirement that a chartered or certified accountant audit the business accounts.</p>

This means that, if the corporation goes bankrupt, creditors can look only to the assets of the corporation for payment;</li>
                                        <li>The corporation is a legal entity separate from its owners. It can own property, dispose of the property, be sued and sue;</li>

These financial resources allow the corporations to invest in facilities and human resources and grow much larger than sole proprietorships and partnerships;</li>

                            <h3 class="card-title" style="margin-top: var(--space-6);">Planning Activities</h3>
                            <p>Planning is a process of preparing a plan of action to achieve a set target for business activities. This may involve forecasting events, scheduling and re-scheduling of activities and tasks that affect the attainment of a target or goal. Planning is thinking ahead of time. Planning affects all the activities that the business undertakes. The entrepreneur and his or her team should plan for everything in the business including and not limited to finance, marketing, buying of stock and even the people he/she employs in the business.</p>
                            <p>Planning for the business involves the following:</p>
                            <p>i. Setting goals, objectives and targets. This involves:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Making a decision on what target to achieve after a certain period of time;</li>
                                <li>Developing long term and short term plans for the business.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>ii. Deciding on the activities that will be undertaken to help achieve the goals, objectives and targets.</p>
                            <p>iii. Developing ways of finding out whether the business is achieving its desired targets.</p>

                            <h3 class="card-title" style="margin-top: var(--space-6);">Organisation</h3>
                            <p>This is the process of identifying activities and tasks which will be carried out in the business and deciding the order in which the activities will be implemented and the people responsible for the activities. There are many activities that could be involved in a particular business such as purchasing of medical equipment or laboratory materials and banking. The complexity and intensity of these activities will depend on the size of the enterprise.</p>
                            <p>The entrepreneur needs to employ workers to help in carrying out some routine activities. They should identify the tasks and allocate duties and responsibilities to others.</p>
                            <p>The following are the main functions in organising:</p>
                            <p>i. Listing down all the activities that must be carried out in the business such as accounting, record keeping and purchasing;</p>
                            <p>ii. Grouping all the activities that are related together. For example for accounting include record keeping, banking and planning finances (budgeting).</p>
                            <p>iii. Deciding which activities must be done by the business owner and those by others thus allowing the business owner to focus on the core business activity of patient treatment or product development etc. depending on the nature of the business. Delegating i.e. allocating duties and responsibility to others. When delegating, the entrepreneur should make sure that others know their full responsibilities.</p>

                            <h3 class="card-title" style="margin-top: var(--space-6);">Leadership</h3>
                            <p>This is the function of providing strategic direction in the business. In a business there may be people working for or assisting the owner in one way or another. But it is the owner who knows the direction he/she wants to take the business. The business vision may be written or not. To have a successful business, the owner must be prepared to be a leader. Module two in this series covers Leadership and Management in more detail.</p>

                            <h3 class="card-title" style="margin-top: var(--space-6);">Resource Mobilisation</h3>
                            <p>Resource mobilisation involves looking for required resources to implement the activities identified in the business plan. These resources could be people, money, raw materials, equipment, and so on. It is the responsibility of the business owner to look for these resources. Further details on resource mobilisation can be obtained from the Module on Financial Management and Resource Mobilisation.</p>

                            <h3 class="card-title" style="margin-top: var(--space-6);">Controlling</h3>
                            <p>Controlling is one of the most important roles for any entrepreneur. Control involves knowing whether what has been planned or invested in the business is going according to plan and schedule. The business owner should take pro-active measures to prevent damages to the business. The following are some of the main control activities:</p>
                            <p>i. Controlling the budget involves ensuring that spending does not exceed what was budgeted;</p>
                            <p>ii. Controlling cash movement and the way it is spent (used) involves making sure that there is enough cash to meet daily business activities;</p>
                            <p>iii. Controlling credit sales involves reducing the number of debtors;</p>
                            <p>iv. Controlling stock held so that the business does not have too much or too little;</p>
                            <p>v. Controlling performance of workers so that they are able to meet the targets and that they stick to the work that has been planned.</p>

                            <p>One the most difficult things when starting a business is raising the start-up funds or capital. The entrepreneur might have a great and clear idea of how to run a successful business. However, if sufficient finance cannot be raised, it is unlikely that the business will get off the ground. Raising finance for start-up requires careful planning. The entrepreneur needs to decide:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>How much finance is required?</li>
                                <li>When and how long the finance is needed for?</li>
                                <li>What security (if any) can be provided?</li>
                                <li>Whether the entrepreneur is prepared to give up some control (ownership) of the start-up in return for investment?</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>The finance needs of a start-up should take account of these key areas:</p>
                            <p>i. Set-up costs- the costs that are incurred before the business starts to trade;<br>
                            ii. Starting investment in capacity- the fixed assets that the business needs before it can begin to trade;<br>
                            iii. Working capital- the stocks needed by the business, e.g. raw materials and allowance for amounts that will be owed by customers once sales begin;<br>
                            iv. Growth and development- e.g. extra investment in capacity.</p>

                            <h3 class="card-title" style="margin-top: var(--space-6);">Debt Financing (Borrowing)</h3>
                            <p>This is a financing method which involves an interest bearing loan being advanced to the business. The loan repayment is usually scheduled to be funded directly from the sales and profits of the venture. The financing may be short-term or long-term borrowing. Regular (monthly) interest payments are required to repay the loan and these could be difficult to service in case of poor performance of the business. Interest costs can escalate if loan interest rates are revised upwards by the lender.</p>
                            <p>The following are some common sources of debt financing:</p>

                                        <h4 class="definition-term">i. Loans from commercial banks</h4>
                                        <p class="definition-text">Although some banks will make unsecured short-term loans, most bank loans are secured by receivables, inventories or other assets. The banks require collateral for them to issue a loan and the collateral value will depend on the amount of loan that an entrepreneur is applying for. The loan is payable at an interest that is set by the bank issuing the loan.</p>

                                </div>

                                        <h4 class="definition-term">ii. Bank overdraft</h4>
                                        <p class="definition-text">This is a more short-term kind of finance which is also widely used by start-ups and small businesses. An overdraft is really a loan facility; the bank lets the business ‘owe it money’ when the bank balance goes below zero, in return for charging a high rate of interest. As a result, an overdraft is a flexible source of finance in the sense that it is only used when needed. Bank overdrafts are excellent for helping a business handle seasonal fluctuations in cash flow or when the business runs into short-term cash flow problems (e.g. a major customer fails to pay on time).</p>

                                        <p class="definition-text">This is credit given by suppliers who sell goods on account. This credit is reflected on the entrepreneur’s balance sheet as accounts payable, and in most cases must be paid in 30 to 90 days.</p>

                            <h3 class="card-title" style="margin-top: var(--space-6);">Equity Financing</h3>
                            <p>This is where a venture reaches out to equity partners for financing in the venture with no legal obligation for entrepreneurs’ to repay the principal amount or pay interest on it. However, it requires sharing ownership and profits with the equity partners. This profit is mostly in form of dividend normally paid after tax. It can be raised through two major sources: public stock offerings and private placements.</p>

                            <h3 class="card-title" style="margin-top: var(--space-6);">Public Stock Offerings</h3>
                            <p>Going public is a term used to refer to a business raising capital through the sale of securities to the public through the capital markets. In Kenya, initial public offerings, and rights issues are some of the common practices of companies going public or seeking to grow their capital base. The company invites the public or existing shareholders to buy shares and invest in its future. Selling securities is one of the fastest ways to raise large sums of capital in short periods of time. The public market provides liquidity for owners since they can readily sell their shares. Despite the positives that arise, there are expenses involved in going public like accounting and legal fees among others. Detailed disclosures of the company’s affairs must be made public. There are also numerous requirements imposed by the regulating bodies such as Capital Markets Authority and the Kenya Revenue Authority.</p>

                            <h3 class="card-title" style="margin-top: var(--space-6);">Private Equity</h3>
                            <p>This is another method of raising capital that small ventures often use. The entrepreneur would approach or be approached by potential partners who provide the required financing for specific growth or business needs. Private equity is easier to raise. However, business owners sometimes have to give up controlling interest of their businesses in order to benefit from private equity.</p>

                            <h3 class="card-title" style="margin-top: var(--space-6);">Internal Sources</h3>
                            <p>The main internal sources of finance for a start-up include:</p>
                            <p>i. <strong>Personal savings</strong> - These are the most important sources of finance for a start-up business. Most start-ups make use of the personal financial arrangements of the founder. This can be personal savings or other cash balances that have been accumulated. It can be personal debt facilities which are made available to the business. Investing personal savings maximises the control the entrepreneur keeps over the business. It is also a strong signal of commitment to outside investors or providers of finance.</p>
                            <p>ii. <strong>Retained profits</strong> - This is another important source of finance for any business, large or small. This is the cash that is generated by the business when it trades profitably. Retained profits can generate cash the moment trading has begun if the entrepreneur is willing to plough back the profits of early transactions into the business to finance other transactions.</p>
                            <p>iii. <strong>Borrowing from friends and family</strong> - This is also a common way of raising financing where friends and family who are supportive of the business idea provide money either directly to the entrepreneur or to the business. This can be quicker and cheaper to arrange compared with a standard bank loan and the interest and repayment terms may be more flexible than a bank loan. However, borrowing in this way can add to the stress faced by an entrepreneur, particularly if the business gets into difficulties.</p>
                            <p>iv. <strong>Credit cards</strong> - This is a surprisingly popular way of financing a small start-up. Many entrepreneurs who have access to credit card facilities use this as a means of financing small business opportunities/contracts and regular expenses. The entrepreneur pays for various business-related expenses on a credit card and receives a statement from the credit card company 15 days later. The business then pays the statement balance within the credit-free period. The effect is that the business gets access to a free credit period of around 30-45 days.</p>

                            <h3 class="card-title" style="margin-top: var(--space-6);">Leasing</h3>
                            <p>Many businesses today are being faced with the challenge of financing their fixed assets either through outright purchase or leasing of the asset. Current trends, mainly driven by cash flow pressure in the short term, are opting for flexible payments for the use of an asset as opposed to outright purchase which will make them set aside cash upfront for purchase of the asset.</p>

                            <h4 class="card-title">Leasing Verses Buying</h4>
                            <p>As opposed to an outright purchase, a leasing arrangement offers the opportunity to only pay a portion of the asset every month. - he portion which you 'use up' during the time you are using the asset. This arrangement is made to provide for return of the asset to the owner at the end of the lease period.</p>
                            <p>Some lease arrangements also prefer to monitor the use of the asset to minimise misuse and ensure that maintenance is carried out as required. Essentially, they are the true owners of the asset and it is in their interest to keep track of the asset's use. In the case of vehicles, some cap the number of kilometres that the vehicle should travel per month. They also keep track of the asset to ensure that the lessee is not misusing the asset. At the end of the lease, you may return the asset or purchase it for its depreciated resale value.</p>

                                            <li>Reduced initial cash outlay- You do not need all the cash up front, you just need the first month's instalment for a start.</li>
                                            <li>Easier credit terms- It is easier to get someone to lease you an asset than sell to you on credit. Furthermore, you may negotiate a longer period for use of the asset. The owner has the title to the asset and therefore his risk is reduced.</li>
                                            <li>Avoidance of financial restrictions- Leasing frees your balance sheet to be able to borrow for other purposes.</li>
                                            <li>Flexibility in addressing obsolescence- Leasing is flexible enough to enable you keep pace with technology; you do not tie yourself to obsolete technology. You simply let go of the asset and take a fresh lease on the new one.</li>
                                            <li>Flexibility in addressing need and suitability- If you are not sure of the suitability of the asset, you can use the lease period to make the assessment without being bound by owning the asset upfront.</li>
                                            <li>Maintenance support- Under some leases, the lesser may agree to be responsible for maintaining and repairing the leased equipment at their cost.</li>
                                            <li>Current deductibility of rent- Your lease or rental payments are fully deductible for tax purposes if you use the leased asset in your business.</li>
                                            <li>Balance sheet appearance- Leasing improves certain financial indicators, such as your debt-to-equity and gives you a positive financial outlook.</li>

                                            <li>Overall cost- Your costs over the life of the asset are generally going to be higher than if you purchased the asset. This is because your rental payments must compensate the lesser not only for acquisition and financing costs, but also for the risk of not being in possession of his asset.</li>
                                            <li>No ownership interest- Your lease payments do not establish any ownership in your leased equipment. At the end of the lease, you will not have a tangible asset to show for your payments.</li>
                                            <li>Lost tax benefits- You lose the tax benefits of depreciation deductions that come with ownership.</li>
                                            <li>Commitment to property- Once you sign a lease agreement, you are generally committed to making payments for the entire lease period even if you stop using the property.</li>

                                            <li>You retain control- There are restrictions that come with a leased asset that deny you the freedom to make decisions without referring to the lesser.</li>
                                            <li>You can consider the long-term cost- There are benefits of purchase that accrue in the long run, especially if the equipment can continue being productive for many years.</li>
                                            <li>You want to stay at the same location- In case of business premises, you stand to benefit from strategic locations if you buy upfront since leasing can cause you to lose premises when you are not ready.</li>
                                            <li>A purchase may bring you tax savings- There are tax savings that accrue especially with depreciation allowance on assets that you get to enjoy if you own the assets. The savings can be significant if the value of the asset is significant.</li>

                                            <li>Heavy initial outlay- This could be a challenge especially in hard economic times. Most businesses especially small ones may find it hard to afford the initial outlay required.</li>
                                            <li>Associated costs- For a business that may not afford initial cash upfront, loan financing may be another option of purchasing upfront. This raises the related costs of interest and the risk that interest can be adjusted upwards without notice in hard economic times.</li>
                                            <li>The owner bears the risk- Any risks such as damage, obsolescence, depreciation or breakdown are solely borne by the owner.</li>
                                            <li>Inflexible disposal- It may proof difficult to economically dispose the asset especially if it is used for a while. Some business owners end up getting stuck with old equipment that litters the factories because they cannot identify a possible buyer.</li>
