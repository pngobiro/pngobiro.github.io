                            <p>A health system can be defined as structured and interrelated work of all agencies contributing to health within a country and “includes efforts to influence determinants of health as well as more direct health improving activities”. A health system is therefore more than the pyramid of publicly owned facilities that deliver personal health services. It includes, for example, a mother caring for a sick child at home; private providers; behaviour change programmes; vector-control campaigns; health insurance organisations; occupational health and safety legislation. It also includes inter-sectoral action by health staff, for example, encouraging the Ministry of Education to promote female education, a well known determinant of better health.</p>
                            <p>A health system consists of all organisations, people and actions whose primary intent is to promote, restore or maintain health. This definition includes the full range of stakeholders in a health sector, for example, private and not-for-profit service providers, health insurance organisations, public health legislation, community workers, health educators, researchers, patients, and consumers, as well as mothers caring for sick children (Health Systems 20/20).</p>

                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Leadership and governance</li>

                            </ul>
                            <p>The six building blocks contribute to the strengthening of a health system in different ways. A dynamic relationship exists between the various components in a health system. The multiple relationships and interactions among the blocks constitute a functioning health system. Each building block interacts with and influences the others, and is in turn affected by them. These relations and interactions cut across not only the health system building blocks but also the different sectors and stakeholders that constitute the system. Figure 1.1 below illustrates relationships among the building blocks.</p>

                            <p>The six building blocks contribute to the strengthening of health systems in different ways. Some cross-cutting components such as leadership/governance and health information systems provide the basis for the overall policy and regulation of all the other health system blocks. Key input components to the health system include specifically financing and the health workforce. A third group, namely medical products and technologies and service delivery, reflects the immediate outputs of the health system, i.e. the availability and distribution of care.</p>

                                <li>Good health services are those which deliver effective, safe, quality personal and non-personal health interventions to those that need them, when and where needed, with minimum waste of resources.</li>
                                <li>A well-performing health workforce is one that works in ways that are responsive, fair and efficient to achieve the best health outcomes possible, given available resources and circumstances. This means there are sufficient staff, fairly distributed; they are competent, responsive and productive.</li>
                                <li>A well-functioning health information system is one that ensures the production, analysis, dissemination and use of reliable and timely information on health determinants, health system performance and health status</li>

                            <p>At county level, the Kenya Health Policy 2012-2030 proposes the formation of county health departments whose role will be to create and provide an enabling institutional and management structure responsible for “coordinating and managing the delivery of health care mandates and services at the county level”. In addition to the county health departments, the policy calls for the formation of county health management teams. These will provide “professional and technical management structures” in each county to coordinate the delivery of health services through health facilities available in each county.</p>
                            <p>The role of the county government is to provide strategic and operational leadership and stewardship for overall health management in the county, including provision of health services, resource mobilisation, creation of linkages with national level referral health services, monitoring and evaluation, coordination and collaboration with state and non-state stakeholders at the county level.</p>
                            <p>Within each county, the Health Facility Management Teams are charged with the responsibility of providing health services, developing and implementing facility health plans, coordinating and collaborating with stakeholders through County Health Stakeholder Forums, supervising, continuously monitoring and evaluating health service provision and implementing health policies.</p>
