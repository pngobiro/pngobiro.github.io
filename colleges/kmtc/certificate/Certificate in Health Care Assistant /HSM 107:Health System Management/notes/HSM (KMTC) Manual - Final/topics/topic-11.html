                        <div class="content-card">
                            <p>Patients have the right to receive considerate and respectful health care. It is the health care provider’s legal and ethical responsibility to know and respect the patient’s rights. Professionally health care workers have specific legal responsibilities that regulate their particular profession. Adhering to legal regulations is vital for the health care worker’s own protection, the protection of their employer and more importantly, the safety and well-being of the patient. Failure to observe legal and ethical obligations leads to negligence or malpractice.</p>

                            <h3 class="card-title" style="margin-top: var(--space-6);">Medical Negligence</h3>
                            <p>Medical negligence, according to Mosby’s Medical Dictionary (8th edition), can be defined as the commission of an act that a prudent person would not have done or the omission of a duty that a prudent person would have fulfilled, resulting in injury or harm to a patient.</p>

                            <h3 class="card-title" style="margin-top: var(--space-6);">Medical Malpractice</h3>
                            <p>Medical malpractice means bad, wrong or injudicious treatment of a patient professionally which results in injury, unnecessary suffering or death. Malpractice and negligence may occur through omission of a necessary act as well as commission of an unwise or negligent act. This may be in the form of misdiagnosis, wrong decisions and treatment, prescription errors and medical or surgical complications, all of which may result in suffering, permanent injury or death.</p>
                        </div>

                        <!-- Regulation -->
                        <div class="content-card">
                            <h3 class="card-title">Regulation</h3>
                            <p>In Kenya, medical, nursing and midwifery practices are regulated by statutory authorities, including the Medical Practitioners and Dentists Board, the Nursing Council of Kenya, the Clinical Officers Council and the Pharmacy and Poisons Board. These bodies are obliged to protect members of the public by ensuring that medical practitioners including dentists, nurses and midwives, clinical officers and pharmacists are properly qualified, that they perform their services to patients with skill and diligence and observe at all times high moral and ethical standards. Health care professionals are expected to know and follow the laws regulating their profession, license or registration.</p>

                            <h3 class="card-title" style="margin-top: var(--space-6);">Applicable laws</h3>
                            <p>Legal responsibilities in the health sector are interpreted through civil or criminal law. Civil law deals with legal relationships between people and protection of a person's rights. Criminal law deals with wrongs against a person, property or society, practising without the required licence, theft and murder among others. Many of the wrong doings in health care are civil wrongs. However, they can lead to legal action.</p>

                            <h3 class="card-title" style="margin-top: var(--space-6);">Compliance</h3>
                            <p>The following are basic guidelines on how to comply with appropriate laws and procedures:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Protect the patient from exposure (heat or cold);</li>
                                <li>Knock and pause before entering a room;</li>
                                <li>Draw curtains or close door when providing care;</li>
                                <li>Leave while visitors are with the patient;</li>
                                <li>Do not listen when patients make phone calls;</li>
                                <li>Abide by the rules of confidentiality;</li>
                                <li>Do not discuss the patient's condition with anyone outside of work;</li>
                                <li>Be aware of your surroundings and do not discuss a patient within areas others could overhear (lifts, cafeteria, corridors, parking lot, etc).</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h3 class="card-title" style="margin-top: var(--space-6);">Privileged Communication</h3>
                            <p>All information given to health personnel by a patient is considered privileged communication, and by law must be kept confidential. However, certain information is exempt by law and must be reported. This includes:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Births and deaths;</li>

                                <li>Drug abuse;</li>
                                <li>Chronic diseases.</li>
                            </ul>

When she went two weeks past the due date, he admitted her at a private hospital for induction of labour, but for three days labour did not set in. However, when labour started on the fourth day her doctor was nowhere to be found; it was not until the next day that he appeared in the middle of the night and attempted to deliver her by vacuum extraction, but this was abandoned because there was a lot of bleeding. She was then taken to theatre and a CS was performed. She gave birth to a baby boy weighing 4kg. When she was returned to the ward, the bleeding continued and had to be returned to theatre again, but was not told what was done there. Details of operations done on her were only made known to her husband when he went to clear the bills. And then it was not until three months later that her husband actually informed her of the loss of her uterus. After some years, her husband left her for another woman to have more children.</td>

                            <p>Health care workers must be familiar with their employer's policies and procedures. Policies and procedures are the guidelines that provide information about employment terms, work place procedures, quality control etc. Technical procedures tell you how to complete tasks the way your employer wants them done. There may be procedures for the following:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>How to take a temperature;</li>
                                <li>How to give an enema;</li>
                                <li>How to fill out forms;</li>

                            <p>These guidelines assure that the health care worker performs their jobs correctly. It is important to always follow a health facility's policies and procedures. Doing this will protect your patients, co-workers, employer and yourself.</p>

                            <p>Ethics is a set of moral principles and a code for behaviour governing an individual’s actions with other individuals and within society. Ethics is a critical reflection about morality – what is believed to be right and good. Medicine and technology are rapidly changing and offering choices to health professionals. Although challenging and even exciting, the choices can be difficult. For example, should medications known to be effective be withheld from a patient because it is thought they are incompetent or do not have the means to store or manage the medication properly?</p>
                            <p>In modern health care and research, value conflicts arise where there often appears to be no clear consensus as to the “right thing to do”. These conflicts present problems requiring moral decisions that necessitate a choice between two or more alternatives.</p>
                            <p>Examples:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Should a parent have a right to refuse immunisations for his or her child?</li>
                                <li>Does public safety supersede an individual’s right?</li>
                                <li>Should children with serious birth defects be kept alive?</li>
                                <li>Should a woman be allowed an abortion for any reason?</li>
                            </ul>

It is conflict between moral obligations that are difficult to reconcile and require moral reasoning. Situations necessitating a choice between two equal (usually undesirable) alternatives. Modern health care technology has created many ethical dilemmas. For example:<br>• Assisted suicide – is it justified in certain patients?<br>• Stem cell research – should aborted foetuses be used?<br>• Should a patient be permitted to smoke marijuana if it eases pain or effects of chemotherapy?</p>

                                        <h4 class="definition-term">Deontology / Non-consequentialism Theory</h4>
                                        <p class="definition-text">This is derived from the Greek word “Deon”, meaning duty. Under this theory, some acts are right or wrong independent of their consequences. The theory is based on the concept of duty. It is premised on one’s obligation and on that basis seeks to determine what is ethical by answering the question: What should I do and why should I do it?</p>
                                        <p class="definition-text"><strong>Illustration:</strong> Anita, a practitioner, believes she has a duty to give cardiac clients detailed information on the pathology involved in their condition even though the client has indicated that they are not ready or may be terrified to hear the information causing the client distress.</p>

                                        <p class="definition-text">Also called Teleological theory. Actions are determined and justified by the consequence of the act. Consequentialists consider all the consequences of what they are about to do prior to deciding a right action. This also answers the question: What should I do and why should I do it?</p>
                                        <p class="definition-text"><strong>Illustration:</strong> Had Anita respected the wishes of her clients, she would have given them only the information which would have been a benefit to them and not caused them undue stress. She would have been motivated by her desire to do good (beneficence), rather than her sense of duty. This would amount to deontological betrayal.</p>
