                            <p>Project management is a methodical approach to achieving agreed upon results within a specified timeframe with available resources. It involves applying knowledge, skills, tools and techniques to a wide range of activities in order to meet the requirements of a project. The focus of project management is to meet the expectations of a project in order to fulfil the needs that have been identified by the people. Project management is accomplished through managerial processes of planning, organising, controlling, leading and motivating human resource to identify resource requirements, establishing clear and achievable objectives, balancing the competing demands for quality, scope, time and cope and adapting the specifications, plans, and approach to the different concerns and expectations of the various stakeholders to generate outputs (deliverables). Project management is often an important role for health managers/supervisors. The concepts, methods and tools described in this module are an important part of a supervisor's repertoire.</p>

This includes schedules, task lists and budgets to keep the project on track. This ensures adherence to the phases of the project cycle (13.4).

                                    <p class="feature-text">In a project, set-up change is unavoidable. A flexible approach needs to be maintained to absorb any changes that may arise but also not divert completely from the initial plan and intended project objectives. Change management is an approach to shifting or transitioning individuals, teams and organisations from a current state to a desired future state. It is an organisational process aimed at helping stakeholders to accept and embrace changes in their environment. In some project management contexts, change management refers to a process wherein changes to a project are formally introduced and approved. Change management uses basic structures and tools to control any organisational change effort. The goal is to maximise benefits and minimise the change impacts on workers and avoid distractions.</p>

                        </div>
                        <div class="content-card">
                            <p>Project planning is the process of developing and maintaining or adapting a project plan that provides supporting details to the project definition in terms of resources, time, cost, scope and quality plan and schedules. It is about constructing a statement that indicates why, what, who, when, where, how much, what standards and so what. The major inputs to project planning process are the scope statement, environmental factor analysis, which include political, economic, technical, social cultural and technological factors and a good understanding of the resource requirements for the proposed activities. The main output for project planning is the project management plan. The planning phase involves scheduling of time, costing and budgeting and risk management. This is a very critical stage of any project.</p>

                            <h3 class="card-title" style="margin-top: var(--space-6);">Importance of project planning and design</h3>
                            
                            <h4 class="card-title">Cost-effectiveness</h4>
                            <p>Project management provides a roadmap for the journey of success. It is the greatest resource that allows the manager to understand available resources and their use. Thus, with a plan in hand, it is easy to utilise the resources in the best possible way. Project planning, prior to launching a project, identifies irrelevant costs, reduces wastage of resources and thus ensures cost-effectiveness in the longer run.</p>

                            <h4 class="card-title">Better Productivity</h4>
                            <p>Project management keeps the quality of products and services in constant check thus ensuring better productivity in terms of quality and quantity. This not only helps the organisation in earning goodwill for a lifetime but also promises customer satisfaction. Trustworthy quality of products and services is intended to retain existing clientele and attracting new ones.</p>

                            <h4 class="card-title">Minimisation of Risks</h4>
                            <p>Every organisation faces risks of loss for various reasons. However, identifying risks and solutions is easier with a strategy. This maintains stability in the work. By planning and analysing, a project manager can mitigate risks and be a part of fair competition. Project management helps in identification of loopholes and potential threats. Once these are singled out, the management can then take decisions to change strategies to minimise risks that can negatively affect productivity.</p>
                            <p>An organisation can prepare a risk management plan detailing how to deal with the various risks that they may encounter during project implementation. For example, during the implementation of the project, one of the common risks is that there may be lack of technical capacity of implementing organisations to manage project resources efficiently and effectively. Therefore, during the planning phase, standards and regulations should be formulated. These standards and regulations should focus on capacities of the organisations, the requirements and actions necessary where such requirements and capacities are not met.</p>

                            <h4 class="card-title">Accomplishing Predetermined Goals</h4>
                            <p>Every viable organisation has goals and objectives which allow the organisation or institution to fulfil its mission. Project management is the key tool for achieving predetermined targets in a structured way. It decides the strategies that will be used to reach the goal quickly. It is a structured way of getting to your objectives.</p>

                            <p>The project cycle is a way of viewing the main elements that projects have in common and how they relate to each other in sequence. The precise formulation of the cycle and its phases varies from organisation to organisation. There is no standard cycle, although the basic components are discussed below.</p>
                            <p>Project cycle management is the systematic process of programming, project identification, project appraisal, financing, implementing, monitoring and evaluation. It is used to guide management activities and decision making procedures during the life-cycle of a project from start to end. It involves regulating and supervising various activities undertaken at each phase of the project cycle.</p>

The idea may be identified through several interactions including focus group discussions, brainstorming and problem inventory analysis, amongst others.<br><br>In the public sector in Kenya, during this phase, the situation at national and sectoral level is analysed to identify aspirations, constraints and opportunities which development cooperation could address. This involves a review of socio-economic indicators, and national challenges. The purpose is to identify and agree on the purpose and objectives that should respond ultimately to development priorities and thus to provide a relevant and feasible programming framework within which projects can be identified and prepared. For each of these priorities, the project design teams will formulate strategies that take account of the lessons of past experience as well as opportunities andor emerging needs.</p>

This involves consultation with the intended beneficiaries of each action, an analysis of the problems they face (given the aspirations) and the identification of options to address these problems. A decision should be made on the relevance of each project idea both to the intended beneficiaries and to the programming framework and which ideas should be further studied during the formulation phase.<br><br>At the formulation stage, the relevant project ideas are developed into operational project plans. Beneficiaries and other stakeholders participate in the detailed specification of the project idea that is then assessed for its feasibility (whether it is likely to succeed) and sustainability (whether it is likely to generate long-term benefits for the beneficiaries). On the basis of this assessment, a decision is made on whether to draw up a formal project proposal and seek funding for the project. A monitoring plan should be prepared during this phase to ensure that the project is implemented against proposed resources and timelines.<br><br>At this phase, baseline data is collected and the needs assessment carried out. The idea is expressed in a proposal. This process includes documentation, validating, ranking and approving various projects by the project staff or professional consultants.</p>

The document could be in form of the following documents: budget sector plans for Government of Kenya funded activities and or financing agreements from partner countries. These are signed between two countries. Further information is in Module 8: Financial Management and Resource Mobilization.

This phase takes place during the implementation. A monitoring plan is used to monitor project implementation. It ensures that input deliveries, work schedules, targeted outputs and other required actions are proceeding according to plan. Monitoring provides the manager and other key stakeholders with continuous feedback on implementation i.e. identifying actual or potential successes and problems as early as possible to facilitate timely interventions or adjustment to the operations.<br><br>Monitoring is a management activity that allows a continuous adaptation of the intervention if problems arise or if changes in the context have an influence on the performance of the operation. During the monitoring, operation managers compare at different moments the actual implementation with what was planned. If activities cannot be implemented as foreseen for some reason, a reflection has to lead to an adaptation of that activity so that the success of the operation remains guaranteed.<br><br>Continuous communication with different stakeholders is important. Through periodic reports usually stipulated in the deliverables, they keep the contracting agency whether government or development partner, informed about the progress, results, challenges, lessons learnt and planned activities for the next period. The internal monitoring reports, made by project staff, complete the monitoring procedures. The activity and resource schedules form the basis for a monitoring system.</p>

It assists decision makers by providing information about any needed adjustments of objectives, policies, implementation strategies and other project elements. It examines whether the assumptions made during project formulation or appraisal stage are still valid or if changes are required to ensure overall project objectives are achieved. Refer to Module 17 for more detailed information on this area.<br><br>There are several ways of categorising project evaluations where: the summative evaluation is also known as end term evaluation and formative evaluations also known as midterm evaluation. Summative evaluations are carried out when the project is over and the aim is to assess its effectiveness and impact. Formative evaluations are usually undertaken early to gain understanding of what is being achieved in order to introduce improvements.<br><br>Summative evaluations judge merit and the work; the extent to which the desired goals have been attained; whether measured outcomes can be attributed to observed interventions and the conditions under which goals were attained. Formative evaluations help programmes get ready for summative evaluation by improving programme processes and providing feedback about strengths and weaknesses that appear to affect goal attainment.<br><br>• Quantitative and qualitative evaluations- Quantitative evaluations focus on measurable inputs provided and changes that result from the direct implementation of project activities. Qualitative evaluations are more process oriented and focus on assessment of changes of hard-to-measure factors such as attitudes, behaviour, skills and level of knowledge.<br>• Self-evaluation-This is an evaluation conducted by people directly involved in the implementation of the project.<br>• Internal evaluation- An evaluation conducted by people who form part of the staff of the organisation that provided the funding.<br>• External evaluation- An evaluation conducted by those who are external to funding organisations and project.<br><br>During the phase, the government and or development partner assess the project's accomplishments and identify lessons that have been learned. The final evaluation findings are used to improve the design of future projects or programmes.</p>

                            <p>The logical framework is used in the design, monitoring and evaluation of projects. It is used during the entire project implementation cycle. It ensures that the fundamental questions are asked and weaknesses analysed in order to provide decision makers with better and more relevant information. The tool guides systematic and logical analysis of the inter-related key elements; improves planning by highlighting linkages between project elements and external factors; provides a better basis for systematic monitoring and analysis of the effects of projects; facilitates common understanding and better communication between decision makers, managers and other parties involved in the project and ensures systematic monitoring of the project.</p>
                            <p>The logical framework is considered rigid as the objectives and external factors specific at the onset are over emphasised. The tool is a fairly complex, to obtain full benefits, the implementers should have a thorough understanding of the same.</p>

                            <p>A Gantt chart is an important project management tool. It is used to keep track of progress for each activity. A Gantt chart breaks the work down into smaller steps, indicates dependencies and defines milestones. It assigns human resources to work on tasks. They are excellent models for scheduling, budgeting, reporting, presenting and communicating project plans and progress easily and quickly. A Gantt chart can be constructed using MS Excel or a similar spreadsheet.</p>

                            <p>The Gantt charts create a picture of complexity of the project and assist to set realistic timeframes. Gantts charts can, however, become extraordinarily complex. The length of the bar does not indicate the amount of work input at every stage. The Gantt chart requires constant updating to provide adequate information to the management.</p>

                            <h4 class="card-title">iii. Brainstorming</h4>
                            <p>Brainstorming is usually the first crucial creative stage of the project management and project planning process. The brainstorming process is ideally a free-thinking and random technique. Consequently, this stage of the project planning process can benefit from being facilitated by a team member able to manage such a session, specifically to help organise people to think randomly and creatively. The advantages of using brainstorming are that new ideas are generated and problems are better defined. It also helps reduce conflict. However, the brainstorming sessions can generate unworkable ideas.</p>

                            <h4 class="card-title">iv. Fishbone Diagrams</h4>
                            <p>The fishbone diagram identifies possible causes for an effect or problem. Fishbone diagrams are good at identifying hidden factors which can be significant in enabling larger activities, resources areas or parts of a process. Fishbone diagrams are not good for scheduling or showing interdependent time-critical factors. Fishbone diagrams are also called 'cause and effect diagrams' and Ishikawa diagrams, after Kaoru Ishikawa (1915-89), a Japanese professor specialising in industrial quality management and engineering who devised the technique in the 1960s.</p>
                            <p>A fishbone diagram has a central spine running left to right, around which is built a map of factors which contribute to the final result (or problem). For each project, the main categories of factors are identified and shown as the main 'bones' leading to the spine. Ishikawa's diagram became known as a fishbone diagram, obviously, because it looks like a fishbone:</p>

                            <h4 class="card-title">v. Project critical path analysis (CPA)</h4>
                            <p>A critical path analysis is normally shown as a flow diagram, whose format is linear (organised in a line), and specifically a time-line. CPA is also called Critical Path Method (CPM). A commonly used tool within CPA is PERT (Programme/Project Evaluation and Review Technique) which is a specialised method for identifying related and interdependent activities and events, especially where a big project may contain hundreds or thousands of connected elements. PERT is not normally relevant in simple projects, but any project of considerable size and complexity, particularly when timings and interdependency issues are crucial, can benefit from the detailed analysis enabled by PERT methods.</p>
                            <p>CPA flow diagrams are very good for showing interdependent factors whose timings overlap or coincide. They also enable a plan to be scheduled according to a timescale. Critical Path Analysis flow diagrams also enable costing and budgeting, and help planners to identify causal elements.</p>

                            <p>The total cumulative time is 137 minutes. However, from the diagram the time taken is 126 minutes since laboratory and x-rays tests are done concurrently. Often, the patient does one as he is waiting for the results of the other procedure thereby saving on the time. This method therefore helps identify such activities and schedule to minimise the time of the project hence saving on project resources.</p>

                                        <p class="definition-text">Strategic planning is part of an organisation's activities. It is used to set priorities, focus energy and resources, strengthen operations, ensure that employees and stakeholders are working towards common goals, establish agreement around intended outcomes/results and assess and adjust the organisation's direction in response to a changing environment. This is done through establishing priorities, making of strategic choices, pulling the entire organisation together and providing an outline on the application of resources. The strategic plan focuses on the following:</p>
                                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                            <li><strong>Where we are now?</strong> This is based on a comprehensive assessment of the internal and external environment.</li>
                                            <li><strong>Where do we want to be?</strong> This is a picture (real or mental) of the desired future x number of years from now. What keeps us or might keep us from moving to where we want to be (obstacles)?</li>
                                            <li><strong>How can we address these obstacles or hindering forces?</strong> This is the thrust of the strategic plan.</li>
                                            <li><strong>How do we monitor our progress?</strong> This set parameters on how to measure gains to be made.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                        <p class="definition-text">Strategic plans can span anywhere from 3 to 25 years, depending on the level of the aspiration. It is more than a visionary document, broad enough to convey the desired future state, flexible to allow and accommodate changes over time.</p>

                                        <h4 class="definition-term">ii. Annual Operational Plans</h4>
                                        <p class="definition-text">An operational planning is a sub-set of strategic work planning. It describes short-term ways of achieving milestones and explains how, or what portion of a strategic plan will be put into operation during a given operational period in the case of commercial application, a fiscal year or another given budgetary term. An annual operational plan is the basis for, and justification of an annual operating budget request. Therefore, a five-year strategic plan would need five operational plans funded by five operating budgets.</p>
                                        <p class="definition-text">Annual operational plans describe the activities and required budgets for each part of the organisation for the next 1-3 years. They link the strategic plan with the activities the organisation will deliver and the resources required to deliver them. Annual plans can be tweaked and should especially as circumstances change, compile to the strategic plan.</p>
                                        <p class="definition-text">Annual operational plans draw directly from the strategic plans, programme missions and goals, objectives and activities. The annual operational plan is both the first and last step in preparing an operating budget request. As the first step, the annual operational plan provides a plan for resource allocation. As the last step, the annual operational plan may be modified to reflect policy decisions or financial changes made during the budget development process.</p>
                                        <p class="definition-text">Annual operational plans should be prepared by the people who will be involved in project implementation. There is often a need for significant cross-departmental dialogue as plans created by one part of the organisation inevitably have implications for other parts. Annual operational plans have the following sections:</p>
                                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                            <li>Objectives - sometimes divided among key organisational strategies;</li>

                                        <p class="definition-text">A department plan defines the goals and activities a department will undertake for a specified time period and may be included as a section in the organisation’s overall plan. The department plan is linked to the operation plan. It shows clear deliverables and output for the department. Because different departments have different responsibilities, the particular data needed for and useful in department business plans varies widely. The departmental plan may have the following sections:</p>
                                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                            <li>Mission and vision of the department;</li>

                                            <li>The goals of the department that derive from the mission, vision and analysis.</li>
                                            <li>Overall strategies, sometimes called strategic thrusts or directions;</li>

                                            <li>The budget to support the plan;</li>
                                            <li>The long term outlook.</li>

                                        <p class="definition-text">The individual plan has two component parts: the performance plan and a (professional) development plan. The individual plan, sometimes called a performance agreement, results from periodic conversations between the supervisor and employee for a particular performance management cycle. Once agreed, it is signed off by the functional head (or supervisor) to ensure that resource implications are taken into account (and provided). The individual plan link back to the departmental plan, and ultimately the organisation’s or agency’s strategic plan, with all plans adding up to create progress towards the vision within the confines of the mission. The individual development plan includes the following:</p>
