                                    <p>It is impossible to have a clean and sanitary environment without water. Water is necessary in promoting personal hygiene and in cleaning the environment. Without an adequate and wholesome water supply, health cannot be maintained.</p>

                                    <p>Water is essential for life. Man can live nearly two months without food, but can live only three or four days without water. In general 70% of human body weight is water and a human being needs two liters of water per day as minimum.</p>
                                </li>

                                    <p>It is essential to run industries. Nearly all modern industries are thirsty; they need water. For example:</p>
                                    <ul style="margin-top: 0.5rem; font-size: 0.9em;">
                                        <li>It takes about 10 liters of water to produce one litter of petrol.</li>
                                        <li>It takes about 600 liters of water to produce 1kg of woolen cloth.</li>
                                        <li>It takes about 3500 liters of water to produce 1kg of dry cement.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>

                                    <strong>Food Composition</strong>
                                    <p>Most of the foods that man eats contain water. For example:</p>
                                    <ul style="margin-top: 0.5rem; font-size: 0.9em;">
                                        <li>Milk contains about 88% water.</li>
                                        <li>Egg contains about 66% water.</li>
                                        <li>Fish are 80% water.</li>
                                        <li>Potatoes are 75% water.</li>
                                        <li>Beef is 77% water.</li>

                                    <p>It’s important for the balance in ecology (i.e. the balance in relationship between living things and the environment in which they live). All animal life depends directly or indirectly upon vegetation for food, and vegetation will not grow without water. Any break in this ecological chain can mean failure of the whole ecological system.</p>

                            <p>To protect well water from pollution and contamination:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list checklist">
                                <li>The well should be located on a higher level than possible sources of contaminants such as latrines and cesspits (a pit for collection of waste matter and water especially sewage).</li>
                                <li>This is because the liquid from the pit may seep into the surrounding ground and into the groundwater.</li>
                                <li>If the latrine is higher up a slope than the well then the contaminated groundwater is likely to flow downwards and into the well.</li>
                                <li>In normal soils, the minimum distance between the well and the source of contaminants should never be less than 15 metres and a distance of 30–50 m is recommended. However for limestone and some other soil formations this distance needs to be greater because groundwater can pass very easily through some rocks and soils.</li>
                                <li>The inside wall of the well should be made waterproof by constructing a well casing. In small diameter bored wells the casing can be a pipe, but in larger wells the casing needs to be constructed by cementing from the top of the well down to a minimum depth of 3 metres.</li>
                                <li>The casing of the well should also be extended for a minimum of 60 cm above the surrounding ground level to prevent the entrance of surface runoff.</li>
                                <li>A concrete cover should be fitted over the casing to prevent dust, insects, small animals and any other contaminants from falling in.</li>
                            </ul>

                                <li>A concrete waterproof protection box, also known as a spring box, should be constructed over the spring to prevent all actual and potential sources of contamination.</li>
                                <li>A retention wall in the front part of the protection box should be constructed to keep water flowing to the delivery pipe.</li>

                                <li>The spring and collection box, if there is one, should have a watertight top, preferably concrete. Water will move by gravity flow or by means of a properly-installed mechanical pump.</li>
                                <li>Springs should be protected from flooding and surface water pollution by constructing a deep <em>diversion ditch</em> above and around the spring.</li>
                                <li>The ditch should be constructed so it collects surface water running towards the spring and carries, or diverts, it away. It needs to be deep enough to carry all surface water away, even in a heavy rainstorm.</li>
                                <li>The surrounding area should be fenced to protect it from animals.</li>

                            <p><strong>Water pollution</strong> is the contamination of water bodies (example lakes, rivers, oceans and groundwater) by pollutants discharged directly or indirectly into water bodies without adequate treatment to remove harmful compounds.</p>
                            <p>Water Pollution—any chemical, biological, or physical change in water quality that has a harmful effect on living organisms or makes water unsuitable for desired uses.</p>

                            <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem;">Disease-causing agents</h4>
                            <p>(Pathogens) which include bacteria, viruses, protozoa and parasitic worms that enter water from domestic sewage and untreated human and animal wastes.</p>

                            <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem;">Oxygen depleting wastes</h4>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list compact">
                                <li>These are organic wastes that can be decomposed by aerobic (oxygen requiring) bacteria.</li>
                                <li>Large populations of bacteria use up the oxygen present in water to degrade these wastes. In the process this degrades water quality.</li>
                                <li>The amount of oxygen required to break down a certain amount of organic matter is called the biological oxygen demand (BOD).</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem;">Inorganic plant nutrients</h4>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list compact">
                                <li>These are water soluble nitrates and phosphates that cause excessive growth of algae and other aquatic plants.</li>
                                <li>The excessive growth of algae and aquatic plants due to added nutrients is called eutrophication.</li>
                                <li>They may interfere with the use of the water by clogging water intake pipes, changing the taste and odour of water and cause a buildup of organic matter.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem;">Water soluble inorganic chemicals</h4>
                            <p>Which are acids, salts and compounds of toxic metals such as mercury and lead. High levels of these chemicals can make the water unfit to drink, harm fish and other aquatic life, reduce crop yields and accelerate corrosion of equipment that use this water.</p>

                            <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem;">Sediment of suspended matter</h4>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list compact">
                                <li>These are insoluble particles of soil and other solids that become suspended in water.</li>
                                <li>This occurs when soil is eroded from the land.</li>
                                <li>High levels of soil particles suspended in water, interferes with the penetration of sunlight.</li>
                                <li>This reduces the photosynthetic activity of aquatic plants and algae disrupting the ecological balance of the aquatic bodies.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem;">Water soluble radioactive isotopes</h4>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list compact">
                                <li>These can be concentrated in various tissues and organs as they pass through food chains and food webs.</li>
                                <li>Ionizing radiation emitted by such isotopes can cause birth defects, cancer and genetic damage.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem;">Hot water</h4>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list compact">
                                <li>Hot water let out by power plants and industries that use large volumes of water to cool the plant result in rise in temperature of the local water bodies.</li>
                                <li>Thermal pollution occurs when industry returns the heated water to a water source.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem;">Organic chemicals</h4>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list compact">
                                <li>Which include oil, gasoline, plastics, pesticides, cleaning solvents, detergent and many other chemicals.</li>
                                <li>These are harmful to aquatic life and human health.</li>
                                <li>They get into the water directly from industrial activity either From improper handling of the chemicals in industries and more often from improper and illegal disposal of chemical wastes.</li>

                                <li>The control of pollution should ideally take place at the point of generation, or, in other words, it should be prevented at source.</li>
                                <li>The control of excess nutrients is an important issue both from a public health perspective and to keep natural waters free from eutrophication. Farmers may need guidance on good agricultural practices that will help reduce water pollution from agriculture.</li>
                                <li>Pollution prevention is best achieved by ensuring that each potential point source is properly sited, designed, constructed and managed.</li>
                                <li>Sources of pollution should be sited as far from water sources as possible (at least 15 m away) and below any water sources on the site.</li>
                                <li>Appropriate use of excreta disposal, solid waste disposal and animal waste disposal will help prevent contamination of both surface and groundwater.</li>
