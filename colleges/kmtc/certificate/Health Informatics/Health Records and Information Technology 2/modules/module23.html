                <div class="content-block">
                    <p>With good set of indicators available, the next step in the analysis process can take place.
                    Indicators represent numerical values which help provide insight into quality. They do not
                    however tell what these numerical values mean</p>
                    <p>To understand the meaning and significance of indicators, professional management engage in an
                    interpretation of those indicators. There are several methods of interpretation of health indicators,
                    but the basic concept is to compare the indicator with some other pieces of information. Such
                    comparison may be between the indicator and the population, geography, personnel or the
                    resources.</p>
                    <p>Any description of interpretation is likely to seem incomplete, this is because interpretation is
                    based on an analyzed thought process which is not mechanical procedures. It is a creative
                    process in which the health professional must pull together a diverse array of information in
                    trying to explain or make sense out of certain events. The health professional must always be
                    interposed between information and action.</p>
                    <p>Interpretation is a creative process with judgement made as to the relationship between various
                    elements of the situation. It is the creative process that forms the challenge that health
                    professional face.</p>
                    <p>Some forms of interpretation include;</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Trends</li>

                <h2>üìö Trend</h2>
                <div class="content-block">
                    <p>To determine the trend of an indicator, it is necessary to look at where there is a change in the
                    value of that indicator overtime. Generally the most important trends involves the determination
                    of patterns of change. The significance of trend is that they can be observed repeatedly. They
                    provide predictive value, i.e. they can be used to give advance notice that a set of events is likely
                    to occur. This help to give an early warning so that recourses can be prepared to meet the
                    problem or opportunities that those events may present.</p>

                    <p>Coverage refers to the proportion of the population which is actively reached by a particular
                    service provided by the health information. e.g. "coverage of antenatal care services‚Äù means the
                    % of pregnant women in the population who actively attend ANC and receive such services.</p>

                    <p>Utilization is useful in comparing the level of effort of different facility.</p>
                    <p>Utilization is an important interpretation of information when making decision about upgrading
                    facilities. Health posts may be recommended for upgrading to a health Centre if it can be shown
                    that utilization of the existing health post is large enough to justify its upgrading. Some health
                    Centre's can be recommended for down grading to a health post if their utilization is too small to
                    justify a health Centre.</p>
