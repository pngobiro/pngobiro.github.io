                        <li>Health information has been defined as, information about people's health and how the

                        <li>Health care information describes the incidence, prevalence and cause of major diseases.
                        It also tells us about the availability and effectiveness of curative services. e.g. the
                        hospital activity analysis can tell us how effective curative services are by looking at the
                        average length of stay and the status of the patient when being discharged</li>

                        <li>H.I.S is also being defined as a system that collects and represents health information that
