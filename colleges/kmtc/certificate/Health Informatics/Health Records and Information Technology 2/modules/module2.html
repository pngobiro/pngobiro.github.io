                <div class="content-block">
                    <p>In 1972 a committee including representatives from the ministry of health, the central bureau of
                    statistics and the attorney general chamber was formed. The task of this committee was to design
                    a health information system for Kenya.</p>
                    <p>A pilot project was designed and tested in 3 districts, Mombasa which represented an urban,
                    Kwale which represented peri-urban district and Kitui which represented rural district. The pilot
                    project was completed in 1976 and the following suggestions and recommendations were
                    adopted. One of the recommendations was to merge two units, the research and evaluation unit
                    of the division of family health and vital and health statistics units of the division of
                    communicable disease control into one entity the Health Information System.</p>
                    <p>Another recommendation was to develop a system of code numbers for the reporting forms</p>
                    <p>How were the code numbers of the reporting forms established?</p>
                    <p>In 1982, another committee of professionals was formed to investigate on the accuracy
                    and efficiency of all health data collection forms. The committee suggested a number of
                    changes and as a result, all officially approved forms were changed from MED to MOH
                    and were accompanied by a corresponding code numbers.</p>
                    <p>In 1984 the national policy on districts focus for rural development was initiated in
                    response to this new development. The ministry of health decentralizing health
                    information system offices in all districts would be processed.</p>

                <div class="content-block">
                    <p>There are various individuals and field staff who are involved in a typical health information

                    <ul>
                        <li>Families and communities</li>
                        <li>Field health workers such as public health technicians</li>

                    activities such as data collection and use. The people who work in the system at each level are
                    responsible for the completeness and accuracy of either the data they collect or the reports they

                <h2>üìö Uses of Health Information System</h2>
                <div class="content-block">
                    <p>H.I is one of the most essential components of health delivery system. It has numerous uses
                    including:-</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Parents use height and weight information to monitor nutritional status of their children.</li>
                        <li>Community groups use health information to identify and control environmental hazards</li>
                        <li>Health workers use such information to identify and screen persons who need treatment</li>
                        <li>Clinical staff use patients history to diagnose and treat individual health problems</li>
                        <li>Managers use information to maximize program effectiveness and efficiency</li>
                        <li>Administrators use information to identify health problems and audit the use of program
                        funds and other resources to justify expenditure and future funding.</li>
                        <li>Epidemic control units use information for disease surveillance</li>
                        <li>Donor agencies use information to compare alternative methods of health care delivery
                        and assess program effectiveness</li>
                        <li>International agencies use health information to monitor progress</li>
                        <li>Health workers use health information system to identify persons needing treatment and
                        follow up those who miss appointments and seek out those who may be candidates to
                        special services</li>
                        <li>Health information system help to evaluate the impact or input of programs of health</li>
                        <li>Health information helps the MoH to justify man power training and assess if there is
                        need to train more workers or employ more</li>
                        <li>Research purposes ‚Äì research is very vital function in health institutions. Analysis and
                        conclusions of proper research can come up with recommendations which can be a guide
                        to any changes concerning the ministry, health facilities or even the community involved</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Two principals need to be emphasized about health information collection and use</p>
                    <p>These are:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Data flows in systems and is made up of individuals and departments. If one unit is weak,
                        the entire system suffers.</li>
                        <li>Data collection is closely related to data use. Any improvement in the collection of data is
                        not enough without corresponding improvement in its use. Managers who use data are
                        more likely to encourage its collection. Health information is a vital resource for health
                        planning, implementation and evaluation.</li>
                        <li>Data users include everyone in health delivery system ranging from individual parents
                        and patients to national planners and international donor agencies. Uses of data likewise
                        range from monitoring of individual health and nutritional programs, evaluation and long
                        term policy development. It is absolutely essential to be selective and identify priority
                        areas for data collection, since data collection have limited capacity and data users have
                        limited interest.</li>

                <div class="content-block">
                    <p>HIS collects data from all possible sources that have a bearing on health in a systematic way.
                    The data is processed and turned into information that is used to plan and manage health
                    services efficiently. HIS therefore aims at providing adequate and timely information for the
                    determination of health policies and evaluation of health services and programs</p>
                    <p>The H.I.S should give:</p>
