                    <li>Data flow in HIS is bidirectional, from bottom-up for reporting and top-down for feedback and policy implementation.</li>
                    <li>An efficient HIS requires regular and continuous information flow to facilitate decision-making and policy formulation.</li>

                    <li>Inpatient health information systems focus on curative services, calculating statistics like bed occupancy, length of stay, and death rates to monitor hospital efficiency.</li>
                    <li>Outpatient health information systems track preventive and curative services from vertical programs such as KEPI, CDD, AIDS, STD, Laboratory, and MCH/FP, each potentially having its own subsystem.</li>
