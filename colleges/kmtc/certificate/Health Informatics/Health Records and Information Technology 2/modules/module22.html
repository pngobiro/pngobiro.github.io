                    <li>Significance of an indicator is judged by its relevance and utility in providing meaningful health insights, exemplified by comparing sex-disaggregated vs. weight-for-age indicators for children under five.</li>
                    <li>Validity of an indicator is assessed by its measurability and accurate quantification, illustrated by contrasting "poor health" vs. antenatal clinic attendance rates for pregnant women.</li>
                    <li>Reliability of an indicator is determined by its ability to be consistently and repeatedly quantified, demonstrated by comparing beliefs about immunization vs. immunization dropout rates.</li>
                    <li>Feasibility of an indicator relates to the practicality of data collection with available resources, exemplified by the challenges in measuring monthly infant mortality vs. seasonal outpatient attendance variations.</li>
                    <li>Key indicators are identified across major health program areas including Outpatient services, Inpatient services, Maternity and Child Health/Family Planning, Nutrition, Immunization, and Communicable Disease Control, each tailored to monitor specific program objectives and outcomes.</li>
