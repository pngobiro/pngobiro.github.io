                <div class="content-block">
                    <p>The population served by a health facility is called its catchment area population. ‚ÄúCatchment
                    area" is a term borrowed from geography to describe the land which collects rain water that flow
                    into rivers or lakes. Catchment area as applied to health facility means the area surrounding that
                    facility from which its patients come. We determine the catchment area population of a facility
                    by use of the latest national population census data.</p>

                <div class="content-block">
                    <p>The population at which a particular service is aimed at is considered as the target population for
                    that service. E.g. the target population for CWC is children < 5 years of age. The target
                    population of antenatal clinic is pregnant women. Determining the target population within a
                    catchment area can be estimated by using National Demographic Indicators.</p>

                <h2>üìö Utilization</h2>
                <div class="content-block">
                    <p>The number of patients attending a health facility to receive services is defined as the utilization
                    of the facility. The total utilization (patient‚Äôs visits for all services) cannot be expressed as a
                    figure for a certain period of time. Since health facilities report on monthly basis, it is possible to
                    determine the utilization of each facility for each month that has passed.</p>
                    <p>Utilization is useful in comparing the level of effort of different facility.</p>
                    <p>Utilization is an important interpretation of information when making decision about upgrading
                    facilities. Health posts may be recommended for upgrading to a health Centre if it can be shown
                    that utilization of the existing health post is large enough to justify its upgrading. Some health
                    Centre's can be recommended for down grading to a health post if their utilization is too small to
                    justify a health Centre.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Catchment area population refers to the population geographically served by a health facility, determined using census data and representing the community from which patients are drawn.</li>
                    <li>Catchment areas for health facilities are delineated based on geographical boundaries and population data to define service responsibility and coverage.</li>
                    <li>Target population is the specific demographic group a health service is designed to serve, such as children under 5 for CWC or pregnant women for antenatal care, identified using demographic indicators.</li>
                    <li>Utilization of a health facility is defined by the number of patients attending for services, measured monthly to assess service usage and compare facility efforts.</li>
                    <li>Utilization rates are crucial for decisions on upgrading or downgrading health facilities, reflecting service demand and justifying resource allocation adjustments.</li>
