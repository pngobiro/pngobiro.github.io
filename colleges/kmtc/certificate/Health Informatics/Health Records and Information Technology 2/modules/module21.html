                <div class="content-block">
                    <p>Each level of the health system that collects health information is required to perform an
                    appropriate degree of analysis of that information.</p>
                    <p>This analysis is performed for the purpose of monitoring the changing health needs of the
                    population and evaluating the effectiveness of health system in meeting those needs</p>
                    <p>Once the health information that has been collected is processed, the essential steps of analyzing
                    that information must be performed. Interpretive report is required</p>
                    <p>An interpretive report is an examination of the descriptive information with view towards
                    providing insight into how the information can be used to improve the health status of the
                    population and the services delivered to that population.</p>
                    <p>Interpretation of information gives managers ideas about collective action to take, how better to
                    display resources and how to make improvement in the structure and organization of their
                    operations.</p>
                    <p>Information collected, analyzed and interpreted need to be shared/ disseminated with colleagues
                    and other users of health information. Sharing of information can take place in three ways;</p>

                <h2>üìö GENERATING INDICATORS</h2>
                <div class="content-block">
                    <p>The steps of meaningful analysis of health information is to develop indicators:</p>
                    <p><b>INDICATORS:</b> are statistical values which give insight into the quality of health status or health
                    services</p>
                    <p>Indicators assist managers in making judgement of quality. Up to this point the data that has been
                    collected, reported and processed have provided a quantitative picture. What is needed now is to
                    see how this quantitative information gives insight into the qualitative nature of health status and
                    services. Developing the correct indicator helps this happen since many indicators can be
                    identified, it is necessary to select <b>Key Indicators</b>. Key indicators are the most important items
                    of data that allow managers to have rapid assessment of the health picture in their area</p>
