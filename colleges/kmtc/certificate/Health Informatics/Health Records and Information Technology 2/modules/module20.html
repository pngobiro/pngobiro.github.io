                        <li>Personal health
                            <p>Records are kept about individual patients during the course of their diagnosis and treatments or
                            when preventive services such as ante-natal or family planning services are provided to them.</p>

                        <li>Health status
                            <p>Through the aggregation of information, about diagnosis and death, a picture of the community's
                            morbidity and mortality can be acquired. This information is necessarily to assess the health
                            status of the population and whether their trend is developing.</p>

                            Information is required for research when new health problems confront the nation such as

                <h2>üìö CRITERIA FOR INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THE HEALTH INFORMATION</h2>
                <div class="content-block">
                    <p>The MoH will exercise its prerogative in judging whether items of health information are to be
                    included in the health information system. In general for a health information to be included, it
                    must be deemed to be of essential value in furthering the understanding of the overall health
                    picture of the nation.</p>
                    <p>The overall thrust of the policy is to limit the amount of information collected and reported so as
                    not to place an unmanageable burden on the personnel required to collect it.</p>
                    <p>The following criteria will be applied in determining whether to include items of information in
                    the health information system.</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Useful - the information must have value, facilitating the management of health services.</li>
                        <li>Ease of collection ‚Äì the information which is complicated or time consuming to collect
                        should be excluded. Even if the information in question has value, but places an
                        unordinary burden on health personnel to collect especially at the expense of the health
                        care activities it should not be included in the health information system</li>
                        <li>Quality of information ‚Äì information collected should be of high quality n measures
                        should be put in place to ensure the information meets the required standards</li>
                        <li>Meaningful ‚Äì the information must add significant meaning to the understanding of the
                        overall health pictures.</li>
                        <li>Utilization of information ‚Äì information which is collected and reported not utilized must
                        be excluded from the health information system. It happens that information piles in
                        offices without being utilized.</li>
                        <li>Who requires the information ‚Äì at issue here is whether the information is basically to
                        satisfy the needs of the nation or the needs of foreign donors. The health services must
                        not be "built‚Äù by donor organizations who requires excessive information connected with
                        funding.</li>
