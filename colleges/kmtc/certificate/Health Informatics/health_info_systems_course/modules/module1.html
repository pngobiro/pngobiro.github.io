                <h2>📚 Defining a Health Information System</h2>
                <div class="content-block">
                    <p>A health information system (HIS) is a comprehensive and integrated structure that collects, collates, analyzes, evaluates, stores, and disseminates health and health-related data and information for use by all stakeholders. It is designed to support evidence-based decision-making and improve the planning, management, and delivery of health services. This involves understanding several key terms.</p>

                    <h3>Health</h3>
                    <p>Health is defined as a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.</p>

                    <h3>Information</h3>
                    <p>Information is a collection of facts that have been processed into usable form, or processed data. This transforms raw data into actionable intelligence.</p>

                    <h3>System</h3>
                    <p>A system is a collection of units that form a body, or components that work together to achieve a common objective or goal.</p>

                     <h3>Health Information</h3>
                     <p>Health Information is information about the people’s health, including how communities, governments, and NGOs use this information to plan and provide quality health care services. It is also organized and interpreted data about health status, resources, activities, and events related to health. </p>

                     <h3>Information System</h3>
                     <p>An information system is an integrated set of components for collecting, processing, and storing data, and for delivering information, knowledge, and digital products. It's the entire infrastructure that collects, processes, stores, analyzes, and distributes information for a dedicated purpose.</p>

                    <h3>Health Information System</h3>
                   <p>A Health Information System is a comprehensive and integrated structure that collects, collates, analyzes, evaluates, stores, disseminates, health and health related data and information for use by all.</p>

                <h2>📚 Components of a Health Information System</h2>
                <div class="content-block">
                      <p>A Health Information System has several components which all contribute to its functioning:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li><strong>People:</strong> Those who collect, process, manage, and use the data (e.g., healthcare workers, administrators).</li>
                      <li><strong>Hardware:</strong> The physical devices used to input, process, store and output data (e.g. computers, printers).</li>
                      <li><strong>Networks:</strong>  The infrastructure that allows data to be transmitted (e.g., internet, intranet).</li>
                      <li><strong>Data:</strong> The raw facts and figures that are collected (e.g., patient records, survey responses).</li>
                      <li><strong>Software:</strong> The programs that are used to process and manage data (e.g. database management systems, spreadsheet programs).</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
            </section>

           <section class="content-section">
                <h2>📚 Concept of Health Information System</h2>
                <div class="content-block">
                     <p>A health information system is a structured method for collecting and processing data from diverse sources and using the information to guide policy-making and health service management. It can be paper-based or electronic. A national or county-level HIS combines data from various sources, including vital registrations, censuses, facility surveys, and individual records, aiming for efficient service management. Despite its critical role, current data sources can be fragmented, emphasizing the need to unify these diverse inputs into a cohesive system, often facilitated by tools like DHIS.</p>

                    <p>Health information management (HIM) is the practice of maintaining and caring for health records through both traditional paper methods and electronic systems. This is carried out in hospitals, clinics, health departments, and insurance companies, among other facilities. The widespread digitization of health records, along with health human resources information, and advancements in health informatics and health information technology are driving increased utilization of information management within the healthcare sector. This process involves systematic data collection, processing, and conversion into meaningful information for improved planning and management of health services.</p>

              <section class="content-section">
                <h2>📚 Historical Background of Health Information Systems</h2>
                <div class="content-block">
                     <p>Before independence, there was no formal structure to collect, collate analyze and disseminate health information. A committee of professionals was formed in 1972 to design a health Information System for Kenya. A pilot project was implemented and tested in three districts (Mombasa, Kitui, Kwale), which gave way to recommendations that were later adopted.</p>
                     <p>Key steps in the evolution of HIS include;</p>
                      <ul>
                      <li>Merging of Research and Evaluation Unit of the Division of Family Health and the Vital Statistics Unit of the Division of Communicable Disease control to form one entity of HIS.</li>
                       <li>Formation of committee to investigate the accuracy and efficiency of all health data collection forms in 1982 and a change from MED to MOH forms.</li>
                        <li>National policy on District Focus for Rural Development in 1984 leading to establishment of HIS offices in all districts.</li>
                        <li>Decentralization of HIS to Counties.</li>
                        <li>Establishment of the Kenya Health Policy Framework (KHPF) in 1994 which outlined areas which required immediate attention including integrated data collection and reporting.</li>
                        <li>Introduction of performance-based monitoring in the public sector.</li>
                         <li>Adoption of District Health Information System Software (DHIS) in 2010 which was web-based.</li>
                         <li>Formulation of HIS policy (2010-2030) and HMIS strategic plan (2009-2014).</li>
                      </ul>
                      <p>These developments are an attempt to ensure the highest health standards and HIS continues to play a key role.</p>

                <h2>📚 Introduction to HIS Policy</h2>
                <div class="content-block">
                     <p>The HIS policy is an expressing of the goals, priorities, and strategies for improving performance in the healthcare sector. It highlights the importance of performance measurements for insights into the effectiveness and efficiency of health services. The application of HIS is also expected to enhance accountability and provide a forum for learning from previous experiences.</p>
                     <p>Weaknesses identified in existing systems include:</p>
                     <ul>
                       <li>Lack of policy and guidelines.</li>
                       <li>Inadequate capacities of HIS staffs.</li>
                       <li>Unskilled personnel handling data.</li>
                       <li>Lack of integration.</li>
                        <li>Parallel data collection.</li>
                         <li>Poor coordination.</li>
                      </ul>
                      <p>The current HIS provides limited information for monitoring health goals and empowering communities with timely information on health.
                      </p>
                      <p>The development of this policy was as a result of teamwork and consultative process guided by specific principles that include:</p>
                      <ul>
                      <li>The need to establish simple, understandable and compatible system for tracking progress in healthcare.</li>
                      <li>The need for readily accessible, accurate and timely data for management and decision making.</li>
                       <li>The recognition of compulsory and comprehensive data reporting by all service providers.</li>
                      <li>The need to promote ethical consideration and data security.</li>
                      <li>The need to share information among stakeholders, establish clear support structures and use appropriate technologies.</li>
