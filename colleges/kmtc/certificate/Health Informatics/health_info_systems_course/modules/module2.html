                <p>The HIS Policy has a defined vision, mission and goals which guide its operations:</p>
                      <ul>
                      <li><strong>Vision:</strong> To be a center of excellence for quality health and health-related data and information for use by all.</li>
                       <li><strong>Mission:</strong> To provide timely, reliable, and accessible quality health information for evidence-based decision making to promote health.</li>
                         <li><strong>Goals:</strong> To enhance the availability of comprehensive quality health and health-related data and information for evidence-based decision-making.</li>
                      </ul>
                      <p>Objectives of a health information system are:</p>
                      <ol>
                         <li>Provide quantitative and qualitative data which is essential for identifying major programs.</li>
                         <li>Generate information to be used to evaluate health policies for planning health programs and efficient management of health services.</li>
                         <li>Open up continuous dialogue between those who collect and the users of the information with the aim of improving health services.</li>
                        <li>Disseminate timely information to users‚Äôe.g. researchers and health administrators.</li>
                        <li>Provide regular feedback to all personnel in the information system which helps to emphasize the important role each of them plays.</li>
                        <li>Create and maintain a health information data base at the Sub County.</li>

                     <p>Various individuals are involved in a typical HIS, playing different roles in the collection, management, and use of health data. These include:</p>
                     <ul>
                      <li>Families and communities.</li>
                      <li>Field health workers e.g. Public Health Officers etc.</li>

                <h2>üìö Different Systems within the HIS</h2>
               <div class="content-block">
                      <p>There are different systems within the HIS that cover different aspects of health information:</p>
                    <ol>
                      <li><strong>Inpatient Health Information System:</strong> This system collects information on curative services from patients admitted at the health facility. Information collected includes bed occupancy, patient turnover, average length of stay among others which are vital in monitoring the operational efficiency of the health facility.</li>
                      <li><strong>Outpatient Health Information System:</strong> This system collects information on preventive, curative, health promotion, and rehabilitative services from various programs. Each program (e.g., Immunization, Maternal Health) has its own information system which provides different health statistics.</li>
                      <li><strong>Management Information System:</strong> This system provides management-related data, including personnel data, facility information, and transportation system data.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Each of these system gives different health service statistics. For example from DVI we can get immunization coverage and number of mothers who have received tetanus toxoid. From lab we can get number of diagnostic investigations and from outpatient department we can get morbidity cases and number of attendance per health facility.</p>

                <h2>üìö Flow of Health Information</h2>
                <div class="content-block">
                       <p>The flow of health information follows a hierarchical structure. Data is collected at the lowest level (unit level), processed and analyzed at sub-county and county levels, then transmitted to the national level. Feedback is disseminated from the top down, ensuring data informs action at all levels.</p>
                      <ul>
                      <li><strong>Unit Level:</strong> This includes data collected from community units, usually submitted to health facilities like dispensaries.</li>
                      <li><strong>Sub-county Level:</strong> Data is submitted to the sub-county HRIO, then keyed into the KHIS (Kenya Health Information System).</li>
                      <li><strong>National Level:</strong> National level analyzes data and gives feedback to the county, who in turn gives feedback to the sub-county and finally the unit level.</li>
                      </ul>
                     <p>The flow of information follows a "bottom-top-bottom" pattern.</p>

                 <div class="content-block">
                       <p>The healthcare system in Kenya is structured into four tiers of care:</p>
                     <ol>
                        <li><strong>Tier 1: Community Level:</strong> This level is composed of community health units (CHUs), which operate within a defined geographical area, usually covering around 5,000 people, managed by a Community Health Committee and linked to a health facility.
                         <ul>
                             <li>Community Health Extension Workers (CHEWs) or Community Health Assistants (CHAs) supervise the community units.</li>
                             <li>Community units comprise of CHEW/CHA, CHW/CHV and CHC.</li>
                          </ul>
                          <p>Services available at this level include water and sanitation hygiene, maternal and child health advice, family planning, growth monitoring, deworming and first aid services.</p>
                        <li><strong>Tier 2: Primary Care Level:</strong> This includes dispensaries and health centers, providing basic outpatient health services and serving as the first line of contact with patients. Dispensaries are manned by nurses, while health centers are manned by clinical officers.</li>
                        <li><strong>Tier 3: County Level:</strong> This includes District and County hospitals which focus on delivery of healthcare services as well as generating their own expenditure plans.</li>
                         <li><strong>Tier 4: National Level:</strong> This comprises National teaching and referral hospitals which provide specialized services and often act as referral points for lower levels of care.</li>

                            <p>Solutions may vary. As an example, a small rural dispensary would fit in Tier 2. Personnel might include a nurse, a community health worker, and a health records officer. Data collected would be sent from the dispensary to the sub-county HRIO.</p>
