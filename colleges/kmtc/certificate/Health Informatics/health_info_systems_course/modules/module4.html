                <h2>📚 Defining Health Sector Indicators</h2>
                 <div class="content-block">
                   <p>Health sector indicators are statistical values used to measure progress and assess the quality of health services or health status. They are used to:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Provide insight into the quality of health services.</li>
                      <li>Measure changes over time.</li>
                      <li>Document change in specific conditions.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Indicators are intimately related to the activities and serve to define the magnitude of a problem. Developing indicators is a key step in health information analysis and this is done by reviewing the objectives of the various health programs.</p>
                   <p>Indicators should be clearly defined, measurable, and relevant to the objectives of a health program.</p>

                <h2>📚 Principles of Tally Sheets and Summary Forms</h2>
                 <div class="content-block">
                       <p>Tally sheets are working sheets on which data is recorded to facilitate ease of count during data summarization. Summary forms are used for reporting and are completed at specified periods using the tally sheets, registers or other source documents.</p>
                       <p>General guidelines for using these forms include:</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li>Ensuring that all identification particulars are filled in before completing the particular form.</li>
                         <li>Reporting specific ages within the appropriate age classification.</li>
                         <li>Filling appropriate data in forms where data is disaggregated by sex.</li>
                        <li>Separating new or first visits from revisits.</li>
                        <li>Aggregating totals where applicable.</li>
                            <li>Maintaining accuracy to avoid errors and transpositions.</li>
                            <li>Ensuring completeness (no blanks or dashes) and practicing zero reporting.</li>
                            <li>Filling in the name of the person preparing the report, date and a signature.</li>
                           <li>Submitting the completed reports to the District Health Information System (DHIS) before the 5th of the following month.</li>
                             <li>Districts must make summaries promptly once all reports have been received and maintain a checklist of reports and facilities to ensure timeliness and completeness</li>
                        </ul>
                      <p>Tally sheets are marked using forward slashes (killing one zero at ago for example 0) and are usually made immediately a clinician is through with a client before attending to the next one.</p>

                            <p>Solutions will vary.
