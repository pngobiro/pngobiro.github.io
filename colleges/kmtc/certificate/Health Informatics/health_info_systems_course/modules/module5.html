                <h2>📚 DHIS2 (District Health Information Software 2)</h2>
                <div class="content-block">
                      <p>DHIS2 is a web-based, free and open-source software developed by the University of Oslo that is used widely in low and middle income countries. It is used for collection, analysis and visualization of data.</p>
                    <p>Key features of DHIS2 include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>It supports the collection of many different data sets and easily expands to new data requirements.</li>
                          <li>It enables automated import from other systems.</li>
                           <li>It avoids duplication of data collection and storage.</li>
                           <li>It provides easy access to data for all online users.</li>
                           <li>It enables generation of reports for analysis and comparisons.</li>
                          <li>It can generate a variety of output formats.</li>
                      </ul>
                     <p>The system's reporting is categorized as standardized (one click) or dynamic- enhanced deep analysis. This allows for comparison across areas and over time.</p>
                      <p>To use DHIS2, you need a computer, internet connectivity and a web browser such as google chrome. </p>
                      <p>DHIS2 requires user credentials which includes; name, email, phone number, working location, job title and why they require access.</p>

           <section class="content-section">
                <h2>📚 DHIS2 Principles of Reporting</h2>
                 <div class="content-block">
                       <p>DHIS2 supports different reporting functions that include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Collection of data.</li>
                           <li>Running quality checks.</li>
                            <li>Data access at multiple levels.</li>
                             <li>Reporting.</li>
                            <li>Making graphs and maps.</li>
                            <li>Enabling comparison across time and space.</li>
                            <li>Showing trends.</li>
                        </ul>
                      <p>DHIS2 has two types of reports:</p>
                     <ol>
                         <li><strong>Standardized (One-Click) Reports:</strong> These include standard reports, dataset reports, reporting rate summaries, report tables and resources.</li>
                         <li><strong>Dynamic (Enhanced Deep Analysis):</strong> These include pivot tables, organization unit distribution reports and tally sheets.</li>
                     </ol>
                     <p>The benefits of using DHIS includes provision of a comprehensive HIS solution that is customized to different health needs and supports an integrated HIS at all levels. DHIS2 is user friendly as it allows customization and does not require any programming. It allows different kinds of data validation and has one-click reports that use charts and tables.</p>

                    <p>DHIS was introduced in Kenya in 2010 and the national roll out was from May to October 2011. This adoption was due to multiplicity of HIS/M&E systems, inability to authoritatively state the level of sector performance and difficulty in determining intra-district reporting rates. It also aimed at addressing limited analysis with conflicting statistics, limited capacity of excel based databases and the existing trust in the system.</p>

            <section class="content-section">
               <h2>📚 Electronic Medical Records (EMRs)</h2>
               <div class="content-block">
                      <p>EMRs are digital versions of patient’s paper charts which can enhance efficiency, reduce errors and improve patient care. EMRs provide authorized personnel access to patient and population level data and support efficient health delivery.</p>
                      <p>Key characteristics of EMRs include:</p>
                       <ul>
                            <li>It is a paperless, computerized system of maintaining patient data.</li>
                            <li>It aims to increase efficiency and reduce errors.</li>
                            <li>It can also be defined as a longitudinal collection of electronic health information that provides immediate, authorized access to person and population level data.</li>
                        </ul>
                     <p>Electronic Medical Record systems are increasingly being adopted in Kenya to improve medical record management, health program management, and the quality of patient care.
                     </p>
                     <p>Though EMRs have several advantages, their main challenges include high costs of setup, lack of standardization, computer viruses and low levels of literacy among users.</p>

           <section class="content-section">
                <h2>📚 Advantages and Disadvantages of EMRs</h2>
                 <div class="content-block">
                        <p>Benefits of using EMRs include:</p>
                       <ul>
                         <li>Saving money on storage and labor.</li>
                         <li>Enhancing patient safety by having access to complete patient history.</li>
                           <li>Easy retrieval of patient records.</li>
                           <li>Saving time by instant access to information and eliminating time wasted on paper records.</li>
                         <li>Improved communication and clarity by eliminating handwriting and typing.</li>
                           </ul>
                         <p>Some of the concerns include:</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li>Learning curve for users.</li>
                          <li>Lack of a universal system.</li>
                            <li>Concerns over data security.</li>
                           </ul>
                        <p>Despite these concerns, EMRs are becoming increasingly popular, requiring uniform data and systems. The government of Kenya has come up with guidelines and standards to promote use of EMRs.</p>

                <h2>📚 Geographic Information Systems (GIS)</h2>
                 <div class="content-block">
                       <p>GIS is a computer system that captures, stores, analyzes, and displays geographically referenced data. GIS integrates location data with information enabling visualization of trends in relation to place.</p>
                       <p>Key components of GIS include:</p>
                        <ul>
                           <li>Hardware (computers, printers, digitizers)</li>
                            <li>Software (database management systems, map digitizing systems)</li>
                             <li>Data (maps, reports)</li>
                           <li>People (data entry staff, surveyors)</li>
                          <li>Processes/Methods (overlaying, digital mapping)</li>
                        </ul>
                     <p>GIS is used to assimilate divergent data, understand spatial and non-spatial relations and visualize data for analysis. GIS aids in locating and monitoring trends, identifying areas of greatest health needs, planning interventions and monitoring change.</p>

                           <li><strong>Quantitative variables:</strong> Can be measured numerically, such as count data and height data. These can be further divided into discrete variables (measured as whole numbers) and continuous variables (measurements in between whole numbers).</li>
                        </ul>
                     <p>Data can be presented using Tables, Bar charts, Histograms, Line graphs, scatter plots and maps.</p>
                     <p>Other methods include pie charts, box plots, frequency polygons and survival curves</p>
                    <p>Presented data should be clear, meaningful, and easy to interpret. Effective visual displays avoid unnecessary or distracting features.</p>
