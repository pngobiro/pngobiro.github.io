                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>After the data has been collected, the researcher turns to the task of analyzing them. The
                            analysis of data requires a number of closely related operations such as establishment of
                            categories, the application of these categories to raw data through coding, tabulation and
                            then drawing statistical inferences.</p>

                        <p>The researcher should classify the raw data into some purposeful and usable categories.
                            Coding operation is usually done at this stage through which the categories of data are
                            transformed into symbols that may be tabulated and counted.</p>

                        <p>A great deal of data, especially in large inquiries, is tabulated by computers. Computers not
                            only save time but also make it possible to study large number of variables affecting a
                            problem simultaneously.</p>

                        <p>Analysis work after tabulation is generally based on the computation of various percentages,
                            coefficients, etc., by applying various well defined statistical formulae. In the process of
                            analysis, relationships or differences supporting or conflicting with original or new
                            hypotheses should be subjected to tests of significance to determine with what validity data
                            can be said to indicate any conclusion(s).</p>

                        <p>In brief, the researcher can analyze the collected data with the help of various statistical
                            measures.</p>

                        <p>After data analysis, the researcher is in a position to test the hypotheses, if any, that
                            he/she had formulated earlier.</p>

                        <p>In hypothesis testing the researcher finds out whether the facts from the analysis support
                            the hypotheses or they happen to be in contrary. Various tests, such as Chi-square test,
                            T-test, F-test, have been developed by statisticians for this purpose.</p>

                        <p>The hypotheses may be tested through the use of one or more of such tests depending upon the
                            nature and object of research inquiry. Hypothesis -testing will result in either accepting
                            the hypothesis or in rejecting it.</p>

                        <p>If the researcher had no hypotheses to start with, generalizations established on the basis
                            of data may be stated as hypotheses to be tested by subsequent researches in times to come.

                            ability to arrive at certain generalizations. If the researcher had no hypothesis to start
                            with, he/she might seek to explain his/her findings on the basis of some theory available,
                            this is known as interpretation. The process of interpretation may quite often trigger off
                            new questions which in turn may lead to further researches.</p>

                        <p>Data analysis methods and techniques are useful for finding insights in data, such as, facts,
                            and figures. The two primary methods for data analysis are qualitative data analysis
                            techniques and quantitative data analysis techniques.</p>

                        <p>These data analysis techniques can be used independently or in combination with the other to
                            help business leaders and decision-makers acquire business insights from different data
                            types.</p>

                        <h3>Quantitative data analysis</h3>
                        <p>Quantitative data analysis involves working with numerical variables including statistics,
                            percentages, calculations, measurements, and other data since the nature of quantitative
                            data is numerical.</p>

                        <p>Quantitative data analysis techniques typically include working with algorithms, mathematical
                            analysis tools, and software to manipulate data and uncover insights that reveal the
                            business value.</p>

                        <p>For example, a financial data analyst can change one or more variables on a company's Excel
                            balance sheet to project their employer's future financial performance.</p>

                        <p>Quantitative data analysis can also be used to assess market data to help a company set a
                            competitive price for its new product.</p>

                        <h3>Qualitative data analysis</h3>
                        <p>Qualitative data describes information that is typically non-numerical. The qualitative data
                            analysis approach involves working with unique identifiers, such as labels and properties,
                            and categorical variables, such as statistics, percentages, and measurements.</p>

                        <p>A data analyst may use firsthand or participant observation approaches, conduct interviews,
                            run focus groups, or review documents and artifacts in qualitative data analysis.</p>

                        <p>Qualitative data analysis can be used in various business processes, for example, qualitative
                            data analysis techniques are often part of the software development process.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Data can be presented in one of the three ways:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>As text</li>
                            <li>In tabular form;</li>
                            <li>In graphical form.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>Methods of presentation must be determined according to the data format, the method of
                            analysis to be used, and the information to be emphasized.</p>

                        <p>Inappropriately presented data fail to clearly convey information to readers and reviewers.
                            Even when the same information is being conveyed, different methods of presentation must be
                            employed depending on what specific information is going to be emphasized.</p>

                        <p>A method of presentation must be chosen after carefully weighing the advantages and
                            disadvantages of different methods of presentation.</p>

                        <h3>a) Text presentation</h3>
                        <p>Text is the method used to explain results and trends, and provide contextual information.
                            Data are fundamentally presented in paragraphs or sentences.</p>

                        <p>Text can be used to provide interpretation or emphasize certain data. If quantitative
                            information to be conveyed consists of one or two numbers, it is more appropriate to use
                            written language than tables or graphs.</p>

                        <h3>b) Table Presentation</h3>
                        <p>Tables are the most appropriate for presenting individual information, and can present both
                            quantitative and qualitative information. The strength of tables is that they can accurately
                            present information that cannot be presented with a graph.</p>

                        <p>Another advantage of tables is that information with different units can be presented
                            together. For instance, blood pressure, heart rate, number of drugs administered, and
                            anesthesia time can be presented together in one table.</p>

                        <p>Tables are useful for summarizing and comparing quantitative information of different
                            variables.</p>

                        <p>However, the interpretation of information takes longer in tables than in graphs, and tables
                            are not appropriate for studying data trends.</p>

                        <h3>c) Graph Presentation</h3>
                        <p>Graphs simplify complex information by using images and emphasizing data patterns or trends,
                            and are useful for summarizing, explaining, or exploring quantitative data.</p>

                        <p>Graphs are effective for presenting large amounts of data and can be used in place of tables
                            to present small sets of data.</p>

                        <p>A graph format that best presents information must be chosen so that readers and reviewers
                            can easily understand the information.</p>

                        <h3>i) Bar graph</h3>
                        <p>A bar graph is used to indicate and compare values in a discrete category or group, and the
                            frequency or other measurement parameters (i.e. mean).</p>

                        <p>Depending on the number of categories, and the size or complexity of each category, bars may
                            be created vertically or horizontally.</p>

                        <p>The height (or length) of a bar represents the amount of information in a category.</p>

                        <p>Bar graphs are flexible, and can be used in a grouped or subdivided bar format in cases of
                            two or more data sets in each category.</p>

                        <h3>ii) Histogram</h3>
                        <p>A histogram is a graphical display of data using bars of different heights. In a histogram,
                            each bar groups numbers into ranges. Taller bars show that more data falls in that range. A
                            histogram displays the shape and spread of continuous sample data</p>

                        <p>A histogram displays the single quantitative variable along the x axis and frequency of that
                            variable on the y axis.</p>

                        <h3>iii) Pie Chart</h3>
                        <p>A pie chart is a type of graph in which a circle is divided into sectors where each sector
                            represents a proportion of the whole.</p>

                        <p>Pie charts are a useful way to organize data in order to see the size of components relative
                            to the whole, and are particularly good at showing percentage or proportional data.</p>

                        <p>While pie charts are popular data representations, they can be hard to read, and it can be
                            difficult to compare data from one pie chart to another. They are a useful way to visualize
                            information that might be presented in a small table.</p>
