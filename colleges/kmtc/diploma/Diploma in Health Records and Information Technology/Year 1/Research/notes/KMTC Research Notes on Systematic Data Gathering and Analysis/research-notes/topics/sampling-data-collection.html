                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>All the items under consideration in any field of inquiry or during a particular research is
                            known as the target population.</p>

                        <p>It's not possible to consider the whole population during the study or research due to much
                            time and high cost that come along with, therefore it's important for the researcher to
                            select part of the population (sample) for the study purpose. The items so selected
                            constitute what is technically called sample.</p>

                        <p>The researcher must decide the way of selecting a sample or what is popularly known as the
                            sample design. In other words, a sample design is a definite plan determined before any data
                            is actually collected for obtaining a sample from a given population.</p>

                        <p>Samples can be either probability samples or nonprobability samples. With probability samples
                            each element has a known probability of being included in the sample but the non-probability
                            samples do not allow the researcher to determine this probability.</p>

                        <p>Probability samples are those based on simple random sampling, systematic sampling,
                            stratified sampling, cluster/area sampling whereas non-probability samples are those based
                            on convenience sampling, judgment sampling and quota sampling techniques.</p>

                        <p>A brief mention of the important sample designs in research is as follows:</p>

                        <h3>i) Deliberate Sampling and Judgment Sampling</h3>
                        <p>Deliberate sampling is also known as purposive or nonprobability sampling. This sampling
                            method involves purposive or deliberate selection of particular units of the universe
                            (items) for constituting a sample which represents the universe (target population). When
                            population elements are selected for inclusion in the sample based on the ease of access, it
                            can be called convenience sampling.</p>

                        <p>On the other hand, in judgment sampling the researcher's judgment is used for selecting items
                            which he/she considers as representative of the population. For example, a judgment sample
                            of college students might be taken to secure reactions to a new method of teaching. Judgment
                            sampling is used quite frequently in qualitative research where the desire happens to be to
                            develop hypotheses rather than to generalize to larger populations.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h3>ii) Simple Random Sampling</h3>
                        <p>This type of sampling is also known as chance sampling or probability sampling where each and
                            every item in the population has an equal chance of inclusion in the sample and each one of
                            the possible samples, in case of finite universe, has the same probability of being
                            selected.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h3>iii) Systematic Sampling</h3>
                        <p>In this type of sampling a particular pattern is adopted to select items from the population
                            for study or research.</p>

                        <p>An element of randomness is usually introduced into this kind of sampling using random
                            numbers to pick up the unit with which to start. This procedure is useful when sampling
                            frame is available in the form of a list. In such design the selection process starts by
                            picking some random point in the list and then every $\mathrm{n}^{\text {th }}$ element is
                            selected until the desired number is secured.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h3>iv) Stratified Sampling</h3>
                        <p>If the population from which a sample is to be drawn does not constitute homogeneous group,
                            then stratified sampling technique is applied so as to obtain representative sample.</p>

                        <p>In this technique, the population is stratified into a number of nonoverlapping
                            subpopulations or strata and sample items are selected from each stratum. If the items
                            selected from each stratum is based on simple random sampling the entire procedure, first
                            stratification and then simple random sampling, is known as stratified random sampling.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h3>v) Quota Sampling</h3>
                        <p>In stratified sampling the cost of taking random samples from individual strata is often
                            expensive that interviewers are simply given quota to be filled from different strata, the
                            actual selection of items for sample being left to the interviewer judgment, this is called
                            quota sampling. The size of the quota for each stratum is generally proportionate to the
                            size of that stratum in the population. Quota sampling is thus an important form of
                            non-probability sampling. Quota samples generally happen to be judgment samples rather than
                            random samples.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h3>vi) Cluster Sampling and Area Sampling</h3>
                        <p>Cluster sampling involves grouping the population into clusters and then selecting the groups
                            or the clusters rather than individual elements for inclusion in the sample.</p>

                        <p>The clustering approach can make the sampling procedure relatively easier and increase the
                            efficiency of field work, especially in the case of personal interviews.</p>

                        <p>Area sampling is quite close to cluster sampling and is often considered when the total
                            geographical area of interest happens to be big. Under area sampling, the total area is
                            divided into a number of smaller nonoverlapping areas, generally called geographical
                            clusters, then a number of these smaller areas are randomly selected, and then all units or
                            items in those small areas are included in the sample.</p>

                        <p>Area sampling is especially helpful where there is no list of the population concerned. It
                            also makes the field interviewing more efficient since interviewer can do many interviews at
                            each location.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h3>vii) Multi-stage Sampling</h3>
                        <p>This is a further development of the idea of cluster sampling and the technique is meant for
                            big inquiries extending to a considerably large geographical area like an entire country.
                        </p>

                        <p>Under multi-stage sampling the first stage may be to select large primary sampling units such
                            as county, then districts, then towns and finally certain families within towns. If the
                            technique of random sampling is applied at all stages, the sampling procedures described as
                            multi-stage random sampling.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h3>viii) Sequential Sampling</h3>
                        <p>This is sample design where the ultimate size of the sample is not fixed in advance but is
                            determined according to mathematical decisions on the basis of information yielded as survey
                            progresses.</p>

                        <p>The design is usually adopted under acceptance sampling plan in the context of statistical
                            quality control.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>In dealing with any real life problem it is often found that data/information at hand is
                            inadequate, and hence, it becomes necessary to collect data that is appropriate.</p>

                        <p>There are several ways of collecting the appropriate data which differ considerably in
                            context of costs, time and other resources at the disposal of the researcher.</p>

                        <p>Primary data can be collected either through experiment or through survey. If the researcher
                            conducts an experiment, he/she observes some quantitative measurements, or the data with the
                            help of which he/she examines the truth contained in his hypothesis. In the case of a
                            survey, data can be collected by one or more of the following methods:</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h3>i) By Observation</h3>
                        <p>This method implies the collection of information through investigator's own observation,
                            without interviewing the respondents. The information/data obtained relates to what is
                            currently happening and is not complicated by either the past behavior or future intentions
                            or attitudes of respondents.</p>

                        <p>The method is no doubt an expensive method and the information provided by this method is
                            also very limited. As such this method is not suitable in inquiries where large samples are
                            concerned.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h3>ii) Through Personal Interview</h3>
                        <p>In this method, the investigator/researcher follows a rigid procedure and seeks answers to a
                            set of pre-conceived questions through personal interviews.</p>

                        <p>This method of collecting data is usually carried out in a structured way where output
                            depends upon the ability of the interviewer to a large extent.</p>

                        <h3>iii) Through Telephone Interviews</h3>
                        <p>Telephone Interview is a method of collecting information/data which involves contacting the
                            respondents on telephone for data acquisition/gathering. This method is not widely used but
                            it plays an important role in industrial surveys in developed regions, particularly when the
                            survey has to be accomplished in a very limited time.</p>

                        <h3>iv) By Mailing of Questionnaires</h3>
                        <p>The researcher and the respondents do come in contact with each other (either over the phone
                            or physical contact) if this method of survey is adopted.</p>

                        <p>Questionnaires are mailed to the respondents with a request to be returned after being filled
                            by the respondent. Collection of the filled questionnaires is done by the researcher. It is
                            the most extensively used method in various economic and business surveys.</p>

                        <p>Before applying this method, usually a Pilot Study for testing the questionnaire is
                            conducted; this reveals the weaknesses, if any, of the questionnaire to enhance correction
                            before the final questionnaire is mailed to the respondent.</p>

                        <p>Data/information is collected by filling up the schedules; this is done by enumerators on the

                        <p>Some occasional field checks on the work of the enumerators may ensure sincere work.</p>

                            <p>The researcher should select one of these methods of collecting data taking into
                                consideration the nature of investigation, objective and scope of the inquiry/research,
                                financial resources, available time and the desired degree of accuracy.</p>
                            <p>Though the researcher should pay attention to all these factors but much depends upon the
                                ability and experience of the researcher. In this context D.r ALGOL remarks that in the
                                collection of statistical data common sense is the chief requisite and experience is the
                                chief teacher.</p>

                        <p>Execution of the project is a very important step in the research process. When the execution
                            of the project proceeds on correct lines, the data to be collected would be adequate and
                            dependable. The researcher should see that the project is executed in a systematic manner
                            and in time. If the survey is to be conducted by means of structured questionnaires, data
                            can be readily machine processed. In such a situation, questions as well as the possible
                            answers may be coded.</p>

                        <p>If the data is to be collected through interviewers, arrangements should be made for proper
                            selection and training of the interviewers.</p>

                        <p>In other words during project execution, steps should be taken to ensure that the survey is
                            under statistical control so that the collected information/data is in accordance with the
                            pre-defined standard of accuracy.</p>
