\section*{INTRODUCTION TO RESEARCH}

Research may be very broadly defined as systematic gathering of data and information and its analysis for advancement of knowledge in any subject.

Research is an academic activity and as such the term should be used in a technical Sense.

According to Clifford Woody research comprises defining and redefining problems, formulating hypothesis or suggested solutions; collecting, organizing and evaluating data; making deductions and reaching conclusions; and at last carefully testing the conclusions to determine whether they fit the formulating hypothesis.
D. Steiner and M. Stephenson in the Encyclopedia of Social Sciences define research as "the manipulation of things, concepts or symbols for the purpose of generalizing to extend, correct or verify knowledge, whether that knowledge aids in construction of theory or in the practice of an art."

In summary the term 'research' refers to the systematic method consisting of identifying the problem, formulating a hypothesis, collecting the data, analyzing the data and reaching certain conclusions either in the form of solutions towards the concerned problem or in certain generalizations for some theoretical formulation.

\section*{Purpose/Objectives of Research}
i) To gain familiarity with a phenomenon or to achieve new insights into it. (Studies with this object in view are termed as exploratory or formulative research studies).
ii) To portray accurately the characteristics of a particular individual, situation or a group. (Studies with this object in view are known as descriptive research studies).
iii) To determine the frequency with which something occurs or with which it is associated with something else. (Studies with this object in view are known as diagnostic research studies).k
iv) To test a hypothesis of a causal relationship between variables. (Such studies are known as hypothesis-testing research studies)
v) To enable development of new theories (making discoveries)
vi) To enable the prediction of future outcome of a phenomenon.

\section*{Types of Research}

Research is broadly categorized into social research and scientific research.

Social research is used to investigate the behavior of humans in the social life and is either qualitative or quantitative or both. Qualitative approach can be seen in participant observation, communication with research participants. Furthermore, social research looks deep into human nature and analyzes social phenomena. The social scientist or
researcher take a sample of population and investigate data and later on form a general theory based on the analyzed data.

Scientific research is connected with natural sciences like physics, biology and chemistry. In scientific research scientists try to generate new knowledge by investigating the phenomenon using empirical and measurable techniques. Scientific researches follow measurable analytical method and the specialty is that anybody can repeat the same research anytime.

Social and scientific researches are further classified into the following types;
i) Descriptive and Analytical Research
ii) Applied and Fundamental Research
iii) Qualitative and Quantitative Research
iv) Conceptual and Empirical Research

Descriptive research concentrates on finding facts to ascertain the nature of something as it exists. In contrast analytical research is concerned with determining validity of hypothesis based on analysis of facts collected.

Applied research is carried out to find answers to practical problems to be solved and as an aid in decision making in different areas including product design, process design and policy making. Fundamental research is carried out as more to satisfy intellectual curiosity, than with
the intention of using the research findings for any immediate practical application.

Qualitative research studies such aspects of the research subjects which are not quantifiable, and hence not subject to measurement and quantitative analysis. In contrast quantitative research makes substantial use of measurements and quantitative analysis techniques.

Conceptual research involves investigation of thoughts and ideas and developing new ideas or interpreting the old ones based on logical reasoning. In contrast empirical research is based on firm verifiable data collected by either observation of facts under natural condition or obtained through experimentation.
V) All other types of research are variations of one or more of the above stated approaches, based on either the purpose of research, or the time required to accomplish research, on the environment in which research is done, or on the basis of some other similar factor.

Research can be field-setting research or laboratory research or simulation research, depending upon the environment in which it is to be carried out. Research can as well be understood as clinical or diagnostic research. Such research follow case-study methods or in depth approaches to reach the basic causal relations and the studies usually go deep into the causes of things or events that interest us, using very small samples and very deep probing data gathering devices.

\section*{Research Approaches}

The two basic approaches to research are quantitative approach and the qualitative approach.

Quantitative approach can be further sub-classified into inferential, experimental and simulation approaches to research. The purpose of inferential approach to research is to form a data base from which to infer characteristics or relationships of population. This usually means survey research where a sample of population is studied (questioned or observed) to determine its characteristics, and it is then inferred that the population has the same characteristics.

Experimental approach is characterized by much greater control over the research environment and in this case some variables are manipulated to observe their effect on other variables.

Simulation approach involves the construction of an artificial environment within which relevant information and data can be generated. This permits an observation of the dynamic behavior of a system (or its sub-system) under controlled conditions.

The term 'simulation' in the context of business and social sciences applications refers to "the operation of a numerical model that represents the structure of dynamic process. Simulation approach can also be useful in building models for understanding future conditions.

Qualitative approach to research is concerned with subjective assessment of attitudes, opinions and behavior. Research in such a situation is a function of researcher's insights and impressions. Such an approach to research generates results either in non-quantitative form or in the form which are not subjected to rigorous quantitative analysis.

\section*{Research Methods and Methodology}

Research methods or techniques refer to the methods that the researchers use in performing research operations or conducting a research.

Research methodology is a way to systematically solve the research problem or may be understood as a science of studying how research is done scientifically.

In it we study the various steps that are generally adopted by a researcher in studying his/her research problem along with the logic behind them.

Researchers not only need to know how to develop certain indices or tests, how to calculate the mean, the mode, the median or the standard deviation or chi-square, how to apply particular research techniques, but they also need to know which of these methods or techniques are relevant and which are not, and meaning / indications based on their research topic.

Researchers also need to understand the assumptions underlying various techniques and the criteria by which they can decide the certain techniques and procedures will be applicable to certain problems and others will not. Therefore it is necessary for the researcher to design their methodology based on their research problems as the same may differ from one problem to problem.

\section*{Research Process}

Research process consists of series of actions or steps necessary to effectively carry out research and the desired sequencing of these steps. The chart below indicates the research process which consists of a number of closely related activities as shown through I to VII. But such activities overlap continuously rather than following a strictly prescribed sequence.

Where (F) = reed back (Helps in controlling the sub-system) to which it is transmitted)
(F) = feed forward (Serves the vital function of providing cirieria for evaluation)

Research process therefore involves the following steps;
1. Formulating the research problem;
2. Extensive literature survey
3. Developing the hypothesis
4. Preparing the research design
5. Determining sample design
6. Collecting the data
7. Execution of the project
8. Analysis of data
9. Hypothesis testing
10. Generalizations and interpretation
11. Preparation of the report

\section*{Formulating the Research Problem}

A research problem is the situation that causes the researcher to feel apprehensive and not at ease. It is what makes the researcher to conduct/carry out a research.

There are two types of research problems i.e. those which relate to states of nature and those that relate to relationships between variables.

The researcher must single out the problem he/she wants to study, i.e., he/she must decide the general area of interest or aspect of a subjectmatter that he/she would like to inquire into.

\section*{Techniques Involved in Defining a Research Problem}

\section*{i) State the problem in a general way}

The researcher should state the problem in general terms with respect to some practical, scientific or intellectual interest. In this, the researcher may do a study concerning subject matter or seek guidance from the experts.

The problem stated should also be checked for ambiguity and feasibility.

\section*{ii) Understand the Nature of the Problem}

The researcher needs to discuss the problem with those related to the subject matter in order to clearly understand the origin of the problem, its nature, objectives, and the environment in which the problem is to be studied.

\section*{iii) Survey the Available Literature}

All available literature including relevant theories, reports, records, and other relevant documents on the problem needs to be reviewed and examined. This would help the researcher to identify the data available, the techniques that might be used, types of difficulties that may be
encountered during the study, possible analytical shortcomings, and even new methods of approach to the present problem.

\section*{iv) Holding Discussions for Developing Ideas}

The researcher may discuss the problem with his/her colleagues and others related to the concerned subject. This helps the researcher to generate new ideas, identify different aspects on the problem, gain suggestions and advices from others, and sharpen his/her focus on certain aspects within the field.

However, discussions should not be limited to the problem only, but should also be related to the general approach to the problem, techniques that might be used, possible solutions, etc.

\section*{v) Rephrase The Research Problem into A working Proposition}

Finally, the researcher must rephrase the problem into a working proposition.

Rephrasing the problem means putting the problem in specific terms that is feasible and may help in the development of working hypotheses.

N/B: Once the researcher has gone through the above steps systematically, it is easy to rephrase the problem into analytical and operational terms.

\section*{Extensive Literature Survey}

Once the problem is formulated, the researcher should undertake extensive literature survey connected with the problem.

Academic journals, conference proceedings, government reports and books are part of the sources of literature survey depending on the nature of the problem.

In the process of literature survey, it should be remembered that one source will lead to another. The earlier studies (researches) if available, which are similar to the study or research being carried out should be carefully studied. A good library will be a great help to the researcher at this stage.

\section*{Development of Working Hypotheses}

After extensive literature survey, researcher should state in clear terms the working hypothesis or hypotheses of the research topic they are undertaking.

Working hypothesis is a tentative assumption made in order to draw out and test its logical or empirical consequences. As such the manner in which research hypotheses are developed is particularly important since they provide the focal point for research. Hypothesis should be very specific and limited to the research at hand because it has to be tested. The role of the hypothesis is to guide the researcher by delimiting the area of research and to keep them on the right track. It also indicates the type of data required and the type of methods of data analysis to be used.

Therefore, working hypotheses arise as a result of a-prior thinking about the subject, examination of the available data and material including related studies and the counsel of experts and interested parties .Working hypotheses are more useful when stated in precise and clearly defined terms.

\section*{Preparing the Research Design}

The research problem having been formulated in clear cut terms, the researcher will be required to prepare a research design, i.e., will have to state the conceptual structure within which research would be conducted.

The preparation of such a design facilitates research to be as efficient as possible yielding maximum information.

In other words, the function of research design is to enable the collection of relevant information/data with minimal expenditure of effort, time and money. All these can be achieved depending mainly on the research purpose which is categorized into; Exploration, description, diagnosis, and experimentation purposes.

There are several research designs, such as, experimental and nonexperimental hypothesis testing. Experimental designs can be either informal designs or formal designs (such as completely randomized design, randomized block design, Latin square design, simple and
complex factorial designs), out of which the researcher must select one for his own project.

\section*{Determining Sample Design}

All the items under consideration in any field of inquiry or during a particular research is known as the target population.

It's not possible to consider the whole population during the study or research due to much time and high cost that come along with, therefore it's important for the researcher to select part of the population (sample) for the study purpose. The items so selected constitute what is technically called sample.

The researcher must decide the way of selecting a sample or what is popularly known as the sample design. In other words, a sample design is a definite plan determined before any data is actually collected for obtaining a sample from a given population.

Samples can be either probability samples or nonprobability samples. With probability samples each element has a known probability of being included in the sample but the non-probability samples do not allow the researcher to determine this probability.

Probability samples are those based on simple random sampling, systematic sampling, stratified sampling, cluster/area sampling whereas
non-probability samples are those based on convenience sampling, judgment sampling and quota sampling techniques.

A brief mention of the important sample designs in research is as follows:

\section*{i) Deliberate Sampling and Judgment Sampling}

Deliberate sampling is also known as purposive or nonprobability sampling. This sampling method involves purposive or deliberate selection of particular units of the universe (items) for constituting a sample which represents the universe (target population). When population elements are selected for inclusion in the sample based on the ease of access, it can be called convenience sampling.

On the other hand, in judgment sampling the researcher's judgment is used for selecting items which he/she considers as representative of the population. For example, a judgment sample of college students might be taken to secure reactions to a new method of teaching. Judgment sampling is used quite frequently in qualitative research where the desire happens to be to develop hypotheses rather than to generalize to larger populations.

\section*{ii) Simple Random Sampling}

This type of sampling is also known as chance sampling or probability sampling where each and every item in the population has an equal chance of inclusion in the sample and each one of the possible samples, in case of finite universe, has the same probability of being selected.

\section*{iii) Systematic Sampling}

In this type of sampling a particular pattern is adopted to select items from the population for study or research.

An element of randomness is usually introduced into this kind of sampling using random numbers to pick up the unit with which to start. This procedure is useful when sampling frame is available in the form of a list. In such design the selection process starts by picking some random point in the list and then every $\mathrm{n}^{\text {th }}$ element is selected until the desired number is secured.

\section*{iv) Stratified Sampling}

If the population from which a sample is to be drawn does not constitute homogeneous group, then stratified sampling technique is applied so as to obtain representative sample.

In this technique, the population is stratified into a number of nonoverlapping subpopulations or strata and sample items are selected from each stratum. If the items selected from each stratum is based on simple random sampling the entire procedure, first stratification and then simple random sampling, is known as stratified random sampling.

\section*{v) Quota Sampling}

In stratified sampling the cost of taking random samples from individual strata is often expensive that interviewers are simply given quota to be filled from different strata, the actual selection of items for sample being left to the interviewer judgment, this is called quota sampling. The size of the quota for each stratum is generally proportionate to the size of that stratum in the population. Quota sampling is thus an important form of non-probability sampling. Quota samples generally happen to be judgment samples rather than random samples.

\section*{vi) Cluster Sampling and Area Sampling}

Cluster sampling involves grouping the population into clusters and then selecting the groups or the clusters rather than individual elements for inclusion in the sample.

The clustering approach can make the sampling procedure relatively easier and increase the efficiency of field work, especially in the case of personal interviews.

Area sampling is quite close to cluster sampling and is often considered when the total geographical area of interest happens to be big. Under area sampling, the total area is divided into a number of smaller nonoverlapping areas, generally called geographical clusters, then a number of these smaller areas are randomly selected, and then all units or items in those small areas are included in the sample.

Area sampling is especially helpful where there is no list of the population concerned. It also makes the field interviewing more efficient since interviewer can do many interviews at each location.

\section*{vii) Multi-stage Sampling}

This is a further development of the idea of cluster sampling and the technique is meant for big inquiries extending to a considerably large geographical area like an entire country.

Under multi-stage sampling the first stage may be to select large primary sampling units such as county, then districts, then towns and finally certain families within towns. If the technique of random sampling is applied at all stages, the sampling procedures described as multi-stage random sampling.

\section*{viii) Sequential Sampling}

This is sample design where the ultimate size of the sample is not fixed in advance but is determined according to mathematical decisions on the basis of information yielded as survey progresses.

The design is usually adopted under acceptance sampling plan in the context of statistical quality control.

\section*{Collecting the Data}

In dealing with any real life problem it is often found that data/information at hand is inadequate, and hence, it becomes necessary to collect data that is appropriate.

There are several ways of collecting the appropriate data which differ considerably in context of costs, time and other resources at the disposal of the researcher.

Primary data can be collected either through experiment or through survey. If the researcher conducts an experiment, he/she observes some quantitative measurements, or the data with the help of which he/she examines the truth contained in his hypothesis. In the case of a survey, data can be collected by one or more of the following methods:

\section*{i) By Observation}

This method implies the collection of information through investigator's own observation, without interviewing the respondents. The information/data obtained relates to what is currently happening and is not complicated by either the past behavior or future intentions or attitudes of respondents.

The method is no doubt an expensive method and the information provided by this method is also very limited. As such this method is not suitable in inquiries where large samples are concerned.

\section*{ii) Through Personal Interview}

In this method, the investigator/researcher follows a rigid procedure and seeks answers to a set of pre-conceived questions through personal interviews.

This method of collecting data is usually carried out in a structured way where output depends upon the ability of the interviewer to a large extent.

\section*{iii) Through Telephone Interviews}

Telephone Interview is a method of collecting information/data which involves contacting the respondents on telephone for data acquisition/gathering. This method is not widely used but it plays an important role in industrial surveys in developed regions, particularly when the survey has to be accomplished in a very limited time.

\section*{iv) By Mailing of Questionnaires}

The researcher and the respondents do come in contact with each other (either over the phone or physical contact) if this method of survey is adopted.

Questionnaires are mailed to the respondents with a request to be returned after being filled by the respondent. Collection of the filled questionnaires is done by the researcher. It is the most extensively used method in various economic and business surveys.

Before applying this method, usually a Pilot Study for testing the questionnaire is conducted; this reveals the weaknesses, if any, of the
questionnaire to enhance correction before the final questionnaire is mailed to the respondent.

N/B: Questionnaires to be used must be well prepared to be effective in collecting the relevant information/data.

\section*{v) Through Schedules}

Under this method the enumerators are appointed and given training. They are provided with schedules containing relevant questions.

Data/information is collected by filling up the schedules; this is done by enumerators on the basis of replies given by respondents.

Some occasional field checks on the work of the enumerators may ensure sincere work.

N/B: The researcher should select one of these methods of collecting data taking into consideration the nature of investigation, objective and scope of the inquiry/research, financial resources, available time and the desired degree of accuracy.

Though the researcher should pay attention to all these factors but much depends upon the ability and experience of the researcher. In this context D.r ALGOL remarks that in the collection of statistical data common sense is the chief requisite and experience is the chief teacher.

\section*{Execution of the Project}

Execution of the project is a very important step in the research process. When the execution of the project proceeds on correct lines, the data to be collected would be adequate and dependable. The researcher should
see that the project is executed in a systematic manner and in time. If the survey is to be conducted by means of structured questionnaires, data can be readily machine processed. In such a situation, questions as well as the possible answers may be coded.

If the data is to be collected through interviewers, arrangements should be made for proper selection and training of the interviewers.

In other words during project execution, steps should be taken to ensure that the survey is under statistical control so that the collected information/data is in accordance with the pre-defined standard of accuracy.

\section*{Analysis of Data}

After the data has been collected, the researcher turns to the task of analyzing them. The analysis of data requires a number of closely related operations such as establishment of categories, the application of these categories to raw data through coding, tabulation and then drawing statistical inferences.

The researcher should classify the raw data into some purposeful and usable categories. Coding operation is usually done at this stage through which the categories of data are transformed into symbols that may be tabulated and counted.

A great deal of data, especially in large inquiries, is tabulated by computers. Computers not only save time but also make it possible to study large number of variables affecting a problem simultaneously.

Analysis work after tabulation is generally based on the computation of various percentages, coefficients, etc., by applying various well defined statistical formulae. In the process of analysis, relationships or differences supporting or conflicting with original or new hypotheses should be subjected to tests of significance to determine with what validity data can be said to indicate any conclusion(s).

In brief, the researcher can analyze the collected data with the help of various statistical measures.

\section*{Hypothesis Testing}

After data analysis, the researcher is in a position to test the hypotheses, if any, that he/she had formulated earlier.

In hypothesis testing the researcher finds out whether the facts from the analysis support the hypotheses or they happen to be in contrary. Various tests, such as Chi-square test, T-test, F-test, have been developed by statisticians for this purpose.

The hypotheses may be tested through the use of one or more of such tests depending upon the nature and object of research inquiry. Hypothesis -testing will result in either accepting the hypothesis or in rejecting it.

If the researcher had no hypotheses to start with, generalizations established on the basis of data may be stated as hypotheses to be tested by subsequent researches in times to come.

\section*{Generalizations and Interpretation}

If a hypothesis is tested and upheld several times, it may be possible for the researcher to arrive at generalization, i.e., to build a theory. The real value of research lies in its ability to arrive at certain generalizations. If the researcher had no hypothesis to start with, he/she might seek to explain his/her findings on the basis of some theory available, this is known as interpretation. The process of interpretation may quite often trigger off new questions which in turn may lead to further researches.

\section*{Preparation/Writing the Report}

Finally, the researcher has to prepare the report of what has been done by him/her during the entire research process. Writing of report must be done with great care keeping in mind that the document might be used by other researchers who want to improve on what has been done as a reference point.

\section*{Qualities of A good Research}
i) Good research is systematic

It means that research is structured with specified steps to be taken in a specified sequence in accordance with the well-defined set of rules. Systematic characteristic of the research does not rule out creative
thinking but it certainly does reject the use of guessing and intuition in arriving at conclusions.
ii) Good research is logical

This implies that research is guided by the rules of logical reasoning and the logical process of induction and deduction are of great value in carrying out research.

Induction is the process of reasoning from a part to the whole whereas deduction is the process of reasoning from some premise to a conclusion which follows from that very premise. Logical reasoning makes research more meaningful in the context of decision making.
iii) Good research is empirical

This implies that a research is related basically to one or more aspects of a real situation and deals with concrete data that provides a basis for external validity to research results.
iv) Good research is replicable

This characteristic allows research results to be verified by replicating the study and thereby building a sound basis for decisions.

\section*{DATA ANALYSIS AND PRESENTANTION}

Analysis refers to dividing a whole into its separate components for individual examination.

Data analysis is a process for obtaining raw data, and subsequently converting it into information useful for decision-making by users.

Data analysis is also defined as a technique that typically involves multiple activities such as gathering, cleaning, and organizing the data. These processes, which usually include data analysis software, are necessary to prepare the data for business purposes.

Data is collected and analyzed to answer questions, test hypotheses, or disprove theories.

\section*{Data analysis methods}

Data analysis methods and techniques are useful for finding insights in data, such as, facts, and figures. The two primary methods for data analysis are qualitative data analysis techniques and quantitative data analysis techniques.

These data analysis techniques can be used independently or in combination with the other to help business leaders and decision-makers acquire business insights from different data types.

\section*{Quantitative data analysis}

Quantitative data analysis involves working with numerical variables including statistics, percentages, calculations, measurements, and other data since the nature of quantitative data is numerical.

Quantitative data analysis techniques typically include working with algorithms, mathematical analysis tools, and software to manipulate data and uncover insights that reveal the business value.

For example, a financial data analyst can change one or more variables on a company's Excel balance sheet to project their employer's future financial performance.

Quantitative data analysis can also be used to assess market data to help a company set a competitive price for its new product.

\section*{Qualitative data analysis}

Qualitative data describes information that is typically non-numerical. The qualitative data analysis approach involves working with unique identifiers, such as labels and properties, and categorical variables, such as statistics, percentages, and measurements.

A data analyst may use firsthand or participant observation approaches, conduct interviews, run focus groups, or review documents and artifacts in qualitative data analysis.

Qualitative data analysis can be used in various business processes, for example, qualitative data analysis techniques are often part of the software development process.

\section*{Data Presentation}

Data presentation is a process of comparing two or more data sets with visual aids, such as graphs. Using a graph, one can represent how the information relates to other data.

This process follows data analysis and helps to organize information by visualizing and putting it into a more readable format. The process is useful in nearly every industry, as it helps professionals share their findings after performing data analysis.

\section*{Methods of Data Presentation}

Data can be presented in one of the three ways:
- As text
- In tabular form;
- In graphical form.

Methods of presentation must be determined according to the data format, the method of analysis to be used, and the information to be emphasized.

Inappropriately presented data fail to clearly convey information to readers and reviewers. Even when the same information is being conveyed, different methods of presentation must be employed depending on what specific information is going to be emphasized.

A method of presentation must be chosen after carefully weighing the advantages and disadvantages of different methods of presentation.

\section*{a) Text presentation}

Text is the method used to explain results and trends, and provide contextual information. Data are fundamentally presented in paragraphs or sentences.

Text can be used to provide interpretation or emphasize certain data. If quantitative information to be conveyed consists of one or two numbers, it is more appropriate to use written language than tables or graphs.

\section*{b) Table Presentation}

Tables are the most appropriate for presenting individual information, and can present both quantitative and qualitative information. The strength of tables is that they can accurately present information that cannot be presented with a graph.

Another advantage of tables is that information with different units can be presented together. For instance, blood pressure, heart rate, number of
drugs administered, and anesthesia time can be presented together in one table.

Tables are useful for summarizing and comparing quantitative information of different variables.

However, the interpretation of information takes longer in tables than in graphs, and tables are not appropriate for studying data trends.

\section*{c) Graph Presentation}

Graphs simplify complex information by using images and emphasizing data patterns or trends, and are useful for summarizing, explaining, or exploring quantitative data.

Graphs are effective for presenting large amounts of data and can be used in place of tables to present small sets of data.

A graph format that best presents information must be chosen so that readers and reviewers can easily understand the information.

\section*{i) Bar graph}

A bar graph is used to indicate and compare values in a discrete category or group, and the frequency or other measurement parameters (i.e. mean).

Depending on the number of categories, and the size or complexity of each category, bars may be created vertically or horizontally.

The height (or length) of a bar represents the amount of information in a category.

Bar graphs are flexible, and can be used in a grouped or subdivided bar format in cases of two or more data sets in each category.

\section*{ii) Histogram}

A histogram is a graphical display of data using bars of different heights. In a histogram, each bar groups numbers into ranges. Taller bars show that more data falls in that range. A histogram displays the shape and spread of continuous sample data

A histogram displays the single quantitative variable along the x axis and frequency of that variable on the y axis.

\section*{iii) Pie Chart}

A pie chart is a type of graph in which a circle is divided into sectors where each sector represents a proportion of the whole.

Pie charts are a useful way to organize data in order to see the size of components relative to the whole, and are particularly good at showing percentage or proportional data.

While pie charts are popular data representations, they can be hard to read, and it can be difficult to compare data from one pie chart to another. They are a useful way to visualize information that might be presented in a small table.
