                        <p>Research methods or techniques refer to the methods that the researchers use in performing
                            research operations or conducting a research.</p>

                        <p>Research methodology is a way to systematically solve the research problem or may be
                            understood as a science of studying how research is done scientifically.</p>

                        <p>In it we study the various steps that are generally adopted by a researcher in studying
                            his/her research problem along with the logic behind them.</p>

                        <p>Researchers not only need to know how to develop certain indices or tests, how to calculate
                            the mean, the mode, the median or the standard deviation or chi-square, how to apply
                            particular research techniques, but they also need to know which of these methods or
                            techniques are relevant and which are not, and meaning / indications based on their research
                            topic.</p>

                        <p>Researchers also need to understand the assumptions underlying various techniques and the
                            criteria by which they can decide the certain techniques and procedures will be applicable
                            to certain problems and others will not. Therefore it is necessary for the researcher to
                            design their methodology based on their research problems as the same may differ from one
                            problem to problem.</p>

                            process which consists of a number of closely related activities as shown through I to VII.
                            But such activities overlap continuously rather than following a strictly prescribed

                            scientific or intellectual interest. In this, the researcher may do a study concerning
                            subject matter or seek guidance from the experts.</p>

                            documents on the problem needs to be reviewed and examined. This would help the researcher
                            to identify the data available, the techniques that might be used, types of difficulties
                            that may be encountered during the study, possible analytical shortcomings, and even new

                            concerned subject. This helps the researcher to generate new ideas, identify different
                            aspects on the problem, gain suggestions and advices from others, and sharpen his/her focus
                            on certain aspects within the field.</p>

                        <p>However, discussions should not be limited to the problem only, but should also be related to
                            the general approach to the problem, techniques that might be used, possible solutions, etc.

                        <p>Rephrasing the problem means putting the problem in specific terms that is feasible and may
                            help in the development of working hypotheses.</p>
