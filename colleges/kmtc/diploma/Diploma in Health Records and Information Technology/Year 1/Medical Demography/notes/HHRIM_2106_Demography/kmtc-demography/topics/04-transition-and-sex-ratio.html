                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Demographic transition emphasizes the strong interrelationships between population structure, fertility, mortality and migration which lie at heart of formal demography.</p>
                        
                        <p>The so called theory of demographic transition was first described in the 1940's added to and rewritten many times until now there is no single, clear, generally accepted view of precisely what it comprises.<br>
                        The classified description of the theory as set by NOSTEIN (1945) BLACKER (1947) and others is roughly as follows. There are a series of stages during which a population moves from a situation where both mortality and fertility are high to a position where both mortality and fertility are low.<br>
                        Both before and after the transition population from growth is very slow, in between, during the transition population growth are very rapid, essentially because the decline in mortality occurs before the decline in fertility.<br>
                        The theory can be disputed on several grounds both of a theoretical and on a descriptive nature. It has been criticized because it is unclear whether it is purely descriptive or whether it also includes statements about the actual cause of the transition.</p>
                        
                        <p>The early writers about the theory differ in the emphasis they place on causal factors. Because it is formulated at a very general level it is very difficult to generate from its hypothesis which can be tested or refuted convincingly, a requirement for any scientific theory. It has also been criticized by CODE (1973) and others, on descriptive grounds. In many parts of Europe the decline in fertility occurred either before or simultaneously with the decline in mortality. The best known example of this is France where fertility fell to a low level early on before any substantial decline in mortality.</p>
                        
                        <p>Despite these criticisms, demographic transition theory remains at the core of demography as an academic discipline partly because of the lack of anything better to replace it.</p>
                        
                        <p>As a result, it has had a very great influence on the way the subject has developed. One particular detrimental influence is that it has demographers to consider the subject or migration as not being a part of demography.</p>
                        
                        <p>Yet for the most practical purposes, esp. population estimates and projections, and for explaining both current and historical trends in population growth and development, migration is an essential ingredient.</p>
                        
                        <p>One only has to consider the growth of the United States of America or Australia during the $19^{\text{th}}$ century, the current population of London the depopulated rural areas of Ireland or the rapid growth of urban areas in developing countries to realize the crucial impact of migration.</p>

                        <p>Note that if the sex ratio at birth is 105, then after every 205 births on average 100 are females i.e. the proportion that are female is thus</p>
