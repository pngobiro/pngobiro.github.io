                        <p>Ratios, Rates and Proportions are the basic tools of formal demography. Essentially they enable comparison by eliminatory differences due to population size.</p>
                        
                        <p>A ratio is simply any number divided by any other number. A proportion is a type of ratio that is by the formula:-</p>
                        <div class="equation">
                            $$ \text{Proportion} = \frac{x}{x+y} $$
                        </div>

                        <p>A proportion can only range from 0.0 to 1.0. It is though very common to express proportions as percentages simply by multiplying by 100 in which case the range of possible value is from 0% to 100%. The term "rate" is used very loosely in demography and can course confusion. Strictly, the numerator of the rate is a number of events, such as births or deaths occurring during a period of time, and the denominator is the population at risk of experiencing these events. The crucial point is that some time period has to be specified. More precisely the denominator is the № of "persons- years of exposure to risk" experienced by the population during the period under consideration. In demography, rates are most frequently calculated by periods of one year.</p>

                        <p>This means that the total number of persons- year of exposure to risky can usually be approximated by the population at the mid- year. To understand this, consider the calculations of an annual death rate. Each person servicing for the whole year will contribute one year to the total number of years of exposure to risk, while those dying during the year will contribute only a fraction of the year. This fraction will be on average half a year if people die evenly throughout the year. The total number of years of exposure to risk arrived at by adding these fractions to the total contributed by those who survived is clearly the same as taking an average population total during the year and letting each and every person in that average population - contribute a whole year of exposure. And since the average population can normally be approximated very closely by the population at the mid-year, the mid-year population can under most circumstances, be used for calculations of annual rates. This is why most governments statistical services produce population estimates relating to the middle of each year, rather than the beginning or end.</p>

                        <p>This is one of the most fundamental relations in demography. It can be written as:-</p>

                            $$ Pt_{1} = Pt_{0} + (B - D) + (IN - OUT \text{ MIGRATION}) $$
                        </div>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>$Pt_{1}$ = Population at the end of the period.</li>
                            <li>$Pt_{0}$ = Population at the beginning of the period.</li>
                            <li>B = Births during the period.</li>
                            <li>D = Deaths during the period.</li>
                            <li>IN = Migration IN (immigration) during the period.</li>
                            <li>OUT = Migration OUT (emigration) during the period.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <p>The difference between the number of births and deaths gives the "natural increase" whiles the difference between the numbers of migrants in and out gives the "net migration". Thus the equation can be written as:-</p>
                        
                        <p>Population change = natural increase + net migration.</p>
                        
                        <p>The equation can also be expressed in terms of rates by dividing each element by the mid-year population (MYP). Then the rate of population change is just</p>

                        <p>the difference between the birth rate & death rate is just the rate of natural increase and the difference between the in and out migration rates are the net migration rate so the equation can be written as:-</p>

                        <p>Doubling point of the population is the period that the population is expected to double from its current times 2. For example if the population is 28 million, when is it expected to double to 56 million? The formula for doubling point of the population is 70/R. 70 is constant and R is the growth rate (%)</p>

                        <h3 class="content-subheading">Example 1;</h3>
                        <p>Kenya growth rate in 1997 was 3.3%, present population in 1997 was 28 million. When will it double to 56 million?</p>
                        <p>70/3.3 = 21.27 years. Add 1997 + 21.27 = 2018. Therefore, the population is expected to double in the year 2018 from 28 m to 56 m.</p>

                        <h3 class="content-subheading">Example 2:</h3>
                        <p>Can also use the following formula;-</p>
                        <div class="equation">
                            $$ Pt_{1} = Pt_{0} (1+r)^{t} $$

                            <li>$Pt_{1}$ = Population at the end of the period</li>
                            <li>$Pt_{0}$ = Population at the beginning of the period</li>
                            <li>r = growth rate</li>
                            <li>t = time (period)</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>Thus using the example above, calculate when the population will double:-</p>
                        <div class="equation">

                            <li>A bank account balance, b, for an account starting with s dollars, earning an annual interest rate, r, and left untouched for n years can be calculated as $b=s(1+r)^{n}$ (an exponential growth formula). Find a bank account balance to the nearest dollar, if the account starts with $100, has an annual rate of 4%, and the money left in the account for 12 years.</li>
