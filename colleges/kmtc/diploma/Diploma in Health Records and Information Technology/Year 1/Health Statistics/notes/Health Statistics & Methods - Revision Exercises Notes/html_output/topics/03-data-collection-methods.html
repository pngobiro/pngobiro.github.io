                        <span class="heading-text">1. Primary Data</span>
                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Its data especially collected for the purpose for which its required. Data that one collects by himself. Data can be collected the whole population or use of sampling by investigating only part of the population.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Methods of collecting primary data</h3>
                        
                        <h4>i. Direct measurement</h4>
                        <p>Where the information can be measured or counted. We can arrange for ourselves or someone else to take the necessary measurements directly and using the 3rd party influence. This method has the distinct advantage that accurate measurements can be obtained. It can however turn out to be very time consuming and costly if misused.</p>

                        <h4>ii. Experimentation</h4>
                        <p>It's a method where a particular Rx is given to the population or the people to determine the effect it has on the population. E.g applying fertilizer on different crops to determine their yields etc.</p>

                        <h4>iii. Observation</h4>
                        <p>It involves watching or counting events as they happen. It involves getting data when investigation concerns attitude and behaviour. Its applicable when all other methods cannot be effectively used due to the situation. Data can be obtained by either directly or indirectly. Its sometimes referred to as participatory or non-participatory.</p>
                        
                        <h5>a) Direct/participatory observation.</h5>
                        <p>The investigator goes to the study situation and behaves like the respondent. For instance, if you are carrying out an investigation on alcoholic behaviour, you will go and mix with alcoholics in their drinking places and behave like them recording your observations. Respondents may or may not know that you are there as an investigator. Another example can be taken from (CID) who does a passive but participatory role in data collection. The observer may ask a series of questions informally or administer a test.</p>

                        <h5>b) Indirect/non participatory observation</h5>
                        <p>In this method, the respondent is observed through a device e.g through one way mirror, tape recorders, cameras, closed circuits or even a key hole. In most cases the respondent is not aware that he is being observed.</p>

                        <h4>iv. Interviewing</h4>
                        <p>This is a method of data collection in which you or your assistant conducts an interview conversation with respondents while completing a pre-designed interview schedule. There are advantages and disadvantages of conducting the interview by yourself or employing an interviewer.</p>
                        <h5>Advantages of interviewing by investigator:</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Information collected will be more accurate as the investigator knows the limitation of the population or sample to be interviewed.</li>
                            <li>Reduces chances of wrong recording of information by the investigator is more knowledgeable about the investigation than the interviewer.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h5>Disadvantages of interviewing by investigator.</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>It takes more time for one person to conduct all interviews with respondents and therefore time may not allow you to do it by yourself.</li>
                            <li>It cannot be used in some cases because of the cost. This is particularly when conducting large surveys e.g census.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h5>Advantages of interviewing by assistant</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Information will be collected faster than when the investigator is doing it alone.</li>
                            <li>It's possible to cover a large area within a short time.</li>
                            <li>It may be less expensive when the data generated is compared with the volume of data generated by investigator.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h5>Disadvantages.</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Information collected may not be as accurate as the one the investigator collects, this is because the interviewer may misinterpret the questions wrongly when conducting the interview.</li>
                            <li>The assistant may record the information wrongly taking the editing session very difficult and expensive.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>v. Questionnaire</h4>
                        <p>This is where an investigator/interviewer has a set of questions (the questionnaires), designed questions which he/she administers to the respondent (the person chosen to be in the sample). It has the advantages that the results can be obtained quickly and reliably. Due to high response rate obtained when using this method, its usually considered the most effective way of obtaining data.</p>
                        <p>This method is subdivided into 3 parts;</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>By post</li>
                            <li>Face to face interview</li>
                            <li>By phone.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <h5>1. Post.</h5>
                        <p>The questions are sent to the respondent through the post office, the respondent fills the questions and posts back. It requires that:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>i. Write an introduction letter</li>
                            <li>ii. Give an explanation on how questions should be answered.</li>
                            <li>iii. A statement that ensures the respondent that the information given by them will be treated highly confidential.</li>
                            <li>iv. Enclose a stamp and addressed envelope for return postage.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h6>Advantages of postal questionnaires</h6>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Can be sent to a very large no. of people in the population at a low cost.</li>
                            <li>There is no risk of bias or mistake that can originate from the interviewer.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h6>Disadvantages of postal questionnaires</h6>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Low proportion of returns. Postal enquiries are commonly used by government because they have the power to make it compulsory for the questions to be returned.</li>
                            <li>Can only be used in collection of limited factual data such as figures or dates.</li>
                        </ul>

                            <p>The method of data collection that you need to use depends on:</p>
                            <ol type="i">
                                <li>Available resources that include money, man power and time. However the method that gives you the best results utilizing the available resources to its maximum. The method therefore should enable you to conclude your investigation effectively.</li>
                                <li>A thorough consideration of advantages and disadvantages should be considered so that you can apply the method that has less disadvantages.</li>

                        <h3>i. Questionnaire</h3>
                        <p>This is a research instrument that gathers data over a large sample. Each item in the questionnaire is developed to address each specific objective. A questionnaire that is well thought of saves time. There is no opportunity for interview bias and can cover a wide area. Open-ended questionnaires can generate large amount of data that can take long time to process and analyze.</p>
                        <h4>Advantages</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>a. Large amount of information can be collected from a large no of people in a short period of time and in a relatively cost effective way.</li>
                            <li>b. Can be carried out by the researcher or by any no. of people with a limited effect to its validity and reliability.</li>
                            <li>c. The results of the questionnaire can usually be quickly and easily quantified by either a researcher or through the use of software package.</li>
                            <li>d. Can be analyzed more scientifically and objectively than other forms of research.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Disadvantages</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>a. They may confuse the respondent as to the nature of the information required. The respondent will not answer right as he does not know the purpose of the study.</li>
                            <li>b. May discourage respondents to the extent of discarding the questionnaires.</li>
                            <li>c. May leave important information required in the study; some of the questions may be omitted. The respondent may not understand the question well or was bored.</li>
                            <li>d. Response rates can be very low, the respondents will not post back the questionnaires.</li>
                            <li>e. The participants may forget important issues because they occur after the event.</li>
                            <li>f. Questionnaire is standardized so its not possible to explain any points in the question that participants might mis-interpret. This could be partially solved by piloting.</li>
                            <li>g. There is no direct contact so the researcher cannot deal with any other misunderstanding.</li>
                            <li>h. There is no opportunity for the researcher to ask for further information or probe deeper to the answers given to the respondents.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4>Categories of Questions</h4>
                        <p>There are two broad categories of questions that are used in the questionnaires:</p>
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li>Structured or close ended.</li>
                            <li>Unstructured or open-ended</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h5>Structured</h5>
                        <p>These are questions which are accompanied by a list of all possible answers from which the respondents select the answer that describes their situation. Leave allowance for others e.g others (specify).</p>
                        <h6>Advantages</h6>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Saves time for the researcher. Economical to use in terms time and money.</li>
                            <li>The researcher gets the information he requires.</li>
                            <li>It's easier to analyze since they are in an immediate usable form.</li>
                            <li>It's simple for the respondent to understand.</li>
                            <li>They are easier to administer because each item is followed by an alternative answers.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <h6>Disadvantages</h6>
                        <ol>
                            <li>It's difficult to construct because the answers must be well thought of.</li>
                            <li>Responses are limited and the respondents are compelled to answer questions according to the researcher's choices.</li>

                        <h5>Unstructured</h5>
                        <p>This refers to questions that give the respondent complete freedom of expressions. These free expressions permit an individual/respondent to use his or her own words.</p>
                        <h6>Advantages</h6>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Are simple to formulate because the researcher does not have to labour to come up with appropriate response categories.</li>
                            <li>The respondent's responses may give an insight into his feelings, background, hidden motivation, interests and decisions.</li>
                            <li>It gives the researcher the real feelings or picture of the respondents.</li>
                            <li>It gives respondent's freedom to excess him/herself in his/her own words.</li>
                            <li>It saves time for the researcher.</li>
                            <li>Can stimulate the respondent to think and express what he/she considers most important.</li>
                            <li>It permits a greater depth of the respondent when the respondent is allowed to give a personal response usually reasons for the response given may be directly or indirectly included.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <h6>Disadvantages</h6>
                        <ol>
                            <li>It's time consuming for the respondent.</li>
                            <li>It's tedious and cumbersome for the researcher to compile the responses.</li>
                            <li>There is tendency to provide information that does not answer the stipulated research questions or objectives.</li>
                            <li>Responding to open ended questions is time consuming. This may put off some respondents.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h4>Contingency questions</h4>
                        <p>These are follow up questions needed to get further information from the relevant sample. These questions probe for more information. They also simplify the respondent's task in that they will not be required to answer questions that are not relevant to them.</p>

                        <h4>Matrix questions</h4>
                        <p>These are questions that share the same set of response categories e.g Were the learning objectives achieved?</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Agree</li>

                        <h5>Disadvantages</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Some respondents especially the ones that may not be too keen to give the right responses might form a pattern of agree or disagree with the statement.</li>

                        <h4>Rules/principals for constructing a questionnaire/design.</h4>
                        <ol>
                            <li>List the objectives that you want the questionnaire to accomplish. This will help in writing the questions, since questions are related to objectives.</li>
                            <li>Clarity is essential/important. Terms like several, must, because have no precise meaning and they should therefore be avoided.</li>
                            <li>The questions are focused and are limited to single idea. i.e short questions should be used as they are easier to understand. They should be short and clear e.g have you gone for VCT and how often?</li>
                            <li>Double barreled questions should be avoided. Questions that have more than two meanings yet allows for one answer e.g Do you think that students should have more classes about history and culture? What motivates your work? Pleasant work and nice coworkers.</li>
                            <li>Leading or biased questions should be avoided e.g asking for the gender of a child-like is he a boy when you see by yourself. Were you at the KCs bar on the night of 15th?</li>
                            <li>Very personal and sensitive questions should be avoided as the respondent may be dishonest in answering them.</li>
                            <li>Simple words that are easily understandable should be used. Difficult words that are not familiar will discourage the respondent. Avoid jargon words e.g short hand etc.</li>
                            <li>Questions that assume facts with no evidence should be avoided. Such questions offend and discourage the respondent. e.g asking a mother if she affords formula milk for breastfeeding by looking at her social class. This may discourage her to respond. You got HIV because you were unfaithful.</li>
                            <li>Avoid psychologically threatening questions e.g asking a mother, are you afraid that your child who is HIV positive is about to die?</li>
                        </ol>
                        
                        <h4>Essentials of a good questionnaire</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Should be comparatively short.</li>
                            <li>Questions should proceed in a logical sequence e.g simple to difficult questions.</li>
                            <li>Personal and intimate questions should be left to the end.</li>
                            <li>Questions may be dichotomous (yes/no) answers or the multiple choice questions.</li>
                            <li>There should be provisional for indicators of uncertainty i.e. 'don't know'.</li>
                            <li>Provide room for 'others specify'.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Advantages</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>More information and in greater depth can be obtained. The enumerator has a chance to probe for more information.</li>
                            <li>There is greater flexibility as there is an opportunity to restructure questions.</li>
                            <li>Personal information can be obtained more easily.</li>

                            <li>The language of the interview can be adopted to the ability or educational level of the respondent and as such misinterpretations concerning questions can be avoided.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4>Disadvantages</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>There may arise a communication barrier between the interviewer and the respondent.</li>
                            <li>The program of the interviewer may not coincide with that of the respondent.</li>
                            <li>Its time consuming as the interviewer can take a lot of time in one respondent.</li>
                            <li>There is a tendency of biasness (interview bias).</li>
                            <li>There is a probability of shunning down of the interviewer by the respondent e.g a young person interviewing an old person about his sex life.</li>
                            <li>Very expensive especially when large and widely spread geographical sample is taken.</li>
                            <li>Certain types of respondents such VIPs may not be approachable under this method.</li>

                        <h4>Types of interview schedule</h4>
                        <ol>
                            <li><b>Observation schedule:</b> This is a type of schedule having questions which guide an observer systematically.</li>
                            <li><b>Rating schedule:</b> Set of questions that helps guide a psychologist or sociologist to measure the attitude and behaviour of an individual.</li>

                        </ol>

                        <h4>Principles of interview schedule design</h4>
                        <h5>Open-ended interviews</h5>
                        <p>Designed to be flexible and to allow the respondent to use his/her own words.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>The first question must confirm that the potential respondent is aware of the purposes and the scope of the interview, the amount of time it will take, and the way the responses will be used e.g addressing confidentiality issues.</li>
                            <li>Address whether or not the responses will be recorded. Recording responses has the advantage that all materials are captured but the disadvantage that many respondents may speak less freely if they are being recorded obtain a consent before recording.</li>
                            <li>It must contain questions that will answer the research questions.</li>
                            <li>It must not contain questions that are not related to the research questions.</li>
                            <li>Each question must address a single use.</li>
                            <li>Topics that might be covered include:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>a. Demographic questions-age, education, position (occupation), gender can be observed.</li>
                                    <li>b. Knowledge- questions about what a person knows about a specific topic.</li>
                                    <li>c. Behaviour- questions about what a person does in general or has done on a specific occasion and/or what a person plans to do in future.</li>
                                    <li>d. Opinions or values- questions as to what a person thinks about a topic.</li>
                                    <li>e. Feelings- questions about how a person feels about an issue.</li>
                                    <li>f. Sensory- questions as to what a person has seen, touched, heard, tasted or smelt.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ol>

                        <h5>Wording of questions</h5>
                        <p>Wording should be open ended. Questions that require a one word answer, such as yes or no, should only be used as an introduction to more searching questions or for specific facts.</p>
                        <p>Questions must be neutral. Avoid using many questions that might lead the respondents to provide a specific answer or that might generate a strong emotional reaction.</p>
                        <p>Questions should be worded clearly, using simple words, and not using any jargon, abbreviations or technical terms.</p>

                        <h5>Order of questions</h5>
                        <p>To get the respondent involved in the interview, start with some non-controversial questions such as facts.</p>
                        <p>Ask questions about the present before asking about the past or the future.</p>
                        <p>Use the last question of the interview to allow the respondent to talk about any issue that he/she thinks is important and has not been addressed or has not been addressed in sufficient depth.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Benefits of interview schedule</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The interviewer is present and can establish his/her credentials and develop rapport with the respondent.</li>
                            <li>In face to face interview, the interviewer can use visual aids to illustrate points or identify issues he/she is addressing. These aids include photographs, diagrams and physical models.</li>
                            <li>If the respondent does not understand a question, the interviewer can interpret it.</li>
                            <li>The respondent is not provided with potential resources so that respondent's genuine views are obtained.</li>
                            <li>The interviewer can notice that a respondent is distressed and either terminate the interview or take steps to reassure the respondent.</li>
                            <li>The data are complete as the interviewer can check that all issues have been covered and all relevant demographic data is recorded.</li>
                        </ul>

                            <li>Questions used are always open-ended.</li>
                            <li>Participants are randomly selected. To obtain meaningful information, a highly skilled and trained facilitator must guide the group but careful not to leave it in pre-determined direction.</li>
                            <li>It's of 6-8 participants.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4>Advantages of focus group discussion guide.</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The researcher can interact with the participants, pose follow ups questions or ask questions about the situation.</li>
                            <li>Results can be easier to understand than complicated statistical data.</li>
                            <li>The researcher can get information from non-verbal responses, such as facial expressions or body language.</li>
                            <li>Information is provided more quickly than if people were interviewed separately.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Disadvantages</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The small sample size means the groups might not be a good representation of the larger population.</li>
                            <li>Group discussions can be difficult to steer and control so time can be lost to irrelevant topics.</li>
                            <li>Respondents can feel peer pressure to give similar answers to the moderator's questions.</li>
                            <li>The moderator's skills in phrasing questions along with the setting can affect the responses and skew results.</li>
                            <li>No guarantee of confidentiality.</li>
                        </ul>
