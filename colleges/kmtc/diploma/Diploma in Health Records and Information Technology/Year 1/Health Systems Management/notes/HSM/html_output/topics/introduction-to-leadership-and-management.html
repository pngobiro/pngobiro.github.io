                <div class="content-card">
                    <p>Originally, the term management comes from Latin word "manus" referring to the driver controlling a team of horses pulling a cart. This image helps us in considering other definitions. The examples of definitions of management as defined differently by different scholars are that, it is the;</p>
                    <ul class="enhanced-list">
                        <li>Process of getting things done through other people (in simple terms).</li>
                        <li>Process through which resources in an organization are made available and effectively used in accomplishing the organizational goals.</li>
                        <li>Process of working with and through individual and groups and other resources to accomplish organizational goals or objectives.</li>
                        <li>Planning, organizing, co-ordinating, commanding and controlling.</li>
                        <li>Process of creating and maintaining of an internal environment of an organization in which individuals and groups perform effectively towards the attainment of the organization goals.</li>
                        <li>Process of integrating (bring together) all the organizational aspects for instance the structure, people and technology in order to achieve the organizational goals.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>It should be noted that, the definitions of management are non-exhaustive, they vary greatly because of the nature, and types of organizations in terms of products produced or services rendered. However, the most important elements in most definitions are: -</p>
                    <ul class="enhanced-list">
                        <li>Process</li>
                        <li>Resources</li>
                        <li>Utilization and</li>
                        <li>Goals</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Management is important because it enhances the efficiency and effectiveness of an organization's performance. It involves planning, leading, organizing and controlling an organization, as well as more the intangible qualities of inspiration and motivation. Regarding management as a process helps to ensure that operations achieve their objectives and that essential health systems are improved - the operational aspect of management.</p>

                    <h3>Who Is a Manager and What Are Their Roles?</h3>
                    <p>A manager is a person who has the responsibility for achieving certain outcomes, along with the authority to utilize the resources of the organization in doing so. The combination of responsibility and authority is crucial to the concept of management. Timeliness is another critical aspect. The timely use of the resources - whether human, financial, information or physical assets - is essential for effective management. In an ideal management team, the team members recognize the authority of the manager and provide support in a constructive way.</p>
                    <p>A manager is therefore a person who can organize people to work together harmoniously and make effective use of resources to achieve laid-down objectives, through a process that includes planning, implementation, monitoring and evaluation. A distinction should be made between a manager who is a leader, and one who is an administrator. Administration is a subset of management. An administrator is somebody who interprets policies and directives from above for implementation, knows the rules and applies them well The administrator and the manager do not have to be different people.</p>

                    <h3>Process Management</h3>
                    <p>Process management means documenting processes (the way work should be done in the organization), measuring the results of that work as seen by the end users, target populations and policy makers, and taking corrective action if results don't meet expectations. In a well-managed organization, all staff members have two responsibilities to do their job and to improve their work processes. It is upon the management to direct and support staff in realizing these responsibilities.</p>
                    <p>A health system is managed by a team and will be most productive and efficient if the team focuses on technique - the way the team members work together, the methods through which services are delivered. It is very easy to focus on what you do. It is more important to focus on why you do it. Today the paradigm of health care is becoming more client-centred, a concept that leads to demands for client-oriented, health promoting and higher quality health care services. Thus managers need to keep focused on the population for whom they are working to reduce suffering and mortality caused by disease. Continuous improvement is at the heart of process management.</p>

                    <span class="heading-text">THEORIES OF MANAGEMENT</span>
                </h2>
                <div class="content-card">
                    <p>There are various management theories as listed below:</p>
                    <ul class="enhanced-list">
                        <li>Classical management.</li>
                        <li>Human Relations</li>
                        <li>Situational/Contingency.</li>
                        <li>Management by Objectives</li>
                        <li>Systems approach to management</li>
                        <li>Bureaucratic Management</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>1. Classical approach</h3>
                    <p>This approach was developed between 1900 and 1910 and extended through to early 1950s. The theory had 3 branches. These are:</p>
                    <ul class="enhanced-list">
                        <li>Scientific Management</li>
                        <li>Administrative/Principles of Management</li>
                        <li>Bureaucratic Management</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>a. Scientific management theory</h4>
                    <p>This is a technique of management whereby the work methods are scientifically studied and standards established. It is a philosophy about the relationship between the people and work - not technique or efficiency device.</p>
                    <p>The scientific Management approach was developed by an American engineer called Frederick Winslow Taylor, (1856-1915). He came up with this theory because the systematic approach (formally used) failed to lead to widespread production efficiency. He discovered that:</p>
                    <ul class="enhanced-list">
                        <li>Production and pay were poor.</li>
                        <li>Inefficiency and waste were common.</li>
                        <li>Many companies had unused potential.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h5>Principles of Scientific management theory</h5>
                    <p>The scientific management theory has 4 principles. These are: -</p>
                    <ul class="enhanced-list">
                        <li>Developing scientific methods of designing jobs to replace the rule of thumb methods. This involves collecting and analyzing data to arrive at the best way of performing tasks or series of tasks.</li>
                        <li>The Scientific selection and progressive teaching and developing employees to improve performance.Integrating scientifically selected employees and developed methods of designing jobs. The Scientific methods of job design should be well explained by management to reduce resistance.</li>
                        <li>A division of work resulting in the interdependence between management and workers. Taylor believed that if they were truly dependent on one another, then co-operation would naturally follow.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>NOTE:</strong></p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Scientific management theory emphasized on specialization and division of labour.</li>
                        <li>Taylor and other scientific management pioneers believed that employees could be motivated by economic rewards, provided those rewards were related to individual performance. "The more you work the more you earn".</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h5>Limitations of scientific management</h5>
                    <p>These are:</p>
                    <ul class="enhanced-list">
                        <li>Simplistic motivational assumptions.</li>
                        <li>Workers were viewed as part of machine.</li>
                        <li>Exploitation of labour.</li>
                        <li>Ignored relationship between the organizations and its environment.</li>
                        <li>Excluded senior management tasks.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>These limitations prompted the development of administrative management theory.</p>

                    <h4>b. Administrative/principles of management theory</h4>
                    <p>It is also referred to as principles of management. This type of management places emphasis on the members of the organization usually referred to as "body corporate", that is, the personnel or employees.The Administrative theory was developed by a French top Management specialist called Henri Fayol, (1841-1925). The theory emerged in 1916 and it emphasized the perspective of senior managers within the organization. Taylor argued that management was a profession and could be taught.</p>
                    <p>Fayol in his contribution, defined management as comprising of five (5) elements. These are:</p>
                    <ul class="enhanced-list">
                        <li>Planning</li>
                        <li>Organizing</li>
                        <li>Commanding</li>
                        <li>Coordinating and</li>
                        <li>Controlling</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>In addition, Fayol stated 14 principles that he wanted them applied flexibly. These are:</p>
                    <ol class="enhanced-list">
                        <li><strong>Division of work</strong> - Divide work into specialized tasks (elements) and assign responsibility to specific individual.</li>
                        <li><strong>Authority</strong> - Delegate authority a long with responsibility (workers are given the right to command to get the work done).</li>
                        <li><strong>Discipline</strong> - Rules and regulations should be enforced fairly and judiciously. There should be well-defined procedures of dealing with disciplinary matters.</li>
                        <li><strong>Unity of command</strong> - Each employee should be assigned to only one supervisor, otherwise conflict and confusion in authority and instructions would result.</li>
                        <li><strong>Unity of direction</strong> - The principle of Fayol states that "there should be one head and one plan for group of activities/tasks having the same objectives. For example, the personnel department should have only one personnel officer with a specified plan for personnel policies, feeding personnel in all departments of the organization.</li>
                        <li><strong>Subordination of individual interest to organization interest</strong> - Interests of the organization must take priority over the interests of an individual or a group, whenever there is a conflict between the two.</li>
                        <li><strong>Remuneration of employees</strong> -All workers should be fairly paid with appropriate additional incentives for additional efforts.</li>
                        <li><strong>Centralization</strong> - All major policy formulation and decisions should be made at the top management level (central point).</li>
                        <li><strong>Scalar chain</strong> - Communication should follow the formal channel in the hierarchy. Keep the communication within the chain of command.</li>
                        <li><strong>Order</strong>- Place for everything and everything in its place.</li>
                        <li><strong>Equity</strong> - Fair discipline and order enhance employee commitment. Managers should be fair and friendly to subordinates and they should exercise impartiality.</li>
                        <li><strong>Initiative</strong> - Encourage employees to act on their own in support of the organization's direction regardless of the mistakes made.</li>
                        <li><strong>Esprit de corps</strong> - Promote a unity of interests between employees and management. Workers should work as a team.</li>
                        <li><strong>Stability of staff/tenure of employees</strong> - Employee turnover should be minimized. Tenure and long term commitment should be encouraged. It results in a sense of belonging to organization giving rise to dedication and better outcome/ results/ output.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Although in his contributions, management was viewed as a profession that could be trained and developed, emphasized the broad policy aspect of top - level managers and offered universal management prescriptions, it had limitation: -</p>
                    <h5>Limitation</h5>
                    <p>The universal prescriptions need qualifications for environmental, technological and personnel factors.</p>

                    <h4>c. Bureaucratic management theory</h4>
                    <p>It was developed by a German Sociologist, Lawyer and Historian called Max Weber (1864-1924). He was interested in the work of Taylor. His theory was based on authority structures (hierarchy) of a form of an organization. He was specifically concerned with the administration, that is, how the organizations are structured in terms of "who is responsible for who or to who along with the activities to be carried out. He thought bureaucracy would be:</p>
                    <ol type="i">
                        <li>Fairer</li>
                        <li>More impartial and</li>
                        <li>More rational</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h5>Characteristics of bureaucratic theory</h5>
                    <ul class="enhanced-list">
                        <li>Workers are selected and promoted on the basis of technical competence and experience (merit).</li>
                        <li>A system of rules covering the duties and rights of employees that must be adhered to.</li>
                        <li>Well defined hierarchy of authority.</li>
                        <li>A division of labour by functional specialization.</li>
                        <li>A system of procedures for dealing with work situations.</li>
                        <li>Job-holders are expected to be impartial, that is, practice fairness and no favourism.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h5>Limitations</h5>
                    <p>The shortcomings to this theory are:</p>
                    <ul class="enhanced-list">
                        <li>It had limited organizational flexibility and it is slow in decision making.</li>
                        <li>It ignores the importance of people and interpersonal relations.</li>
                        <li>It accumulates power that could result in authoritarian management.</li>
                        <li>Rules may become ends in themselves.</li>
                        <li>Difficult to dismantle once established.</li>
                        <li>Too much specialization that could result, for example, patient to die in hospital if the person assigned to that responsibility is not there.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>These limitations come because of the complexity of organizations. It is better for small organizations, although it is mainly applied in the government organizations.</p>
                    <p>Bureaucratic theory served to fit the traditional organizations which were less innovative in their operations and later around 1930's, human relations theory was developed to look at the human aspect of the organization.</p>

                    <h3>2. Human relation theory</h3>
                    <p>The theory was developed by Professor Elton Mayo around 1930s and it was backed up by A. Maslow, Mcgregor (1960), Hersberg, Likert, Argyris and Chester Bernard (1938).</p>

                    <h3>Management Functions</h3>
                    <p>Managerial work consists of a number of well-defined but interrelated functions (see Figure 1 below):</p>
                    <ul class="enhanced-list">
                        <li><strong>Planning:</strong> Working in a broad outline of the things that need to be done and the methods for doing them to accomplish the purpose set for organization.</li>
                        <li><strong>Organizing:</strong> At the senior most level, establishing the formal structure of an organization through which work subdivisions are arranged, defined and coordinated for the whole organization; at lower levels carrying out similar functions for the specific department or division.</li>
                        <li><strong>Guiding:</strong> On an ongoing basis, making decisions, embodying them in specific general orders and instructions, and serving as a leader of the organization.</li>
                        <li><strong>Controlling:</strong> Coordinating, monitoring, evaluating, and supervising.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h3>3. Management by Objectives</h3>
                    <p>In this management approach the manager sets clear objectives to be realized. This is repeated in every department in the organization to help realize the broad organizational goal. It is worth noting that objectives must be SMART so as to ensure the organization realizes its objectives. To recap, SMART refers to:</p>
                    <ul class="enhanced-list">
                        <li><strong>Specific:</strong> The objective is exact, distinct and clearly stated. Vague language or generalities are not results. It identifies the nature of expected changes, the target, region, etc. It should be as detailed as possible without being wordy.</li>
                        <li><strong>Measurable:</strong> The objective is measurable qualitatively and/or quantitatively.</li>
                        <li><strong>Achievable:</strong> The objective is achievable with the human and financial resources available.</li>
                        <li><strong>Realistic:</strong> The objective addresses specific, recognized challenges and is within mandate.</li>
                        <li><strong>Time-bound:</strong> The objective is to be achieved in a stated time-frame or planning period</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>NB- Management by objectives is a goal oriented process and not works oriented process. To be busy and work is not important if it does not effectively lead to achievement. It is an aid to planning as well as a motivating factor for employees</p>
                    
                    <h4>ELEMENTS OF MBO PROCESS</h4>
                    <p><strong>Central goal setting</strong>- this is the basic stage in MBO process where central management sets the definition and clarification of the organizational objectives usually in consultation with other managers (group and top manager jointly involved). The objectives should be specific and realistic......idea should be floated from top to bottom</p>
                    <p><strong>Manager-subordinate involvement</strong>-here the subordinates work with the managers in setting individual goals. These goals are specific and short range and primarily indicate what the subordinates must set goals in consultation with individuals who comprise his unit. In this manner everyone is involved in the goal setting</p>
                    <p><strong>Matching goals and resources</strong>-objectives can only be achieved if resources are available. Therefore management should provide the subordinates with the necessary tools and materials to effectively achieve these goals. The resources should be allocated precisely in line with the goals set and should be done in consultation with the subordinates</p>
                    <p><strong>Freedom of implementation</strong>- there should be adequate freedom for the manager subordinate task force in deciding on the utilization of resources and means of achieving the objectives</p>
                    <p><strong>Review and appraisal of performance</strong>- there should be regular reviews of progress between managers and subordinates. These reviews would-:</p>
                    <ul class="enhanced-list">
                        <li>Determine if the individual is making satisfactory progress</li>
                        <li>Reveals if any unanticipated problems have developed</li>
                        <li>Help subordinates understand the process of MBO better</li>
                        <li>Improves morale of the subordinates</li>
                        <li>Assists the managers and subordinates to modify either objectives or methods if need be</li>
                    </ul>

                    <span class="heading-text">Principles of Management</span>
                </h2>
                <div class="content-card">
                    <p>Basic principles of management were set out by Henry Fayol (1841-1925), a French management theorist who developed one of the first comprehensive statements of a general theory of management.<sup>1</sup> Still relevant today, the 14 principles Fayol articulated are:</p>
                    <ol class="enhanced-list">
                        <li><strong>Division of work:</strong> The specialization of the workforce according to the skills a person has, creating specific personal and professional development within the labour force and therefore increasing productivity; leads to specialization, which increases the efficiency of labour. By separating a small part of work, the workers' speed and accuracy in its performance increases. This principle is applicable to both technical and managerial work.</li>
                        <li><strong>Authority and responsibility:</strong> The issue of commands followed by responsibility for their consequences. Authority means the right of a superior to give orders to subordinates; responsibility means obligation for performance. This principle suggests that there must be parity between authority and responsibility. They go together and are two sides of the same coin.</li>
                        <li><strong>Discipline:</strong> Discipline refers to obedience, proper conduct in relation to others, respect of authority, etc. It is essential for the smooth functioning of all organizations.</li>
                        <li><strong>Unity of command:</strong> This principle states that every subordinate should receive orders and be accountable to one and only one superior. If an employee receives orders from more than one superior, it is likely to create confusion and conflict. Unity of command also makes it easier to fix responsibility for mistakes.</li>
                        <li><strong>Unity of direction:</strong> All those working in the same line of activity must understand and pursue the same objectives. All related activities should be put under one group, there should be one plan of action for them, and they should be under the control of one manager. Unity of action seeks to ensure a focus of efforts and coordination of strength.</li>
                        <li><strong>Subordination of individual interest:</strong> The management must put aside personal considerations and put company objectives first. Therefore the interests of the goals of the organization must prevail over the personal interests of individuals.</li>
                        <li><strong>Remuneration:</strong> Workers must be paid sufficiently as this is one of the chief motivations of employment and therefore greatly influences productivity. The quantum and methods of remuneration payable should be fair, reasonable and rewarding of effort.</li>
                        <li><strong>The degree of centralization:</strong> The amount of power wielded within the central management depends on company size. Centralization implies the concentration of decision making authority at the top management. Sharing of authority with lower levels is called decentralization. The organization should strive to achieve a proper balance.</li>
                        <li><strong>Scalar chain:</strong> Scalar chain refers to the chain of superiors ranging from top management to the lowest rank. The principle suggests that there should be a clear line of authority from top to bottom linking all managers at all levels. It is considered a chain of command. It involves a concept called a "gang plank", through which a subordinate may contact a superior or the superior's superior in case of an emergency, defying the hierarchy of control. However, the immediate superiors must be informed about the matter.</li>
                        <li><strong>Order:</strong> Social order ensures the fluid operation of a company through authoritative procedure. Material order ensures safety and efficiency in the workplace.</li>
                        <li><strong>Equity:</strong> Employees must be treated kindly, and justice must be enacted to ensure a just workplace. Managers should be fair and impartial when dealing with employees.</li>
                        <li><strong>Stability of tenure of personnel:</strong> The period of service should not be too short and employees should not be moved from positions frequently. An employee who is removed before becoming accustomed to the assigned work cannot render useful service.</li>
                        <li><strong>Initiative:</strong> Tapping into the initiative of employees can add strength and new ideas to an organization. Initiative on the part of employees is a source of strength for the organization because it provides new and better ideas. Employees who know their ideas are respected are likely to take greater interest in the functioning of the organization.</li>
                        <li><strong>Esprit de corps:</strong> This refers to the need of managers to develop and ensure morale in the workplace, individually and communally. Team spirit helps develop an atmosphere of mutual trust and understanding. These can be used to initiate and aid the processes of change, organization, decision making, skill management and the overall view of the management function.</li>

                    <p>Managers clearly have many functions and roles. These can be summarized into three basic categories:</p>

                <div class="content-card">
                    <p>For managers to be effective they require certain critical skills, including those in the list below. The skills may be used singly or in combination, depending on the situation and circumstances. They are:</p>
                    <ul class="enhanced-list">
                        <li>Computer skills</li>

                    <span class="heading-text">Leadership</span>
                </h2>
                <div class="content-card">
                    <h3>Definition:</h3>
                    <p>Leading is the process of influencing people, that is, personnel, followers so that they could contribute to the goals of the organization or group. Leadership on the other hand is the interpersonal influence, exercised in situations and directed through the communication process towards the organizational goals. It is concerned with guiding others or activities of followers/subordinates towards the pre-determined objectives/goals. A leader/manager must use influence (positive) to achieve the set objectives or goals.</p>
                    <p>However, there are as many definitions of leadership as there are people who have attempted to define it. One common theme that runs through each of them is the ability of an individual to inspire confidence and to provide support to members of a group to achieve the programme objectives.</p>
                    <p>Leadership is a process or ability to influence the behaviour of others, to motivate and mobilize others to work together and achieve a common aim. It is a way of focusing and motivating a group of people to enable them to achieve their own aims and develop themselves. It also involves being accountable and responsible for the group as a whole. Leadership comprises three factors: the leader, the people, and the situation or conditions.Thus leadership is determined not only by the characteristics of the leader and the team, but also by the situations that prevail in the programme or organization.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Process of leading</h3>
                    <p>Leading involves various activities and not merely leading people. It comprises of:</p>
                    <ul class="enhanced-list">
                        <li>Planning</li>
                        <li>Organizing</li>
                        <li>Directing</li>
                        <li>Delegating</li>
                        <li>Reporting</li>
                        <li>Staffing and</li>
                        <li>Motivating people</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Great vision emerges when a powerful mind, working long and hard on massive amount of information, is able to see (or recognize in suggestions from others) interesting patterns and new possibilities<sup>5</sup>.</p>
                    <p>A leader uses power in influencing group behavior. Power the ability to influence, command, or apply force is central to leadership and derives from several resources, including:<sup>6</sup></p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Authority or legitimate power</strong> - comes from the right of the position in the organization to direct the activities of subordinates</li>
                        <li><strong>Reward power</strong>- based on leader's ability to withhold or provide rewards for performance</li>
                        <li><strong>Coercive power</strong>- maintains control over punishment</li>
                        <li><strong>Referent power</strong> - exists when the leader possesses personal characteristics that are appealing to the constituency, and the constituency flows out of admiration, charisma impact, or the desire to be like the leader.</li>
                        <li><strong>Expert power</strong>- occurs when the leader has knowledge or expertise that is of value</li>
                        <li><strong>Information power</strong> - based on the persuasive content of the person's message, apart from personal characteristics.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Power can also be referred to a measure of a person's potential to get others to do what he or she wants them to do, as well as to avoid being forced by others to do what he or she does not want to do.</p>
                    <p>Effective leadership in organizations creates a vision of the future that considers the legitimate long-term interests of the parties involved in the organization, develops a strategy for moving toward that vision, enlists the support of employees to produce the movement, and motivates the employees to implement the strategy.</p>
                    <p>In summary leadership can be defined as a process by which a person influences others to accomplish an objective and directs the organization in a way that makes it more cohesive and coherent. This definition is similar to Northouse's (2007, p3) definition - Leadership is a process whereby an individual influences a group of individuals to achieve a common goal.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Are Leaders Born or Made?</h3>
                    <ul class="enhanced-list">
                        <li>Some argue that leaders are born, while others hold that leaders are made. Whichever the case, the training of leaders - whether born or not - gives them skills that help them to become better leaders or managers.</li>
                        <li>To maximize their potential individuals must begin to think of leadership in place of management, accountability in place of responsibility, job roles in place of job descriptions.</li>
                        <li>To increase our leadership ability, we must expand ourselves. Leadership development is personal development. In order for us to understand ourselves, we must gather information; we must obtain the facts and data that tell us about ourselves. For individuals to maximize potential they must begin to think of leadership in place of management, of accountability in place of responsibility. They must begin to think of job roles in place of job descriptions</li>
                        <li>Leadership is the art of inspiring followers to perform their duties willingly, competently and enthusiastically so as to achieve organizational objectives. Leadership is determined not only by the characteristics of the leader and the team, but also by the situations that prevail. A good leader has the ability to set direction and inspire others. The leader is willing to take risk, is creative and innovative, accountable and responsible. In a service-oriented organization, leadership determines the success or failure of the delivery of services. It provides inspiration and motivation for workers to perform.</li>

                    <h3>Qualities of Good Leadership</h3>
                    <p>These are numerous, as the following list suggests:</p>
                    <ul class="enhanced-list">
                        <li><strong>Vision:</strong> Good leaders have a vision of the future and lead their people to their vision. A vision must be shared or it will be useless.</li>
                        <li><strong>Creativity:</strong> A good leader is creative - able to come up with new ideas and ways of doing things.</li>
                        <li><strong>Awareness:</strong> Good leaders have the ability to perceive opportunities in the environment within which they are operating, to enable them to utilize the context to achieve the intended objectives.</li>
                        <li><strong>Initiative:</strong> This is exercised whenever effort is concentrated on a specific activity, to start something that was not going on before, to stop something that was occurring, or to shift the direction and character of the effort.</li>
                        <li><strong>Inquisitive:</strong> This is the ability to gain access to facts and data from people or other information sources. The quality of information may depend on a leader's thoroughness, keenness and commitment. A leader who is keen to learn as much as possible about work activities is more likely to gain quality information than one who ignores the need for enquiry.</li>
                        <li><strong>Supportive:</strong> A good leader is supportive to the led. The leader in return also gets support so that the vision and mission are realized.</li>
                        <li><strong>Advocacy:</strong> This means taking a position in support of a cause, e.g., creating awareness on cost sharing. A leader has the ability to convince or persuade, and is prepared to take a stand.</li>
                        <li><strong>Making decisions:</strong> This involves choosing or selecting from two or more courses of action. It may involve choosing an intervention or how best available resources can be effectively used.</li>
                        <li><strong>Critiquing:</strong> Good leaders are able to give (and accept) constructive critique and feedback. Management teams need to use the "Critique Approach" when conducting supervision, counselling and guidance of their subordinates.</li>

                    <p>It is generally accepted that leadership style - that is, the way leadership ability is exercised - can be grouped into five<sup>3</sup> categories:</p>
                    <ul class="enhanced-list">
                        <li><strong>Autocratic/dictatorship:</strong> Autocratic leaders use their legitimate authority to suppress their followers in order to realize their own goals.</li>
                        <li><strong>Democratic:</strong> Democratic leadership is about majority rule; the leader goes by the decision of the majority. The weakness of this type of leadership is that the minority are suppressed and their views are rarely heard.</li>
                        <li><strong>Laissez-faire:</strong> This is a leadership style in which the leader provides minimal direction and gives employees power to determine goals, make decisions and resolve problems on their own. This style can be effective when employees are highly skilled, experienced, self-motivated and well educated. Otherwise, it can result in chaos.</li>
                        <li><strong>Paternalistic:</strong> These leaders act as fathers to their followers.</li>
                        <li><strong>Charismatic leadership:</strong> The leader has a magnetic personality that in itself attracts people and instils loyalty. This type of leader is normally referred to as a born leader.</li>

                    <span class="heading-text">The Difference between Managers and Leaders</span>
                </h2>
                <div class="content-card">
                    <p>It is important to understand the difference between management and leadership. While management deals with the administrative aspects of a manager's work (planning, organizing, monitoring), leadership deals with the interpersonal aspects (inspiration, motivation, influence).</p>
                    <p>Qualities of both a manager and a leader are necessary. While performing managerial or administrative roles (planning, organizing and controlling), managers are often called upon to take up leadership roles that deal with the interpersonal aspects of their job (inspiration, motivation, influence) that may have a long-lasting impact on individuals and the group.</p>
                    <p>A manager without leadership skills is an administrator, while a creative, far-sighted leader who is unable to implement a vision (without managerial skills) will confuse and lose the team. There may be only one or two designated leaders in an organization, such as the director or team leader, but leadership qualities can be found in many others within the team.</p>
                    <p>Clearly, the managers must perform both leadership and management functions. The major responsibilities of a manager are to operate and maintain the organization efficiently, ensuring that it provides useful services to clients and the community. Managers tend to be problem-solvers, seeking better ways to use their resources to get the job done. Effective managers bring order and consistency to programmes.</p>
                    <p>Leaders, on the other hand, are pathfinders; they branch out more in their thinking. They are concerned with building the organization for the future, providing direction, securing new resources, developing new capacities, preparing the organization to meet challenges and take advantage of emerging opportunities, adapting to change, and networking.</p>
                    <p>In summary:</p>
                    <ul class="enhanced-list">
                        <li>Management is a science; leadership is an art.</li>
                        <li>Managers manage things; leaders lead people.</li>
                        <li>Managers run institutions; leaders build institutions.</li>
                        <li>Managers are busy; leaders make time.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>We can further summarize leadership as indicated below.</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Management is about path following; leadership is path finding</li>
                        <li>Management is about doing things right; leadership is about doing the right things</li>
                        <li>Management is about planning and budgeting; leadership is about establishing direction</li>
                        <li>Management is about controlling and problem solving; leadership is about motivating and inspiring</li>

                    <span class="heading-text">Theories of leadership</span>
                </h2>
                <div class="content-card">
                    <p>Interest in leadership increased during the early part of the twentieth century. Early leadership theories focused on what qualities distinguished between leaders and followers, while subsequent theories looked at other variables such as situational factors and skill levels. While many different leadership theories have emerged, most can be classified as one of eight major types:</p>
                    
                    <h3>1. Great Man Theories:</h3>
                    <p>Great man theories assume that the capacity for leadership is inherent - that great leaders are born, not made. These theories often portray great leaders as heroic, mythic and destined to rise to leadership when needed. The term "Great Man" was used because, at the time, leadership was thought of primarily as a male quality, especially in terms of military leadership.</p>
                    
                    <h3>2. Trait Theories:</h3>
                    <p>Similar in some ways to "Great Man" theories, trait theories assume that people inherit certain qualities and traits that make them better suited to leadership. Trait theories often identify particular personality or behavioral characteristics shared by leaders. If particular traits are key features of leadership, then how do we explain people who possess those qualities but are not leaders? This question is one of the difficulties in using trait theories to explain leadership.</p>
                    
                    <h3>3. Contingency Theories:</h3>
                    <p>Contingency theories of leadership focus on particular variables related to the environment that might determine which particular style of leadership is best suited for the situation. According to this theory, no leadership style is best in all situations. Success depends upon a number of variables, including the leadership style, qualities of the followers and aspects of the situation.</p>
                    
                    <h3>4. Situational Theories:</h3>
                    <p>Situational theories propose that leaders choose the best course of action based upon situational variables. Different styles of leadership may be more appropriate for certain types of decision-making. For example, in a situation where the leader is the most knowledgeable and experienced member of a group, an authoritarian style might be most appropriate. In other instances where group members are skilled experts, a democratic style would be more effective.</p>
                    
                    <h3>5. Behavioral Theories:</h3>
                    <p>Behavioral theories of leadership are based upon the belief that great leaders are made, not born. Rooted in behaviorism, this leadership theory focuses on the actions of leaders not on mental qualities or internal states. According to this theory, people can learn to become leaders through teaching and observation.</p>
                    
                    <h3>6. Participative Theories:</h3>
                    <p>Participative leadership theories suggest that the ideal leadership style is one that takes the input of others into account. These leaders encourage participation and contributions from group members and help group members feel more relevant and committed to the decisionmaking process. In participative theories, however, the leader retains the right to allow the input of others.</p>
                    
                    <h3>7. Management Theories:</h3>
                    <p>Management theories, also known as transactional theories, focus on the role of supervision, organization and group performance. These theories base leadership on a system of rewards and punishments. Managerial theories are often used in business; when employees are successful, they are rewarded; when they fail, they are reprimanded or punished.</p>
                    
                    <h3>8. Relationship Theories:</h3>
                    <p>Relationship theories, also known as transformational theories, focus upon the connections formed between leaders and followers. Transformational leaders motivate and inspire people by helping group members see the importance and higher good of the task. These leaders are focused on the performance of group members, but also want each person to fulfill his or her potential. Leaders with this style often have high ethical and moral standards.</p>

                    <h3>Managing Change</h3>
                    <p>Organizations are designed to fit the environment in which they operate at a given time. Their environments are constantly changing in varying degrees. Change is therefore inevitable in any organization that seeks to maintain its relevance. Managers deal with many organized groups representing various interests. Most of these groups exert power over operations of organizations. While they may be able to do little or nothing to change these forces, it is nevertheless up to the manager to anticipate and integrate these various forces that are bound to affect his operations.</p>
                    <p>Different types of change require different strategies to implement the change successfully. Managers must anticipate changes in the environment that will require future adjustments in the organizations designs. Change management is a systematic approach to dealing with change, both from the perspective of an organization and at the level of the individual.</p>
                    <p>Change management is a systematic approach to dealing with change, both from the perspective of an organization and on the individual level. Change management means to plan, initiate, realize, control and finally stabilize change processes, whether corporate or personal. Change may cover such diverse problems as, for example, strategic direction or personal development programmes for staff.</p>
                    
                    <h3>The Importance of Change Management</h3>
                    <p>The capacity to manage change is the most important characteristic of leaders who succeed. This capacity depends on seven essential abilities:</p>
                    <ul class="enhanced-list">
                        <li>To be capable of adapting to the environment and be conscious of the gap between what is done and what can be done; to appreciate but never be satisfied with the situation as it is today and pay more attention to what does not function than to what functions.</li>
                        <li>To be able to question the present reality.</li>
                        <li>To be able to communicate a compelling vision of the direction the organization must take.</li>
                        <li>To have the capacity to create a coalition of followers and supporters.</li>
                        <li>To be capable of building a team capable of making change happen.</li>
                        <li>To persist and persevere.</li>
                        <li>To share with others the credit and recognition brought by success.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h3>Types of Change</h3>
                    <p>Change is the continuous adaptation of corporate strategies and structures to changing external conditions. It may take several forms, as described below:</p>
                    <p><strong>Developmental Change</strong> Developmental change occurs when an organization makes an improvement to its current way of doing business. If an organization decided to improve its processes, methods or performance standards, this would be considered developmental change.</p>
                    <p><strong>Transformational Change</strong> Transformational change occurs after the transition period. Transformational change may involve both developmental and transitional change, and it is common for the two types to occur in tandem. This happens mainly when organizations are faced with the emergence of radically different technologies, significant changes in supply and demand, unexpected competition, lack of revenue, or other major shifts in how they do business. Formal changes are the responses of an organization to major internal forces and external pressures (change drivers).</p>
                    <p><strong>Transitional Change</strong> Transitional change is more intrusive than developmental change, as it replaces existing processes or procedures with something that is completely new to the organization. The period when the old process is being dismantled and the new process is being implemented is called the transitional phase.</p>

                    <h3>Guidelines for Change Management</h3>
                    <p>Resistance to change can be avoided or reduced by doing the following:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Planning change carefully:
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Identify problems and their underlying causes.</li>
                                <li>Formulate alternative actions to solve the problems.</li>

                    <h3>Kurt Lewin's Change Model</h3>
                    <p>An early model of change developed by Kurt Lewin (1890-1947),<sup>4</sup> one of the modern pioneers of social, organizational and applied psychology, described change as a three-stage process:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>"Unfreezing":</strong> It involves overcoming inertia and dismantling the existing "mind set". Defence mechanisms have to be bypassed.</li>
                        <li><strong>"Change":</strong> This is typically a period of confusion and transition. We are aware that the old ways are being challenged, but we do not yet have a clear picture of what we are replacing them with.</li>
                        <li><strong>"Refreezing":</strong> The new mindset is crystallizing and one's comfort level is returning to previous levels. This is often misquoted as "refreezing" (Lewin, 1947).</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p><strong>Note:</strong> Change is inevitable in the current complex environment. It has been said that change is the only constant. A leader would learn change practices that produce results.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Resistance to change</h3>
                    <p>Change is actually a frightening word for many people. People resist and try to avoid changes that will leave them worse off than they are now. But, resistance may be met even if the proposed change is neutral, or beneficial to the persons concerned.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Why people resist change</h4>
                    <ul class="enhanced-list">
                        <li>They believe that is not in their interest to change</li>
                        <li>They think the change is the wrong thing to do, if you knew what I knew"</li>
                        <li>They are skeptical about the possibility of success</li>
                        <li>They don't understand why change is happening</li>
                        <li>It isn't relevant to them</li>
                        <li>They don't understand exactly what change is required</li>
                        <li>They don't have the time or resources to change</li>
                        <li>They don't think that they will be able to change (Fear of failure)</li>
                        <li>They feel they were not involved in the decision to change</li>
                        <li>Lack of conviction that change is needed</li>
                        <li>Dislike of imposed change</li>
                        <li>Dislike of surprises</li>
                        <li>Fear of the unknown</li>
                        <li>Reluctance to deal with unpopular issues fear of inadequacy and failure</li>
                        <li>Disturbed practices, habits and relations</li>
                        <li>Lack of respect and trust in the person promoting change</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h3>Strategies for dealing with change resistance</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Education & Communication:</strong> One of the best ways to overcome resistance to change is to educate people about the change effort beforehand. Up-front communication and education helps employees see the logic in the change effort. This reduces unfounded and incorrect rumors concerning the effects of change in the organization</li>
                        <li><strong>Participation & Involvement:</strong> When employees are involved in the change effort they are more likely to buy into change rather than resist it. This approach is likely to lower resistance more so than merely hoping people will acquiesce to change</li>
                        <li><strong>Facilitation & Support:</strong> Managers can head-off potential resistance by being supportive of employees during difficult times. Managerial support helps employees deal with fear and anxiety during a transition period. This approach is concerned with provision of special training, counseling, time off work.</li>
                        <li><strong>Negotiation and Agreement:</strong> Managers can combat resistance by offering incentives to employees not to resist change. This can be done by allowing change resistors to veto elements of change that are threatening, or change resistors can be offered incentives to go elsewhere in the company in order to avoid having to experience the change effort. This approach will be appropriate where those resisting change are in a position of power.</li>
                        <li><strong>Manipulation and Cooptation:</strong> "Cooptation" (no it's not misspelled) involves the patronizing gesture of bringing a person into a change management planning group for the sake of appearances rather than their substantive contribution. This often involves selecting leaders of the resisters to participate in the change effort. These leaders can be given a symbolic role in decision making without threatening the change effort.</li>
                        <li><strong>Explicit and Implicit Coercion:</strong> Managers can explicitly or implicitly force employees into accepting change by making clear that resisting change can lead to losing jobs, firing, or not promoting employees</li>
                    </ol>

                </h2>
                <div class="content-card">
                    <p>Group dynamics refers to a system of behaviors and psychological processes occurring within a social group (intragroup dynamics), or between social groups (intergroup dynamics). The study of group dynamics can be useful in understanding decision-making behavior, tracking the spread of diseases in society, creating effective therapy techniques, and following the emergence and popularity of new ideas and technologies. Group dynamics are at the core of understanding racism, sexism, and other forms of social prejudice and discrimination. These applications of the field are studied in psychology, sociology, anthropology, political science, epidemiology, education, social work, business, and communication studies.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Team building</h3>
                    <p>Team building is a philosophy of job design in which employees are viewed as members of interdependent teams instead of as individual workers. Team building refers to a wide range of activities, presented to businesses, schools, sports teams, religious or nonprofit organizations designed for improving team performance.</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>The team member.</strong> Successful teams are made up of a collection of effective individuals. These are people who are experienced, have problem solving ability, are open to addressing the problem, and are action oriented.</li>
                        <li><strong>Team relationships:</strong> For a team to be successful the members of the team must be able to give and receive feedback</li>
                        <li><strong>Team problem solving:</strong> An effective team depends on how focused and clear the goal of the team is. A relaxed, comfortable and accepting environment and finally, open and honest communication are required.</li>
                        <li><strong>Team leadership:</strong> Effective team leadership depends on leadership competencies. A competent leader is: focused on the goal, ensures a collaborative climate, builds confidence of team members, sets priorities, demonstrates sufficient "know-how" and manages performance through feedback.</li>
                        <li><strong>Organizational environment:</strong> The climate and culture of the organization must be conducive to team behavior. Competitiveness should be discouraged and uniformity should be encouraged - this will eliminate conflict and discord among team members.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Team building is pursued via a variety of practices, and can range from simple bonding exercises to complex simulations and multi-day team building retreats designed to develop a team (including group assessment and group-dynamic games), usually falling somewhere in between. It generally sits within the theory and practice of organizational development, but can also be applied to sports teams, school groups, and other contexts.</p>
                    <p>Team building is not to be confused with "team recreation" that consists of activities for teams that are strictly recreational. Team building can also be seen in day-to-day operations of an organization and team dynamic can be improved through successful leadership. Team building is said to have benefits of self-development, positive communication, leadership skills and the ability to work closely together as a team to solve problems.</p>
                    <p>Work environments tend to focus on individuals and personal goals, with reward & recognition singling out the achievements of individual employees. Team building can also refer to the process of selecting or creating a team from scratch</p>
                    
                    <h3>Team dynamic</h3>
                    <p>When assembling a team it is very important to consider the overall dynamic of the team. When building a team, five dynamics are fundamental to team success:</p>
                    
                    <h3>Goals</h3>
                    <p>The overall goals of team building are to increase the teams understanding of team dynamics and improve how the team works together. Unlike working as a group, working as a team incorporates group accountability rather than individual accountability and results in a collective work product. Team building encourages the team approach to working on a project. Advantages to this approach include:</p>
                    <ul class="enhanced-list">
                        <li>Increased flexibility in skills and abilities</li>
                        <li>More productive than work groups with individual mindset</li>
                        <li>More beneficial in times of organizational change</li>
                        <li>Encourage both individual and team development and improvement</li>
                        <li>Focuses on group goals to accomplish more beneficial tasks</li>
                        <li>Improved range of team building objectives such as collaboration, communication and increased creative or flexible thinking.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h3>Eight (8) effective strategies a leader should employ to enhance team building:</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Establish clear and inspiring team goals</li>
                        <li>Maintain a results-oriented team structure</li>
                        <li>Assemble competent team members</li>
                        <li>Strive for unified commitment</li>
                        <li>Provide a collaborative climate</li>
                        <li>Encourage standards of excellence</li>
                        <li>Furnish external support and recognition</li>

This might not be difficult for organizations who have been managing using strategic plan since they can adopt what they have or modify to suit the ever changing trends in technology and innovations in management approaches.
