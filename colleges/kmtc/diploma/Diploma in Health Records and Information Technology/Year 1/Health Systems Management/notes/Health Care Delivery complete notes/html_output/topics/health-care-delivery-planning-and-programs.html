                        <p>The Health Information Management (HIM) profession in Kenya has been created because of a need for accurate, complete data regarding the care and treatment of patients and the production of timely information for evidence based decision making within the health sector. HIM professionals like their other colleagues within the health sector need to be regulated in order to ensure that they operate professionally. Regulatory mechanisms for Health Records and Information Management, like any other health profession, shall include activities like state licensure of practitioners, accreditation of programmes, certification of practitioners, and legislation that governs practice. This calls for the establishment of a Professional Regulatory Board which shall be responsible for:</p>

                        <p><strong>Health Planning</strong> - Is the process of defining community health problems, identifying needs and resources, establishing priority goals, and setting out the administrative action needed to reach those goals.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Features of Planning:</h4>
                        <ol>
                            <li>A good plan should give

                                    <li>b) A clear picture of the tasks to be accomplished</li>
                                    <li>c) The resources needed to accomplish the task</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>Planning takes place at all levels
                                <ul>
                                    <li>a) planning takes place at any level in health system</li>
                                    <li>b) planning takes place continually, it is cyclic/spiral process.</li>
                                    <li>c) planning methods can be applied to:- . A large program at national level eg. Malaria control programme. Small one - at village level eg. Construction of community health post.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>Planning must be collective undertaking
                                <ul>
                                    <li>a) It requires the participation of:- . Professionals - from health and other sectors . Community/Non government organizations (NGO). Government/Party</li>

                            </li>
                        </ol>

                        <h4>Types of Planning</h4>
                        <p>a) <strong>Strategic planning</strong>-often referred as alocative planning- normally five years or more. Strategic planning is the process of determining what an organization intends to be in the future and how it will get there. It is finding the best future for your organization and the best path to reach that destination.</p>
                        <p>b) <strong>Tactical/operational planning</strong> -may be referred to as activity planning. It covers a short period of time medium term -usually one year Tactical/operational planning is short range planning that emphasizes the current operations of various parts of the organization. Short range is defined as a period of time extending only about one year or less into the future.</p>

                        <h4>Why planning?</h4>
                        <p>The increasing demand for medical and health care services, in the face of limited resources, has brought out the need for careful planning and management of health services</p>
                        <p>The purpose of planning:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>a) To match the limited resources with many problems</li>
                            <li>b) To eliminate wasteful expenditure and avoid duplication</li>
                            <li>c) To develop the best course of action to accomplish a defined objective</li>
                            <li>d) Improved communication among all chains</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>It's easy for departments at every level to become confused as to what's going on. Both your employees and stakeholders want to ensure that your organization will have a long-lasting future. They want to know where your organization is headed and the steps it takes to get there. Effective planning in healthcare management can help you create clarity and improve communication. Your strategic plan should address the key issues, your organization's vision and goals, and the steps to get there. Your employees and stakeholders will have improved confidence and faith in your organization.</p>
                        <p>e) <strong>Developing and sharing a vision:</strong> With this in mind, you can make an impact on every level of your organization. Employees will be committed and motivated to help achieve your vision. Stakeholders will have the confidence and clarity they need to make sound financial decisions. Strategic planning for healthcare facilities that's clearly developed, executed, and communicated can help each of your individuals carry out your out vision that can lead to a fulfilling future</p>
                        <p>f) <strong>Increased employee motivation and engagement:</strong> Each of your employees wants to be recognized and heard. Being recognized by their leaders can greatly impact their productivity, engagement, and safety management. Every employee wants to have the responsibility to make decisions they know will benefit your organization. This also motivates them to perform above the minimum acceptable standards as outlined in the job description or performance evaluation. Employees won't be motivated to improve themselves for an organization that doesn't state a clear vision or a well-executed game plan.</p>
                        <p>g) <strong>Transformational leadership and authority:</strong> Transformational leadership is a type of leadership that inspires your employees to work harder and to do better. It incorporates techniques that have been cited in organizational behavior literature. Transformational leaders clearly communicate their organization's vision, believe in their individual employees, and have the abilities to produce high levels of performance. Helping your employees understand how their roles can contribute your organization's mission and vision is a crucial part of strategic management.</p>
                        <p>h) <strong>Increased team cooperation and collaboration:</strong> Team collaboration and cooperation is an essential component in delivering high-quality healthcare. Employees must work together to make your organization a success. Teamwork is essential for every healthcare industry in order to improve their performance and service. Effective strategic planning models in healthcare can bring your employees together to deliver quality care, great customer service, and increased performance.</p>

                        <h4>Objectives, targets and goals of Health Planning</h4>
                        <p>An important element of planning is the setting of clear cut objectives, targets and goals.</p>
                        <p><strong>Objective:</strong> It is a planned end point of all activities. It is stated in term of measured amount of progress towards goal.</p>
                        <p><strong>Targets:</strong> When the objective is split into discrete activity it becomes target like number of sputum smear collected or Tubectomy done.</p>
                        <p><strong>Goal:</strong> An ultimate desired state towards which the objectives and resources are directed. Goal is not constrained by time, resources nor are they necessarily attainable. They are formulated at top level and they are generally broad for example 'Health for all.</p>

                        <h4>Planning for health involves 3 types of activities</h4>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Assessment of the current status</li>
                            <li>Identification of the desired state in the future</li>
                            <li>Specification of interventions and other activities to achieve the new desired state.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h4>Planning involves following steps</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Analysis of health situation</li>
                            <li>Establishment of objectives and goals</li>
                            <li>Assessment of resources</li>
                            <li>Fixing priorities</li>
                            <li>Write up of formulate plan</li>
                            <li>Programming and implementation</li>
                            <li>Evaluation.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h5>Analysis of health situation:</h5>
                        <p>The minimum essential requirement of health planning includes</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>The population its age and sex structure</li>
                            <li>Mortality and morbidity statistics</li>
                            <li>The Epidemiology and geographical distributions of diseases</li>
                            <li>Medical care facilities available such as hospitals, health centres and other private and public health agencies.</li>
                            <li>The man power available</li>
                            <li>Training facilities available</li>
                            <li>Beliefs and attitude of people towards health, disease, its cure and prevention.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>The analysis of the above data brings out health problems, needs and demands of the population.</p>

                        <h5>Establishment of goals and objectives</h5>
                        <p>Objectives are the guide for action.</p>
                        <p>Objectives needed for economical and better performance of programme.</p>
                        <p>Objectives should be established at all levels at upper level it is more general and lower level it is more detail and specific.</p>
                        <p>Objectives may be long term and short term. In setting up these objectives time and resources are important factors</p>
                        <p>Objectives shout be - <strong>SMART</strong> (Specific, simple - Measurable - Achievable - Relevant - Time bound)</p>

                        <h5>Assessment of resources:</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Man power</li>
                            <li>Money</li>
                            <li>Materials</li>
                            <li>Skills</li>
                            <li>Knowledge and techniques needed or available for the implementation of the health programme.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h5>Fixing priorities</h5>
                        <p>Establish the priorities in the order of magnitude of health problems.</p>
                        <p>Prioritisation is based on financial constraint, mortality and morbidity data, diseases which can be prevented at low cost, political and community interest.</p>
                        <p>Once priorities are established alternative plans are formulated and assessed to determine whether they are practicable feasible.</p>
                        <p>Alternate plan with greater effectiveness are chosen.</p>

                        <h5>Write-up formulated plan</h5>
                        <p>The plan should be complete in all aspect.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The input required for the health programme and the output expected</li>
                            <li>Cost and time needed for each stage of implementation of the health programme</li>
                            <li>Working guidance for all those involved in the implementation of the health programme</li>
                            <li>It must contain a' built in' system of evaluation</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h5>Programming and implementation:</h5>
                        <p>Once the plan is approved by policy making authorities programme and implementation are begun.</p>
                        <p>The effective implantation of the programme depends upon the existence of effective organization.</p>
                        <p>The main consideration at implementation stage include</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Defining of the role and task</li>
                            <li>Selection, training, motivation and supervision of the manpower involved</li>

                        </ol>

                        <h5>Evaluation:</h5>
                        <p>It is the final step of planning cycle. It should be both concurrent and terminal.</p>
                        <p>The purpose of evolution is to assess the achievements of stated objectives, its adequacy, efficiency and its acceptance by the people.</p>
