                            <p>The first part of this chapter describes the structure and function of the cardiovascular system, comprising the heart, a fist-sized muscular organ lying between the lungs, and an extensive system of blood vessels, carrying blood pumped by the heart to all body tissues. Impressively, the average adult contains nearly $100,000 \mathrm{~km}$ of blood vessels, more than enough to stretch around the Equator twice, and the heart beats over two and a half billion times in an average 70-year lifespan. Cardiovascular function normally declines with age, as discussed on page 120. Disease of the cardiovascular system is common in most parts of the world, and some common cardiovascular conditions are discussed in the illnesses section.</p>
                            <p>The lymphatic system is closely connected, both structurally and functionally, with the cardiovascular system and is discussed in Chapter 6.</p>

                            <p>The right side of the heart pumps blood to the lungs (the <strong>pulmonary circulation</strong>), where gas exchange occurs, i.e. the blood collects oxygen from the air sacs and excess carbon dioxide diffuses into the air sacs for exhalation. The left side of the heart pumps blood into the <strong>systemic circulation</strong>, which supplies the rest of the body. Here, tissue wastes are passed into the blood for excretion, and body cells extract nutrients and oxygen.</p>
                            <p>The cardiovascular system ensures a continuous flow of blood to all body cells, and is subject to continual physiological adjustments to maintain an adequate blood supply. Should the supply of oxygen and nutrients to body cells become inadequate, tissue damage occurs and cell death may follow.</p>

                            <h4>Arteries and arterioles</h4>
                            <p>Arterial walls are thicker than venous walls to withstand the higher pressure of blood in the arterial system. The structure of arterial walls varies, depending on how close the artery lies to the heart. In the largest arteries (sometimes called <strong>elastic arteries</strong>) the tunica media contains more elastic tissue and little smooth muscle. This allows the vessel wall to stretch, absorbing the pressure wave generated by the heart as it beats. These proportions gradually change as the arteries branch many times and become smaller, until in the arterioles (the smallest arteries) the tunica media consists almost entirely of smooth muscle. This enables their diameter to be precisely controlled, which regulates the pressure within them. Systemic blood pressure is mainly determined by the resistance these tiny arteries offer to blood flow, and for this reason they are called <strong>resistance vessels</strong>.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>Anastomoses and end-arteries</strong><br>
                            Anastomoses are arteries that form a link between the main arteries supplying an area, e.g. the arterial supply to the palms of the hand (p. 108) and soles of the feet, the brain, the joints and, to a limited extent, the heart muscle. If one artery supplying the area is blocked, anastomotic arteries provide a collateral circulation. This is most likely to provide an adequate blood supply when the blockage occurs gradually, giving the anastomotic arteries time to dilate.</p>
                            <p>An end-artery is an artery that is the sole source of blood to a tissue, e.g. the branches from the circulus arteriosus (circle of Willis) in the brain or the central artery to the retina of the eye. When an end-artery is blocked the tissues it supplies die because there is no alternative blood supply.</p>

                            <h4>Capillaries and sinusoids</h4>
                            <p>The smallest arterioles branch into huge numbers of minute capillaries. Capillary walls consist of a single layer of endothelial cells sitting on a very thin basement membrane, permeable to water and other small molecules. Blood cells and large molecules such as plasma proteins are normally too large to diffuse through. The capillaries form a vast network of tiny vessels that link the smallest arterioles to the smallest venules. Capillary diameter varies from 3–4 $\mu$m (about half the diameter of a red blood cell) to about 170 $\mu$m in the liver, where rapid and extensive exchange of materials is very important to allow the liver to modify the composition of the blood flowing through it. The capillary bed is the site of exchange of substances between the blood and the tissue fluid, which bathes the body cells, and, with the exception of cells on the skin surface and in the cornea of the eye, every body cell lies close to a capillary.</p>
                            <p>In certain places, including the liver and bone marrow, the capillaries are significantly wider and leakier than normal. These capillaries are called <strong>sinusoids</strong> and because their walls are incomplete and their lumen is much larger than usual, blood flows through them more slowly under less pressure and can come directly into contact with the cells outside the sinusoid wall. This allows much faster exchange of substances between the blood and the tissues, useful, for example, in the liver, which regulates the composition of blood arriving from the gastrointestinal tract.</p>

                                    <p>When an area of skin is pressed firmly with a finger, it turns white (blanches) because the blood in the capillaries under the finger has been squeezed out. Normally it should take less than 2 seconds for the capillaries to refill once the finger is removed and for the skin to turn pink again. Although the test may produce unreliable results, particularly in adults, its use in children can be helpful and a prolonged capillary refill time suggests poor perfusion or dehydration.</p>

                            <h4>Veins and venules</h4>
                            <p>Capillaries converge to form tiny venules. Blood pressure drops significantly in the capillary beds, so blood passing into the venous system does so under very low pressure. Venous walls are therefore thinner than arterial walls, although they have the same three layers of tissue.</p>
                            <p>When cut, the veins collapse, whereas the thicker-walled arteries remain open. When an artery is cut, blood spurts at high pressure while a slower, steady flow of blood escapes from a vein.</p>
                            <p>Some veins possess valves, which prevent backflow of blood (Fig. 5.3). They are formed by a fold of tunica intima and strengthened by connective tissue. The cusps are semilunar (half-moon) in shape with the concavity towards the heart. Valves are abundant in the veins of the limbs, especially the lower limbs where blood must travel a considerable distance against gravity when the individual is standing. They are absent in very small and very large veins in the thorax and abdomen. Valves and the skeletal muscle pump (p. 95) ensure one-way flow back to the heart.</p>
                            <p>Veins are called <strong>capacitance vessels</strong> because they stretch, and therefore have the capacity to hold a large proportion of the body's blood. At any one time, about two-thirds of the body's blood is in the venous system. This allows the vascular system to absorb (to an extent) sudden changes in blood volume, such as in haemorrhage; the veins can constrict, helping to prevent a sudden fall in blood pressure.</p>

                            <p>The outer layers of tissue of thick-walled blood vessels receive their blood supply via a network of blood vessels called the <strong>vasa vasorum</strong>. Thin-walled vessels and the endothelium of the others receive oxygen and nutrients by diffusion from the blood passing through them.</p>

                            <h3>Capillary exchange</h3>
                            <p><strong>Exchange of gases</strong><br>
                            Internal respiration (Fig. 5.4; see also p. 280) is the process by which gases are exchanged between capillary blood and local body cells. Exchange of gases in the lungs, across the capillary walls there, is called external respiration.</p>

                            <p>Oxygen is carried from the lungs to the tissues in combination with haemoglobin (p. 65) as oxyhaemoglobin. When the blood arrives in the capillaries, with their permeable walls, it diffuses down its concentration gradient, from the oxygen-rich arterial blood, into the tissues, where oxygen levels are lower because of constant tissue consumption.</p>
                            <p>Oxyhaemoglobin is an unstable compound and breaks up (dissociates) easily to liberate oxygen. Factors that increase dissociation are discussed on page 66.</p>
                            <p>Carbon dioxide is one of the waste products of cell metabolism and it diffuses into the blood across the thin capillary wall down its concentration gradient. Blood transports carbon dioxide by three different mechanisms to the lungs for excretion:</p>

                            <p>Nutrients, including glucose, amino acids, fatty acids, vitamins and mineral salts required by all body cells, are transported round the body in the plasma. They diffuse through the semipermeable capillary walls into the tissues (Fig. 5.5). Water exchanges freely between the plasma and tissue fluid by osmosis. Diffusion and osmosis are described on page 36.</p>

                            <h4>Capillary fluid dynamics</h4>
                            <p>The two main forces determining overall fluid movement across the capillary wall are the <strong>hydrostatic pressure</strong> (blood pressure), which tends to push fluid out of the bloodstream, and the <strong>osmotic pressure</strong> of the blood, which tends to pull it back in, and is due mainly to the presence of plasma proteins, especially albumin (Fig. 5.6).</p>
                            <p>At the arterial end the hydrostatic pressure is about $5 \mathrm{kPa}(35 \mathrm{mmHg})$, and the opposing osmotic pressure of the blood is only $3 \mathrm{kPa}(25 \mathrm{mmHg})$. The net force at the arterial end of the capillary is therefore an outward pressure of $2 \mathrm{kPa}$ ($15 \mathrm{mmHg}$) and this drives fluid out of the capillary and into the tissue spaces. This net loss of fluid from the bloodstream must be reclaimed because over 20 litres of fluid are filtered out of the body's capillaries every day.</p>
                            <p>At the venous end of the capillary the situation is reversed. Blood flow is slower than at the arterial end because the hydrostatic pressure drops along the capillary to only $2 \mathrm{kPa}(15 \mathrm{mmHg})$. The osmotic pressure remains unchanged at $3 \mathrm{kPa}$ ($25 \mathrm{mmHg}$) and, because this now exceeds hydrostatic pressure, fluid moves back into the capillary.</p>

                            <p>This transfer of substances, including water, to the tissue spaces is a dynamic process. As blood flows slowly through the large network of capillaries from the arterial to the venous end, there is constant change. Not all the water and cell waste products return to the blood capillaries. Of the 24 litres or so of fluid that move out of the blood across capillary walls every day, only about 21 litres return to the bloodstream at the venous end of the capillary bed. The remaining 3 litres drain away from the tissue spaces in the minute lymph capillaries, which originate as blind-ended tubes with walls similar to, but more permeable than, those of the blood capillaries (Fig. 5.5). This extra tissue fluid and some cell waste materials enter the lymph capillaries, forming lymph that is eventually returned to the bloodstream (Ch. 6).</p>

                            <h4>Pericardium</h4>
                            <p>The pericardium is the outermost layer and is made up of two sacs. The outer sac (the <strong>fibrous pericardium</strong>) consists of fibrous tissue and the inner (the <strong>serous pericardium</strong>) of a continuous double layer of serous membrane.</p>
                            <p>The fibrous pericardium is continuous with the tunica adventitia of the great blood vessels above and is attached to the diaphragm below. Its inelastic, fibrous nature protects and prevents over-distension of the heart.</p>
                            <p>The serous pericardium is a membrane formed by a single layer of endothelial cells, folded over itself so that it forms a double membrane around the heart, with an enclosed space in between the layers (Fig. 5.10). A similar arrangement is seen round the lungs with the pleura (see Fig. 10.15).</p>
                            <p>The inner layer is firmly attached to the myocardium below and is called the <strong>visceral pericardium</strong>. The outer layer is the <strong>parietal pericardium</strong>, and it lines the fibrous pericardium. About 20 mL of lubricating fluid, the pericardial fluid, lie between the two layers, so that the heart can beat without rubbing against the fibrous pericardium.</p>

                            <h4>Myocardium</h4>
                            <p>The myocardium is composed of specialised cardiac muscle found only in the heart (see Fig. 5.9B). It is striated, like skeletal muscle, but is not under voluntary control. Each fibre (cell) has a nucleus and one or more branches. The ends of the cells and their branches are in very close contact with the ends and branches of adjacent cells. Microscopically, these 'joints', or intercalated discs, are thicker, darker lines than the striations. This arrangement gives cardiac muscle the appearance of being a sheet of muscle rather than a very large number of individual cells. Because of the end-to-end continuity of the fibres, each one does not need to have a separate nerve supply. When an impulse is initiated, it spreads from cell to cell via the branches and intercalated discs over the whole 'sheet' of muscle, causing contraction. The 'sheet' arrangement of the myocardium enables the whole heart to contract in a coordinated and efficient manner.</p>
                            <p>Running through the myocardium is also the network of specialised conducting fibres responsible for transmitting the heart's electrical signals. The myocardium is thickest at the apex and thins out towards the base (Fig. 5.11). The wall of the left ventricle is thicker than the right because it has to pump blood around the body, whereas the right ventricle pumps blood, under low pressure, only to the lungs.</p>
                            <p>Specialised muscle cells in the walls of the atria secrete atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP, p. 247).</p>
                            <p><strong>Fibrous tissue in the heart</strong><br>
                            The myocardium is supported by a network of fine fibres that run through all the heart muscle. This is called the fibrous skeleton of the heart. In addition, the atria and the ventricles are separated by a ring of fibrous tissue, which does not conduct electrical impulses. Consequently, when a wave of electrical activity passes over the atrial muscle, it can spread only to the ventricles through the conducting system that bridges the fibrous ring from atria to ventricles (Fig. 5.16).</p>

                            <h4>Endocardium</h4>
                            <p>This lines the chambers and valves of the heart. It is a thin, smooth membrane to ensure smooth flow of blood through the heart. It consists of flattened epithelial cells, and it is continuous with the endothelium lining the blood vessels.</p>

                                
                            <h3>Interior of the heart</h3>
                            <p>The heart is divided into a right and left side by the septum (Fig. 5.11), a partition consisting of myocardium covered by endocardium. After birth, blood cannot cross the septum from one side to the other. Each side is divided by an atrioventricular valve into the upper atrium and the ventricle below; Fig. 5.12A). The atrioventricular valves are formed by double folds of endocardium strengthened by a little fibrous tissue. The right atrioventricular valve (tricuspid valve) has three flaps or cusps, and the left atrioventricular valve (mitral valve) has two cusps. Flow of blood in the heart is one-way: blood enters the heart via the atria and passes into the ventricles below.</p>

                            <p>The valves between the atria and ventricles open and close passively, according to changes in pressure in the chambers (Fig. 5.12B and C). They open when the pressure in the atria is greater than that in the ventricles. During ventricular systole (contraction) the pressure in the ventricles rises above that in the atria and the valves snap shut, preventing backward flow of blood. The valves are prevented from opening upwards into the atria by inelastic tendinous cords, called chordae tendineae (Fig. 5.12D), which fasten the inferior surface of the cusps to the papillary muscles. The papillary muscles, tiny extensions of the myocardium, anchor the chordae tendineae firmly to the ventricular wall.</p>

                            <h3>Flow of blood through the heart</h3>
                            <p>The two largest veins of the body, the superior vena cava and inferior vena cava (Fig. 5.13), empty their contents into the right atrium. This blood passes through the right atrioventricular valve into the right ventricle, and from there is pumped into the pulmonary artery or trunk. The opening of the pulmonary artery is guarded by the pulmonary valve, formed by three semilunar cusps (Fig. 5.14). This valve prevents the backflow of blood into the right ventricle when the ventricular muscle relaxes. The pulmonary trunk divides into left and right pulmonary arteries, which carry the venous blood to the lungs, where exchange of gases takes place: carbon dioxide is excreted and oxygen is absorbed.</p>

                            <p>Two pulmonary veins from each lung carry oxygenated blood back to the left atrium. Blood then passes through the left atrioventricular valve into the left ventricle, and from there it is pumped into the aorta, the first artery of the general circulation. The opening of the aorta is guarded by the aortic valve, formed by three semilunar cusps (Fig. 5.14), which prevents blood flowing back into the left ventricle at the end of each contraction.</p>

                            <p>The blood thus passes from the right to the left side of the heart via the lungs, or pulmonary circulation (see Fig. 5.1). Note that both atria contract at the same time and this is followed by the simultaneous contraction of both ventricles.</p>
                            <p>The muscle layer of the walls of the atria is thinner than that of the ventricles (see Fig. 5.11). This is consistent with the amount of work they do. The atria, significantly helped by gravity, pump the blood only through the atrioventricular valves into the ventricles, whereas the more powerful ventricles pump the blood to the lungs and round the whole body.</p>

                            <h3>Blood supply to the heart (the coronary circulation)</h3>
                            <h4>Arterial supply</h4>
                            <p>The heart is supplied with arterial blood by the right and left coronary arteries, which branch from the aorta immediately distal to the aortic valve (Fig. 5.15; see also Fig. 5.14). The coronary arteries receive about 5% of the blood pumped from the heart, although the heart is only about 0.5% of body weight. This disproportionately large blood supply, of which most goes to the left ventricle, highlights the importance of the heart to body function. The coronary arteries branch throughout the heart, eventually forming a vast network of capillaries.</p>

                            <h4>Venous drainage</h4>
                            <p>Most of the venous blood is collected into a number of cardiac veins that join to form the coronary sinus, which opens into the right atrium. The remainder passes directly into the heart chambers through little venous channels.</p>

                            <h3>Conducting system of the heart</h3>
                            <p>The heart possesses the property of <strong>autorhythmicity</strong>, which means it generates its own electrical impulses and beats independently of nervous or hormonal control, i.e. it is not reliant on external mechanisms to initiate each heartbeat. However, it is supplied with both sympathetic and parasympathetic nerve fibres, which increase and decrease, respectively, the intrinsic heart rate. In addition, the heart responds to a number of circulating hormones, including adrenaline (epinephrine) and thyroxine.</p>
                            <p>Small groups of specialised neuromuscular cells in the myocardium initiate and conduct impulses, causing coordinated and synchronised contraction of the heart muscle (Fig. 5.16).</p>

                            <p><strong>Sinoatrial node</strong><br>
                            The sinoatrial node (SA node) is a small mass of specialised cells that lies in the wall of the right atrium near the opening of the superior vena cava (Fig. 5.16).</p>
                            <p>The sinoatrial cells generate these regular impulses because they are electrically unstable. This instability leads them to discharge (depolarise) regularly, usually between 60 and 90 times a minute. This depolarisation is followed by recovery (repolarisation), but almost immediately their instability leads them to discharge again. Because the SA node discharges faster than any other part of the heart, it normally sets the heart rate and is called the <strong>pacemaker</strong> of the heart. Firing of the SA node triggers atrial contraction.</p>
                            <p>The impulse from the SA node arrives at the atrioventricular node about 0.1 second later. This is the only conducting pathway linking the atria and the ventricles because of the ring of fibrous non-conducting tissue separating the upper and lower parts of the heart.</p>

                            <p><strong>Atrioventricular node</strong><br>
                            The atrioventricular node (AV node) is a small mass of neuromuscular tissue that is situated in the wall of the atrial septum near the atrioventricular valves (Fig. 5.16). Normally, the AV node merely transmits the electrical signals from the atria into the ventricles. There is a delay here; the electrical signal takes 0.1 second to pass through into the ventricles. This allows the atria to finish contracting before the ventricles start.</p>
                            <p>The AV node also has a secondary pacemaker function and takes over this role if there is a problem with the SA node itself, or with the transmission of impulses from the atria. Its intrinsic firing rate, however, is slower than that set by the SA node (40–60 beats per minute, or b.p.m.).</p>

                            <p><strong>Atrioventricular bundle</strong><br>
                            The atrioventricular bundle (AV bundle or bundle of His) is a mass of specialised fibres that originates from the AV node. The AV bundle passes through the fibrous ring that separates atria and ventricles then, at the upper end of the ventricular septum, it divides into right and left bundle branches. Within the ventricular myocardium the branches break up into fine fibres, called the Purkinje fibres. The AV bundle, bundle branches and Purkinje fibres transmit electrical impulses from the AV node to the apex of the myocardium, where the wave of ventricular contraction begins; it then sweeps upwards and outwards, pumping blood into the pulmonary artery and the aorta.</p>

                            <p><strong>Nerve supply to the heart</strong><br>
                            As mentioned earlier, the heart is influenced by autonomic (sympathetic and parasympathetic) nerves originating in the cardiovascular centre in the medulla oblongata.</p>
                            <p>The <strong>vagus nerve</strong> (parasympathetic) supplies mainly the SA and AV nodes and atrial muscle. Vagal stimulation reduces the rate of SA node firing, decreasing the rate and force of the heartbeat.</p>
                            <p><strong>Sympathetic nerves</strong> supply the SA and AV nodes and the myocardium, and stimulation increases the rate and force of the heartbeat.</p>

                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>It does not matter at which stage of the cardiac cycle a description starts. For convenience the period when the atria are filling has been chosen.</p>
                            <p>The atria are continually filling with blood from the superior and inferior venae cavae (into the right atrium) and the pulmonary veins (into the left atrium). As pressure rises in the atria the atrioventricular valves are pushed open and blood flows passively into the ventricles, helped by gravity if the thorax is upright. Up to 70% of ventricular filling can be accomplished without any atrial contraction at all.</p>
                            <p>The SA node triggers a wave of contraction that spreads over the myocardium of both atria, emptying the atria and completing ventricular filling (atrial systole 0.1 second; Fig. 5.17A). When the electrical impulse reaches the AV node it is slowed down, delaying atrioventricular transmission. This delay means that the mechanical result of atrial stimulation, atrial contraction, lags behind the electrical activity by a fraction of a second. This allows the atria to finish emptying into the ventricles before the ventricles begin to contract. After this brief delay, the AV node triggers its own electrical impulse, which quickly spreads to the ventricular muscle via the AV bundle, the bundle branches and Purkinje fibres. This results in a wave of contraction that sweeps upwards from the apex of the heart and across the walls of both ventricles, pumping the blood into the pulmonary artery and the aorta (ventricular systole 0.3 second; Fig. 5.17B). The high pressure generated during ventricular contraction forces the atrioventricular valves to close, preventing backflow of blood into the atria.</p>
                            <p>Contraction of the ventricles is followed by complete cardiac diastole, a period of 0.4 second, when atria and ventricles are relaxed. During this time the myocardium recovers, ready for the next heartbeat, and the atria refill, ready for the next cycle (Fig. 5.17C).</p>
                            <p>The valves of the heart and those of the great vessels open and close, according to the pressure within the chambers of the heart. The atrioventricular valves open during atrial filling and systole because pressure in the atria is higher than in the ventricles. When the ventricles contract, there is a rapid increase in the ventricular pressure, and when it rises above atrial pressure the atrioventricular valves close. When the ventricular pressure rises above that in the pulmonary artery and in the aorta, the pulmonary and aortic valves open and blood flows into these vessels. When the ventricles relax and the pressure within them falls, the reverse process occurs. First the pulmonary and aortic valves close, then the atrioventricular valves open and the cycle begins again.</p>
                            <p>This sequence of opening and closing valves ensures that the blood flows in only one direction.</p>

                            <h3>Heart sounds</h3>
                            <p>If the ear or the diaphragm of a stethoscope is placed on the chest wall a little below the left nipple and slightly nearer the midline, the heartbeat can be heard over the apex of the heart.</p>
                            <p>There are four heart sounds, each corresponding to a particular event in the cardiac cycle. The first two are most easily distinguished, and through the stethoscope sound like 'lub dup'. The first sound, 'lub', is fairly loud and is due to the closure of the atrioventricular valves. This corresponds with the start of ventricular systole. The second sound, 'dup', is softer and is due to the closure of the aortic and pulmonary valves. This corresponds with ventricular diastole.</p>

                            <h3>Electrical activity in the heart</h3>
                            <p>The body tissues and fluids conduct electricity well, so the electrical activity in the heart can be recorded on the skin surface using electrodes positioned on the limbs and/or the chest. This recording, called an <strong>electrocardiogram</strong> (ECG), shows the spread of the electrical signal generated by the SA node as it travels through the atria, the AV node and the ventricles. The normal ECG tracing shows five waves, which, by convention, have been named P, Q, R, S and T (Fig. 5.18).</p>

                            <p>The <strong>P wave</strong> represents the impulse from the SA node sweeping over the atria (atrial depolarisation).</p>
                            <p>The <strong>QRS complex</strong> represents the very rapid spread of the impulse from the AV node through the AV bundle and the Purkinje fibres, and the electrical activity of the ventricular muscle (ventricular depolarisation). Note the delay between the completion of the P wave and the onset of the QRS complex. This represents the conduction of the impulse through the AV node, which is much slower than conduction elsewhere in the heart, and allows atrial contraction to finish completely before ventricular contraction starts.</p>
                            <p>The <strong>T wave</strong> represents the relaxation of the ventricular muscle (ventricular repolarisation). Atrial repolarisation occurs during ventricular contraction, and so is not seen because of the larger QRS complex.</p>
                            <p>The ECG described above and shown in Fig. 5.18 represents normal heart rhythm originating from the SA node, and so is called <strong>sinus rhythm</strong>. Normally, the heart rate falls somewhere between 60 and 90 b.p.m. A heart rate over 100 b.p.m. is called <strong>tachycardia</strong>, and below 60 b.p.m. is <strong>bradycardia</strong>.</p>

                            <h3>Cardiac output</h3>
                            <p>The cardiac output is the amount of blood ejected from each ventricle every minute. The amount expelled by each contraction of each ventricle is the <strong>stroke volume</strong>. Cardiac output is expressed in litres per minute ($\mathrm{L} / \mathrm{min}$) and is calculated by multiplying the stroke volume by the heart rate (measured in beats per minute):</p>
                            <p class="equation">Cardiac output = Stroke volume $\times$ Heart rate</p>
                            <p>In a healthy adult at rest the stroke volume is approximately 70 mL and if the heart rate is $72 / \mathrm{min}$, the cardiac output is $5 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}$. This can increase to around $25 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}$ in exercise, and up to $35 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}$ in athletes. This increase during exercise is called the <strong>cardiac reserve</strong>.</p>

                            <p><strong>Stroke volume</strong><br>
                            The stroke volume is determined by the volume of blood in the ventricles immediately before they contract, i.e. the ventricular end-diastolic volume (VEDV), sometimes called <strong>preload</strong>. In turn, preload depends on the amount of blood returning to the heart through the superior and inferior venae cavae (the venous return). Increased preload leads to stronger myocardial contraction and more blood is expelled, increasing stroke volume and cardiac output. This capacity to increase the stroke volume with increasing preload is finite, and when the limit is reached, i.e. venous return to the heart exceeds cardiac output, cardiac output decreases and the heart begins to fail.</p>

                            This affects the stroke volume, as it creates resistance to blood being pumped from the ventricles into the great arteries. This resistance (sometimes called <strong>afterload</strong>) is determined by the distensibility, or elasticity, of the large arteries and the peripheral resistance of arterioles (p. 96). Increasing afterload increases the workload of the ventricles because it increases the pressure against which they have to pump. This may actually reduce stroke volume if systemic blood pressure becomes significantly higher than normal.</p>

                            <p><strong>Blood volume</strong><br>
                            This is normally kept constant by the kidneys. Should blood volume fall, e.g. through sudden haemorrhage, this can cause stroke volume, cardiac output and venous return to fall.</p>

                            <h3>Venous return</h3>
                            <p>Venous return is the major determinant of cardiac output and the heart normally pumps out all blood returned to it. Systemic venous pressure is much lower than arterial pressure, as the pressure wave from the heart is lost as blood flows through capillaries at low pressure. The blood returns to the heart, assisted by venous valves, despite opposition from gravity but helped by the contraction of skeletal muscles and the respiratory pump.</p>

                            <p><strong>Effect of gravity</strong><br>
                            Gravity resists venous return from all structures below the level of the heart when the body is upright, and can lead to pooling of blood in the lower limbs. Lying down and/or elevating the feet improve blood flow back to the heart.</p>

                            <p><strong>Muscular contraction</strong><br>
                            The contraction of skeletal muscles surrounding the deep veins compresses them, pushing blood towards the heart. In the lower limbs, this is called the <strong>skeletal muscle pump</strong> (Fig. 5.19). Wearing compressive stockings and doing exercises on long flights or during periods of immobility promotes the action of the skeletal muscle pump, helping venous return and reducing the risk that blood pooling in the legs might clot.</p>

                            <p><strong>Respiratory pump</strong><br>
                            During inspiration, chest expansion creates a negative pressure within the thorax, assisting flow of blood towards the heart from the head and arms.</p>

                            <h3>Heart rate</h3>
                            <p>The heart rate is a major determinant of cardiac output. If heart rate rises, cardiac output increases, and if it falls, cardiac output falls too. The main factors determining heart rate are outlined here.</p>

                            <p><strong>Autonomic nervous system</strong><br>
                            The intrinsic rate at which the heart beats is a balance between sympathetic and parasympathetic activity and this is the most important factor in determining heart rate. Sympathetic nervous system activity increases heart rate, whereas parasympathetic activity decreases it.</p>

                            <p><strong>Circulating chemicals</strong><br>
                            The hormones adrenaline (epinephrine) and noradrenaline (norepinephrine), secreted by the adrenal medulla, have the same effect as sympathetic stimulation, i.e. they increase the heart rate. Other hormones, including thyroxine, increase heart rate. Hypoxia and elevated carbon dioxide levels, e.g. in exercise, stimulate heart rate. Electrolyte imbalances may also affect it; for example, hyperkalaemia depresses cardiac function and leads to bradycardia.</p>

                            <p><strong>Position</strong><br>
                            When a person is upright, the heart rate is usually faster than when lying down.</p>

                            <p><strong>Gender</strong><br>
                            The heart rate is faster in women than men.</p>

                            <p><strong>Age</strong><br>
                            In babies and small children the heart rate is more rapid than in older children and adults.</p>

                            <p><strong>Temperature</strong><br>
                            The heart rate rises and falls with body temperature.</p>

                            <p>Blood pressure (BP) is the force or pressure that the blood exerts on the walls of blood vessels. Systemic arterial blood pressure maintains the essential flow of blood into and out of the organs of the body. Keeping blood pressure within normal limits is very important. High blood pressure can damage blood vessels, causing bleeding from sites of blood vessel rupture. Blood flow through tissue beds may be inadequate if blood pressure is too low.</p>

                            <p><strong>Systolic and diastolic pressures</strong><br>
                            When the left ventricle contracts and pushes blood into the aorta, arterial blood pressure rises sharply and produces the <strong>systolic blood pressure</strong>. In adults it is about 120 mmHg. In complete cardiac diastole, when the heart is resting between beats, the pressure within the arteries is much lower and is called <strong>diastolic blood pressure</strong>. In an adult this is about 80 mmHg. The difference between systolic and diastolic blood pressures is the <strong>pulse pressure</strong>.</p>
                            <p>Arterial blood pressure is measured with a sphygmomanometer and is usually expressed with the systolic pressure written above the diastolic pressure:</p>
                            <p class="equation">$\mathrm{BP} = \frac{120}{80} \mathrm{mmHg}$</p>

                            <h4>Relationship between pressure, flow and blood vessel diameter</h4>
                            <p>Blood pressure, blood flow and blood vessel diameter are all very closely interrelated.</p>

                            <p><strong>Tunica media and vessel diameter</strong><br>
                            The tunica media of large arteries contains much elastic tissue, to allow them to expand easily with each heartbeat. When the left ventricle ejects blood into the elastic aorta, the vessel expands to accommodate it and then recoils elastically. In contrast, the tunica media of the smallest arteries and their branches, the arterioles, are rich in smooth muscle and contain much less elastic tissue. Autonomic nerve fibres supply this smooth muscle and control the vessel diameter, regulating flow and pressure. These are the most important vessels that determine systemic blood pressure, and are referred to as resistance vessels.</p>

                            <p><strong>Blood vessel diameter and blood flow</strong><br>
                            Resistance to flow of fluids along a tube is determined by three factors: the diameter of the tube, the length of the tube and the viscosity of the fluid. The most important factor determining how easily blood flows through blood vessels is the first of these variables, i.e. the diameter of the resistance vessels (the <strong>peripheral resistance</strong>).</p>

                            <p>Blood vessel diameter is regulated by the smooth muscle of the tunica media, which is supplied by sympathetic nerves of the autonomic nervous system (p. 186). There is no parasympathetic nerve supply to most blood vessels and therefore vascular smooth muscle tone (degree of contraction) is determined by the degree of sympathetic activity. Sympathetic activity generally constricts blood vessel smooth muscle and narrows the vessel (<strong>vasoconstriction</strong>), increasing the pressure inside. Decreased sympathetic nerve stimulation relaxes the smooth muscle, thinning the vessel wall and enlarging the lumen (<strong>vasodilation</strong>).</p>

                            <p><strong>Baroreceptors</strong><br>
                            Within the wall of the aortic and carotid sinuses there are baroreceptors, nerve endings sensitive to stretch (pressure) (Fig. 5.22), which are the body's principal moment-to-moment regulatory mechanism for controlling blood pressure. A rise in blood pressure in these arteries stimulates the baroreceptors, increasing their input to the CVC. The CVC responds by increasing parasympathetic nerve activity to the heart; this slows the heart down. At the same time, sympathetic stimulation to the blood vessels is inhibited, causing vasodilation. The net result is a fall in systemic blood pressure to reverse the initial rise.</p>

                            <p><strong>Chemoreceptors</strong><br>
                            These are nerve endings situated in the carotid and aortic bodies; they are primarily involved in control of respiration. They are sensitive to changes in the levels of carbon dioxide, oxygen and the acidity of the blood (pH) (Fig. 5.23). Rising blood $CO_2$, falling blood $O_2$ levels and/or falling arterial blood pH all indicate failing tissue perfusion. When these changes are detected by the chemoreceptors, they send signals to the CVC, which then increases sympathetic drive to the heart and blood vessels, pushing blood pressure up to improve tissue blood supply.</p>

                            <p><strong>Higher centres in the brain</strong><br>
                            Input to the CVC from the higher centres is influenced by emotional states such as fear, anxiety, pain and anger that may stimulate changes in blood pressure. The hypothalamus in the brain controls body temperature and influences the CVC, which responds by adjusting the diameter of blood vessels in the skin.</p>

                            <p>The pulse can be felt with gentle finger pressure in a superficial artery when its wall is distended by blood pumped from the left ventricle during contraction (systole). Each contraction of the left ventricle forces about 60–80 mL of blood through the already full aorta and into the arterial system. The aortic pressure wave is transmitted through the arterial system and can be felt at any point where a superficial artery can be pressed firmly but gently against a bone (Fig. 5.24).</p>

                            <h4>Pulmonary circulation</h4>
                            <p>This is the circulation of blood from the right ventricle to the lungs and back to the left atrium. In the lungs, carbon dioxide is excreted and oxygen is absorbed.</p>
                            <p>The <strong>pulmonary artery</strong> or trunk, carrying deoxygenated blood, leaves the upper part of the right ventricle. It passes upwards and divides into left and right pulmonary arteries at the level of the 5th thoracic vertebra. The pulmonary arteries enter their respective lungs at the hilum, and divide into smaller branches that in turn eventually give rise to the dense network of capillaries surrounding the alveoli, the tiny air sacs of the lungs.</p>
                            <p>Exchange of gases takes place between capillary blood and air in the alveoli (p. 280). In each lung the capillaries containing oxygenated blood merge into progressively larger venules, and eventually form two pulmonary veins. These two <strong>pulmonary veins</strong> leave each lung, returning oxygenated blood to the left atrium of the heart. During atrial systole, this blood is pumped into the left ventricle, and during ventricular systole, it is forced into the aorta, the first artery of the general circulation.</p>

                            <h3>Major blood vessels</h3>
                            <p>The aorta is the largest artery of the body. The two largest veins, the superior and inferior venae cavae, return blood from all body parts to the heart.</p>

                            <h4>Aorta</h4>
                            <p>The aorta (Fig. 5.27) begins at the upper part of the left ventricle and, after passing upwards for a short way, it arches backwards and to the left. It then descends behind the heart through the thoracic cavity a little to the left of the thoracic vertebrae. At the level of the 12th thoracic vertebra it passes behind the diaphragm, then downwards in the abdominal cavity to the level of the 4th lumbar vertebra, where it divides into the right and left common iliac arteries.</p>
                            <p>Throughout its length the aorta gives off numerous branches. Some of the branches are paired, i.e. there is a right and left branch with the same name (e.g. the right and left renal arteries supplying the kidneys), and some are single or unpaired (e.g. the coeliac artery).</p>

                            <p><em>Ascending aorta.</em> This is the short section of the aorta that rises from the heart. It is about 5 cm long and lies well protected behind the sternum. The right and left coronary arteries are its only branches. They open just above the level of the aortic valve (see Fig. 5.14) and supply the myocardium.</p>
                            
                            <p><em>Arch of the aorta.</em> The aorta curves sharply downwards behind the left side of the heart, in front of the trachea, forming the aortic arch. The arch is clearly visible on frontal chest X-rays, and three arteries arise from its upper curve: the brachiocephalic artery, the left common carotid artery and the left subclavian artery.</p>
                            <p>The <strong>brachiocephalic artery</strong> is 4–5 cm long and passes obliquely upwards, backwards and to the right. At the level of the sternoclavicular joint it divides into the right common carotid artery and the right subclavian artery.</p>

                            <p><em>Descending aorta in the thorax.</em> This is the long segment of the aorta that descends to the diaphragm and begins at the level of the 4th thoracic vertebra. It extends downwards immediately in front of the bodies of the thoracic vertebrae to the level of the 12th thoracic vertebra, where it passes behind the diaphragm to become the abdominal aorta.</p>
                            <p>The descending aorta in the thorax gives off many paired branches that supply the walls and organs of the thoracic cavity (p. 110).</p>

                            <p><strong>Abdominal aorta</strong><br>
                            The abdominal aorta (Fig. 5.27) is a continuation of the thoracic aorta. The name changes when the aorta enters the abdominal cavity by passing behind the diaphragm at the level of the 12th thoracic vertebra. It descends in front of the vertebral column to the level of the 4th lumbar vertebra, where it divides into the right and left common iliac arteries.</p>
                            <p>Many branches arise from the abdominal aorta, some paired and some unpaired, supplying the abdominal structures and organs (p. 111).</p>

                            <h4>Venae cavae</h4>
                            <p>The superior and inferior venae cavae (Fig. 5.28) are the largest veins in the body and empty blood directly into the right atrium of the heart (see Fig. 5.13). The superior vena cava drains all body structures lying above the diaphragm and the inferior vena cava drains blood from all structures below the diaphragm.</p>

                            This is about 7 cm long and is formed by the union of the left and right brachiocephalic veins.</p>

                            This is formed at the level of the 5th lumbar vertebra by the union of the right and left common iliac veins, and ascends through the abdomen, lying close against the vertebral column and parallel to and just to the right of the descending abdominal aorta. It passes through the central tendon of the diaphragm into the thorax at the level of the 8th thoracic vertebra. As the inferior vena cava ascends through the abdomen, veins draining pelvic and abdominal organs empty into it (p. 112).</p>

                            <h3>Arterial supply</h3>
                            <p>The paired arteries supplying the head and neck are the common carotid arteries and the vertebral arteries (Figs 5.29 and 5.30).</p>

                            <h4>Carotid arteries</h4>
                            <p>The right common carotid artery is a branch of the brachiocephalic artery. The left common carotid artery arises directly from the arch of the aorta. These pass upwards on either side of the neck and have the same distribution on each side. The common carotid arteries are embedded in a fascia, called the carotid sheath. At the level of the upper border of the thyroid cartilage each divides into an internal carotid artery and an external carotid artery.</p>
                            <p>The <strong>carotid sinuses</strong> are slight dilations at the point of division (bifurcation) of the common carotid arteries into their internal and external branches. The walls of the sinuses are thin and contain numerous nerve endings of the glossopharyngeal nerves. These nerve endings, or baroreceptors, are stimulated by changes in blood pressure in the carotid sinuses. The resultant nerve impulses initiate reflex adjustments of blood pressure through the vasomotor centre in the medulla oblongata (p. 98).</p>
                            <p>The <strong>carotid bodies</strong> are two small groups of chemoreceptors, one lying in close association with each common carotid artery at its bifurcation. They are supplied by the glossopharyngeal nerves and are stimulated by changes in the carbon dioxide and oxygen content of blood. When activated, they initiate reflex adjustments of respiration through the respiratory centre in the medulla oblongata (p. 275).</p>

                            <p><strong>Internal carotid artery.</strong> The internal carotid artery is a major contributor to the circulus arteriosus (circle of Willis) (Figs 5.30 and 5.31), which supplies most of the brain. It also has branches that supply the eyes, forehead and nose. It ascends to the base of the skull and passes through the carotid foramen in the temporal bone.</p>

                            <h4>Circulus arteriosus (circle of Willis)</h4>
                            <p>Most of the brain is supplied with arterial blood by an arrangement of arteries called the circulus arteriosus or the circle of Willis, Fig. 5.31. Four large arteries, the two internal carotid arteries and the two vertebral arteries (see Fig. 5.30), unite to form this complete circular channel lying in the subarachnoid space on the underside of the brain. The vertebral arteries arise from the subclavian arteries, pass upwards through the foramina in the transverse processes of the cervical vertebrae, enter the skull through the foramen magnum, and then join to form the basilar artery. The arrangement in the circulus arteriosus is such that the brain receives an adequate blood supply even if a contributing artery is damaged and during extreme movements of the head and neck.</p>

                            <p>The <strong>internal jugular veins</strong> begin at the jugular foramina in the middle cranial fossa (see Fig. 16.12) and each is the continuation of a sigmoid sinus. They run downwards in the neck behind the sternocleidomastoid muscles. Behind the clavicle they unite with the subclavian veins, carrying blood from the upper limbs, to form the brachiocephalic veins.</p>
                            <p>The <strong>brachiocephalic veins</strong> are situated one on each side in the root of the neck. Each is formed by the union of the internal jugular and the subclavian veins. The left brachiocephalic vein is longer than the right and passes obliquely behind the manubrium of the sternum, where it joins the right brachiocephalic vein to form the superior vena cava (see Fig. 5.28).</p>
                            <p>The <strong>superior vena cava</strong>, which drains all the venous blood from the head, neck and upper limbs, is about 7 cm long. It passes downwards along the right border of the sternum and ends in the right atrium of the heart.</p>

                            <h4>The subclavian arteries</h4>
                            <p>The right subclavian artery arises from the brachiocephalic artery, the left branches from the arch of the aorta. They are slightly arched and pass behind the clavicles and over the first ribs before entering the axillae, where they continue as the axillary arteries (Fig. 5.34).</p>
                            <p>Before entering the axilla, each subclavian artery gives off two branches: the <strong>vertebral artery</strong>, which passes upwards to supply the brain (see Fig. 5.30), and the <strong>internal thoracic artery</strong>, which supplies the breast and a number of structures in the thoracic cavity.</p>
                            
                            <p>The <strong>axillary artery</strong> is a continuation of the subclavian artery and lies in the axilla. The first part lies deeply, then it runs more superficially to become the brachial artery.</p>
                            
                            <p>The <strong>brachial artery</strong> is a continuation of the axillary artery. It runs down the medial aspect of the upper arm, passes to the front of the elbow and extends to about 1 cm below the joint, where it divides into the radial and ulnar arteries.</p>
                            
                            <p>The <strong>radial artery</strong> passes down the radial or lateral side of the forearm to the wrist. Just above the wrist it lies superficially and can be felt in front of the radius, as the radial pulse. The artery then passes between the first and second metacarpal bones and enters the palm of the hand.</p>
                            
                            <p>The <strong>ulnar artery</strong> runs downwards on the ulnar or medial aspect of the forearm to cross the wrist and pass into the hand.</p>
                            
                            <p>There are anastomoses between the radial and ulnar arteries, called the <strong>deep</strong> and <strong>superficial palmar arches</strong>, from which <strong>palmar metacarpal</strong> and <strong>palmar digital arteries</strong> arise to supply the structures in the hand and fingers.</p>

                            <p>The <strong>cephalic vein</strong> begins at the back of the hand, where it collects blood from a complex of superficial veins, many of which can be easily seen. It then winds round the radial side to the anterior aspect of the forearm. In front of the elbow it gives off a large branch, the <strong>median cubital vein</strong>, which slants upwards and medially to join the basilic vein. After crossing the elbow joint the cephalic vein passes up the lateral aspect of the arm and in front of the shoulder joint to end in the axillary vein. Throughout its length it receives blood from the superficial tissues on the lateral aspects of the hand, forearm and arm.</p>
                            
                            <p>The <strong>basilic vein</strong> begins at the back of the hand on the ulnar aspect. It ascends on the medial side of the forearm and upper arm, then joins the axillary vein. It receives blood from the medial aspect of the hand, forearm and arm. There are many small veins that link the cephalic and basilic veins.</p>
                            
                            <p>The <strong>median vein</strong> is a small vein that is not always present. It begins at the palmar surface of the hand, ascends on the front of the forearm and ends in the basilic vein or the median cubital vein.</p>
                            
                            <p>The <strong>brachiocephalic vein</strong> is formed when the subclavian and internal jugular veins unite. There is one on each side.</p>
                            
                            <p>The <strong>superior vena cava</strong> is formed when the two brachiocephalic veins unite. It drains all the venous blood from the head, neck and upper limbs and opens into the right atrium. It is about 7 cm long and passes downwards along the right border of the sternum.</p>

                            <p>Most of the venous blood from the organs in the thoracic cavity is drained into the <strong>azygos vein</strong> and the <strong>hemiazygos vein</strong> (see Fig. 5.28). Some of the main veins that join them are the bronchial, oesophageal and intercostal veins. The azygos vein joins the superior vena cava and the hemiazygos vein joins the left brachiocephalic vein. At the distal end of the oesophagus, some oesophageal veins join the azygos vein, and others the left gastric vein. A venous plexus is formed by anastomoses between the veins joining the azygos vein and those joining the left gastric veins, linking the general and portal circulations (see Fig. 12.47). There are many anastomotic connections between veins draining the thoracic and abdominal cavities, so that if one channel becomes blocked, the blood has an alternative route back to the heart.</p>

                            <h3>Venous return</h3>
                            <p>Blood drains from some abdominal organs directly into the inferior vena cava via veins named as the corresponding arteries (see Fig. 5.28). Hepatic veins drain the liver, renal veins drain the kidneys, suprarenal veins drain the adrenal glands, lumbar veins drain lower abdominal structures and gonadal veins drain the ovaries (female) and testes (male). However, most blood from the digestive organs in the abdomen is drained into the hepatic portal vein and passes through the liver before being emptied into the inferior vena cava (the portal circulation).</p>

                            <h4>Portal circulation</h4>
                            <p>As a general rule, venous blood passes from the tissues to the heart by the most direct route through only one capillary bed. In the portal circulation, venous blood from the capillary beds of the abdominal part of the digestive system, the spleen and pancreas travels first to the liver (Fig. 5.38). In the liver, it passes through a second capillary bed, the <strong>hepatic sinusoids</strong>, before entering the general circulation via the inferior vena cava. In this way, blood with a high concentration of nutrients, absorbed from the stomach and intestines, goes to the liver first. This supplies the liver with a rich source of nutrients for its extensive metabolic activities and ensures that the composition of blood leaving the alimentary tract can be appropriately regulated. It also ensures that unwanted and/or potentially toxic materials such as drugs are eliminated before the blood is returned into general circulation. This is called <strong>first-pass metabolism</strong>.</p>
                            <p>Note that rectal veins draining blood from the lower two-thirds of the rectum empty into systemic veins, not the portal vein, and so this blood travels to the heart without first passing through the liver. Drugs absorbed from rectal formulations are therefore absorbed directly into the general circulation. This delays their elimination by the liver, which can be very useful clinically.</p>

                            <p>The abdominal aorta divides at the level of the 4th lumbar vertebra into the right and left common iliac arteries (see Fig. 5.27). In front of the sacroiliac joint each divides into the internal and the external iliac arteries.</p>
                            
                            <p>The <strong>internal iliac artery</strong> runs medially to supply the organs within the pelvic cavity. In the female, one of the largest branches is the uterine artery, which provides the main arterial blood supply to the reproductive organs.</p>
                            
                            <p>The <strong>external iliac artery</strong> runs obliquely downwards and passes behind the inguinal ligament into the thigh, where it becomes the femoral artery.</p>
                            
                            <p>The <strong>femoral artery</strong> (Fig. 5.40) begins at the midpoint of the inguinal ligament and extends downwards in front of the thigh. The femoral pulse can be felt at the origin of the femoral artery. It then turns medially and eventually passes round the medial aspect of the femur to enter the popliteal space, where it becomes the popliteal artery. It supplies blood to the structures of the thigh and some superficial pelvic and inguinal structures.</p>

At the lower border of the popliteal fossa it divides into the anterior and posterior tibial arteries.</p>
                            
                            <p>The <strong>anterior tibial artery</strong> (Fig. 5.41) passes forwards between the tibia and fibula, and supplies the structures in the front of the leg. It lies on the tibia, runs in front of the ankle joint and continues over the dorsum (top) of the foot as the dorsalis pedis artery.</p>
                            
                            <p>The <strong>dorsalis pedis artery</strong> is a continuation of the anterior tibial artery and passes over the dorsum of the foot, where the pulse can be felt, supplying arterial blood to the structures in this area. It ends by passing between the first and second metatarsal bones into the sole of the foot, where it contributes to the formation of the plantar arch.</p>

                            <p>The <strong>posterior tibial artery</strong> (Fig. 5.41) runs downwards and medially on the back of the leg. Near its origin it gives off a large branch called the peroneal artery, which supplies the lateral aspect of the leg. In the lower part it becomes superficial and passes medial to the ankle joint to reach the sole of the foot, where it continues as the plantar artery.</p>
                            
                            <p>The <strong>plantar artery</strong> supplies the structures in the sole of the foot. This artery, its branches and the dorsalis pedis artery form the plantar arch, from which the digital branches arise to supply the toes.</p>

                            <h3>Venous return</h3>
                            <p>There are both deep and superficial veins in the lower limb (Fig. 5.42). Blood entering the superficial veins passes to the deep veins through communicating veins. Movement of blood towards the heart is partly dependent on contraction of skeletal muscles. Backward flow is prevented by a large number of valves. Superficial veins receive less support from surrounding tissues than deep veins.</p>

                            <p>The deep veins (Fig. 5.42) accompany the arteries and their branches, and have the same names. They are:</p>

                            <p>The two main superficial veins (Fig. 5.42) draining blood from the lower limbs are the small and the great saphenous veins.</p>
                            <p>The <strong>small saphenous vein</strong> begins behind the ankle joint, where many small veins that drain the dorsum of the foot join together. It ascends superficially along the back of the leg and in the popliteal space it joins the popliteal vein, a deep vein.</p>
                            <p>The <strong>great saphenous vein</strong> is the longest vein in the body. It begins at the medial half of the dorsum of the foot and runs upwards, crossing the medial aspect of the tibia and continuing up the inner side of the thigh. Just below the inguinal ligament it joins the femoral vein.</p>
                            <p>Many communicating veins link the superficial veins, and also link the superficial and deep veins of the lower limb.</p>

                            <p>The developing fetus obtains its oxygen and nutrients, and excretes its waste, via the mother's circulation. To this end, both maternal and fetal circulations develop specific adaptations unique to pregnancy. Because the lungs, gastrointestinal system and kidneys do not begin to function till after birth, certain modifications in the fetal circulation divert blood flow to meet prenatal requirements.</p>

                            <h3>Placenta</h3>
                            <p>This is a temporary structure that provides an interface between the mother and fetus, and allows the exchange of substances between their circulatory systems. It develops from the surface of the fertilised ovum embedded into the maternal uterine endometrium (Fig. 5.44). It is expelled from the uterus during the final stage of labour soon after birth, when it is no longer needed.</p>

                            <h4>Structure</h4>
                            <p>The mature placenta (Fig. 5.44A) is pancake-shaped, weighs around 500 g, has a diameter of 20 cm and is about 2.5 cm thick, although wide individual variations occur. The placenta is firmly attached to the uterine wall and consists of an extensive network of fetal capillaries bathed in maternal blood. While the fetal capillaries are in very close proximity to the maternal blood supply, the two circulations are completely separate. Branches of the uterine artery bring maternal blood (about $500 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{min}$) into chambers in the placenta called <strong>intervillous spaces</strong>. Projecting into the intervillous spaces are bundles of capillaries bringing blood from the fetus. Oxygen and nutrients diffuse or are actively transported into the fetal blood from the maternal blood, and fetal wastes diffuse into the mother's blood. The placenta is attached to the fetus by a cord (the <strong>umbilical cord</strong>), which is usually about 50 cm long and contains two umbilical arteries and one umbilical vein wrapped in a soft connective tissue coat (Fig. 5.44B). The cord enters the fetus at a spot on the abdomen called the umbilicus.</p>

                            <h4>Functions</h4>
                            <p>Placental functions include exchange of substances, protection of the fetus and maintenance of pregnancy.</p>

                            <p><strong>Exchange of nutrients and wastes</strong><br>
                            Deoxygenated fetal blood flowing through the network of placental capillaries absorbs oxygen and nutrients from maternal blood and excretes its wastes.</p>

                            <p><strong>Protection of the fetus</strong><br>
                            Temporary passive immunity (p. 416) lasting for a few months is provided by maternal antibodies that cross the placenta before birth.</p>
                            <p>Indirect exchange between the fetal and maternal circulations provides a 'barrier' to potentially harmful substances, including bacteria and drugs, although some may cross into the fetus, causing abnormal development. Any substance causing abnormal fetal development is called a <strong>teratogen</strong>. Important teratogens include alcohol, certain drugs including some antibiotics and anticancer agents, ionising radiation and some infections, including the rubella (German measles) virus, cytomegalovirus and syphilis.</p>

                            <p><strong>Maintenance of pregnancy</strong><br>
                            The placenta has an essential endocrine function and secretes the hormones that maintain pregnancy.</p>
                            <p><em>Human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG).</em> Human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) is secreted in early pregnancy, peaking at around 8 or 9 weeks and thereafter in smaller amounts. It stimulates the corpus luteum (p. 494) to continue secreting progesterone and oestrogen, which prevent menstruation and maintain the uterine endometrium, sustaining pregnancy in the early weeks (see Fig. 18.10).</p>
                            <p><em>Progesterone and oestrogen.</em> As pregnancy progresses, the placenta takes over secretion of these hormones from the corpus luteum, which degenerates after about 12 weeks. From 12 weeks until delivery, the placenta secretes increasing levels of oestrogen and progesterone. These hormones are essential for maintenance of pregnancy.</p>

                            <h3>Fetal adaptations</h3>
                            <p>These are shown in Fig. 5.45A.</p>

                            <p><strong>Ductus venosus</strong><br>
                            This is a continuation of the umbilical vein that returns blood directly into the fetal inferior vena cava, and most blood, therefore, bypasses the non-functional fetal liver.</p>

                            <p><strong>Ductus arteriosus</strong><br>
                            This small vessel connects the pulmonary artery to the descending thoracic aorta and diverts blood into the systemic circulation, meaning that very little blood passes through the fetal lungs (see Fig. 5.58).</p>

                            <p><strong>Foramen ovale</strong><br>
                            This is an opening in the septum separating the two atria. It is covered with a flap of tissue that acts as a one-way valve (the atrioseptal valve, see Figs 5.45 and 5.59), allowing blood to flow between the right and left atria, so that most blood bypasses the non-functional fetal lungs.</p>

                            <h3>Changes at birth</h3>
                            <p>These are summarised in Fig. 5.45B.<br>
                            When the baby takes its first breath the lungs inflate for the first time, increasing pulmonary blood flow. Blood returning from the lungs increases the pressure in the left atrium, closing the flap over the foramen ovale and preventing blood flow between the atria. Blood entering the right atrium is therefore diverted into the right ventricle and into the pulmonary circulation through the pulmonary arteries. As the pulmonary circulation is established (see Fig. 5.1), blood oxygen levels increase, causing constriction and closure of the ductus arteriosus. If these adaptations to extrauterine life do not take place after birth, they become evident as congenital abnormalities (see Figs 5.58 and 5.59). When the placental circulation ceases, soon after birth, the umbilical vein, ductus venosus and umbilical arteries collapse, as they are no longer required.</p>

                            <h3>Ageing and the heart</h3>
                            <p>As the heart gets older, its function generally declines; cardiac output falls and the conduction pathways become less efficient. Cardiac muscle cell numbers steadily reduce with age, but hypertrophy (cell enlargement) generally balances this and the ventricles of the heart in older adults are actually slightly larger than in younger people. The compliance (stretchability) of the heart falls with age, mainly because the fibrous skeleton of the heart stiffens, increasing the heart's workload. The ability of the heart muscle to respond to adrenaline (epinephrine) and noradrenaline (norepinephrine) lessens, and the contractile strength of the heart and cardiac reserve are reduced. The older heart is therefore more prone to heart failure (p. 131).</p>
                            <p>These changes occur in the healthy ageing heart and are not consequences of disease. It is notable that age-related decline in cardiovascular function is greatly slowed in individuals who take regular exercise, even in old age.</p>

                            <h3>Ageing and blood vessels</h3>
                            <p>Vasoconstriction and vasodilation responses are less efficient in ageing blood vessels, so regulation of blood flow to the tissues is less well controlled. Arterial and arteriolar walls become stiffer and less compliant, which raises blood pressure and increases the work of the left ventricle. Blood pressure tends to rise with age, even in the absence of any overt cardiovascular disease. The amount of smooth muscle in the walls of most arteries, including those of the heart, kidneys and brain, rises with age, which contributes to their stiffening. This means that the blood supply to most body organs tends to fall, but in healthy old age it does not cause problems because it is matched by a general reduction in metabolic rate.</p>
                            <p>The baroreceptor reflex (p. 98) becomes less brisk with age, not only because the heart and blood vessels are slower to respond but also because of neuronal ageing. This may lead to postural hypotension (p. 138).</p>

                            <p>Shock (circulatory failure) occurs when the metabolic needs of cells are not met because of inadequate blood flow. In effect, there is a reduction in circulating blood volume, in blood pressure and in cardiac output. This causes tissue hypoxia, an inadequate supply of nutrients and the accumulation of waste products. There are different ways of classifying shock, including by cause, which is described here.</p>

                            <h4>Hypovolaemic shock</h4>
                            <p>This occurs when the blood volume is reduced by 15–25%. Cardiac output may fall because of low blood volume and hence low venous return, as a result of different situations:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-content">Severe haemorrhage - whole blood is lost.</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-content">Extensive burns - serum is lost.</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-content">Severe vomiting and diarrhoea - water and electrolytes are lost.</span></li>
                            </ul>

                            <h4>Cardiogenic shock</h4>
                            <p>This occurs in acute heart disease when damaged heart muscle cannot maintain an adequate cardiac output, e.g. in myocardial infarction.</p>

                            <h4>Septic shock (bacteraemic, endotoxic)</h4>
                            <p>Sepsis, or septicaemia, means active infection in the bloodstream, and it can lead to septic shock when it triggers a massive, systemic inflammatory and immune response. White blood cells are activated and a wide range of powerful inflammatory mediators are released into the blood, with widespread effects on organ function. Septic shock has a high mortality rate, even when treated. Symptoms include hypotension due to extensive vasodilation, depression of cardiac contractility, poor tissue perfusion and deteriorating mental state.</p>

                            <h4>Neurogenic shock</h4>
                            <p>The causes include sudden acute pain, severe emotional experience, spinal anaesthesia and spinal cord damage. These interfere with normal nervous control of blood vessel diameter, leading to vasodilation and hypotension.</p>

                            <h4>Anaphylactic shock</h4>
                            <p>Anaphylaxis (p. 417) is a severe allergic response that may be triggered in sensitive individuals by substances like penicillin, peanuts or latex rubber. Vasodilation, provoked by systemic release of inflammatory mediators, e.g. histamine and bradykinin, causes venous pooling and hypotension. Severe bronchoconstriction leads to acute respiratory difficulty and hypoxia. Onset is usually sudden, and in severe cases can cause death in a matter of minutes if untreated.</p>

                            <h3>Physiological changes during shock</h3>
                            <p>In the short term, changes are associated with physiological attempts to restore an adequate blood circulation - <strong>compensated shock</strong> (Fig. 5.46). If not corrected, the longer-term changes may be irreversible.</p>

                            <h4>Compensated shock</h4>
                            <p>As the blood pressure falls, a number of compensatory reflexes are stimulated and hormone secretions increased in an attempt to restore it. These raise blood pressure by increasing peripheral resistance, blood volume and cardiac output (Fig. 5.46).</p>

                            <p>Increased sympathetic stimulation increases heart rate and cardiac output, and also causes vasoconstriction, all of which increase blood pressure. Low blood volume and increased osmolarity of the blood cause secretion of ADH (p. 239) and activate the RAAS (p. 377). Consequent release of aldosterone reduces water and sodium excretion, and promotes vasoconstriction. The veins also constrict, helping to reduce venous pooling and support venous return.</p>
                            <p>If these compensatory mechanisms, plus any medical interventions available, are sufficient, then perfusion of the heart and brain can be maintained and the patient's condition may be stabilised.</p>

                            <h4>Uncompensated shock</h4>
                            <p>If the insult is more severe, shock becomes a self-perpetuating sequence of deteriorating cardiovascular function - <strong>uncompensated shock</strong> (Fig. 5.47). Hypoxia causes cellular metabolism to switch to anaerobic pathways (p. 344), resulting in accumulation of lactic acid and progressive acidosis, which damages capillaries. The capillaries then become more permeable, leaking fluid from the vascular system into the tissues, further lowering blood pressure and tissue perfusion. Also, the accumulation of waste products causes vasodilation, making it harder for control mechanisms to support blood pressure. Organs, including the heart, are deprived of oxygen and may start to fail.</p>

                            <p>Eventually, the cardiovascular system reaches the stage when, although its compensatory mechanisms are running at maximum, it is unable to supply the brain's requirements. As the brain, including the cardiovascular and respiratory centres in the brain stem, becomes starved of oxygen and nutrients, it begins to fail and there is loss of central control of the body's compensatory mechanisms. Circulatory collapse follows. Finally, degenerating cardiovascular function leads to irreversible and progressive brain stem damage, and death follows.</p>

                            <h3>Thrombosis</h3>
                            <p>Thrombosis is the formation of a blood clot (thrombus) inside a blood vessel, interrupting blood supply to the tissues. The risk of a thrombus developing within a blood vessel is increased by several factors.</p>

                            <p><strong>Slow blood flow</strong><br>
                            This may happen in immobility, e.g. with prolonged sitting or bedrest, or on longhaul flights; if a blood vessel is compressed by an adjacent structure such as a tumour or tight clothing; or if there is a sustained fall in blood pressure, as in shock.</p>

                            <p><strong>Damage to the blood vessel intima</strong><br>
                            This is usually associated with atherosclerosis (p. 125).</p>

                            <p><strong>Increased blood coagulability</strong><br>
                            Dehydration, pregnancy and childbirth, blood clotting disorders, some malignant disease, the presence of an intravenous cannula and oestrogen (including when used as a contraceptive) all increase the risk of blood clots forming.</p>

                            <h3>Embolism</h3>
                            <p>Embolism is the blocking of a blood vessel by any mass of material (an embolus) travelling in the blood. This is usually a thrombus or a fragment of a thrombus, but other embolic materials are shown in Box 5.3.</p>

                            <p>Emboli originating in an artery travel away from the heart until they reach an artery too narrow to let them pass; they lodge there, partly or completely blocking blood supply to distal tissues. This is a common cause of stroke (p. 194), myocardial infarction (p. 133) and gangrenous limbs (Fig. 5.48). Emboli originating in veins (deep vein thrombosis, or DVT; p. 127) travel towards the heart, and from there to the lungs in the pulmonary artery. They then lodge in the first branch that is narrower than they are (pulmonary embolism).</p>

                            <p><strong>Pulmonary embolism</strong><br>
                            Blockage of a pulmonary artery or one of its larger branches causes an immediate reduction in blood flow through the lung, and this is one of the most serious consequences of venous embolism. Massive pulmonary embolism blocks a main pulmonary artery and usually causes sudden collapse and death.</p>

                            <h3>Infarction and ischaemia</h3>
                            <p><strong>Infarction</strong> is the term given to tissue death because of interrupted blood supply. The consequences of interrupting tissue blood supply depend of the size of the blocked artery and the functions of the affected tissue. <strong>Ischaemia</strong> is impaired tissue function due to hypoxia and accumulation of cellular wastes (Fig. 5.48).</p>

                            <h3>Atheroma</h3>
                            <h4>Pathological changes</h4>
                            <p>Atheromatous plaques are patchy changes that develop in the tunica intima of large and medium-sized arteries. Initial changes show a fatty streak in the artery wall. Mature plaques consist of accumulations of cholesterol and other lipids, excess smooth muscle and fat-filled monocytes (foam cells). The plaque is covered with a rough fibrous cap. As plaques grow and thicken, they spread along the artery wall and protrude into the lumen. Eventually, the whole thickness of the wall and long sections of the vessel may be affected (Fig. 5.49). Plaques may rupture, exposing subintimal materials to the blood. This may cause thrombosis and vasospasm, and will compromise blood flow.</p>
                            <p>Arteries most commonly involved are those in the heart, brain, kidneys, small intestine and lower limbs.</p>

                            <h4>Causes of atheroma</h4>
                            <p>The origin of atheromatous plaques is uncertain. Fatty streaks present in artery walls of infants are usually absorbed but their incomplete absorption may be the origin of atheromatous plaques in later life.</p>
                            <p>Atherosclerosis (the presence of plaques) is considered to be a disease of older people because it is usually in this age group that clinical signs appear. Plaques start to form in childhood in developed countries, however. The incidence of atheroma is widespread in developed countries. Why atheromatous plaques develop is not clearly understood but the predisposing factors appear to exert their effects over a long period. This may mean that the development of atheroma can be delayed or even arrested by a change in lifestyle (Box 5.4).</p>

                            <h4>Effects of atheroma</h4>
                            <p>Atheromatous plaques may cause partial or complete obstruction of an artery (Fig. 5.49). The blockage may be complicated by clot formation. The consequences of this depend on the site and size of the artery involved and the extent of collateral circulation.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>Narrowing of an artery</strong><br>
                            The tissues distal to the narrow point become ischaemic. The cells may receive enough blood to meet their minimum needs but not enough to cope with an increase in metabolic rate, e.g. when muscle activity is increased. This causes acute cramp-like ischaemic pain, which disappears when exertion stops. Cardiac muscle and skeletal muscles of the lower limb are most commonly affected. Ischaemic pain in the heart is called angina pectoris (p. 133), and in the lower limbs, intermittent claudication.</p>

                            <p><strong>Occlusion of an artery</strong><br>
                            When an artery is completely blocked, the tissues it supplies rapidly degenerate (ischaemia), which leads to infarction (p. 124). If a major artery supplying a large amount of tissue is affected, the consequences are likely to be more severe than if the obstruction occurs in a minor vessel. If the tissue is well provided with a collateral circulation (such as the circulus arteriosus provides in the brain), tissue damage is less than if there are few collateral vessels (which may be the case in the heart).</p>
                            <p>When a coronary artery is occluded, myocardial infarction (p. 133) occurs. Occlusion of arteries in the brain causes cerebral ischaemia and this leads to cerebral infarction (stroke, p. 194).</p>

                            <h4>Complications of atheroma</h4>
                            <p><strong>Thrombosis and infarction</strong><br>
                            If the fibrous cap overlying a plaque breaks down, exposure of the blood to subendothelial materials activates platelets, and an intravascular blood clot forms (thrombosis), blocking the artery and causing ischaemia and infarction (p. 124). Emboli may break off, travel in the bloodstream and lodge in small arteries distal to the clot, causing small infarcts.</p>

                            <p><strong>Haemorrhage</strong><br>
                            Plaques may become calcified, making the artery brittle, rigid and more prone to aneurysm formation, increasing the risk of rupture and haemorrhage.</p>

                            <p><strong>Aneurysm</strong><br>
                            When the arterial wall is weakened by spread of the plaque between the layers of tissue, a local dilation (aneurysm) may develop (see later). This may lead to thrombosis and embolism, or the aneurysm may rupture, causing severe haemorrhage. The most common sites affected by atheroma are the aorta and the abdominal and pelvic arteries.</p>

                            <h3>Arteriosclerosis</h3>
                            <p>This is a progressive degeneration of arterial walls, associated with ageing and accompanied by hypertension.</p>

                            <p>In large and medium-sized arteries, the tunica media is infiltrated with fibrous tissue and calcium. This causes the vessels to become dilated, inelastic and tortuous (Fig. 5.50). Loss of elasticity increases systolic blood pressure and the pulse pressure (p. 96).</p>
                            <p>When small arteries (arterioles) are involved, their lumen is narrowed because of deposition of a substance called hyaline material, which reduces the elasticity of the vessel wall. Because arterioles control peripheral resistance (p. 96), this narrowing increases peripheral resistance and blood pressure. Damage to small vessels has a disproportionate effect on blood flow, leading to ischaemia of tissues supplied by affected arteries. In the limbs, the resultant ischaemia predisposes to gangrene, which is particularly serious in diabetes mellitus. If arteries supplying the brain are affected, cerebral ischaemia can result in progressive deterioration of higher-order functions (p. 194).</p>

                            <h3>Aneurysms</h3>
                            <p>Aneurysms are abnormal local dilations of arteries, which vary considerably in size (Fig. 5.51). Predisposing factors include atheroma, hypertension and defective formation of collagen in the arterial wall.</p>
                            <p>If an aneurysm ruptures, haemorrhage follows, the consequences depending on the site and extent of the bleed. Rupture of the aorta is likely to be fatal, while bleeding into the subarachnoid space can also cause death or permanent disability. Bleeding in the brain can lead to symptoms of stroke (p. 194). An aneurysm damages the blood vessel endothelium, making it rougher than usual and increasing the risk of clot formation. Clots may block circulation locally, or elsewhere if they travel in the bloodstream as emboli. In addition, the swelling associated with the distended artery can cause pressure on local structures such as other blood vessels, nerves or organs.</p>

                            <h4>Types of aneurysm</h4>
                            <p><strong>Saccular aneurysms</strong> (Fig. 5.51 A) bulge out on one side of the artery. When they occur in the relatively thin-walled arteries of the circulus arteriosus (Fig. 5.31) in the brain, they are sometimes called 'berry' aneurysms. They may be congenital, or be associated with defective collagen production or with atheroma.</p>
                            <p><strong>Fusiform</strong> or spindle-shaped distensions (Fig. 5.51B) occur mainly in the abdominal aorta and are usually associated with atheroma.</p>

                            <h3>Venous thrombosis</h3>
                            <p>The risk factors predisposing to development of a clot within a vein are discussed on page 124.</p>
                            <p>Venous thrombosis may be superficial thrombophlebitis, which usually resolves spontaneously, or deep vein thrombosis.</p>

                            <h4>Superficial thrombophlebitis</h4>
                            <p>If a thrombus forms in a superficial vein, the tissue around the affected vein becomes inflamed, red and painful. The most common causes are intravenous infusion and varicosities in the saphenous vein.</p>

                            <h4>Deep vein thrombosis</h4>
                            <p>Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) usually affects the lower limb, pelvic or iliac veins but occasionally the upper limb veins. It may be accompanied by local pain and swelling but is often asymptomatic. Risk factors for DVT include varicose veins, surgery, pregnancy and prolonged immobility, e.g. long journeys with restricted leg room ('economy class syndrome'). It carries a significant risk of death (often from pulmonary embolism (p. 124) if a large clot fragment travels to the lungs).</p>

                            <h3>Varicosed veins</h3>
                            <p>Blood pooling in a vein stretches and damages its soft walls and it becomes inelastic, dilated and coiled. Generally, superficial veins with little support are more susceptible. The valves then cannot close properly because the vein is distended, and pooling and engorgement get worse.</p>

                            <h4>Sites and effects of varicose veins</h4>
                            <p><strong>Varicose veins of the legs</strong><br>
                            Blood in the veins of the leg is constantly subject to gravity, which can lead to sluggish venous return and accumulation of blood in these veins. If the valves become incompetent, pooling gets worse and the leg veins become chronically dilated, twisted and lengthened. The superficial veins are more prone to this than deeper ones because there is less support from surrounding tissues such as muscle, and the varicose veins become clearly visible (Fig. 5.53 A). The great and small saphenous veins and the anterior tibial veins are most commonly affected, causing aching and fatigue of the legs, especially during long periods of standing. These dilated, inelastic veins rupture easily if injured and haemorrhage occurs. Venous return is maintained because superficial veins are usually connected into the network of deeper veins, which are better supported by surrounding tissues and less likely to become varicosed (Fig. 5.54).</p>

                            <p>The skin over a varicose vein may become poorly nourished due to stasis of blood, leading to varicose ulcer, usually on the medial aspects of the leg just above the ankle.</p>
                            <p>Risk factors include increasing age, obesity, pregnancy, standing for long periods, wearing constricting clothing, family history and female gender.</p>

                            <p><strong>Haemorrhoids</strong><br>
                            Sustained pressure on distended veins at the junction of the rectum and anus leads to increased venous pressure, valvular incompetence and the development of haemorrhoids (piles; see Fig. 5.53B). The most common causes are chronic constipation, and the increased pressure in the pelvis towards the end of pregnancy. Slight bleeding may occur each time stools are passed and, in time, may cause anaemia. Severe haemorrhage is rare.</p>

                            <p><strong>Scrotal varicocele</strong><br>
                            Each spermatic cord is surrounded by a plexus of veins that may become varicosed, especially in men whose work involves standing for long periods. If the varicocele is bilateral, the increased temperature due to venous congestion may depress spermatogenesis and cause infertility.</p>

                            <p><strong>Oesophageal varices</strong><br>
                            Raised pressure in the lower oesophageal veins can rupture them, leading to a potentially fatal haemorrhage (p. 350).</p>

                            <h3>Tumours of blood and lymph vessels</h3>
                            <h4>Angiomas</h4>
                            <p>Angiomas are benign tumours of either blood vessels (haemangiomas) or lymph vessels (lymphangiomas). The latter rarely occur, so angioma is usually taken to mean haemangioma.</p>

                            <p><strong>Haemangiomas</strong><br>
                            These are not true tumours but are sufficiently similar to be classified as such. They consist of an excessive growth of blood vessels arranged in an uncharacteristic manner and interspersed with collagen fibres.</p>
                            <p><em>Capillary haemangiomas.</em> Excess capillary growth interspersed with collagen in a localised area makes a dense, plexus-like network of tissue. Each haemangioma is supplied by only one blood vessel, and if it thromboses, the haemangioma atrophies and disappears.</p>
                            <p>Haemangiomas are usually present at birth and are seen as a purple or red mole or birthmark. They may be quite small at birth but grow at an alarming rate in the first few months, keeping pace with the growth of the child. After 1–3 years atrophy may begin, and after 5 years about 80% have disappeared.</p>

                            <p>In oedema, excess tissue fluid accumulates, causing swelling. It may occur in either superficial tissues or deeper organs.</p>

                            <h4>Sites of oedema</h4>
                            <p>Oedema of the superficial tissues causes pitting, i.e. an indentation remains after firm finger pressure has been applied. Oedema develops at different sites, depending on body position and gravity. When standing or sitting the oedema develops in the lower limbs, beginning in the feet and ankles. Patients on bedrest tend to develop oedema in the sacral area. This is called <strong>dependent oedema</strong>.</p>
                            <p>In <strong>pulmonary oedema</strong>, venous congestion in the lungs or increased pulmonary vessel permeability results in accumulation of fluid in the tissue spaces and in the alveoli. This reduces the area available for gaseous exchange and leads to dyspnoea (breathlessness), cyanosis and coughing up of frothy sputum. The most common causes of pulmonary oedema are cardiac failure, inflammation or irritation of the lungs, and excessive infusion of intravenous fluids.</p>

                            <h4>Causes of oedema</h4>
                            <p>Fluid accumulates in the tissues when some aspect of capillary fluid dynamics (Fig. 5.55A; see also p. 85) is abnormal.</p>

                            <p><strong>Increased venous hydrostatic (blood) pressure</strong><br>
                            Congestion of the venous circulation increases venous hydrostatic pressure, reducing the net effect of osmotic pressure that draws fluid back into the capillary at the venous end. Excess fluid then remains in the tissues. This may be caused by heart failure, kidney disease or compression of a limb due to prolonged sitting or tight clothes.</p>

                            <p><strong>Decreased plasma osmotic pressure</strong><br>
                            When plasma protein levels fall, less fluid returns to the circulation at the venous end of the capillary (Fig. 5.55B). Causes include excessive protein loss in kidney disease, and reduced plasma protein levels caused by, for example, liver failure or a protein-deficient diet.</p>

                            <p><strong>Impaired lymphatic drainage</strong><br>
                            Some fluid returns to the circulation via the lymphatic system, and when flow is impaired, oedema develops (Fig. 5.55C). Causes include malignancy that blocks lymph drainage, surgical removal of lymph nodes or lymph node destruction by chronic inflammation.</p>

                            <p><strong>Increased small-vessel permeability</strong><br>
                            In inflammation, chemical mediators increase small-vessel permeability in the affected area. Plasma proteins then leave the circulation (Fig. 5.55D) and the resultant increased tissue osmotic pressure draws fluid into the area, causing swelling of the affected tissue. This type of oedema also occurs in allergic reactions (p. 417), e.g. anaphylaxis, asthma or hay fever.</p>

                            <h3>Effusions and ascites</h3>
                            <p>Abnormal accumulation of excess fluid in body spaces, e.g. the pericardial sac or a joint space, is often associated with inflammatory, infective or obstructive conditions and is referred to as an effusion.</p>

                            <h4>Pleural effusion</h4>
                            <p>This is excess pleural fluid in the pleural cavity. It is usually due to infection or inflammation of the pleura (p. 272), or to left ventricular failure, which increases pressure in the pulmonary circulation because the left ventricle is not able to pump out all the blood returning to it from the lungs.</p>

                            <h4>Ascites</h4>
                            <p>This is accumulation of excess fluid in the peritoneal cavity. The most common causes include liver failure (when plasma protein synthesis is reduced), obstruction of abdominal lymph nodes draining the peritoneal cavity, or inflammatory conditions. The latter includes malignant disease because many tumours release pro-inflammatory mediators.</p>

                            <h3>Heart (cardiac) failure</h3>
                            <p>The heart is described as failing when it is unable to circulate sufficient blood to meet the needs of the body. In mild cases, cardiac output is adequate at rest and becomes inadequate only when tissue needs are increased, e.g. in exercise. Heart failure may affect either side of the heart, but since both sides of the heart are part of one circuit, when one half of the pump begins to fail, it frequently leads to increased strain on, and eventual failure of, the other side. The main clinical manifestations depend on which side of the heart is most affected. Left ventricular failure is more common than right because of the greater workload of the left ventricle.</p>

                            <h4>Compensatory mechanisms in heart failure</h4>
                            <p>In acute heart failure the body has little time to make compensatory changes, but if the heart fails over a period of time the following changes are likely to occur in an attempt to maintain cardiac output and tissue perfusion, especially of vital organs:</p>

                            <h4>Chronic heart failure</h4>
                            <p>This develops gradually and in the early stages there may be no symptoms because compensatory changes occur as described earlier. When further compensation is not possible, myocardial function gradually declines. Underlying causes include degenerative heart changes with advancing age, and many chronic conditions, including anaemia, lung disease, hypertension or cardiac disease.</p>

                            <p><strong>Right-sided (congestive cardiac) failure</strong><br>
                            The right ventricle fails when it cannot generate enough force to push blood through the lungs.</p>
                            <p>When compensation has reached its limit and the ventricle can no longer empty adequately, the right atrium and venae cavae become congested with blood and this is followed by congestion backing up throughout the venous system. The organs affected first are the liver, spleen and kidneys. Oedema (p. 129) of the limbs and ascites (excess fluid in the peritoneal cavity) usually follow.</p>
                            <p>Right ventricular failure may be caused by increased vascular resistance in the lungs or weakness of the myocardium.</p>
                            <p><em>Resistance to blood flow through the lungs.</em> When this is increased the right ventricle has more work to do. The two most common causes are pulmonary embolism and left ventricular failure, when the pulmonary circulation is congested because the left ventricle is not clearing all the blood flowing into it.</p>
                            <p><em>Weakness of the myocardium.</em> This is caused by myocardial damage following ischaemia or infarction.</p>

                            <p><strong>Left-sided (left ventricular) failure</strong><br>
                            This occurs when the left ventricle cannot contract strongly enough to force blood into the aorta, and the ventricle cannot then pump out the blood it receives. Causes include ischaemic heart disease, which reduces the efficiency of the myocardium, and hypertension, when the heart's workload is increased because of raised systemic resistance. Disease of the mitral (left atrioventricular) and/or aortic valves may prevent efficient emptying of the heart chambers, increasing myocardial workload.</p>
                            <p>Failure of the left ventricle leads to dilation of the left atrium and an increase in pulmonary blood pressure. This can back up through the right side of the heart and eventually cause systemic venous congestion.</p>
                            <p>Exercise tolerance becomes progressively reduced as the condition worsens and is accompanied by cough, caused by pulmonary oedema. The person is easily tired, with poorly perfused peripheral tissues and low blood pressure.</p>
                            <p>Congestion in the lungs leads to pulmonary oedema and dyspnoea, often most severe at night. This paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea may be due to raised blood volume as fluid from peripheral oedema is reabsorbed when the person slips down in bed during sleep.</p>

                            <h3>Disorders of heart valves</h3>
                            <p>The heart valves prevent backflow of blood in the heart during the cardiac cycle. The mitral and aortic valves are subject to greater pressures than those on the right side and are therefore more susceptible to damage.</p>
                            <p>Distinctive heart sounds arise when the valves close during the cardiac cycle (p. 92). Damaged valves generate abnormal heart sounds called murmurs. A severe valve disorder causes heart failure. The most common causes of valve defects are rheumatic fever (p. 133), fibrosis following inflammation, and congenital abnormalities.</p>

                            <h4>Stenosis</h4>
                            <p>This is the narrowing of a valve opening, impeding blood flow through the valve. It occurs when inflammation and encrustations roughen the edges of the cusps so that they stick together, narrowing the valve opening. Healing forms fibrous tissue that shrinks as it ages, increasing the stenosis and leading to incompetence.</p>

                            <h4>Incompetence</h4>
                            <p>Sometimes called regurgitation, this is caused by failure of a valve to close completely, allowing blood to flow backwards.</p>

                            <h3>Ischaemic heart disease</h3>
                            <p>Ischaemia of the myocardium is usually caused by atheromatous plaques narrowing or occluding one or more branches of the coronary arteries (Fig. 5.56). Occlusion may be by plaques alone, or plaques complicated by thrombosis. The overall effect depends on the size of the coronary artery involved and whether it is only narrowed or completely blocked. Narrowing of an artery leads to angina pectoris and occlusion to myocardial infarction.</p>
                            <p>When atheroma develops slowly, a collateral arterial blood supply may have time to develop and maintain blood supply. This is due to the dilation of the anastomotic arteries joining adjacent arteries. When sudden severe narrowing or occlusion of an artery occurs the anastomotic arteries still dilate but may not be able to supply enough blood to meet myocardial needs.</p>

                            <h4>Angina pectoris</h4>
                            <p>This is sometimes called angina of effort because the increased cardiac output required during extra physical effort causes severe chest pain, which may also radiate to the arms, neck and jaw. Other precipitating factors for angina include cold weather and emotional states.</p>
                            <p>A narrowed coronary artery may supply sufficient blood to the myocardium to meet its needs during rest or moderate exercise but not when greatly increased cardiac output is needed; for example, walking may be tolerated but not running. The thick, inflexible atheromatous artery wall is unable to dilate to allow for the increased blood flow needed by the more active myocardium, which then becomes ischaemic. In the early stages of the disease, the chest pain stops when the exercise stops.</p>

                            <h4>Myocardial infarction</h4>
                            <p>The myocardium may infarct (p. 124) when a branch of a coronary artery is blocked, usually by an atheromatous plaque complicated by thrombosis (Fig. 5.56). The damage is permanent because cardiac muscle cannot regenerate, and the dead muscle is replaced with non-functional fibrous tissue. Speedy restoration of blood flow through the blocked artery using clot-dissolving (thrombolytic) drugs can greatly reduce the extent of the permanent damage and improve prognosis, but treatment must be started within a few hours of the infarction occurring. The effects and complications are greatest when the left ventricle is involved.</p>
                            <p>Myocardial infarction is usually accompanied by severe crushing chest pain behind the sternum, which, unlike angina pectoris, continues even when the individual is at rest. It is a significant cause of death in the developed world.</p>

                            <h3>Rheumatic heart disease</h3>
                            <p>Rheumatic fever is an inflammatory illness that sometimes follows streptococcal throat infections, most commonly in children and young adults. It is an autoimmune disorder; the antibodies produced to combat the original infection damage connective tissues, including the heart, joints (rheumatoid arthritis, p. 470) and skin.</p>
                            <p>Death rarely occurs in the acute phase but the heart valves may be permanently damaged, eventually leading to disability and possibly cardiac failure.</p>

                            <h4>Acute rheumatic heart disease</h4>
                            <p>In the acute stages, all layers of the heart wall are inflamed (pancarditis, 'pan-' meaning 'all of'). The heart valves, especially the mitral valve, are frequently affected. At least half of acute cases develop chronic valvular incompetence following recovery. The inflamed myocardium can fail, leading to signs of heart failure, including tachycardia, breathlessness and cardiac enlargement. Inflammation of the pericardium can lead to friction within the pericardial cavity as the heart beats, pain behind the sternum and interference with the pumping action of the heart. Permanent fibrotic damage may fuse the visceral and parietal layers of the serous pericardium together, restricting the heart's action.</p>

                            <h4>Chronic rheumatic heart disease</h4>
                            <p>Inflamed tissue becomes fibrous as it heals, and this fibrous tissue interferes with the action of the myocardium and the heart valves. Fibrotic nodules develop on their cusps, which shrink as they age, distorting the cusp and causing stenosis and incompetence of the valve. The great majority of these patients have mitral valve damage but the aortic valve is frequently affected too. Chronic fibrotic changes in the pericardium and myocardium cause heart failure.</p>
                            <p>Sometimes rheumatic valvular disease presents with no history of acute rheumatic fever or streptococcal infection.</p>

                            <h3>Infective endocarditis</h3>
                            <p>Pathogens in the blood may colonise any part of the endocardium, but the most common sites are on or near the heart valves (including prosthetic valves) and round the margins of congenital heart defects. These areas are susceptible to infection because they are exposed to fast-flowing blood that may cause mild trauma. This illness, which may be acute or subacute, is serious and sometimes fatal without treatment. It is usually bacterial, either staphylococcal or streptococcal, although other bacteria or fungi can be involved.</p>
                            <p>The main predisposing factors are bacteraemia, depressed immune response and heart abnormalities.</p>

                            <p><strong>Bacteraemia</strong><br>
                            Bacteria in the bloodstream, if not destroyed by phagocytes or antibodies, tend to adhere to platelets and form tiny infected emboli. Inside the heart the emboli are most likely to settle on already damaged endocardium. Vegetations consisting of platelets and fibrin surround the microbes, protecting them from normal body defences and antibiotics. Because of this, infection may be caused by a wide range of bacteria, including some that do not normally cause clinical infection. They normally originate from the skin or the mouth.</p>

                            <p><strong>Depressed immune response</strong><br>
                            This enables low-virulence organisms, including normal body flora, to become established and cause infection. Immunosuppression may be caused by HIV infection, malignant disease, cytotoxic drugs, radiotherapy or steroid therapy.</p>

                            <p><strong>Heart abnormalities</strong><br>
                            The sites most commonly infected are already abnormal in some way. Microbes in the bloodstream cannot adhere to healthy endothelium, but if the endothelial lining is damaged, infection is more likely. Often, the cardiac valves are involved, especially if damaged by rheumatic disease or congenital malformation. Other likely sites of infection include regions of cardiac abnormality, such as ventricular septal defect (p. 135) and patent ductus arteriosus (p. 135). Prosthetic (artificial) valves can also be a focus for infective growths.</p>

                            <h3>Cardiac arrhythmias</h3>
                            <p>The heart rate is normally determined by intrinsic impulses generated in the SA node. The rhythm is determined by the route of impulse transmission through the conducting system. This can be shown on a standard ECG tracing (Fig. 5.57A). A cardiac arrhythmia is any disorder of heart rate or rhythm, and is the result of abnormal generation or conduction of impulses. The normal cardiac cycle (p. 92) gives rise to normal sinus rhythm, which has a rate of between 60 and 100 b.p.m.</p>

                            <p><strong>Sinus bradycardia</strong><br>
                            This is normal sinus rhythm below 60 b.p.m. This may occur during sleep and is common in athletes. It is an abnormality when it follows myocardial infarction or accompanies raised intracranial pressure (p. 192).</p>

                            <p><strong>Sinus tachycardia</strong><br>
                            This is normal sinus rhythm above 100 b.p.m. when the individual is at rest. This accompanies exercise and anxiety, but is an indicator of some disorders, e.g. fever, hyperthyroidism and some cardiac conditions.</p>

                            <p><strong>Asystole</strong><br>
                            This occurs when there is no electrical activity in the ventricles and therefore no cardiac output. The ECG shows a flat line (Fig. 5.57B). Ventricular fibrillation and asystole cause sudden and complete loss of cardiac output, i.e. cardiac arrest and death.</p>

                            <p><strong>Fibrillation</strong><br>
                            This is the contraction of the cardiac muscle fibres in a disorderly and uncoordinated sequence. The chambers do not contract as a coordinated unit and the pumping action is disrupted.</p>
                            <p>In <em>atrial fibrillation (AF)</em>, atrial pumping is ineffective and stimulation of the AV node is irregular. AF is very common, especially in older adults. It may be asymptomatic because, although atrial function is disordered, most ventricular filling happens passively and atrial contraction only tops it up, so cardiac output is maintained. However, common symptoms include unpleasant palpitations, breathlessness and fatigue. The pulse is irregular and there are no discernible $P$ waves on the ECG. Often the cause is unknown but AF can develop as a result of many forms of heart disease, thyrotoxicosis (p. 250), alcoholism and lung disease.</p>
                            <p><em>Ventricular fibrillation</em> is a medical emergency that will swiftly lead to death if untreated because the chaotic electrical activity within the ventricular walls cannot coordinate an effective pumping action (cardiac arrest). The heart stops pumping into both the pulmonary and the systemic circulations. No pulses can be felt; consciousness is lost and breathing stops. The ECG shows an irregular chaotic trace with no recognisable wave pattern (Fig. 5.57B).</p>

                            <p><strong>Heart block</strong><br>
                            Heart block occurs when normal impulse transmission is blocked or impaired. A common form involves obstruction of impulse transmission through the AV node, but (less commonly) conducting tissue in the atria or ventricles can also be affected. When the AV node is involved, the delay between atrial and ventricular contraction is increased. The severity depends on the extent of loss of stimulation of the AV node.</p>
                            <p>In <em>complete heart block</em>, ventricular contraction is entirely independent of impulses initiated by the SA node. Freed from the normal pacing action of the SA node, the ventricles are driven by impulses generated by the pacemaker activity of the AV node, resulting in slow, regular ventricular contractions and a heart rate of about 30–40 b.p.m. In this state the heart is unable to respond quickly to a sudden increase in demand by, for example, exercise. The most common causes are:</p>

                            <h3>Congenital abnormalities</h3>
                            <p>Abnormalities in the heart and great vessels at birth may be due to intrauterine developmental errors or to the failure of the heart and blood vessels to adapt to extrauterine life. Sometimes, there are no symptoms in early life and the abnormality is recognised only when complications appear.</p>

                            <p><strong>Patent ductus arteriosus</strong><br>
                            In the fetus, the ductus arteriosus bypasses the nonfunctional lungs (Fig. 5.58). At birth, when the pulmonary circulation is established, the ductus arteriosus should close completely. If it remains patent (open), blood regurgitates from the aorta to the pulmonary artery where the pressure is lower, reducing the volume entering the systemic circulation and increasing the volume of blood in the pulmonary circulation. This leads to pulmonary congestion and eventually cardiac failure.</p>

                            <p><strong>Atrial septal defect</strong><br>
                            This is commonly known as a 'hole in the heart' and occurs if closure of the foramen ovale (Fig. 5.59) does not occur properly after birth. After birth, when the pulmonary circulation is established and the pressure in the left atrium exceeds that in the right atrium, the atrioseptal valve closes. Later the closure becomes permanent due to fibrosis (Fig. 5.59).<br>
                            If the atrioseptal valve does not completely seal the hole, an opening between the atria remains patent after birth. In many cases, it is too small to cause symptoms in early life but they may appear later. In severe cases, blood flows back to the right atrium from the left. This increases the right ventricular and pulmonary pressure, causing hypertrophy of the myocardium and eventually cardiac failure. As pressure in the right atrium rises, blood flow through the defect may be reversed, but this is not an improvement because deoxygenated blood is then entering the general circulation.</p>

                            <p><strong>Coarctation of the aorta</strong><br>
                            The most common site of coarctation (narrowing) of the aorta is between the left subclavian artery and ductus arteriosus. This forces more blood than normal into the brachiocephalic, left common carotid and left subclavian arteries, leading to hypertension in the upper body. There may be systemic hypotension if there is inadequate flow past the coarctation into the descending aorta and its branches.</p>

                            <p>The term 'hypertension' is used to describe a level of blood pressure that, taking all other cardiovascular risk factors into account, would benefit the patient if reduced. Blood pressure readings where systolic and diastolic values are below 130/85 mmHg, respectively, are considered normal. Readings that indicate hypertension are listed in Table 5.2. Blood pressure tends to rise naturally with age. Arteriosclerosis (p. 126) may contribute to this but is not the only factor.</p>
                            <p>Hypertension is classified as essential (primary, idiopathic) or secondary to other diseases. Irrespective of the cause, hypertension commonly affects the kidneys (p. 385).</p>

                            <h4>Essential hypertension</h4>
                            <p>Essential hypertension (hypertension of unknown cause) is very common in the developed world and accounts for 95% of all cases. Treatment aims to prevent complications, which can be serious, primarily cardiovascular and renal disease. Sometimes complications, such as heart failure, cerebrovascular accident or myocardial infarction, are the first indication of hypertension, but often the condition is symptomless and is only discovered during a routine examination.</p>
                            <p><strong>Risk factors</strong><br>
                            Risk factors for hypertension include obesity, diabetes mellitus, family history, cigarette smoking, a sedentary lifestyle and high intakes of salt or alcohol. Stress may increase blood pressure, and there is a well-documented link between low birth weight and incidence of hypertension in later life.</p>

                            <h4>Malignant (accelerated) hypertension</h4>
                            <p>This is a rapid and aggressive acceleration of hypertensive disease. Diastolic pressure in excess of 120 mmHg is common. The effects are serious and quickly become apparent, e.g. haemorrhages into the retina, papilloedema (oedema around the optic disc), encephalopathy (cerebral oedema) and progressive renal disease, leading to cardiac failure.</p>

                            <h4>Secondary hypertension</h4>
                            <p>Hypertension resulting from other diseases accounts for 5% of all cases (Box 5.5).</p>

                            <p>The effects of long-standing and progressively rising blood pressure are serious (Fig. 5.60). Hypertension predisposes to atherosclerosis and has specific effects on particular organs.</p>

                            </figure>

                            <p><strong>Heart</strong><br>
                            The rate and force of cardiac contraction are increased to maintain the cardiac output against a sustained rise in arterial pressure. The left ventricle hypertrophies to increase its contractile strength, but begins to fail when compensation has reached its limit. This is followed by back-pressure and accumulation of blood in the lungs (pulmonary congestion) and hypertrophy of the right ventricle, and eventually by right ventricular failure. Hypertension also predisposes to ischaemic heart disease (p. 132) and aneurysm formation (p. 127).</p>

                            <p><strong>Brain</strong><br>
                            Stroke, caused by cerebral haemorrhage (p. 195), is common, the effects depending on the position and size of the ruptured vessel. When a series of small blood vessels rupture, e.g. microaneurysms, at different times, there is progressive disability. Rupture of a large vessel causes extensive loss of function or death.</p>

                            <p><strong>Kidneys</strong><br>
                            Autoregulation mechanisms (p. 97) protect the kidneys, to an extent, from fluctuations in systemic blood pressure but sustained hypertension causes kidney damage. If damage is sustained for only a short time, recovery may be complete. Otherwise the kidney damage causes further hypertension owing to activation of the RAAS (p. 377), progressive loss of kidney function and kidney failure.</p>

                            <p><strong>Blood vessels</strong><br>
                            High blood pressure damages blood vessels. The walls of small arteries become hardened, and in larger arteries the development of atheroma is accelerated. If other risk factors for vascular disease are present, such as diabetes or smoking, damage is more extensive. The vessel wall may become so badly weakened by these changes that an aneurysm develops, and as the blood vessels become progressively damaged and less elastic, hypertension worsens.</p>
                            <p>The capillaries of the retina and the kidneys are particularly susceptible to the effects of chronic hypertension, leading to retinal bleeding and reduced renal function. Damaged retinal blood vessels are clearly visible through an ophthalmoscope on examination, and the first indication of hypertension may be picked up during a routine eye test.</p>

                            <p><strong>Pulmonary hypertension</strong><br>
                            Normally, the pulmonary circulation is a low-pressure system, to prevent fluid being forced out of the pulmonary capillaries into the alveoli. When blood pressure rises, alveoli begin to fill with fluid (pulmonary oedema), which blocks gas exchange. Rising pulmonary blood pressure may result from left-sided heart failure (p. 132) or other problems with left ventricular function, when blood accumulates in the pulmonary circulation because the left ventricle is not pumping efficiently. Lung disease can also increase in pulmonary blood pressure because of destruction of lung capillaries, e.g. in emphysema. Primary pulmonary hypertension, where there is no identifiable cause, is rare.</p>

                            <h3>Hypotension</h3>
                            <p>This usually occurs as a complication of other conditions, such as shock (p. 122) or Addison's disease (p. 254). Low blood pressure leads to inadequate blood supply to the brain. Depending on the cause, unconsciousness may be brief (fainting) or more prolonged, possibly causing death.</p>
                            <p><strong>Postural hypotension</strong> is an abrupt fall in blood pressure on standing up suddenly from a sitting or lying position. It causes dizziness and occasionally syncope (fainting). It is most common in older people, whose baroreceptor reflex does not respond quickly enough to maintain blood pressure during sudden changes of body position.</p>
