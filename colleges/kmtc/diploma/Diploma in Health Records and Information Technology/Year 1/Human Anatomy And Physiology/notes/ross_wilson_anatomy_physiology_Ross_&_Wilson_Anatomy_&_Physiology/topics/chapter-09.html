                            <p>The endocrine system consists of glands, which are widely separated and have no physical connections with each other (Fig. 9.1). Endocrine glands are groups of secretory cells surrounded by extensive networks of capillaries that facilitate diffusion of hormones (chemical messengers) from the secretory cells into the bloodstream. They are also referred to as <strong>ductless glands</strong> because hormones diffuse directly into the bloodstream. Hormones are then carried in the bloodstream to target tissues and organs that may be distant, where they influence cell growth and metabolism.</p>

                            <p>Homeostasis of the internal environment is maintained partly by the autonomic nervous system and partly by the endocrine system. The autonomic nervous system is concerned with rapid changes, while endocrine control is generally involved in slower and more precise adjustments.</p>

                            <p>The main endocrine glands are shown in Fig. 9.1, although many other organs and tissues also secrete hormones as a secondary function. For example, adipose tissue produces leptin (Table 9.4, p. 247), which is involved in the regulation of appetite, and the heart secretes atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP, Table 9.4, p. 247), which acts on the kidneys.</p>
                            <p>Although the hypothalamus is classified as a part of the brain rather than an endocrine gland, it controls the pituitary gland and indirectly influences many others.</p>
                            <p>The ovaries and the testes secrete hormones associated with the reproductive system after puberty; their functions are described in Chapter 18. The placenta, which develops to nourish the developing fetus during pregnancy, also has an endocrine function, which is outlined in Chapter 5.</p>
                            <p>The most important endocrine glands are explored in the early sections of this chapter. Some hormones, e.g. prostaglandins, do not travel to remote organs but act locally instead and some of these are considered briefly on page 248. Changes in endocrine functions that accompany ageing are explored. Problems that arise when abnormalities occur are caused by the over- or under-activity of endocrine glands and are explained in the final sections of the chapter.</p>

                            <h3>Overview of hormone action</h3>
                            <p>When a hormone arrives at its target cell, it binds to a specific receptor, where it acts as a switch influencing chemical or metabolic reactions inside the cell. Receptors for peptide hormones are situated on the cell membrane and those for lipid-based hormones are located inside cells. Examples of peptide and lipid-based hormones are shown in Box 9.1.</p>

                            <p>The level of a hormone in the blood is variable and self-regulating within its normal range. A hormone is released in response to a specific stimulus and usually its action reverses or negates the stimulus through a <strong>negative feedback mechanism</strong> (p. 35). This may be controlled either indirectly through the release of hormones by the hypothalamus and the anterior pituitary gland, e.g. steroid and thyroid hormones, or directly by blood levels of the stimulus, e.g. insulin and glucagon, which are determined by plasma glucose levels.</p>
                            <p>The effect of a <strong>positive feedback mechanism</strong> is amplification of the stimulus and increasing release of the hormone until a particular process is complete and the stimulus ceases, e.g. release of oxytocin during labour (p. 239).</p>

                            <p>The pituitary gland and the hypothalamus act as a unit, regulating the activity of most of the other endocrine glands. The pituitary gland lies in the hypophyseal fossa of the sphenoid bone below the hypothalamus, to which it is attached by a stalk (Fig. 9.2). It is the size of a pea, weighs about 500 mg and consists of two main parts that originate from different types of cell. The <strong>anterior pituitary</strong> is composed of glandular tissue secreting hormones because it is an upgrowth of glandular tissue from the pharynx, and the <strong>posterior pituitary</strong> is composed of nervous tissue because it is a downgrowth of nervous tissue from the brain. There is a network of nerve fibres between the hypothalamus and the posterior pituitary (Fig. 9.3).</p>

                            <p><strong>Arterial blood</strong><br>
                            Arterial supply is from branches of the internal carotid artery. The anterior lobe is supplied indirectly by blood that has already passed through a capillary bed in the hypothalamus (see later), and the posterior lobe is supplied directly.</p>
                            <p><strong>Venous drainage</strong><br>
                            Venous blood, containing hormones from both lobes, leaves the gland in short veins that enter the venous sinuses between the layers of dura mater.</p>

                            <h4>The influence of the hypothalamus on the pituitary gland</h4>
                            <p>The hypothalamus controls release of hormones from both the anterior and posterior pituitary but in different ways that are explained in the next sections.</p>

                            <h3>Anterior pituitary</h3>

                            This network of vessels transports blood from the hypothalamus to the anterior pituitary, where it enters a network of tiny sinusoids (p. 83) that are in close contact with the secretory cells, permitting easy passage of hormones into the bloodstream. As well as providing oxygen and nutrients, this blood transports releasing and inhibiting hormones secreted by the hypothalamus. These hormones specifically influence secretion and release of other hormones formed in the anterior pituitary (Table 9.1).</p>

                            <p>Some of the hormones secreted by the anterior lobe stimulate or inhibit secretion by other endocrine glands (target glands) while others have a direct effect on target tissues.

                            <p>Secretion of an anterior pituitary hormone follows stimulation of the gland by a specific releasing hormone produced by the hypothalamus and carried to the gland through the pituitary portal system already described. The whole system is controlled by a negative feedback mechanism (Ch. 2): that is, when the level of a hormone in the blood supplying the hypothalamus is low it produces the appropriate releasing hormone, which stimulates release of a trophic hormone by the anterior pituitary. This in turn stimulates the target gland to produce and release its hormone. As a result, the blood level of that hormone rises and inhibits secretion of its releasing factor by the hypothalamus (Fig. 9.4).</p>

                            <p><strong>Growth hormone</strong><br>
                            Growth hormone (GH) is the most abundant hormone synthesised by the anterior pituitary. It stimulates growth and division of most body cells, i.e. has anabolic effects, especially on those in the bones and skeletal muscles.<br>
                            Its secretion is highest in childhood and adolescence, accelerating cell division, increasing tissue mass and driving the rapid body growth taking place at this time. In adult life, GH controls growth and regeneration of nearly all body tissues, especially skeletal muscle and bone. It also regulates aspects of metabolism in many organs, e.g. liver, intestines and pancreas. It stimulates protein synthesis, especially for tissue growth and repair, promotes breakdown of fats and increases blood glucose levels (Ch. 12).<br>
                            Its release is stimulated by growth hormone releasing hormone (GHRH) and suppressed by growth hormone release inhibiting hormone (GHRIH), also known as somatostatin, both of which are secreted by the hypothalamus.<br>
                            GH secretion is controlled by a negative feedback system; it is inhibited when the blood level rises and also when GHRIH is released by the hypothalamus. GHRIH also suppresses secretion of thyroid stimulating hormone and gastrointestinal secretions, e.g. gastric juice, gastrin and cholecystokinin (Ch. 12).<br>
                            Secretion of GH is greater at night during deep sleep and is also stimulated by hypoglycaemia (low blood glucose), exercise and anxiety. Ongoing sleep disturbances in children, e.g. in childhood asthma, can lead to restriction of normal growth.<br>
                            GH is a stress hormone and, as such, is released during situations such as starvation and trauma.</p>

                            <p><strong>Prolactin</strong><br>
                            This hormone, also known as lactogenic hormone, is secreted during pregnancy to prepare the breasts for lactation (milk production) after childbirth. The blood level of prolactin is stimulated by prolactin releasing hormone (PRH) released from the hypothalamus and it is lowered by prolactin inhibiting hormone (PIH, dopamine) and by an increased blood level of prolactin. Immediately after birth, suckling stimulates prolactin secretion and lactation. The resultant high blood level is a factor in reducing the incidence of conception during lactation.<br>
                            Prolactin, together with oestrogens, corticosteroids, insulin and thyroxine, is involved in initiating and maintaining lactation. Prolactin secretion is related to sleep, rising during any period of sleep, night or day.</p>

                            <p><strong>Thyroid stimulating hormone</strong><br>
                            Release of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) is stimulated by thyrotrophin releasing hormone (TRH) from the hypothalamus. It stimulates growth and activity of the thyroid gland, which secretes the hormones thyroxine ($T_4$) and tri-iodothyronine ($T_3$). Secretion is regulated by a negative feedback mechanism: i.e. when the blood level of thyroid hormones is high, secretion of TSH is reduced, and vice versa (Fig. 9.4). Exposure to cold is a powerful stimulant of TSH secretion, leading to increased thyroid hormone release and an increase in metabolic rate.</p>

                            <p><strong>Adrenocorticotrophic hormone (corticotrophin)</strong><br>
                            Corticotrophin releasing hormone (CRH) from the hypothalamus promotes synthesis and release of adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) by the anterior pituitary. This stimulates growth and activity of the adrenal cortex, increasing the output of adrenocortical steroid hormones, especially cortisol.<br>
                            ACTH levels are highest at about 8 a.m. and fall to their lowest about midnight, although high levels sometimes occur at midday and 6 p.m. This circadian rhythm is maintained throughout life. It is associated with sleep patterns and adjustment to changes takes several days, e.g. following changing work shifts or travelling to a different time zone (jet lag).<br>
                            Secretion is also regulated by a negative feedback mechanism, being suppressed when the blood level of ACTH rises (Fig. 9.4). Other factors that stimulate secretion include hypoglycaemia, exercise and other stressors, e.g. emotional states and fever.</p>

                            <p><strong>Gonadotrophins</strong><br>
                            Just before puberty, two gonadotrophins (sex hormones) are secreted in gradually increasing amounts by the anterior pituitary in response to hypothalamic release of luteinising hormone releasing hormone (LHRH), also known as gonadotrophin releasing hormone (GnRH). Rising levels of these hormones at puberty promotes maturation of the reproductive organs. In both males and females the hormones responsible are:</p>

                            FSH stimulates production of gametes (ova or spermatozoa) by the gonads (the ovary in the female and the testis in the male).</p>
                            <p><em>In females</em><br>
                            LH and FSH control the secretion of the hormones oestrogen and progesterone during the menstrual cycle (see Figs 18.9 and 18.10). As the levels of oestrogen and progesterone rise, secretion of LH and FSH is suppressed.</p>
                            <p><em>In males</em><br>
                            LH, also called interstitial cell stimulating hormone (ICSH), stimulates the interstitial cells of the testes to secrete the hormone testosterone (Ch. 18).</p>

                            <h3>Posterior pituitary</h3>
                            <p>The posterior pituitary is formed from nervous tissue and consists of nerve cells surrounded by supporting glial cells called pituicytes. These neurones have their cell bodies in the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei of the hypothalamus and their axons form a bundle known as the hypothalamohypophyseal tract (see Fig. 9.3A). Posterior pituitary hormones are synthesised in the nerve cell bodies, transported along the axons and stored in vesicles within the axon terminals in the posterior pituitary (see Fig. 9.3B).</p>
                            <p>Unlike in the anterior pituitary, where secretion is stimulated by hormones, nerve impulses from the hypothalamus trigger exocytosis of the vesicles, releasing posterior pituitary hormones into the bloodstream.</p>
                            <p>Oxytocin and antidiuretic hormone (ADH, vasopressin) are the hormones released from axon terminals within the posterior pituitary (see Fig. 9.3B). These hormones act directly on non-endocrine tissue.</p>

                            <p><strong>Oxytocin</strong><br>
                            Oxytocin stimulates two target tissues during and after childbirth (parturition): uterine smooth muscle and the muscle cells of the lactating breast.<br>
                            During childbirth the posterior pituitary releases increasing amounts of oxytocin into the bloodstream in response to increasing stimulation of sensory stretch receptors in the uterine cervix as the baby's head progressively dilates it. Sensory impulses are generated and transmitted to the hypothalamus, stimulating the posterior pituitary to release more oxytocin. In turn, this stimulates more forceful uterine contractions and greater stretching of the uterine cervix as the baby's head is forced further downwards. This is an example of a positive feedback mechanism, which stops soon after the baby is delivered when distension of the uterine cervix is greatly reduced (Fig. 9.5).</p>

                            <p>The process of milk ejection also involves a positive feedback mechanism. Suckling generates sensory impulses that are transmitted from the breast to the hypothalamus, triggering release of oxytocin from the posterior pituitary. On reaching the lactating breast, oxytocin stimulates contraction of the milk ducts and myoepithelial cells around the glandular cells, ejecting milk. Suckling also inhibits the release of prolactin inhibiting hormone (PIH), prolonging prolactin secretion and lactation.</p>
                            <p>Oxytocin levels rise during sexual arousal in both males and females. This increases smooth muscle contraction, which is associated with glandular secretion and ejaculation in males. In females, contraction of smooth muscle in the vagina and uterus promotes movement of sperm towards the uterine tubes. It is believed that the smell of oxytocin may be involved in social recognition and bonding between mother and newborn baby.</p>

                            <p><strong>Antidiuretic hormone (vasopressin)</strong><br>
                            The main effect of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) is to reduce urine output (diuresis is the production of large volumes of urine). ADH acts on the distal convoluted tubules and collecting ducts of the kidneys, increasing their permeability to water (Ch. 13). This results in increased reabsorption of water from the glomerular filtrate and a corresponding reduction in the volume of urine produced. ADH secretion is determined by the osmotic pressure of the blood circulating to the osmoreceptors, which lie in the hypothalamus close to the supraoptic nucleus (see Fig. 9.3A).<br>
                            As osmotic pressure rises, e.g. as a result of dehydration, secretion of ADH increases. More water is therefore reabsorbed by the kidneys and the urine output is reduced. This means that the body retains more water and the rise in osmotic pressure is reversed. Conversely, when the osmotic pressure of the blood is low, e.g. after a large fluid intake, secretion of ADH is reduced, less water is reabsorbed and more urine is produced (Fig. 9.6).</p>
                            <p>At high concentrations, e.g. after severe blood loss, ADH causes smooth muscle contraction, especially vasoconstriction in small muscular arteries (arterioles). This has a pressor effect, raising systemic blood pressure; the alternative name of this hormone, vasopressin, reflects this effect.</p>
