                            <p>Before exploring the digestive system and its functions in Chapter 12, it is useful to understand the body's nutritional needs. The importance of a balanced diet to good health is increasingly recognised, as this provides the correct amounts of nutrients; counteracts the increasing prevalence of obesity; and reduces the risk of other significant conditions, such as cardiovascular disease and some cancers, as well as conferring many health benefits.</p>
                            <p>Food provides nutrients, some of which are broken down to provide energy while others are needed for growth, repair and other cellular activities. The main nutrient groups are:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-content">carbohydrates</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-content">proteins</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-content">fats</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-content">vitamins</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-content">mineral salts, trace elements and water.</span></li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Food usually contains a combination of nutrients; for example, potatoes and bread are mainly carbohydrate but both also contain protein and some vitamins. Dietary fibre, more correctly known as <strong>non-starch polysaccharide (NSP)</strong>, consists of indigestible material. Although it is not a nutrient, as it is neither a source of energy nor essential for cellular metabolism, NSP is an important dietary constituent that has many beneficial effects on the body.</p>
                            <p>A balanced diet is essential for health and provides appropriate amounts of all nutrients in the correct proportions to meet body requirements. An <strong>essential nutrient</strong> is a substance that cannot be made by the body and, for the maintenance of health, must therefore be eaten in the diet.</p>
                            <p>The first parts of this chapter explore the balanced diet and its constituents. The impact of healthy eating during early and middle life on the health of older adults is then explored, as many health problems arise as the result of poor diet. In developed countries obesity is increasingly common, while in other countries malnutrition is widespread. The final section considers some consequences of poor nutrition.</p>

                            <p>A balanced diet contains appropriate proportions of all the nutrients required for health. This is normally achieved by eating a variety of foods because no single food, with the exception of breast milk, contains the correct proportions of the essential nutrients. If any nutrient is eaten in excess or is deficient, health may be adversely affected. For example, a high-energy diet can lead to obesity, and an iron-deficient one to anaemia.</p>
                            <p>A balanced diet is highly important in maintaining a healthy body weight, which can be assessed by calculating <strong>body mass index</strong> (BMI; Box 11.1).</p>

                            <p>Healthy eating, i.e. eating a balanced diet, requires knowledge and planning. An important dietary consideration is the amount of energy required, which should meet individual requirements. Daily energy requirements depend on several factors, including metabolic rate (p. 342), age, gender and activity levels. For healthy adults, the recommended average daily energy intake is:</p>

                            <p>Dietary carbohydrates, fats and proteins are the principal energy sources and fat is the most concentrated form. Dietary energy is correctly expressed in joules or kilojoules (kJ), although the older terms calories and kilocalories (kcal or Cal) are also still used in the UK.</p>
                            
                            <p>This section is based on the recommendations of the British Nutrition Foundation (2016a, 2016b, 2016c). Recommendations for daily food intake sort foods of similar origins and nutritional values into food groups, and advise that from the age of 2 years a certain proportion from each group should be eaten daily (Fig. 11.1). If this plan is followed, the resulting dietary intake is likely to be well balanced. The five food groups are:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-content">fruit and vegetables</span></li>

                            <p>A sixth group is shown in the bottom left-hand corner of Fig. 11.1. These foods should be eaten less often and only in small amounts because they are high in saturated fat, salt and sugar; they are not needed as part of a healthy diet.</p>
                            <p>The first two groups just listed should form most of the diet, with the other groups forming the remainder.</p>

                            <p>At least five portions per day are recommended; fruit and vegetables should make up around a third of the diet. This group includes fresh, frozen and canned products, and provides carbohydrate, fibre, vitamins A and C, and folic acid.</p>
                            <p>Unsweetened 100% fruit or vegetable juice and smoothies (150 mL) count as only one of the 'five a day', irrespective of how much is taken (Box 11.2).</p>

                            <h4>Potatoes, bread, rice, pasta and other starchy carbohydrates</h4>
                            <p>The British Nutrition Foundation recommends that this group should make up about one-third of the diet and that each meal should be based around one food from this group. Potatoes, yams and plantains are classified as 'starchy carbohydrates' and are, therefore, considered within this group rather than as fruit and vegetables. Other foods in this group include breakfast cereals, rice and noodles. These foods are sources of carbohydrate and fibre that provide sustained energy release. Some also contain iron and B-group vitamins, including folic acid (p. 304).</p>

                            <h4>Dairy and dairy alternatives</h4>
                            <p>Foods in this group provide protein and minerals, including calcium, iodine and zinc; some are also a source of vitamins A, $B_2$ and $B_{12}$. They include milk, cheese, fromage frais and yoghurt, and often contain considerable amounts of fat. Intake should therefore be limited to three servings per day and options with less fat and sugar considered. When dairy alternatives are used, e.g. in cases of cows' milk allergy or lactose intolerance, unsweetened calcium-fortified products are recommended (Box 11.3).</p>

                            <h4>Beans, pulses, fish, eggs, meat and other proteins</h4>
                            <p>In addition to the food shown in Fig. 11.1, this group includes processed meat products such as bacon, sausages, beefburgers, salami and pâté. Intake of red and processed meat should not exceed 70 g per day. Moderate amounts are recommended because many have a high fat content. It is suggested that fish, including one portion of oily fish such as salmon, trout, sardines or fresh tuna, is eaten twice weekly. This food group provides protein, iron, vitamins B and D, and sometimes minerals. Vegetarian alternatives include tofu, nuts, beans and pulses, e.g. lentils. Beans and pulses are also a good source of fibre, although only one 80 g portion counts as one of the 'five a day'.</p>

                            <h4>Oils and spreads</h4>
                            <p>Dietary fat is an essential part of the diet, as it provides the essential fatty acids and enables absorption of the fat-soluble vitamins. As fats are high in energy, only small amounts are required. Fats are classified as saturated or unsaturated and the differences are explained on page 301; unsaturated products, which generally come from plants, are the recommended option.</p>
                            <p>Items in this group should be eaten only sparingly. They are not required in the diet and can have adverse health consequences, as they are high in energy and have little additional nutritional value; low-salt and low-fat/sugar alternatives are recommended. Examples include sugar and sugary soft drinks, syrup, chocolate and sweets, cakes, biscuits, ice cream and savoury snacks, e.g. crisps. Fried food, including chips, and mayonnaise, butter and ghee are also included in this group.</p>

                            <h4>Additional recommendations</h4>
                            <p>The British Nutrition Foundation makes other specific recommendations about salt (p. 304) and fluid intake (1.5-2 litres per day). This includes water, tea, coffee, squash and fruit juice. Alcohol intake should not exceed 3-4 units per day for men and 2-3 units per day for women (Box 11.4).</p>

                            <h4>Groups of people with specific dietary requirements</h4>
                            <p>Certain groups of people require a diet different from the principles outlined above. For example, pregnant and lactating women have higher energy requirements to support the growing baby and milk production. Menstruating women need more iron in their diet than non-menstruating women to compensate for blood loss during menstruation. Babies and growing children have higher energy requirements than adults because they have relatively higher growth and metabolic rates. In some gastrointestinal disorders, e.g. coeliac disease (p. 360), there is intolerance of certain foods, which restricts dietary choices.</p>
                            <p>Digestion, absorption and use of nutrients are explained in Chapter 12. Structures of carbohydrates, proteins and fats are described in Chapter 2.</p>

                            <h3>Carbohydrates</h3>
                            <p>Carbohydrates are mainly sugars and starches, which are found in a wide variety of foods, e.g. sugar, jam, cereals, bread, biscuits, pasta, convenience foods, fruit and vegetables. Chemically, they consist of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen, the hydrogen and oxygen being in the same proportion as in water (Ch. 2). Carbohydrates are classified according to the complexity of the chemical substances from which they are formed:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-content"><strong>monosaccharides</strong>, e.g. glucose (see Fig. 2.7)</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-content"><strong>disaccharides</strong>, e.g. sucrose (see Fig. 2.7)</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-content"><strong>polysaccharides</strong>, complex molecules built from large numbers of monosaccharides, some of which are digestible, e.g. glycogen, while others are not, e.g. NSP (p. 322).</span></li>
                            </ul>

                            <h4>Glycaemic index</h4>
                            <p>The type of carbohydrate eaten is important in a healthy diet. The rate of carbohydrate absorption from the alimentary tract depends on the complexity of carbohydrate structure. Monosaccharides such as glucose are quickly absorbed and cause blood glucose levels to rise sharply. Foods high in glucose and other monosaccharides therefore rapidly increase blood glucose levels and are said to have a <strong>high glycaemic index (GI)</strong>. They tend not to satisfy hunger for long because the rapid rise in blood glucose stimulates insulin secretion, which in turn reduces blood glucose levels. More complex carbohydrates such as starches require digestion before absorption, and so cause a slower and more sustained rise in blood glucose levels. They are referred to as <strong>low-GI foodstuffs</strong> and include unprocessed wholegrain and high-fibre foods. They satisfy hunger for longer because they release carbohydrates over a more extended period. Low-GI foods are important in weight control and in managing diabetes mellitus.</p>

                            <h4>Functions of digestible carbohydrates</h4>
                            <p>These include:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">

                            </ul>

                            <h3>Proteins</h3>
                            <p>During digestion, proteins are broken down into their constituent amino acids and it is in this form that they are absorbed into the bloodstream. A constant supply of amino acids is needed to build new proteins, e.g. structural proteins, enzymes and some hormones.</p>

                            <h4>Amino acids</h4>
                            <p>Amino acids (see Fig. 2.8) are composed of the elements carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen. Some contain minerals such as iron, copper, zinc, iodine, sulphur and phosphate. Amino acids are divided into two categories: essential and non-essential.</p>
                            <p><strong>Essential amino acids</strong> cannot be synthesised in the body and therefore they must be included in the diet. <strong>Non-essential amino acids</strong> are those that can be synthesised in the body. The essential and non-essential amino acids are shown in Box 11.5.</p>

                            <p><strong>Nitrogen balance</strong><br>
                            Excess amino acids are broken down. The amino group ($NH_2$) is converted to the nitrogenous waste product urea and excreted by the kidneys. The remainder of the molecule is converted to either glucose or a ketone body (see ketosis, p. 129), depending on the amino acid. <strong>Negative nitrogen balance</strong> occurs when amino acid supply does not meet body needs. This situation may arise either when dietary protein intake is inadequate, e.g. deficiency or absence of amino acids, or protein requirement is increased, e.g. during growth spurts and following injury or surgery.</p>

                            <h4>Biological value of protein</h4>
                            <p>The nutritional value of a protein, its biological value, is determined by how well it meets the nutritional needs of the body. Protein of <strong>high biological value</strong> is usually of animal origin; it is easily digested and contains all the essential amino acids in the proportions required by the body.</p>
                            <p>A balanced diet, containing all the amino acids required, may also be achieved by eating a range of foods containing proteins of lower biological values, provided that deficiencies in amino acid content of any one of the constituent proteins is supplied by another. A vegetarian diet contains proteins with lower biological values, e.g. from vegetables, cereals and pulses. When proteins from different plant sources are combined, they complement each other, providing higher biological values than a single plant source. Through this complementary action the biological value of vegetarian diets can be similar to those based on animal protein.</p>

                            <h4>Functions of proteins</h4>
                            <p>Amino acids are used for:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-content">growth and repair of body cells and tissues</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-content">synthesis of enzymes, plasma proteins, antibodies (immunoglobulins) and some hormones</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-content">provision of energy - normally a secondary function, this becomes important only when there is not enough carbohydrate in the diet and fat stores are depleted.</span></li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>When protein is eaten in excess of the body's needs, the nitrogenous amino group is detached, i.e. it is deaminated, and excreted by the kidneys (p. 345). The remainder is converted to fat for storage in the fat depots, e.g. in the fat cells of adipose tissue (p. 51).</p>

                            <h3>Fats</h3>
                            <p>Fats consist of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen, but they differ from carbohydrates in that the hydrogen and oxygen are not in the same proportions as in water. There are several groups of fats and lipids that are important in nutrition.</p>

                            <h4>Fats (triglycerides)</h4>
                            <p>Commonly known as 'fat', a triglyceride molecule consists of three fatty acids linked to a glycerol molecule (see Fig. 2.9). Depending on the type and relative amounts of fatty acids they contain, fats are classified as saturated or unsaturated.</p>
                            <p>In general, saturated fats are solid at room temperature and originate from animal sources, while unsaturated fats are oils, usually derived from vegetables or plants. A high intake of saturated fat can predispose to coronary heart disease (Ch. 5).</p>
                            <p>Linoleic, linolenic and arachidonic acids are <strong>essential fatty acids</strong>, which cannot be synthesised by the body in significant amounts but are needed for synthesis of prostaglandins, phospholipids and leukotrienes. These fatty acids are found in oily fish.</p>

                            <h4>Cholesterol</h4>
                            <p>Unlike other lipids, whose molecules are composed of chains of atoms, this molecule contains four rings, which give it the characteristic steroid structure. It can be synthesised by the body (around 20%), with the remainder coming from saturated fats in the diet as a constituent of full-fat dairy products, fatty meat and egg yolk. Cholesterol is needed for synthesis of steroid hormones, e.g. glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids (Ch. 9), and is an important constituent of cell membranes.</p>
                            <p>Cholesterol is transported in the blood combined with proteins, forming lipoproteins. Two examples are:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-content"><strong>Low-density lipoprotein (LDL)</strong>: this carries cholesterol from the liver to the body cells. Excessive blood LDL levels are harmful to health, as LDL can build up in arterial walls, leading to atherosclerosis. LDL is sometimes known as 'bad cholesterol'.</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-content"><strong>High-density lipoprotein (HDL)</strong>: this carries cholesterol back from body cells to the liver, where it is either broken down or excreted.

                            <p>High blood cholesterol levels are associated with an increased risk of atherosclerosis (p. 125), hypertension (high blood pressure, p. 136) and diabetes mellitus (p. 255).</p>

                            <p>As the body stores excess fat, it is important not to eat too much, as this will lead to weight gain and becoming overweight or obese (p. 306).</p>

                            <h3>Vitamins</h3>
                            <p>Vitamins are chemicals required in very small quantities for essential metabolic processes. As most cannot be made by the body, they are an essential part of the diet and insufficiency may lead to a deficiency disease. They are found in a wide range of foods and are divided into two groups:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-content">fat-soluble vitamins: A, D, E and K</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-content">water-soluble vitamins: B complex and C.</span></li>
                            </ul>

                            <h4>Fat-soluble vitamins</h4>
                            <p>Bile is needed for absorption of these vitamins from the small intestine. The presence of mineral oils in the intestine and malabsorption impair their absorption.</p>

                            <p><strong>Vitamin A (retinol)</strong><br>
                            This vitamin is found in foods such as cream, egg yolk, liver, fish oil, milk, cheese and butter. It is not found in vegetable fats and oils but is added to margarine during manufacture. In addition, vitamin A can be formed in the body from certain carotenes, the main dietary sources of which are green vegetables, orange-coloured fruit (e.g. mangoes, apricots) and carrots. The main functions of vitamin A are:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-content">generation of the light-sensitive pigment rhodopsin (visual purple) in the retina of the eye (Ch. 8)</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-content">cell growth and differentiation, which is especially important in fast-growing cells, such as bone and the epithelial cells covering both internal and external body surfaces</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-content">immunity and defence against infection.</span></li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>The first sign of vitamin A deficiency is night blindness due to formation of abnormal retinal pigment. Other consequences include xerophthalmia (drying and thickening of the conjunctiva), which ultimately ulcerates and destroys the conjunctiva. This is a common cause of blindness in developing countries. Atrophy and keratinisation of other epithelial tissues lead to an increased incidence of infections of the ear and the respiratory, genitourinary and alimentary tracts. Immunity is compromised and bone development may be abnormal and delayed.</p>

                            <p><strong>Vitamin D</strong><br>
                            Vitamin D is found mainly in animal fats such as eggs, butter, cheese and fish liver oils. Humans can synthesise this vitamin by the action of the ultraviolet rays in sunlight on a form of cholesterol (7-dehydrocholesterol) in the skin, although this requires exposure to sunlight. Advice from Public Health England (2016) is that all UK residents should consider taking vitamin D supplements in autumn and winter when sunlight is limited. Individuals at greater risk of deficiency - namely, those from African, African-Caribbean and South Asian backgrounds, and people seldom exposed to sunlight - should consider doing this throughout the year.</p>
                            <p>Vitamin D increases calcium and phosphate absorption from the gut and stimulates their retention by the kidneys. It therefore promotes the calcification of bones and teeth.</p>
                            <p>Deficiency causes rickets in children and osteomalacia in adults (p. 469), due to impaired absorption and use of calcium and phosphate.</p>

                            <p><strong>Vitamin E</strong><br>
                            Also known as tocopherol, this is found in nuts, egg yolk, wheat germ, whole cereal, milk and butter.</p>
                            <p>Vitamin E is an antioxidant, which means that it protects body constituents such as membrane lipids from being destroyed in oxidative reactions caused by free radicals. Vitamin E has been shown to protect against coronary heart disease.</p>
                            <p>Deficiency is rare because this vitamin is present in many foods, and is usually seen only in premature babies and in conditions associated with impaired fat absorption, e.g. cystic fibrosis (p. 288).</p>

                            <p><strong>Vitamin K</strong><br>
                            The sources of vitamin K are liver, some vegetable oils and leafy green vegetables. It is also synthesised by bacteria in the large intestine and significant amounts are absorbed. A small amount is stored in the liver. Vitamin K is required by the liver for the production of prothrombin and factors VII, IX and X, all essential for blood clotting (p. 71). Deficiency therefore prevents normal blood coagulation and increases bleeding times. It may occur in adults when there is obstruction to the flow of bile, severe liver damage and malabsorption, e.g. in coeliac disease. Premature babies may be given vitamin K to prevent haemorrhagic disease of the newborn. This is because their intestines are sterile and require several weeks to become colonised with vitamin K-producing bacteria, allowing normal blood clotting.</p>

                            <h4>Water-soluble vitamins</h4>
                            <p>Water-soluble vitamins are lost in the urine, so body stores are usually limited.</p>

                            <p><strong>Vitamin B complex</strong><br>
                            This group of water-soluble vitamins promotes activity of enzymes involved in the chemical breakdown (catabolism) of nutrients to release energy.</p>
                            <p><em>Vitamin $B_1$ (thiamin)</em><br>
                            This is present in nuts, yeast, egg yolk, liver, legumes, meat and the germ of cereals. It is rapidly destroyed by heat. Thiamin is essential for the complete aerobic release of energy from carbohydrate. Absence or deficiency leads to accumulation of lactic and pyruvic acids, which may cause a build-up of tissue fluid (oedema) and heart failure. Thiamin is also important for nervous system function because of the dependency of these tissues on glucose for fuel.</p>
                            <p>Deficiency causes <strong>beriberi</strong>, which occurs mainly in countries where polished rice (rice with the outer coverings and germ removed) is the chief constituent of the diet. In beriberi there is:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-content">severe muscle wasting</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-content">delayed growth in children</span></li>

                            </ul>
                            <p>If it is untreated, death from cardiac failure or severe microbial infection may occur.</p>
                            <p>The main cause of thiamin deficiency in developed countries is alcoholism, where the diet is usually poor. The central nervous system is affected, causing neurological symptoms, which are usually irreversible. These include memory loss, ataxia and visual disturbances, known as Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome.</p>
                            <p><em>Vitamin $B_2$ (riboflavin)</em><br>
                            Riboflavin is found in yeast, green vegetables, milk, liver, eggs, cheese and fish roe. Only small amounts are stored in the body and it is destroyed by light and alkalis. It is involved in carbohydrate and protein metabolism, especially in the eyes and skin. Deficiency leads to cracking of the skin, commonly around the mouth (angular stomatitis), and inflammation of the tongue (glossitis).</p>
                            <p><em>Vitamin $B_3$ (niacin)</em><br>
                            This is present in liver, cheese, yeast, whole cereals, eggs and dairy products; in addition, the body can synthesise it from the amino acid tryptophan. It is central to energy release from carbohydrates in cells. In fat metabolism it inhibits the production of cholesterol and assists in fat breakdown.</p>
                            <p>Deficiency is rare and occurs mainly in areas where maize is the chief constituent of the diet. This is because niacin in maize is in an unusable form. <strong>Pellagra</strong> develops within 6-8 weeks of severe deficiency. It is characterised by:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-content">dermatitis - sunburn-like skin sensitivity affecting areas exposed to sunlight</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-content">confusion and dementia.</span></li>
                            </ul>
                            <p><em>Vitamin $B_6$ (pyridoxine)</em><br>
                            This stable vitamin is found in egg yolk, peas, beans, soya beans, yeast, poultry, white fish and peanuts. Dietary deficiency is very rare. Vitamin $B_6$ is associated with amino acid metabolism, including the synthesis of non-essential amino acids and important molecules such as haem and nucleic acids (Ch. 2).</p>
                            <p><em>Vitamin $B_{12}$ (cobalamin)</em><br>
                            This is a group of cobalt-containing compounds that are found in almost all foods of animal origin, and are destroyed by heat.</p>
                            <p>Vitamin $B_{12}$ is essential for DNA synthesis, and deficiency leads to megaloblastic anaemia (p. 74), which is correctable with supplements. However, vitamin $B_{12}$ is also required for formation and maintenance of myelin, the fatty substance that surrounds and protects some nerves. Deficiency accordingly causes irreversible damage, such as peripheral neuropathy and/or subacute spinal cord degeneration. The presence of <strong>intrinsic factor</strong> in the stomach is essential for absorption of vitamin $B_{12}$ in the terminal ileum. Deficiency is usually associated with insufficient intrinsic factor, which is fairly common in older adults. Dietary deficiency is uncommon but it is sometimes associated with a vegan diet.</p>
                            <p><em>Folic acid (folate)</em><br>
                            This is found in liver, leafy green vegetables, brown rice, beans, nuts and milk. It is synthesised by bacteria in the large intestine, and much of it is absorbed. It is destroyed by heat and moisture. As only a small amount is stored in the body, deficiency quickly becomes evident. Like vitamin $B_{12}$, folic acid is also essential for DNA synthesis, and when it is lacking, mitosis (cell division) is impaired. This manifests particularly in rapidly dividing tissues such as blood, and folate deficiency therefore leads to megaloblastic anaemia (p. 74), which is reversible with folate supplements. It is involved in development of the embryonic neural tube, which later becomes the spinal cord and skull. Folate deficiency at conception and during early pregnancy is linked to spina bifida (p. 202).</p>
                            <p><em>Pantothenic acid</em><br>
                            This is found in many foods and is associated with energy-yielding carbohydrate metabolism. No deficiency diseases have been identified. It is destroyed by excessive heat and freezing.</p>
                            <p><em>Biotin</em><br>
                            This is found in a wide range of foods, including yeast, egg yolk, liver, kidney and tomatoes, and is synthesised by microbes in the intestine. It is associated with the metabolism of carbohydrates, lipids and some amino acids; deficiency is very rare.</p>

                            <p><strong>Vitamin C (ascorbic acid)</strong><br>
                            This is found in fresh fruit, especially blackcurrants, oranges, grapefruit and lemons, and also in rosehips and green vegetables. The vitamin is very water-soluble and is easily destroyed by heat, ageing, chopping, salting and drying. These processes may predispose to the development of <strong>scurvy</strong> (deficiency). Deficiency becomes apparent after 4–6 months.</p>
                            <p>Vitamin C is associated with protein metabolism, especially the laying down of collagen fibres in connective tissue. Vitamin C, like vitamin E, acts as an antioxidant, protecting body molecules from damaging oxidative reactions caused by free radicals. When scurvy affects collagen production, there is fragility of blood vessels, delayed wound healing and poor bone repair. Gums become swollen and spongy, and the teeth loosen in their sockets. Systemic effects include fatigue, weakness and aching joints and muscles.</p>

                            <h3>Minerals, trace elements and water</h3>
                            <h4>Minerals and trace elements</h4>
                            <p>Minerals are inorganic substances needed in small amounts for normal cellular functioning. Some minerals, e.g. calcium, phosphate, sodium and potassium, are needed in larger amounts than others. Those required in only tiny quantities are known as <strong>trace elements</strong> or <strong>trace minerals</strong>, e.g. iron, iodine, zinc, copper, cobalt, selenium and fluoride. The main minerals and trace elements are outlined here.</p>

                            <p><strong>Calcium</strong><br>
                            This is found in milk, cheese, eggs, green vegetables and some fish, e.g. sardines. An adequate supply should be obtained from a well-balanced diet, although requirements are higher in pregnant women and growing children. The most abundant of the minerals, 99% of calcium (about 1 kg in adults) is found in the bones and teeth, where it is an essential structural component. Calcium is also involved in blood clotting and in nerve and muscle function. Deficiency of calcium causes rickets in children and osteomalacia in adults (p. 469).</p>

                            <p><strong>Phosphate</strong><br>
                            Sources include milk and dairy products, red meat, fish, poultry, bread and rice. If there is sufficient calcium in the diet, it is unlikely that there will be phosphate deficiency.</p>
                            <p>Phosphate is associated with calcium and vitamin D in the hardening of bones and teeth; 85% of body phosphate is found in these sites. Phosphates are an essential part of nucleic acids (DNA and RNA, Ch. 17), cell membranes and energy storage molecules such as adenosine triphosphate (ATP, see Fig. 2.10).</p>

                            <p><strong>Sodium</strong><br>
                            Sodium is found in most foods, especially in processed foods and 'fast food'. It is also frequently added during cooking or as table salt. Intake of sodium chloride usually exceeds the recommended 6 g daily, although excess is normally excreted in the urine. High sodium intake is associated with hypertension (p. 136), which is a risk factor for ischaemic heart disease (p. 132) and stroke (p. 194). Food is usually labelled with sodium content, and to convert this to salt, the sodium content is multiplied by 2.5.</p>
                            <p>Sodium is the most common extracellular cation and is essential for muscle contraction and transmission of nerve impulses.</p>

                            <p><strong>Potassium</strong><br>
                            This is found widely distributed in almost all foods, especially fruit and vegetables, and intake usually exceeds requirements.</p>
                            <p>It is the most common intracellular cation and, like sodium, is involved in muscle contraction and transmission of nerve impulses.</p>

                            <p><strong>Iron</strong><br>
                            Iron, as a soluble compound, is found in liver, red meat, pulses, nuts, eggs, dried fruit, wholemeal bread and leafy green vegetables. In normal adults about 1 mg of iron is lost from the body daily. The normal daily diet contains more, i.e. 9-15 mg, but only 5-15% of this is in a form that can be absorbed. Iron is essential for the formation of haemoglobin in red blood cells. It is also necessary for carbohydrate metabolism and synthesis of some hormones and neurotransmitters. Menstruating and pregnant women have increased iron requirements, as do young people experiencing growth spurts.</p>
                            <p>Iron deficiency anaemia (p. 73) is the most common nutritional deficiency worldwide and occurs when iron stores become depleted. Iron deficiency anaemia may also arise from chronic bleeding, e.g. in peptic ulcer disease.</p>

                            <p><strong>Iodine</strong><br>
                            Iodine is found in seafoods and in vegetables grown in soil rich in iodine. In parts of the world where iodine is deficient in soil, very small quantities are added to table salt to prevent goitre (p. 251).</p>
                            <p>It is essential for the formation of thyroxine and tri-iodothyronine, two hormones secreted by the thyroid gland, which regulate metabolic rate and physical and mental development.</p>

                            <h4>Water</h4>
                            <p>Water is the most abundant constituent of the human body, accounting for around 60% of the body weight in an adult (see Fig. 2.17).</p>
                            <p>A large amount of water is lost each day in urine, sweat and faeces. This is normally balanced by intake in food and fluids, to satisfy thirst. The recommended daily intake is about 1.5–2 litres (6–8 glasses) for adults. Water requirements are increased by physical activity and high environmental temperatures. Dehydration, with serious consequences, may occur if intake does not balance loss. Water balance is finely regulated by the action of hormones on the kidney tubules (Ch. 13).</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>Functions of water</strong><br>
                            These include:</p>

                        <div class="content-card">
                            <p>The importance of good nutrition to health and well-being at all stages of the lifespan is well established. The relationship between nutrition, diet and ageing is complex, as many diseases arise from poor diet; for example, atherosclerosis is associated with a diet high in saturated fat and this condition predisposes to coronary heart disease (p. 132). Good nutrition during early and middle life can significantly reduce the risk of problems in later life; for example, there is evidence that young women who limit their dairy intake when trying to lose weight, or drink lots of fizzy drinks (which impair calcium absorption), have an increased risk of osteoporosis (p. 468) in later life.</p>
                            <p>The senses of smell and taste decline with age (Ch. 8), which can reduce appetite and enjoyment of eating.</p>
                            <p>Basal metabolic rate (BMR, p. 342) gradually declines with age from the fourth or fifth decades of life. This is mainly due to a reduction in muscle mass and a corresponding increase in body fat; BMR is higher in those with more muscle, as muscle is more metabolically active than adipose tissue (fat). Physical activity generally lessens with age, further reducing BMR in older adults.</p>
                            <p>UK dietary recommendations for older adults are the same as those for other adults, although energy requirements gradually reduce as the BMR falls, especially when physical activity is limited. As for other age groups, it is important for older adults to eat a balanced diet with sufficient fibre and vitamins.</p>

                            <h4>Nutritional disorders in older adults</h4>
                            <p>Malnutrition and obesity are both prevalent in older adults, as well as other conditions considered here. Malnutrition is more prevalent in those living in institutions, whereas being overweight or obese tends to be more common in people living at home.</p>

                            <p><strong>Malnutrition</strong><br>
                            Being underweight (BMI below 18.5) predisposes to health problems, e.g. development of pressure ulcers, which take longer to heal in older adults. In the oldest adults, anorexia and weight loss become increasingly common and the incidence of protein-energy malnutrition (PEM, p. 307) increases. Malnutrition in healthcare settings is considered in the following section.</p>

                            <p><strong>Obesity</strong><br>
                            It is common for body weight to increase between the ages of 40 and 65 ('middle age spread'). This is generally attributed to a reduction in physical activity and BMR rather than increased dietary energy intake. Overweight is defined as BMI above 25 and obesity when BMI is above 30 (see Box 11.1). After 65 years, there is usually weight loss accompanied by a lower dietary intake, a decline in muscle mass and an increasing risk of malnutrition. Being overweight or obese at any age carries many health risks (see Box 11.6).</p>

                            <p><strong>Vitamin deficiency</strong><br>
                            Some vitamin deficiencies become more common in older adults. Vitamin D deficiency (p. 302) is more closely linked to older adults who live in institutions or are housebound. It is recommended that vitamin D intake be maintained by eating oily fish and fortified cereals regularly and that those over 65 years take supplements ($10 \text{ \mu g}$ per day).</p>
                            <p>Vitamin $B_{12}$ deficiency, perhaps due to decreased absorption of intrinsic factor, is also more common in older adults and may result in pernicious anaemia (p. 74).</p>

                            <p><strong>Constipation</strong><br>
                            Constipation becomes more common as muscle tone and peristaltic activity of the colon lessen with age. This is exacerbated by a lower fluid and/or fibre intake, taking less exercise and reduced mobility. If there is difficulty with activities related to nutrition, e.g. mobility problems that prevent shopping, impaired cognitive function or loss of the manual dexterity required to prepare and eat food and drinks, this further predisposes to constipation.</p>

                            <p>The importance of nutrition is increasingly recognised as essential for health, and illness often alters nutritional requirements.</p>

                            <h4>Protein-energy malnutrition</h4>
                            <p>Protein-energy malnutrition (PEM) is the result of inadequate intake of protein, carbohydrate and fat. It occurs during periods of starvation and when dietary intake is insufficient to meet increased requirements, e.g. in trauma, fever and illness. Malnutrition is relatively rare in developed countries except when there is an underlying condition, e.g. sepsis, trauma, surgery or a concurrent illness. Poor nutrition is seen where poverty is prevalent and is usually the result of a diet that is not adequately balanced. In the UK, many older adults admitted to hospitals and care homes have signs of under-nutrition, which often worsens after admission. Anorexia (loss of appetite) from any cause may lead to malnutrition. People with advanced cancer or some chronic illnesses can experience loss of appetite accompanied by profound weight loss and muscle wasting as a symptom of cachexia (p. 59).</p>
                            <p>If dietary intake is inadequate, it is not uncommon for vitamin deficiency to develop at the same time. Poor nutrition reduces the ability to combat other illness and infection. The degree of malnutrition can be assessed from measurement of body mass index (see Box 11.1).</p>
                            <p>Infants and young children are particularly susceptible, as their nutritional requirements for normal growth and development are high. In developing countries where people experience long periods of near-total starvation, the following two conditions described are found in children under 5 years.</p>

                            <p><strong>Kwashiorkor</strong><br>
                            This is malnutrition with oedema that typically occurs when breast feeding stops and is often precipitated by infections such as measles or gastroenteritis. Severe liver damage significantly reduces the production of plasma proteins, leading to ascites and oedema in the lower limbs that mask emaciation (Fig. 11.2 A).</p>
                            <p>Growth stops and there is loss of weight and loss of pigmentation of skin and hair, accompanied by listlessness, apathy and irritability. There is susceptibility to infection, and recovery from injury and infection takes longer.</p>

                            <p><strong>Marasmus</strong><br>
                            This type of malnutrition with severe muscle wasting is characterised by emaciation due to breakdown (catabolism) of muscle and fat (Fig. 11.2B). There is no oedema. Growth milestones are delayed and the skin becomes wrinkled due to absence of subcutaneous fat; hair is lost.</p>

                            <h4>Malabsorption</h4>
                            <p>The causes of malabsorption vary widely, from short-term problems such as gastrointestinal infections (p. 354) to chronic conditions such as cystic fibrosis (p. 288). Malabsorption may be specific for one nutrient, e.g. vitamin $B_{12}$ in pernicious anaemia (p. 74), or it may apply across a spectrum of nutrients, e.g. tropical sprue (p. 360).</p>

                            <h4>Obesity</h4>
                            <p>In developed countries, this is increasingly common, although it is also prevalent in some developing countries. The WHO defines obesity as a BMI of 30 or above (see Box 11.1). It occurs when energy intake exceeds energy expenditure, e.g. in inactive individuals whose food intake exceeds daily energy requirements.</p>
                            <p>Obesity (Fig. 11.3) is a growing public health challenge worldwide that affects people of all ages and predisposes to many other conditions (Box 11.6). Worldwide, 39% of adults aged 18 years and over were overweight in 2014, and 13% were obese (WHO, 2016). There were more than 40 million overweight or obese children aged under 5 worldwide, of whom 75% live in urban areas of developing countries (WHO, 2016). Childhood obesity is of particular concern, especially in developing countries (where malnutrition can also be widespread), because this preventable condition is likely to continue into and during adulthood with its associated health risks, especially diabetes and cardiovascular disease.</p>

                            <p>The hormone <strong>leptin</strong> is associated with obesity. It has several functions, one of which is control of appetite. After eating, this hormone is released by adipose tissue and acts on the hypothalamus, resulting in a feeling of satiety (fullness), which suppresses the appetite. In obesity, there are usually high blood levels of leptin and the negative feedback system, which usually suppresses the appetite, no longer operates normally.</p>
                            <p>Another function of leptin is involvement in the synthesis of gonadotrophin releasing hormone and gonadotrophins at puberty (Ch. 18). As it is secreted by fat tissue, levels are low in thin individuals, which explains why:</p>
