                            <li>Psychology began as philosophy which entails attempting to understand behavior through reasoning.</li>
                            <li>Philosophy is defined as the study of the mind.</li>
                            <li>Philosophy did not involve observations or experiments.</li>
                            <li>Behavior was explained through reasoning and arguments.</li>
                            <li>Socrates is known for questioning everything and supplying no answers.</li>
                            <li>Plato's student attempted to explain why people dream and how people operate</li>
                            <li>The Greeks were the first to define psychology as the study of the mind or the soul.</li>
                            <li>Aristotle, a Greek philosopher thought that the highest form of reasoning and thinking came from the heart.</li>
                            <li>But during the $19^{\text {m }}$ century Psychology became a science and an academic discipline when people who wanted to learn more about human behavior and mental processes</li>
                            <li>During this time a German scientist Wilhelm Wundt opened the first laboratory and faculty of Psychology in the University of Leipzig in 1879 and established the first Psychological Journal in 1881.</li>
                            <li>He was the first to apply the scientific method to the field.</li>
                            <li>His work focused on consciousness - or the awareness of immediate experience.</li>
                            <li>However, it applied the efforts of the scientific process in the same way physics or chemistry would.</li>
                            <li>Later, one of his students G. Stanley Hall brought the science of psychology to America.</li>
                            <li>He founded the American Psychological Association and became its first president.</li>
                            <li>He started America's first research laboratory at John's Hopkins University in 1883, and published the first journal of psychology in America.</li>

                            <li>Describe - what is the nature of this behavior?</li>
                            <li>The first goal is to observe behavior and describe, often in as much detail as possible, what was observed as objectively as possible.</li>
                            <li>Through describing the behavior of humans and other animals, we are able to understand it and gain a better perspective on what is considered normal and abnormal.</li>
                            <li>Explain -why does it occur?</li>
                            <li>While descriptions come from observable data, psychologists must go beyond what is obvious and explain their observations. In other words, why did the subject do what he or she did?</li>
                            <li>Predict -</li>
                            <li>Another primary goal of psychology is to make predictions.</li>
                            <li>Once we know what happens, and why it happens, we can begin to speculate what will happen in the future.</li>
                            <li>There's an old saying, which very often holds true: "the best predictor of future behavior is past behavior."</li>
                            <li>Control -The fourth goal of psychology is to control, modify or change the existing behavior. Influencing behavior in a helpful manner.</li>
                            <li>Once we know what happens, why it happens and what is likely to happen in the future, we can expect control over it.</li>
                            <li>E.g, if your father was abusive, you are likely to choose an abusive partner, and can therefore intervene to change this negative behavior</li>
                            <li>Improve -Not only do psychologists attempt to control behavior, they want to do so in a positive manner, they want to improve a person's life, not make it worse. This is not always the case, but it should always be the intention.</li>
