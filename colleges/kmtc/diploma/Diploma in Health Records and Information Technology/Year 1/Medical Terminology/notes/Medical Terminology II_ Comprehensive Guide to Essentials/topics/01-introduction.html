                        <h2 id="origin">Origin/ Historical background of medical terminology</h2>
                        <p>The majority of medical terms claim Greek and Latin ancestory. Some have been adapted from modern languages especially German and French. The study of medical terminology can enrich our understanding.</p>

                        <h2 id="technicians">Health information technicians</h2>
                        <p>Every time a patient receives medical treatment, information is added to the patient's medical record which includes data about symptoms, medical history, test results, diagnoses and treatment.</p>
                        <p>Health information technicians organize and manage these records working closely with physicians, nurses and other health professionals to ensure that they provide a complete and accurate basis for quality patient care.</p>
                        <p>Accurate medical records are essential for administrative purposes. Health information technicians assign a code to each diagnosis and procedure a patient receives and this information is used for accurate patient billing. In addition, health information technicians analyze medical records to reveal trends in health and diseases. This research can be used to: improve patient care, manage costs, and help establish new medical treatments.</p>
                        <p>To read and interpret medical records, health information technicians need a thorough background in medical terminology. Most of these technicians work in hospitals and long-term care facilities. Others may work in medical clinics, government agencies, insurance companies and consulting firms.</p>

                        <h3 id="elements">Medical Word Elements</h3>
                        <p>The language of medicine is a specialized vocabulary used by health care practitioners.</p>
                        <p>Many current medical word elements originated as early as the 1st century B.C., when Hippocrates practiced medicine.</p>
                        <p>With advancements in medicine, new terms have evolved to reflect these innovations. For example, radiographic terms, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ultrasound (US), are now used to describe current diagnostic procedures.</p>
                        <p>A medical word consists of some or all of the following elements: word root, combining form, suffix, and prefix. How you combine these elements, and whether all or some of them are present in a medical term, determines the meaning of a word.</p>

                        <h3 id="word-roots">Word Roots</h3>
                        <p>A word root is the foundation of a medical term and contains its primary meaning. All medical terms have at least one word root. Most word roots are derived from Greek or Latin language. Thus, two different roots may have the same meaning. For example, the Greek word dermatos and the Latin word cutane both refer to the skin.</p>
                        <p>As a general rule, Greek roots are used to build words that describe a disease, condition, treatment, or diagnosis. Latin roots are used to build words that describe anatomical structures. Consequently, the Greek root dermatis used primarily in terms that describe a disease, condition, treatment, or diagnosis of the skin; the Latin root cutaneis used primarily to describe an anatomical structure.</p>

                        <p>A combining form is created when a word root is combined with a vowel. The vowel, known as a combining vowel, is usually an o, but sometimes it is an i.</p>
                        <p>The combining vowel has no meaning of its own, but enables two word elements to be connected. Like the word root, the combining form is the basic foundation to which other word elements are added to build a complete medical word.</p>
                        <p>In this text, a combining form will be listed as word root/vowel (such as gastr/o), as illustrated in Table 1-2.</p>

                        <h3 id="suffixes">Suffixes</h3>
                        <p>A suffix is a word element placed at the end of a word that changes the meaning of the word. In the terms tonsil /itis, and tonsil/ ectomy, the suffixes are -itis (inflammation) and -ectomy (excision, removal).</p>
                        <p>Changing the suffix changes the meaning of the word. In medical terminology, a suffix usually describes a pathology (disease or abnormality), symptom, surgical or diagnostic procedure, or part of speech. Many suffixes are derived from Greek or Latin words.</p>

                        <h3 id="prefixes">Prefixes</h3>
                        <p>A prefix is a word element attached to the beginning of a word or word root. However, not all medical terms have a prefix. Adding or changing a prefix changes the meaning of the word.</p>
                        <p>The prefix usually indicates a number, time, position, direction, or negation. Many of the same prefixes used in medical terminology are also used in the English language.</p>

                        <p>Here are three basic steps for defining medical words using gastroenteritis as an example.</p>
                        <ol class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Define the suffix, or last part of the word. In this case, the suffix -itis, this means inflammation.</li>
                            <li>Define the first part of the word (which may be a word root, combining form, or prefix). In this case, the combining form gastr/o means stomach.</li>
                            <li>Define the middle parts of the word. In this case, the word root enter means intestine.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>When you analyze gastroenteritis following the three previous rules, the meaning is:</p>
                        <ol class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Inflammation (of)</li>

                            <li>Intestine. Thus, the meaning of gastroenteritis is inflammation (of) stomach (and) intestine.</li>

                            <li><strong>Rule #1</strong> A word root links a suffix that begins with a vowel.</li>
                            <li><strong>Rule #2</strong> A combining form (root +o ) links a suffix that begins with a consonant.</li>
                            <li><strong>Rule #3</strong> A combining form links a root to another root to form a compound word. This rule holds true even if the next root begins with a vowel, as in osteoarthritis. Keep in mind that the rules for linking multiple roots to each other are slightly different from the rules for linking roots and combining forms to suffixes.</li>

                        <p>Although pronunciations of medical words usually follows the same rules that govern pronunciations of English words, some medical words may be difficult to pronounce when first encountered.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, selected terms in this book include phonetic pronunciation. Also, pronunciation guidelines can be found on the inside front cover of this book and at the end of selected tables. Use them whenever you need help with pronunciation of medical words.</p>
                        <p>Here are guidelines to help you pronounce medical terms as well as understand pronunciation marks used throughout this text and in most dictionaries.</p>

                        <h3 id="special-sounds">Special Sounds</h3>
                        <p>Here are rules regarding certain letter combinations and special sounds attributed to letters based on their placement in a medical word:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>For ae and oe, only the second vowel is pronounced. Examples are bursae, pleurae, and roentgen.</li>
                            <li>The soft sound of <strong>s</strong> and <strong>j</strong> are given to <strong>c</strong> and <strong>g</strong>, respectively, before <strong>e</strong>, <strong>i</strong>, and <strong>y</strong> in words of Greek or Latin origin. Examples are cerebrum, circumcision, cycle, gel, gingivitis, giant, and gyrate.</li>
                            <li>Before other letters, <strong>c</strong> and <strong>g</strong> have a hard sound. Examples are cardiac, cast, gastric, and gonad.</li>
                            <li>The letters ch are sometimes pronounced like <strong>k</strong>. Examples are cholesterol, cholera, and cholemia.</li>
                            <li>When pn appears at the beginning of a word, <strong>p</strong> is silent and only <strong>n</strong> is pronounced. Examples are pneumonia and pneumotoxin.</li>
                            <li>When pn appears in the middle of a word, <strong>p</strong> and <strong>n</strong> are pronounced. Examples are orthopnea and hyperpnea.</li>
                            <li>When ps appears at the beginning of a word, <strong>p</strong> is silent and only sis pronounced. Examples are psychology and psychosis.</li>
                            <li>When forming the final letter(s) of a word, <strong>e</strong> and es are commonly pronounced as separate syllables. Examples are syncope, systole, and nares.</li>
                            <li>When <strong>i</strong> appears at the end of a word (to form a plural), it is pronounced eye. Examples are bronchi, fungi, and nuclei.</li>
                            <li>All other vowels and consonants have normal English sounds.</li>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">FORMING PLURALS</h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Many medical words have special plural forms based on the ending of the word. Table 2-4 gives some general rules for the formation of plurals along with examples. The plural endings listed in column 2 are substituted for the word endings in column 1.</p>
                        
                        <h3 id="exceptions">Some Exceptions to the Rules</h3>
                        <p>There are exceptions to the rules above for forming plurals, some of which will appear in later chapters. For example, the plural of virus is viruses, and serums is sometimes used instead of sera. An -es ending may be added to words ending in -ex or - ix to form a plural, as in appendixes, apexes, and indexes.</p>
                        <p>Some people, in error, use phalange as the singular of phalanges. Words ending in -oma, meaning "tumor," should be changed to -omata, but most people just add an s to form the plural. For example, the plural of carcinoma (a type of cancer) should be carcinomata, but carcinomas is commonly used.</p>
