                    <h2 class="section-heading">Pathology</h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Although some digestive disorders may be without symptoms (asymptomatic), many are associated with such symptoms as nausea, vomiting, bleeding, pain, and weight loss. Clinical signs, such as jaundice and edema, may indicate a hepatic disorder. Severe infection, drug toxicity, hepatic disease, and changes in fluid and electrolyte balance can cause behavioral abnormalities. Disorders of the GI tract or any of the accessory organs (liver, gallbladder, pancreas) may result in far-reaching metabolic or systemic problems that can eventually threaten life itself. Assessment of a suspected digestive disorder includes a thorough history and physical examination. A range of diagnostic tests assist in identifying abnormalities of the GI tract, liver, gallbladder, and pancreas.</p>
                        <p>For diagnosis, treatment, and management of digestive disorders, the medical services of a specialist may be warranted. Gastroenterology is the branch of medicine concerned with digestive diseases. The physician who specializes in the diagnoses and treatment of digestive disorders is known as a gastroenterologist. Gastroenterologists do not perform surgeries; however, under the broad classification of surgery, they do perform such procedures as liver biopsy and endoscopic examination.</p>
                        
                        <h3 id="ulcer">Ulcer</h3>
                        <p>An ulcer is a circumscribed open sore, on the skin or mucous membranes within the body. Peptic ulcers are the most common type of ulcer that occurs in the digestive system. There are two main types of peptic ulcers: gastric ulcers, which develop in the stomach, and duodenal ulcers, which develop in the duodenum, usually in the area nearest the stomach. A third type of ulceration that affects the digestive system is associated with a disorder called colitis. As the name implies, it occurs in the colon.</p>

                        <h3 id="peptic-ulcer">Peptic Ulcer Disease</h3>
                        <p>Peptic ulcer disease (PUD) develops in the parts of the GI tract that are exposed to hydrochloric acid and pepsin, an enzyme secreted in the stomach that begins the digestion of proteins. Both of these products are found in gastric juice and normally act on food to begin the digestive process. The strong action of these digestive products can destroy the protective defenses of the mucous membranes of the stomach and duodenum, causing the lining to erode. However, current studies have identified the bacterium Helicobacter pylori as a leading cause of PUD. The spiral shape of this organism helps it to burrow into the mucosa, weakening it and making it more susceptible to the action of pepsin and stomach acid. Treatment includes antibiotics to destroy H. pylori and antacids to treat peptic ulcers. Patients are advised to avoid nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), caffeine, smoking, and alcohol, which intensify (exacerbate) the symptoms of gastric ulcers. If left untreated, mucosal destruction produces a whole (perforation) in the wall lining with resultant bleeding from the damaged area.</p>

                        <h3 id="ulcerative-colitis">Ulcerative Colitis</h3>
                        <p>Ulcerative colitis, a chronic inflammatory disease of the large intestine and rectum, commonly begins in the rectum or sigmoid colon and extends upward into the entire colon. It is characterized by profuse, watery diarrhea containing varying amounts of blood, mucus, and pus. Ulcerative colitis is distinguished from other closely related bowel disorders by its characteristic inflammatory pattern. The inflammation involves only the mucosal lining of the colon, and the affected portion of the colon is uniformly involved, with no patches of healthy mucosal tissue evident. Ulcerative colitis is associated with a higher risk of colon cancer. Severe cases may require surgical creation of an opening (stoma) for bowel evacuation to a bag worn on the abdomen.</p>

                        <h3 id="hernia">Hernia</h3>
                        <p>A hernia is a protrusion of any organ, tissue, or structure through the wall of the cavity in which it is naturally contained. In general, though, the term is applied to protrusions of abdominal organs (viscera) through the abdominal wall. An (1) inguinal hernia develops in the groin where the abdominal folds of flesh meet the thighs. In initial stages, it may be hardly noticeable and appears as a soft lump under the skin, no larger than a marble. In early stages, an inguinal hernia is usually reducible; that is, it can be pushed gently back into its normal place. With this type of hernia, pain may be minimal. As time passes, pressure of the abdomen against the weak abdominal wall may increase the size of the opening as well as the size of the hernia lump. If the blood supply to the hernia is cut off because of pressure, a (2) strangulated hernia may develop leading to diagnoses and treatment of digestive disorders necrosis with gangrene. An (3) umbilical hernia is a protrusion of part of the intestine at the navel. It occurs more commonly in obese women and among those who have had several pregnancies. Hernias also occur in newborn infants (congenital) or during early childhood. If the defect has not corrected itself by age 2, the deformity can be surgically corrected. Treatment consists of surgical repair of the hernia (hernioplasty) with suture of the abdominal wall (herniorrhaphy). Although hernias most commonly occur in the abdominal region, they may develop in the diaphragm. Two forms of this type include (4) diaphragmatic hernia, a congenital disorder, and (5) hiatal hernia, in which the lower part of the esophagus and the top of the stomach slides through an opening (hiatus) in the diaphragm into the thorax. With hiatal hernia, stomach acid backs up into the esophagus, causing heartburn, chest pain, and swallowing difficulty. Although many hiatal hernias are asymptomatic, if the disease continues for a prolonged period, it may cause gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).</p>

                        <h3 id="intestinal-obstruction">Intestinal Obstruction</h3>
                        <p>An intestinal obstruction is a partial or complete blockage in the small or large intestine that prevents forward flow of digestive products. Complete obstruction in any part of the intestine constitutes a medical emergency and requires rapid diagnosis and treatment within a 24 -hour period to prevent death. The two forms of intestinal obstructions include mechanical blockage, also called ileus, where contents of the intestine are prevented from moving forward due to an obstacle or barrier that blocks the lumen. The second form, non-mechanical blockage, also called paralytic ileus, where peristaltic movement is lacking or absent and contents are no longer propelled through the intestine. Mechanical obstructions include tumors, scar tissues (adhesions), intestinal twisting (volvolus), intestinal "telescoping" where part of the intestine slips into another part just beneath it (intussusceptions),strangulated hernias, or the presence of foreign bodies, such as fruit pits and gallstones. Non-mechanical blockages often result after abdominal surgeries or with spinal cord lesions where peristalsis or other neurogenic stimuli are affected. Other less common causes include thrombosis or embolism of mesenteric vessels and trauma or bacterial injury to the peritoneum. The primary medical treatment for an intestinal obstruction is insertion of an intestinal tube. If the intestinal tube is ineffective in relieving the obstruction, surgery is indicated.</p>

                        <h3 id="hemorrhoids">Hemorrhoids</h3>
                        <p>Enlarged veins in the mucous membrane of the anal canal are called hemorrhoids. Often they may bleed, hurt, or itch. They may occur inside (internal) or outside (external) the rectal area. Hemorrhoids are usually caused by abdominal pressure, such as from straining during bowel movement, pregnancy, and standing or sitting for long periods. They may also be associated with some disorders of the liver or the heart. A high-fiber diet as well as drinking plenty of water and juices plays a pivotal role in hemorrhoid prevention. Temporary relief from hemorrhoids can usually be obtained by cold compresses, sitz baths, stool softeners, or analgesic ointments. Treatment of an advanced hemorrhoidal condition involves surgical removal (hemorrhoidectomy).</p>

                        <h3 id="hepatitis">Hepatitis</h3>
                        <p>Hepatitis is an inflammatory condition of the liver. The usual causes include exposure to toxic substances, especially alcohol; obstructions in the bile ducts; metabolic diseases; autoimmune diseases; and bacterial or viral infections. A growing public health concern is the increasing incidence of viral hepatitis. Even though its mortality rate is low, the disease is easily transmitted and can cause significant morbidity and prolonged loss of time from school or employment. Although forms of hepatitis range from hepatitis A through hepatitis E, the three most common forms are: hepatitis A , also called infectious hepatitis; hepatitis B , also called serum hepatitis; and hepatitis C . The most common causes of hepatitis A are ingestion of contaminated food, water, or milk. Hepatitis B and hepatitis C are usually transmitted by routes other than the mouth (parenteral), such as from blood transfusions and sexual contact. Because of patient exposure, health-care personnel are at increased risk for contracting hepatitis B , but a vaccine that provides immunity to hepatitis B is available. There is no vaccine available for hepatitis C . Patients with hepatitis C may remain asymptomatic for years or the disease may produce only mild flulike symptoms. Treatment for hepatitis includes antiviral drugs; however, there is no cure. As the disease progresses, scarring of the liver becomes so serious that liver transplantation is the only recourse.</p>
                        <p>One of the major symptoms of many liver disorders, including hepatitis and cirrhosis, is a yellowing of the skin, mucous membranes, and sclerae of the eyes (jaundice, icterus). This occurs because the liver is no longer able to remove bilirubin, a yellow compound formed when erythrocytes are destroyed. Jaundice may also result when the bile duct is blocked, causing bile to enter the bloodstream.</p>

                        <h3 id="diverticulosis">Diverticulosis</h3>
                        <p>Diverticulosisis a condition in which small, blister like pockets (diverticula) develop in the inner lining of the large intestine and may balloon through the intestinal wall. These pockets occur most commonly in the sigmoid colon. They usually do not cause any problem unless they become inflamed (diverticulitis). Signs and symptoms of diverticulitis include pain, often in the left lower quadrant (LLQ) of the abdomen; extreme constipation (obstipation) or diarrhea; fever; abdominal swelling; and occasional blood in bowel movements. The usual treatment for diverticulitis consists of bed rest, antibiotics, and a soft diet. In severe cases, however, excision of the diverticulum (diverticulectomy) may be advised.</p>

                        <h3 id="oncology">Oncology</h3>
                        <p>Although stomach cancer is rare in United States, is common in many parts of the world where food preservation is problematic. It is an important medical problem because of its high mortality rate. Men are more susceptible to stomach cancer than women. The neoplasm nearly always develops from the epithelial or mucosal lining of the stomach in the form of a cancerous glandular tumor (gastric adenocarcinoma). Persistent indigestion is one of the important warning signs of stomach cancer. Other types of GI carcinomas include esophageal carcinomas, hepatocellular carcinomas, and pancreatic carcinomas.</p>
                        <p>Colorectal cancer arises from the epithelial lining of the large intestine. Signs and symptoms, which depend largely on the location of the malignancy, include changes in bowel habits, passage of blood and mucus in stools, rectal or abdominal pain, anemia, weight loss, obstruction, and perforation. An obstruction that develops suddenly may be the first symptom of cancer involving the colon between the cecum and the sigmoid. In this region, where bowel contents are liquid, a slowly developing obstruction will not become evident until the lumen is almost closed. Cancer of the sigmoid and rectum causes symptoms of partial obstruction with constipation alternating with diarrhea, lower abdominal cramping pain, and distention.</p>

                        <p>Various pharmaceutical agents are available to counteract abnormal conditions that occur in the GI tract. Antacids counteract or decrease excessive stomach acid, the cause of heartburn, gastric discomfort, and gastric reflux. Antidiarrheals and antiemetics are prescribed to preserve water and electrolytes, which are essential for body hydration and homeostasis. Medications that increase or decrease peristalsis are used to regulate the speed at which food passes through the GI tract. These drugs include agents that relieve "cramping"(antispasmodics)and those that help in the movement of material through a sluggish bowel (laxatives).</p>
