                    <h2 class="section-heading">Pathology</h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Many cardiac disorders, especially coronary artery disease, and valvular disorders are associated with a genetic predisposition. Thus, a complete history as well as a physical examination is essential in the diagnosis of cardiovascular disease. Although some of the most serious cardiovascular diseases have few signs and symptoms, when they occur they may include chest pain (angina), palpitations, breathing difficulties (dyspnea), cardiac irregularities (arrhythmias) and loss of consciousness (syncope). The location, duration, pattern of radiation, and severity of pain are important qualities in differentiating the various forms of cardiovascular disease and are sometimes characteristic of specific disorders. Because of the general nature of the signs and symptoms of cardiovascular disorders, invasive and noninvasive tests are usually required to confirm or rule out a suspected disease.</p>
                        <p>For diagnosis, treatment, and management of cardiovascular disorders, the medical services of a specialist may be warranted. Cardiology is the medical specialty concerned with disorders of the cardiovascular system. The physician who treats these disorders is called a cardiologist.</p>
                        
                        <h3 id="arteriosclerosis">Arteriosclerosis</h3>
                        <p>Arteriosclerosis is a hardening of arterial walls that causes them to become thickened and brittle. This hardening results from a build-up of a plaque-like substance composed of cholesterol, lipids, and cellular debris (atheroma).Over time, it builds up on the inside lining (tunica intima) of the arterial walls. Eventually, the plaque hardens (atherosclerosis), causing the vessel to lose elasticity. The lumen narrows as the plaque becomes larger. After a while, it becomes difficult for blood to pass through the blocked areas. Tissues distal to the occlusion become ischemic. In many instances, blood hemorrhages into the plaque and forms a clot (thrombus) that may dislodge. When a thrombus travels though the vascular system it is called an embolus (plural, emboli). Emboli in venous circulation may cause death. Emboli in arterial circulation commonly lodge in capillary bed and causes localized tissue death (infarct). Sometimes plaque weakens the vessel wall to such an extent that it forms a bulge (aneurysm) that may rupture. Arteriosclerosis usually affects large- or medium sized arteries, including the abdominal aorta; the coronary, cerebral, and renal arteries; and major arteries of the legs (femoral arteries). One of the major risk factors for developing arteriosclerosis is an elevated cholesterol level (hypercholesterolemia). Other major risk factors include age, family history, smoking, hypertension, and diabetes. Treatment for arthrosclerosis varies depending on the location and symptoms. In one method, occluding material and plaque are removed from the innermost layer of the artery (endarterectomy). In this procedure, the surgeon opens the site and removes the plaque, thereby resuming normal blood flow. Physicians commonly use endarterectomy to treat carotid artery disease, peripheral arterial disease, and diseases of the renal artery and aortic arch.</p>

                        <h3 id="coronary-artery-disease">Coronary Artery Disease</h3>
                        <p>In order for the heart to function effectively, it must receive an uninterrupted supply of blood. This blood is delivered to the heart muscle by way of the coronary arteries. Failure of the coronary arteries to deliver an adequate supply of blood to the myocardium is called coronary artery disease (CAD). Its major cause is the accumulation of plaque which causes the walls of the artery to harden (arteriosclerosis). With partial occlusion, localized areas of the heart experience oxygen deficiency (ischemia). When the occlusion is total or almost total, the affected area of the heart muscle dies (infarction). The clinical signs and symptoms of myocardial infarction (MI) typically include intense chest pain (angina), profuse sweating (diaphoresis), paleness (pallor), and labored breathing (dyspnea).Arrhythmia with an abnormally rapid heart rate (tachycardia) or an abnormally slow heart rate (bradycardia) may also accompany an MI.</p>
                        <p>As the heart muscle undergoes necrotic changes, it releases several highly specific cardiac enzymes, including troponin T, troponin I, and creatinine kinase (CK).The rapid elevation of these enzymes at predictable times following MI helps differentiate MI from pericarditis, abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), and acute pulmonary embolism. When angina cannot be controlled with medication, surgical intervention may be necessary. In percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA), a deflated balloon is passed through a small incision in the skin and into the diseased blood vessel. When the balloon inflates, it presses the occluding material against the lumen walls to force open the channel. After the procedure, the physician deflates and removes the balloon. Sometimes, the physician will place a hollow, thin mesh tube (stent) on the balloon and position it against the artery wall. It remains in place after the balloon catheter is removed and keeps the artery opened.</p>
                        <p>A more invasive procedure involves rerouting blood around the occluded area using a vein graft that bypasses the obstruction (coronary artery bypass graft [CABG]). One end of the graft vessel is sutured to the aorta and the other end is sutured to the coronary artery below the blocked area. This graft reestablishes blood flow to the heart muscle.</p>

                        <h3 id="endocarditis">Endocarditis</h3>
                        <p>Endocarditis is an inflammation of the inner lining of the heart and its valves. It may be non-infective in nature, caused by thrombi formation, or infective, caused by various microorganisms. Although the infecting organism can be viral or fungal, the usual culprit is a bacterium. Congenital valvular defects, scarlet fever, rheumatic fever, calcified bicuspid or aortic valves, mitral valve prolapse, and prosthetic valves are predisposing factors. Bacteria traveling in the bloodstream (bacteremia) may lodge in the weakened heart tissue and form small masses called vegetations composed of fibrin and platelets. Vegetations usually collect on the leaflets of the valves and their cords, causing a backflow of blood (regurgitation) or scarring. Vegetations may dislodge (embolize) and travel to the brain, lungs, kidneys, or spleen. Scaring of the valves may cause them to narrow (stenosis) or not close properly (insufficiency). Although medications may prove helpful, if heart failure develops as a result of damaged heart valves, surgery may be the only option. Whenever possible, the original valve is repaired. When the damage is extensive, a mechanical or bioprosthetic valve may be used. Patients who are susceptible to endocarditis are given antibiotic treatment to protect against infection prior to invasive procedures (prophylactic treatment).Because many bacteria normally found in the mouth are also responsible for endocarditis, prophylactic treatment is essential for tooth removal, root canal procedures, and even routine cleaning.</p>

                        <h3 id="varicose-veins">Varicose Veins</h3>
                        <p>Varicose veins are enlarged, twisted, superficial veins. They develop when the valves of the veins do not function properly (incompetent) and fail to prevent the backflow of blood.</p>
                        <p>Blood accumulates and the vein becomes engorged and distended. Excess fluid eventually seeps from the vein, causing swelling in surrounding tissues (edema). Varicose veins may develop in almost any part of the body, including the esophagus (varices) and rectum (hemorrhoids), but occur most commonly in the greater and lesser saphenous veins of the lower legs. Types of varicose veins include reticular veins, which appear as small blue veins seen through the skin, and "spider"veins (teleangiectases), which look like short, fine lines, starburst clusters, or web-like mazes. Varicose veins of the legs are not typically painful but may be unsightly in appearance. However, if open lesions or pain is present, treatment includes laser ablation, microphlebectomies, sclerotherapy, and occasionally, ligation and stripping for heavily damaged or diseased veins. The same methods are used as an elective procedure to improve the appearance of the legs. Treatment of mild cases of varicose veins includes use of elastic stockings and rest periods during which the legs are elevated.</p>

                        <h3 id="oncology">Oncology</h3>
                        <p>Although rare, the most common primary tumor of the heart is composed of mucous connective tissue (myxoma); however, these tumors tend to be benign. Although some myxomas originate in the endocardium of the heart chambers, most arise in the left atrium. Occasionally, they impede mitral valve function and cause a decrease in exercise tolerance, dyspnea, fluid in the lungs (pulmonary edema), and systemic problems, including joint pain (arthralgia), malaise, and anemia. These tumors are usually identified and located by two dimensional echocardiography. When present, they should be excised surgically. Most malignant tumors of the heart are the result of a malignancy originating in another area of the body (primary tumor) that has spread (metastasized) to the heart. The most common type originates in a darkly pigmented mole or tumor (malignant melanoma) of the skin. Other primary sites of malignancy that metastasize to the heart are bone marrow and lymphatic tissue. Treatment of the metastatic tumor of the heart involves treating the primary tumor.</p>
