                        <p><strong>Suffix Linking:</strong> In medical words, a suffix is added to the end of a word root or combining form to change its meaning. For example, the combining form gastr/o means stomach. The suffix -megaly means enlargement, and -it is means inflammation.</p>
                        <p>Gastr/o/megaly is an enlargement of the stomach; gastr/itis is an inflammation of the stomach. Whenever you change the suffix, you change the meaning of the word. Suffixes are also used to denote singular and plural forms of a word as well as a part of speech. The following tables provide additional examples to reinforce the rules you learned in Chapter 1.</p>
                        <p>This table provides examples of word roots used to link a suffix that begins with a vowel. It also lists combining forms (root + o) used to link a suffix that begins with a consonant</p>

                        <p>Words that contain more than one word root are known as compound words. Multiple word roots within a compound word are always changed to combining forms so that the roots are joined together with a combining vowel, regardless of whether the second word root begins with a vowel or a consonant.</p>
                        <p>Notice that a combining vowel is used in the Table 2-2 between gastr and enter, even though the second word root, enter, begins with a vowel. Keep in mind the rule for linking multiple roots is slightly different from the rules for linking word roots to suffixes. Recall from Chapter 1 that suffixes that begin with a vowel are linked with a word root; suffixes that begin with a consonant are linked with a combining form.</p>

                        <p>Grammatical suffixes are attached to word roots to form parts of speech, such as adjectives and nouns, or singular or plural forms of medical words. They are also used to denote a diminutive form, or smaller version, of a word-for example, tubule, which means a small tube. Many of these same suffixes are used in the English language. (See Table 2-5.)</p>

                        <p>Many medical words have Greek or Latin origins and follow the rules of these languages in building singular and plural forms. Once you learn these rules, you will find that they are easy to apply. You will also find that some English endings have also been adopted for commonly used medical terms. When a word changes from a singular to a plural form, the suffix of the word is the part that changes.</p>
