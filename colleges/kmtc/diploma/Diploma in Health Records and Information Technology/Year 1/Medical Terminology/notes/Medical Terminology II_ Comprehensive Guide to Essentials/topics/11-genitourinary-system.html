                <section id="pathology" class="content-section">
                    <h2 class="section-heading">Pathology</h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Pathology of the urinary system includes a range of disorders from those that are asymptomatic to those that manifest an array of signs and symptoms. Causes for these disorders include congenital anomalies, infectious diseases, trauma, or conditions that secondarily involve the urinary structures. Many times, asymptomatic urinary diseases are first diagnosed when a routine urinalysis shows abnormalities. Forms of glomerulonephritis and chronic urinary tract infection are two such disorders. Symptoms specific to urinary disorders include changes in urination pattern, output, or dysuria. Endoscopic tests, radiological evaluations, and laboratory tests that evaluate renal function are typically employed to diagnose disorders of the urinary system.</p>
                        <p>Signs and symptoms of male reproductive disorders include pain, swelling, erectile dysfunction, and loss of normal sexual drive (libido). Characteristics of infectious diseases, especially those transmitted through sexual activity, commonly include pain, discharge, or lesions as well as a vague feeling of fullness or discomfort in the perineal or rectal area. A complete evaluation of the genitalia, reproductive history, and past and present genitourinary infections and disorders is necessary to identify disorders associated with male reproductive structures.</p>
                        <p>For diagnosis, treatment, and management of genitourinary disorders, the medical services of a specialist may be warranted. Urology is the branch of medicine concerned with male and female urinary disorders and diseases of the male reproductive system. The physician who specializes in diagnoses and treatment of genitourinary disorders is known as a urologist. However, the branch of medicine concerned specifically with diseases of the kidney, electrolyte imbalance, renal transplantation, and dialysis therapy is known as nephrology. Physicians who practice in this specialty are called nephrologists.</p>

                        <h3 id="pyelonephritis">Pyelonephritis</h3>
                        <p>One of the most common forms of kidney disease is pyelonephritis, (also called kidney infection or complicated urinary tract infection).In this disorder, bacteria invade the renal pelvis and kidney tissue, commonly as a result of a bladder infection that has ascended to the kidney via the ureters. When the infection is severe, lesions form in the renal pelvis, causing bleeding. The microscopic examination of urine shows large quantities of bacteria (bacteriuria), white blood cells (pyuria), and, when lesions are present, red blood cells (hematuria). The onset of the disease is usually acute, with symptoms including pain around the kidney, dysuria, fatigue, urinary urgency and frequency, chills, fever, nausea, and vomiting. Treatment with antibiotics is usually successful. However, in some cases, organisms may have developed a resistance and alternative antibiotics may be required.</p>

                        <h3 id="glomerulonephritis">Glomerulonephritis</h3>
                        <p>Any condition that causes the glomerular walls to become inflamed is referred to as glomerulonephritis. One of the most common causes of glomerular inflammation is a reaction to the toxins given off by pathogenic bacteria, especially streptococci that have recently infected another part of the body, usually the throat. Glomerulonephritis is also associated with diabetes and autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus, polyarthritis, and scleroderma.</p>
                        <p>When the glomerular membrane is inflamed, it becomes "leaky" (permeable). Red blood cells and protein pass through the glomerulus and enter the tubule. In some cases, protein solidifies in the nephron tubules and forms solid masses that take the shape of the tubules in which they develop. These masses are called casts. They commonly pass out of the kidney by way of the urine and may be visible when urine is examined microscopically. The clinical picture for glomerulonephritis includes blood and protein in the urine (hematuria and proteinuria) and red cell casts, along with high blood pressure (hypertension (HTN), edema, and impaired renal function. Most patients with acute glomerulonephritis associated with a streptococcal infection recover with no lasting kidney damage.</p>

                        <h3 id="nephrolithiasis">Nephrolithiasis</h3>
                        <p>Stones (calculi) may form in any part of the urinary tract (urolithiasis), but most arise in the kidney, a condition called nephrolithiasis. They commonly form when dissolved urine salts begin to solidify. These stones may increase in size and obstruct urinary structures. If they lodge in the ureters, they cause intense throbbing pain called colic. Because urine is hindered from passing into the bladder, it flows backward (refluxes) into the renal pelvis and the tubules, causing them to dilate. In one method of treatment called extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL), calculi are pulverized using concentrated ultrasound waves, called shock waves, directed at the stones from a machine outside the body. For excessively large stones or patients who have contraindications for ESWL, an alternative treatment is percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL). In this procedure, a small incision is made in the skin, and an opening is formed in the kidney. A nephroscope is inserted into the kidney to locate and remove the stone. If the stone is large, an ultrasonic or electrohydraulic probe is used to break the stone into smaller fragments, which are then more easily removed. A nephrostomy tube may be inserted and remain in place during healing. For stones that have descended into the ureters, it may be possible to remove them using a specialized ureteroscope fitted with a small basket. The ureteroscope is passed through the urethra and bladder and into the ureter where the basket collects the stone. For larger stones, it may be necessary to break them into smaller pieces using an endoscope fitted with a laser beam before the fragments are removed. This procedure is called ureteroscopic stone removal, and no incision is required.</p>

                        <h3 id="bph">Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia</h3>
                        <p>Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), also called nodular hyperplasia or benign prostatic hypertrophy, is commonly associated with the aging process. As the prostate gland enlarges, it decreases the urethral lumen, and complete voiding of urine becomes difficult. Urine that remains in the bladder commonly becomes a breeding ground for bacteria .Bladder infection (cystitis) and, ultimately, kidney infection (nephritis) may result. If medical management of BPH fails, it may be necessary to employ surgical methods. Surgical removal of the entire prostate may be done through the perineum (perineal prostatectomy)or an abdominal opening above the pubis and directly over the bladder (suprapubic prostatectomy). These procedures are invasive and are performed when the entire prostate must be removed, such as when cancer is identified. These methods also enable the removal of lymph nodes for examination. When only a portion of the prostate must be removed, the less invasive transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) is usually performed. In TURP, a resectoscope is inserted through the urethra, and a small loop "chips away" some of the obstructing tissue. At the conclusion of the surgery, the urethra and bladder are irrigated to remove the small chips.</p>

                        <h3 id="cryptorchidism">Cryptorchidism</h3>
                        <p>Failure of the testes to descend into the scrotal sac prior to birth is called cryptorchidism. In many infants born with this condition, the testes descend spontaneously by the end of the first year. If this does not occur, correction of the disorder involves surgical suspension of the testes (orchiopexy) in the scrotum. This procedure is usually done before the child reaches age 2. Because an inguinal hernia commonly accompanies cryptorchidism, the hernia may be sutured (herniorrhaphy) at the same time.</p>

                        <h3 id="atn">Acute Tubular Necrosis</h3>
                        <p>In acute tubular necrosis (ATN), the tubular portion of the nephron is injured by a decrease in blood supply (ischemic ATN) or after the ingestion of toxic chemicals (nephrotoxic ATN). Ischemia may occur because of circulatory collapse, severe hypotension, hemorrhage, dehydration, or other disorders that affect blood supply. ATN does not produce specific signs and symptoms, and diagnosis relies on a positive history of risk factors. General signs and symptoms of ATN include scanty urine production (oliguria) fluid retention, mental apathy, nausea, vomiting, and increased blood levels of calcium (hypercalcemia). When tubular damage is not severe, the disorder is usually reversible.</p>

                        <h3 id="oncology">Oncology</h3>
                        <p>The most common form of cancer in men is carcinoma of the prostate. In the United States, the disease is rarely found in men younger than age 50 ; however, the incidence dramatically increases with age. Symptoms include difficulty starting urination (hesitancy) and stopping the urinary stream, dysuria, urinary frequency, and hematuria. By the time these symptoms develop and the patient seeks treatment, the disease is quite advanced and long-term survival is not likely. Early presymptomatic tests include a blood test for prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and periodic digital rectal examination (DRE).</p>
                        <p>Like other forms of cancer, prostatic carcinomas are staged and graded to determine metastatic potential, response to treatment, chances of survival, and appropriate forms of therapy. Surgery and radiation therapy are usual treatment modalities, but other forms of treatment may also be employed. Surgical treatment includes the removal of the entire prostate (radical prostatectomy).</p>
                        <p>Two forms of radiation oncology include brachytherapy and external beam radiation. In brachytherapy (also called internal radiation therapy), radioactive "seeds" are placed directly in the malignant tissue. They remain in place for long or short periods of time depending on the type of malignancy, its location, and other diagnostic criteria. In external beam radiation (EBR), high energy x-ray beams are generated by a machine and directed at the tumor from outside the body to destroy prostate tissue.</p>
                        <p>Another treatment modality is the application of extreme cold (cryosurgery), which results in the destruction of prostate tissue. Administering antiandrogenic agents as well as hormones that deplete the body of testicular hormones (combined hormonal therapy) has been effective in treatment at the early stages of the disease. Because prostatic cancer is stimulated by testosterone, surgical removal of the testes (bilateral orchiectomy) may be necessary.</p>

                        <p>Pharmacological agents used to treat urinary tract disorders include antibiotics, diuretics, antidiuretics, urinary antispasmodics, and potassium supplements, which are commonly taken concurrently with many diuretics to counteract potassium depletion. Pharmacologic agents are used to treat conditions of the male reproductive system including hypogonadism, erectile disfunction, and reproductive concerns and disorders.</p>
