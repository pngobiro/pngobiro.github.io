                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>All body cells require oxygen and nutrients for survival. They also need a stable internal environment that provides a narrow range of temperature, water, acidity, and salt concentration. This stable internal environment is called homeostasis. When homeostasis is disrupted and cells, tissues, organs, or systems are unable to function effectively, the condition is called disease.</p>
                        <p>From a clinical point of view, disease is a pathological or morbid condition that presents a group of signs, symptoms, and clinical findings. Signs are objective indicators that are observable. A palpable mass and tissue redness are examples of signs. A symptom is subjective and is experienced only by the patient. Dizziness, pain, and malaise are examples of symptoms. Clinical findings are the results of radiologic, laboratory, and other medical procedures performed on the patient or his specimens.</p>
                        <p>Etiology is the study of the cause or origin of a disease or disorder. Some possible causes of diseases include:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>metabolic (such as diabetes)</li>
                            <li>infectious (such as measles and mumps)</li>
                            <li>congenital (such as cleft lip)</li>
                            <li>hereditary (such as hemophilia)</li>
                            <li>environmental (such as burns and trauma)</li>
                            <li>neoplastic (such as cancer)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Establishing the cause and nature of a disease is called diagnosis (Dx). Determining a diagnosis helps in the selection of a treatment. A prognosis is the prediction of the course of a disease and its probable outcome. Any disease whose cause is unknown is said to be idiopathic. A variety of diagnostic procedures are used to identify diseases and determine their extent or involvement.</p>
                        <p>Diagnostic tests can be simple, such as listening to chest sounds with a stethoscope, or complex, such as a biopsy. Many of the diagnostic tests listed in this text can be categorized as surgical, clinical, endoscopic, laboratory, and radiological. Some tests include more than one testing modality.</p>

MRI is used to diagnose a growing number of diseases because it provides superior soft tissue contrast, allows multiple plane views, and avoids the hazards of ionizing radiation. MRI commonly proves superior to CT scan for most central nervous system images, particularly those of the brainstem and spinal cord as well as the musculoskeletal and pelvic areas.

A nuclear scan is the reverse of a conventional radiograph. Rather than being directed into the body, radiation comes from inside the body and is then detected by a specialized camera to produce an image.</td></tr>

SPECT differs from a PET scan in that the tracer remains in the blood stream rather than being absorbed by surrounding tissue. It is especially useful to visualize blood flow through arteries and veins in the brain.</td></tr>
                                    <tr><td>tomography tom/o: to cut -graphy: process of recording</td><td>Radiographic technique that produces an image representing a detailed cross-section, or slice, of an area, tissue, or organ at a predetermined depth.

US, unlike most other imaging methods, create real-time moving images to view organs and functions of organs in motion. A computer analyzes the reflected echoes and converts them into an image on a video monitor. Because this procedure does not use ionizing radiation (x-ray), it is used for visualizing fetuses as well as the neck, abdomen, pelvis, brain, and heart.</td></tr>
