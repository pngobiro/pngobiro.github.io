                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Damage to the brain and spinal cord invariably causes signs and symptoms in other parts of the body. Common signs and symptoms for many neurological disorders include headache, insomnia, back or neck pain, weakness, and involuntary movement (dyskinesia). Careful observation of the patient during the history and physical examination may provide valuable clues about mental status and cognitive and motor ability. Muscle strength, coordination, gait, balance, and reflexes provide additional diagnostic clues. Lumbar puncture provides a sample of CSF for analysis and helps identify various types of meningitis and encephalitis. Radiology- especially computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans-provide detailed images that can locate cerebrovascular irregularities, lesions, and tumors.</p>

                        <h3 id="radiculopathy">Radiculopathy</h3>
                        <p>Radiculopathy, also called radiculitis, is an inflammation of the nerve root associated with the spinal column. Spinal nerves exit the spinal column at each level along the length of the spine. When pressure is applied to the nerve root (compression), the patient experiences tingling, numbness, weakness, or a radiating pain starting in the spine and moving outward. Pressure can be the result of a herniated disc, degenerative changes, arthritis, fractures, bone spurs, or tumors. The area's most commonly affected are the neck (cervical radiculopathy)and the lower back (lumbar radiculopathy, sciatica). The offending nerve root is commonly identified during the history and physical examination by evaluating the area of the skin known to be served by a specific nerve. MRIs and CT scans help to localize the site and nature of compression. Rest and anti-inflammatory medications are usually recommended. However, for disabling pain that lasts for several months or is accompanied by loss of bowel or bladder control, surgery to remove the cause of the pressure (decompression surgery) may be the only option.</p>

                        <h3 id="cerebrovascular-disease">Cerebrovascular Disease</h3>
                        <p>Cerebrovascular disease refers to any functional abnormality of the cerebrum caused by disorders of the blood vessels of the brain. It is most commonly associated with a stroke, also called cerebrovascular accident (CVA). The three major types of strokes are ischemic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, and subarachnoid hemorrhage. The most common type, which accounts for about 80% of all strokes, is ischemic stroke. Ischemic stroke is caused by a narrowing of the arteries of the brain or the arteries of the neck (carotid), generally due to atherosclerosis. This narrowing causes insufficient oxygen delivery to the brain tissue and, within a few minutes, the tissue begins to die. Occasionally, pieces of plaque break loose and travel to the narrower vessels of the brain, causing occlusion, also resulting in ischemia. An intracerebral hemorrhage is caused by the sudden rupture of an artery within the brain. After the rupture, released blood compresses brain structures and destroys them. In a subarachnoid hemorrhage, blood is released into the space surrounding the brain. This condition is commonly caused by a ruptured aneurysm and is usually fatal.</p>
                        <p>Signs and symptoms of stroke include weakness in one half of the body (hemiparesis),paralysis in one half of the body (hemiplegia), inability to speak (aphasia),lack of muscle coordination (ataxia),stupor, loss of consciousness (LOC), coma, or even death. If the CVA is mild, the patient may experience a brief "blackout," blurred vision, or dizziness and may be unaware of the "minor stroke." Stroke symptoms that resolve within 24 hours are known as a transient ischemic attack (TIA).About one third of all strokes are preceded by a TIA. A family history of cerebrovascular disease and high blood pressure appears to be a contributing factor to stroke. Computed tomography (CT) is usually performed to determine the type of stroke. "Clot buster" (thrombolytic) medication is usually administered within 3 hours of symptom onset when ischemic stroke is diagnosed. Antihypertensives may also be administered to control blood pressure. Treatment involves speech, physical, and occupational therapy and various medications, depending on the type of stroke.</p>

                        <h3 id="seizure-disorders">Seizure Disorders</h3>
                        <p>Seizure disorders include any medical condition characterized by sudden changes in behavior or consciousness as a result of uncontrolled electrical activity in the brain. However, chronic or recurring seizure disorders are called epilepsies. Causes of epilepsy include brain injury, congenital anomalies, metabolic disorders, brain tumors, vascular disturbances, and genetic disorders.</p>
                        <p>Seizures are characterized by sudden bursts of abnormal electrical activity in neurons, resulting in temporary changes in brain function. Two major types of seizures are partial and generalized.</p>
                        <p>In partial seizures, only a portion of the brain is involved. There is a short alteration of consciousness of about 10 to 30 seconds with repetitive, unusual movements and confusion. In a generalized seizure, the entire brain is involved. The most common type of generalized seizure is the tonic-clonic seizure; also called grand mal seizure. In the tonic phase of a tonic-clonic seizure, the entire body becomes rigid; in the clonic phase there is uncontrolled jerking. Recovery may take minutes to hours and usually leaves the patient weak. In status epilepticus, tonic-clonic seizures follow one after another without an intervening period of recovery. It is a life-threatening emergency that involves the whole cortex and emergency medical attention is essential. Diagnosis and evaluation commonly rely on electroencephalography and magnetoencephalography to locate the affected area of the brain. Epilepsy can usually be controlled by antiepileptic medications.</p>

                        <h3 id="parkinson-disease">Parkinson Disease</h3>
                        <p>Parkinson disease, also called shaking palsy, is a progressive neurological disorder affecting the portion of the brain responsible for controlling movement. As neurons degenerate, the patient develops uncontrollable nodding of the head, decreased speed of movement (bradykinesia, hypokinesia), tremors, large joint stiffness, and a shuffling gait. Muscle rigidity causes facial expressions to appear fixed and masklike with unblinking eyes. Sometimes the patient exhibits "pill rolling," in which he or she inadvertently rubs the thumb against the index finger.</p>
                        <p>In patients with Parkinson disease, dopamine (a neurotransmitter that facilitates the transmission of impulses at synapses) is lacking in the brain. Management involves the administration of L-dopa, which can cross the blood-brain barrier. L-dopa is converted in the brain to dopamine. Even so, this treatment only reduces symptoms; it is not a cure for Parkinson disease.</p>

                        <h3 id="multiple-sclerosis">Multiple Sclerosis</h3>
                        <p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a progressive, degenerative disease of the central nervous system. MS is characterized by inflammation, hardening and, finally, loss of myelin (demyelination) throughout the spinal cord and brain. As myelin deteriorates, the transmission of electrical impulses from one neuron to another is impeded. In effect, the conduction pathway develops "short circuits."</p>
                        <p>Signs and symptoms of MS include tremors, muscle weakness, and bradykinesia. Occasionally, visual disturbances exist. During remissions, symptoms temporarily disappear, but progressive hardening of myelin areas leads to other attacks. Ultimately, most voluntary motor control is lost and the patient becomes bedridden. Death occurs anywhere from 7 to 30 years after the onset of the disease. Young adults, usually women, between ages 20 and 40 are the most common victims of MS. The etiology of the disease is unclear, but autoimmune disease or a slow viral infection is believed to be the most probable cause.</p>

                        <h3 id="alzheimer-disease">Alzheimer Disease</h3>
                        <p>Alzheimer disease (AD) is a progressive neurological disorder that causes memory loss and serious mental deterioration. Small lesions called plaques develop in the cerebral cortex and disrupt the passage of electrochemical signals between cells. The clinical manifestations of Alzheimer disease include memory loss and cognitive decline. There is also a decline in social skills and ability to carry out activities of daily living. Most patients undergo personality, emotional, and behavioral changes. As the disease progresses, loss of concentration and increased fatigue, restlessness, and anxiety are common. Alzheimer disease was once considered rare but is now identified as a leading cause of senile dementia. Although there is no specific treatment, moderate relief has been associated with medications that prevent a breakdown of brain chemicals required for neurotransmission.</p>

                        <h3 id="mental-illness">Mental Illness</h3>
                        <p>Mental illness includes an array of psychological disorders, syndromes, and behavioral patterns that cause alterations in mood, behavior, and thinking. Its forms range from mild to serious. For example, anxiety may manifest as a slight apprehension or uneasiness lasting a few days to a more severe form involving intense fears lasting for months and even years.</p>
                        <p>Psychosis refers to a serious mental disorder commonly characterized by false beliefs despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary (delusions). The psychotic patient typically "hears voices" and "sees visions" in the absence of an actual stimulus (hallucinations). The patient's speech is usually incoherent and disorganized and behavior is erratic. Neurosis is a mental disorder caused by an emotion experienced in the past that overwhelmingly interferes or affects a present emotion. For example, a child bitten by a dog may show irrational fear of animals as an adult. Many mental disorders are forms of neuroses, including irrational fears (phobias), exaggerated emotional and reflexive behaviors (hysterias), or irrational, uncontrolled performance of ritualistic actions for fear of a dire consequence (obsessive compulsive disorders).</p>
                        <p>Research and education have removed much of the stigma attached to mental illness. Today, mental illness is becoming a more recognizable and treatable disorder. Many psychological disorders can be effectively treated or managed by family physicians, school psychologists, marriage counselors, family counselors, and even support groups such as grief support groups and Alcoholics Anonymous.</p>
                        <p>Diagnosis and treatment of serious mental disorders usually require the skills of a medical specialist called a psychiatrist. In the capacity of a physician, the psychiatrist is licensed to prescribe medications and perform medical procedures not available to those who do not hold a medical license. Psychiatrists commonly work in association with clinical psychologists, who are individuals trained in evaluating human behavior, intelligence, and personality.</p>

                        <p>Intracranial tumors that originate directly in brain tissue are called primary intracranial tumors. They are commonly classified according to histological type and include those that originate in neurons and those that develop in glial tissue. Signs and symptoms of intracranial tumors include headaches, especially upon arising in the morning, during coughing episodes, and upon bending or sudden movement. Occasionally, the optic disc in the back of the eyeball swells (papilledema) because of increased intracranial pressure. Personality changes are common and include depression, anxiety, and irritability.</p>
                        <p>Intracranial tumors can arise from any structure within the cranial cavity, including the pituitary and pineal glands, cranial nerves, and the arachnoid and pia mater (leptomeninges). In addition, all of these tissues may be the sites of metastatic spread from primary malignancies that occur outside of the nervous system. Metastatic tumors of the cranial cavity tend to exhibit growth characteristics similar to those of the primary malignancy but tend to grow more slowly than the parent tumor. Metastatic tumors of the cranial cavity are usually easier to remove than primary intracranial tumors.</p>
                        <p>Computed tomography (CT) scans and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) help establish a diagnosis but are not definitive. Surgical removal relieves pressure and confirms or rules out malignancy. Even after surgery, most intracranial tumors require radiation therapy as a second line of treatment. Chemotherapy combined with radiation therapy usually provides the best chance for survival and quality of life.</p>

                        <p>Neurological agents are used to relieve or eliminate pain, suppress seizures, control tremors, and reduce muscle rigidity. Hypnotics, a class of drugs used as sedatives, depress CNS function to relieve agitation and induce sleep. Anesthetics are capable of producing a complete or partial loss of feeling and are used for surgery. Psychotherapeutic agents alter brain chemistry to treat mental illness. These drugs are used as mood stabilizers in various mental disorders. They also reduce symptoms of depression and treat ADHD and narcolepsy.</p>
