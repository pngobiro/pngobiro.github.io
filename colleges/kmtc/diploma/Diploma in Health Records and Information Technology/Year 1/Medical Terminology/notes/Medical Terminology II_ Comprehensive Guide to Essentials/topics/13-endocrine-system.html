                <section id="pathology" class="content-section">
                    <h2 class="section-heading">Pathology</h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Disorders of the endocrine system are caused by underproduction (hyposecretion) or overproduction (hypersecretion) of hormones. In general, hyposecretion is treated with drug therapy in the form of hormone replacement. Hypersecretion is generally treated by surgery. Most hormone deficiencies result from genetic defects in the glands, surgical removal of the glands, or production of poorquality hormones.</p>

                        <h3 id="pituitary">Pituitary Disorders</h3>
                        <p>Pituitary disorders are related to hypersecretion or hyposecretion of growth hormone, which leads to body-size abnormalities. Abnormal variations of ADH secretion lead to disorders in the composition of blood and marked electrolyte imbalance.</p>

                        <h3 id="thyroid">Thyroid Disorders</h3>
                        <p>Thyroid gland disorders are common and may develop at any time during life. They may be the result of a developmental problem, injury, disease, or dietary deficiency. One form of hypothyroidism that develops in infants is called cretinism. If not treated, this disorder leads to mental retardation, impaired growth, low body temperatures, and abnormal bone formation. Usually these symptoms do not appear at birth because the infant has received thyroid hormones from the mother's blood during fetal development. When hypothyroidism deyelops during adulthood, it is known as myxedema. The characteristics of this disease are edema, low blood levels of T3 and T4, weight gain, cold intolerance, fatigue, depression, muscle or joint pain, and sluggishness.</p>
                        <p>Hyperthyroidism results from excessive secretions of T3, T 4, or both. Two of the most common disorders of hyperthyroidism are Graves' disease and toxic goiter. Graves' disease is considerably more prevalent and is characterized by an elevated metabolic rate, abnormal weight loss, excessive perspiration, muscle weakness, and emotional instability. Also, the eyes are likely to protrude (exophthalmos) because of edematous swelling in the tissues behind them. At the same time, the thyroid gland is likely to enlarge, producing goiter.</p>
                        <p>It is believed that toxic goiter may occur because of excessive release of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) from the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland. Overstimulation by TSH causes thyroid cells to enlarge and secrete extra amounts of hormones. Treatment for hyperthyroidism may involve drug therapy to block the production of thyroid hormones or surgical removal of all or part of the thyroid gland. Another method for treating this disorder is to administer a sufficient amount of radioactive iodine to destroy the thyroid secretory cells.</p>

                        <h3 id="parathyroid">Parathyroid Disorders</h3>
                        <p>As with the thyroid gland, dysfunction of the parathyroids is usually characterized by inadequate or excessive hormone secretion.</p>
                        <p>Insufficient production of parathyroid hormone (PTH), called hypoparathyroidism, can be caused by primary parathyroid dysfunction or elevated blood calcium levels. This condition can result from an injury or from surgical removal of the glands; sometimes in conjunction with thyroid surgery. The primary effect of hypoparathyroidism is a decreased blood calcium level (hypocalcemia). Decreased calcium lowers the electrical threshold, causing neurons to depolarize more easily, and increases the number of nerve impulses, resulting in muscle twitches and spasms (tetany).</p>
                        <p>Excessive production of PTH, called hyperparathyroidism, is commonly caused by a benign tumor. The increase in PTH secretion leads to demineralization of bones (osteitis fibrosa cystica), making them porous (osteoporosis) and highly susceptible to fracture and deformity. When this condition is the result of a benign glandular tumor (adenoma) of the parathyroid, the tumor is removed. Treatment may also include orthopedic surgery to correct severe bone deformities. Excess PTH also causes calcium to be deposited in the kidneys. When the disease is generalized and all bones are affected, this disorder is known as von Recklinghausen disease. Renal symptoms and kidney stones (nephrolithiasis) may also develop.</p>

                        <h3 id="adrenal">Disorders of the Adrenal Glands</h3>
                        <p>As discussed, the adrenal glands consist of the adrenal cortex and adrenal medulla. Each has its own structure and function as well as its own set of associated disorders.</p>

                        <h4 id="adrenal-cortex">Adrenal Cortex</h4>
                        <p>The adrenal cortex is mainly associated with Addison disease and Cushing syndrome.</p>

                        <h4 id="addison-disease">Addison disease</h4>
                        <p>Addison disease, a relatively uncommon chronic disorder caused by a deficiency of cortical hormones, results when the adrenal cortex is damaged or atrophied. Atrophy of the adrenal glands is probably the result of an autoimmune process in which circulating adrenal antibodies slowly destroy the gland. The gland usually suffers 90% destruction before clinical signs of adrenal insufficiency appear. Hypofunction of the adrenal cortex interferes with the body's ability to handle internal and external stress. In severe cases, the disturbance of sodium and potassium metabolism may be marked by depletion of sodium and water through urination, resulting in severe chronic dehydration. Other clinical manifestations include muscle weakness, anorexia, gastrointestinal symptoms, fatigue, hypoglycemia, hypotension, low blood sodium (hyponatremia), and high serum potassium (hyperkalemia). If treatment for this condition begins early, usually with adrenocortical hormone therapy, the prognosis is excellent. If untreated, the disease will continue a chronic course with progressive but relatively slow deterioration. In some patients, the deterioration may be rapid.</p>

                        <h4 id="cushing-syndrome">Cushing syndrome</h4>
                        <p>Cushing syndrome is a cluster of symptoms produced by excessive amounts of cortisol, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), or both circulating in the blood. Causes of this excess secretion include:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Long-term administration of steroid drugs (glucocorticoids) in treating such diseases as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus erythematosus, and asthma.</li>
                            <li>Adrenal tumor resulting in excessive production of cortisol.</li>
                            <li>Cushing disease, a pituitary disorder caused by hypersecretion of ACTH from an adenoma in the anterior pituitary gland.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Regardless of the cause, Cushing syndrome alters carbohydrate and protein metabolism and electrolyte balance. Overproduction of mineralocorticoids and glucocorticoids causes blood glucose concentration to remain high, depleting tissue protein. In addition, sodium retention causes increased fluid in tissue that leads to edema. These metabolic changes produce weight gain and may cause structural changes, such as a moon-shaped face, grossly exaggerated head and trunk, and pencil-thin arms and legs. Other symptoms include fatigue, high blood pressure, and excessive hair growth in unusual places (hirsutism), especially in women. The treatment goal for this disease is to restore serum cortisol to normal levels. Nevertheless, treatment varies with the cause and may necessitate radiation, drug therapy, surgery, or a combination of these methods.</p>

                        <h4 id="adrenal-medulla">Adrenal Medulla</h4>
                        <p>No specific diseases can be traced directly to a deficiency of hormones from the adrenal medulla. However, medullary tumors sometimes cause excess secretions. The most common disorder is a neoplasm known as pheochromocytoma, which produces excessive amounts of epinephrine and norepinephrine. Most of these tumors are encapsulated and benign. These hypersecretions produce high blood pressure, rapid heart rate, stress, fear, palpitations, headaches, visual blurring, muscle spasms, and sweating. Typical treatment consists of antihypertensive drugs and surgery.</p>

                        <h3 id="pancreatic">Pancreatic Disorders</h3>
                        <p>Diabetes is a general term that, when used alone, refers to diabetes mellitus (DM).It is by far the most common pancreatic disorder.DM is a chronic metabolic disorder of impaired carbohydrate, protein, and fat metabolism due to insufficient production of insulin or the body's inability to utilize insulin properly. When body cells are deprived of glucose, their principal energy fuel, they begin to metabolize proteins and fats. As fat is metabolized, ketones are produced and enter the blood, causing a condition called ketosis. Hyperglycemia and ketosis are responsible for the host of troubling and commonly life-threatening symptoms of diabetes mellitus. Insulin is an essential hormone that prepares body cells to absorb and use glucose as an energy source. When insulin is lacking, sugar does not enter cells but returns to the bloodstream with a subsequent rise in its concentration in the blood (hyperglycemia). When blood glucose levels reach a certain concentration, sugar "spills" into the urine and is expelled from the body (glucosuria), along with electrolytes, particularly sodium. Sodium and potassium losses result in muscle weakness and fatigue. Because glucose is unavailable to cells, cellular starvation results and leads to hunger and an increased appetite (polyphagia.)</p>
                        <p>Although genetics and environmental factors, such as obesity and lack of exercise, seem significant in the development of this disease, the cause of diabetes is not always clear.</p>
                        <p>Diabetes mellitus occurs in two primary forms:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li><strong>Type 1 diabetes</strong> is usually diagnosed in children and young adults and was previously called juvenile diabetes. In type 1 diabetes, the body does not produce sufficient insulin. Treatment includes injection of insulin to maintain a normal level of glucose in the blood.</li>
                            <li><strong>Type 2 diabetes</strong> is the most common form and is distinctively different from type 1.Its onset was typically later in life but it has become more prevalent in children as the incidence of obesity has increased. Risk factors include a family history of diabetes and obesity. In type 2diabetes,the body is deficient in producing sufficient insulin or the body's cells are resistant to insulin action in target tissues. Hyperglycemia that results may cause cell starvation and, over time, may damage the kidneys, eyes, nerves, or heart. Treatment for type 2 diabetes includes exercise, diet, weight loss, and if needed, insulin or oral antidiabetic agents. Oral antidiabetic agents activate the release of pancreatic insulin and improve the body's sensitivity to insulin.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4 id="complications">Complications</h4>
                        <p>Diabetes is associated with a number of primary and secondary complications. Patients with type 1 diabetes usually report rapidly developing symptoms. With type 2 diabetes, the patient's symptoms are usually vague, long standing, and develop gradually.</p>
                        <p>Primary complications of type 1 diabetes include diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA).DKA, also referred to as diabetic acidosis or diabetic coma may develop over several days or weeks. It can be caused by too little insulin, failure to follow a prescribed diet, physical or emotional stress, or undiagnosed diabetes.</p>
                        <p>Secondary complications due to long-standing diabetes emerge years after the initial diagnosis (Dx).Common chronic complications include diabetic retinopathy and diabetic nephropathy. In diabetic retinopathy, the retina's blood vessels are destroyed, causing visual loss and, eventually, blindness. In diabetic nephropathy, destruction of the kidneys causes renal insufficiency and commonly requires hemodialysis or renal transplantation.</p>
                        <p>Gestational diabetes may occur in women who are not diabetic, but develop diabetes during pregnancy. That is, they develop an inability to metabolize carbohydrates (glucose intolerance) with resultant hyperglycemia. Gestational diabetes most often resolves after childbirth (parturition); however, this places women at risk of the development of type 2 diabetes later in life.</p>

                        <p>Oncological disorders of the endocrine system vary based on the organ involved and include pancreatic cancer, pituitary tumors, and thyroid carcinoma.</p>

                        <h4 id="pancreatic-cancer">Pancreatic Cancer</h4>
                        <p>Most carcinomas of the pancreas arise as epithelial tumors (adenocarcinomas) and make their presence known by obstruction and local invasion. Because the pancreas is richly supplied with nerves, pain is a prominent feature of pancreatic cancer, whether it arises in the head, body, or tail of the organ.</p>
                        <p>The prognosis in pancreatic cancer is poor, with only a 2% survival rate in 5 years. Pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer death in the United States. The highest incidence is among people ages 60 to 70 . The etiology is unknown, but cigarette smoking, exposure to occupational chemicals, a diet high in fats, and heavy coffee intake are associated with an increased incidence of pancreatic cancer.</p>

                        <h4 id="pituitary-tumors">Pituitary Tumors</h4>
                        <p>Pituitary tumors are generally not malignant; however, because their growth is invasive, they are considered neoplastic and are usually treated as such. Initial signs and symptoms include weight changes, intolerance to heat or cold, headache, blurred vision, and, commonly, personality changes, dementia, and seizures. Tomography, skull radiographs, pneumoencephalography, angiography, and computed tomography scans assist in diagnosis. Depending on the size of the tumor and its location, different treatment modalities are employed. Treatments include surgical removal, radiation, or both.</p>

                        <h4 id="thyroid-carcinoma">Thyroid Carcinoma</h4>
                        <p>Cancer of the thyroid gland, or thyroid carcinoma, is classified according to the specific tissue that is affected. In general, however, all types share many predisposing factors, including radiation, prolonged TSH stimulation, familial disposition, and chronic goiter. The malignancy usually begins with a painless, commonly hard nodule or a nodule in the adjacent lymph nodes accompanied with an enlarged thyroid. When the tumor is large, it typically destroys thyroid tissue, which results in symptoms of hypothyroidism. Sometimes the tumor stimulates the production of thyroid hormone, resulting in symptoms of hyperthyroidism. Treatment includes surgical removal, radiation, or both.</p>

                        <p>Common disorders associated with endocrine glands include hyposecretion and hypersecretion of hormones. When deficiencies of this type occur, natural and synthetic hormones, such as insulin and thyroid agents, are prescribed. These agents normalize hormone levels to maintain proper functioning and homeostasis. Therapeutic agents are also available to regulate various substances in the body, such as glucose levels in diabetic patients. Hormone replacement therapy (HRT), such as synthetic thyroid and estrogen, treat these hormonal deficiencies.
