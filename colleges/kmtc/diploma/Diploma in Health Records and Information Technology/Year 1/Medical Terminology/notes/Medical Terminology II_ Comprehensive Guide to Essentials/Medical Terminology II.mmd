\section*{CHAPTER ONE}

\section*{INTRODUCTION TO MEDICAL TERMINOLOGY}

Medical terminology is a professional language used to communicate facts and ideas in the field of medicine by doctors and other allied health professionals / practitioners.

\section*{Importance of learning Medical terminology}
- It helps to develop the ability to read and understand the language of medicine.
- It helps to communicate to other health departments.
- It helps to understand the standard abbreviations used in the field of medicine.
- It promotes the ability to write and spell medical terms.
- It helps to acquire knowledge of elements of medical terms.
- It helps to appreciate logical method found in medical terminology.
- It is applied in coding and indexing according to International Classification of diseases and health related problems.

\section*{Origin/ Historical background of medical terminology}

The majority of medical terms claim Greek and Latin ancestory.
Some have been adapted from modern languages especially German and French.
The study of medical terminology can enrich our understanding.

\section*{Health information technicians}

Every time a patient receives medical treatment, information is added to the patient's medical record which includes data about symptoms, medical history, test results, diagnoses and treatment.

Health information technicians organize and manage these records working closely with physicians, nurses and other health professionals to ensure that they provide a complete and accurate basis for quality patient care.

Accurate medical records are essential for administrative purposes. Health information technicians assign a code to each diagnosis and procedure a patient receives and this information is used for accurate patient billing. In addition, health information technicians analyze medical records to reveal trends in health and diseases. This research can be used to: improve patient care, manage costs, and help establish new medical treatments.

To read and interpret medical records, health information technicians need a thorough background in medical terminology. Most of these technicians work in hospitals and long-term care facilities. Others may work in medical clinics, government agencies, insurance companies and consulting firms.

\section*{BASIC ELEMENTS OF MEDICAL WORDS}

\section*{Medical Word Elements}

The language of medicine is a specialized vocabulary used by health care practitioners.

Many current medical word elements originated as early as the 1st century B.C., when Hippocrates practiced medicine.

With advancements in medicine, new terms have evolved to reflect these innovations. For example, radiographic terms, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ultrasound (US), are now used to describe current diagnostic procedures.

A medical word consists of some or all of the following elements: word root, combining form, suffix, and prefix. How you combine these elements, and whether all or some of them are present in a medical term, determines the meaning of a word.

\section*{Word Roots}

A word root is the foundation of a medical term and contains its primary meaning. All medical terms have at least one word root. Most word roots are derived from Greek or Latin language. Thus, two different roots may have the same meaning. For example, the Greek word dermatos and the Latin word cutane both refer to the skin.

As a general rule, Greek roots are used to build words that describe a disease, condition, treatment, or diagnosis. Latin roots are used to build words that describe anatomical structures. Consequently, the Greek root dermatis used primarily in terms that describe a disease, condition, treatment, or diagnosis of the skin; the Latin root cutaneis used primarily to describe an anatomical structure.

\section*{Table 1-1 Example of word roots}

\section*{This table lists examples of word roots.}

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|}
\hline English Term & Greek or Latin Term* & Word Root & Word Analysis \\
\hline Skin & dermatos (Gr) cutis (L) & dermat cutane & dermat/itis: inflammation of the skin A term that describes a skin disease cutane/ous: pertaining to the skin A term that describes an anatomical structure \\
\hline Kidney & nephros (Gr) renes (L) & nephr ren & nephr/oma: tumor of the kidney .A term that describes a kidney disease ren/al: pertains to the kidney A term that describes an anatomical structure \\
\hline Mouth & stomatos (Gr) oris (L) & stomat or & stomat/itis: inflammation of the mouth A term that describes any inflammatory condition of the mouth or/al: pertaining to the mouth A term that describes an anatomical structure \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\section*{Combining Forms}

A combining form is created when a word root is combined with a vowel. The vowel, known as a combining vowel, is usually an o, but sometimes it is an i.

The combining vowel has no meaning of its own, but enables two word elements to be connected. Like the word root, the combining form is the basic foundation to which other word elements are added to build a complete medical word.

In this text, a combining form will be listed as word root/vowel (such as gastr/o), as illustrated in

\section*{Table 1-2 Example of Combining forms}

This table illustrates how word roots and vowels create combining forms.

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|l|l|}
\hline Word Root & & Vowel & & Combining Form & Meaning \\
\hline erythr/ & + & $\boldsymbol{O}$ & = & erythr/o & red \\
\hline gastr/ & + & $O$ & = & gastr/o & stomach \\
\hline hepat/ & + & $O$ & = & hepat/o & liver \\
\hline immun/ & + & $O$ & = & immun/o & Immune, immunity, safe \\
\hline Nephr/ & + & $O$ & = & nephr/o & kidney \\
\hline oste/ & + & O & = & oste/o & bone \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\section*{Suffixes}

A suffix is a word element placed at the end of a word that changes the meaning of the word. In the terms tonsil /itis, and tonsil/ ectomy, the suffixes are -itis (inflammation) and -ectomy (excision, removal).

Changing the suffix changes the meaning of the word. In medical terminology, a suffix usually describes a pathology (disease or abnormality), symptom, surgical or diagnostic procedure, or part of speech. Many suffixes are derived from Greek or Latin words.

\section*{Table 1-3 Examples of Suffixes}

This table lists examples of pathological suffixes as well as their phonetic pronunciations.

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|l|l|}
\hline \multicolumn{2}{|l|}{Combining Form} & Suffix & & Medical Word & Meaning \\
\hline \multirow[t]{3}{*}{gastr/o (stomach)} & + & -itis (inflammation) & = & Gastritis & inflammation of the stomach \\
\hline & + & -megaly (enlargement) & = & gastromegaly & enlargement of the stomach \\
\hline & + & -oma (tumor) & = & gastroma & tumor of the stomach \\
\hline \multirow[t]{2}{*}{hepat/o (liver)} & 4 & -itis (inflammation) & = & hepatitis & inflammation of the liver \\
\hline & + & -megaly (enlargement) & = & hepatomegaly & enlargement of the liver \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\section*{Prefixes}

A prefix is a word element attached to the beginning of a word or word root. However, not all medical terms have a prefix. Adding or changing a prefix changes the meaning of the word.

The prefix usually indicates a number, time, position, direction, or negation. Many of the same prefixes used in medical terminology are also used in the English language.

\section*{Table 1-4 Examples of Prefixes}

This table lists examples of prefixes as well as their phonetic pronunciations. Begin learning the pronunciations as you review the information below.

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|l|l|l|}
\hline \multicolumn{2}{|l|}{Prefix} & \multicolumn{2}{|l|}{Word root} & Suffix & Medical word & Meaning \\
\hline an(without, not) & + & esthes (feeling) & + & -ia (condition) & = & condition of not feeling \\
\hline Hyper (excessive, above normal & + & therm (heat) & + & -ia (condition) & = & condition of excessive heat \\
\hline Intra (in, within) & + & muscul (muscle) & + & -ar (pertaining to) & = & pertaining to within the muscle \\
\hline Para (near, beside; beyond) & + & nas (nose) & + & -al (pertaining to) & = & pertaining to (area) near the nose \\
\hline Poly (many, much) & + & ur (urine) & + & -ia (condition) & = & condition of much urine \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\section*{Basic Guidelines}

Defining and building medical words are crucial skills in mastering medical terminology. Following the basic guidelines for each will help you develop these skills.

\section*{Defining Medical Words}

Words Here are three basic steps for defining medical words using gastroenteritis as an example.
1. Define the suffix, or last part of the word. In this case, the suffix -itis, this means inflammation.
2. Define the first part of the word (which may be a word root, combining form, or prefix). In this case, the combining form gastr/o means stomach.
3. Define the middle parts of the word. In this case, the word root enter means intestine.

When you analyze gastroenteritis following the three previous rules, the meaning is:

\section*{Inflammation (of) \\ Stomach (and)}
3. Intestine. Thus, the meaning of gastroenteritis is inflammation (of) stomach (and) intestine.

Table 1-5 on page 4 further illustrates this process.
This table illustrates three steps of defining a medical word using the example gastroenteritis.

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline Combining Form & Middle & Suffix \\
\hline gastr/o & enter/ & -it is \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l} 
Stomach \\
(step 2)
\end{tabular} & \begin{tabular}{l} 
Intestine \\
(step 3)
\end{tabular} & \begin{tabular}{l} 
Inflammation \\
(step 1)
\end{tabular} \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\section*{Building Medical Words}

There are three basic rules for building medical words.
Rule \#1 A word root links a suffix that begins with a vowel.
Rule \#2 A combining form (root +o ) links a suffix that begins with a consonant.
Rule \#3 A combining form links a root to another root to form a compound word. This rule holds true even if the next root begins with a vowel, as in osteoarthritis. Keep in mind that the rules for linking multiple roots to each other are slightly different from the rules for linking roots and combining forms to suffixes.

\begin{tabular}{|ll|l|l|l|}
\hline Rule 1 & \multicolumn{4}{|l|}{} \\
\hline Word Root & + & Suffix & $=$ & Medical Word \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l} 
Hepat/o \\
Liver
\end{tabular} & + & \begin{tabular}{l}
-it is \\
inflammation
\end{tabular} & $=$ & hepatitis \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{|ll|l|l|l|l|}
\hline Rule 2 & \multicolumn{4}{|l|}{} \\
\hline Combining Form + & Suffix & $=$ & Medical Word & Meaning \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l} 
hepat/o \\
liver
\end{tabular}$+$ & \begin{tabular}{l}
-cyte \\
cell
\end{tabular} & $=$ & hepatocyte & liver cell \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|l|}
\hline \multicolumn{5}{|l|}{Rule 3} \\
\hline Combining Form & Word Root & Suffix & Medical Word & Meaning \\
\hline \multirow[t]{2}{*}{oste/o (bone)} & chondr (cartilage) & -itis (inflammation) & osteochondritis & Inflammation of bone and cartilage \\
\hline & arthr (joint) & -itis (inflammation) & osteoarthritis & inflammation of bone and joint \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\section*{Pronunciation Guidelines}

Although pronunciations of medical words usually follows the same rules that govern pronunciations of English words, some medical words may be difficult to pronounce when first encountered.

Therefore, selected terms in this book include phonetic pronunciation. Also, pronunciation guidelines can be found on the inside front cover of this book and at the end of selected tables. Use them whenever you need help with pronunciation of medical words.

Here are guidelines to help you pronounce medical terms as well as understand pronunciation marks used throughout this text and in most dictionaries.

\section*{Special Sounds}

Here are rules regarding certain letter combinations and special sounds attributed to letters based on their placement in a medical word:
- For ae and oe, only the second vowel is pronounced. Examples are bursae, pleurae, and roentgen.
- The soft sound of $\mathbf{s}$ and $\mathbf{j}$ are given to $\mathbf{c}$ and $\mathbf{g}$, respectively, before $\mathbf{e}$, $\mathbf{i}$, and $\mathbf{y}$ in words of Greek or Latin origin. Examples are cerebrum, circumcision, cycle, gel, gingivitis, giant, and gyrate.
- Before other letters, $\mathbf{c}$ and $\mathbf{g}$ have a hard sound. Examples are cardiac, cast, gastric, and gonad.
- The letters ch are sometimes pronounced like $\mathbf{k}$. Examples are cholesterol, cholera, and cholemia.
- When pn appears at the beginning of a word, $\mathbf{p}$ is silent and only $\mathbf{n}$ is pronounced. Examples are pneumonia and pneumotoxin.
- When pn appears in the middle of a word, $\mathbf{p}$ and $\mathbf{n}$ are pronounced. Examples are orthopnea and hyperpnea.
- When ps appears at the beginning of a word, $\mathbf{p}$ is silent and only sis pronounced. Examples are psychology and psychosis.
- When forming the final letter(s) of a word, $\mathbf{e}$ and es are commonly pronounced as separate syllables. Examples are syncope, systole, and nares.
- When $\mathbf{i}$ appears at the end of a word (to form a plural), it is pronounced eye. Examples are bronchi, fungi, and nuclei.
- All other vowels and consonants have normal English sounds.

\section*{FORMING PLURALS}

Many medical words have special plural forms based on the ending of the word. Table 2-4 gives some general rules for the formation of plurals along with examples. The plural endings listed in column 2 are substituted for the word endings in column 1.

\section*{Some Exceptions to the Rules}

There are exceptions to the rules above for forming plurals, some of which will appear in later chapters. For example, the plural of virus is viruses, and serums is sometimes used instead of sera. An -es ending may be added to words ending in -ex or - $i x$ to form a plural, as in appendixes, apexes, and indexes.
Some people, in error, use phalange as the singular of phalanges. Words ending in -oma, meaning "tumor," should be changed to -omata, but most people just add an $s$ to form the plural. For example, the plural of carcinoma (a type of cancer) should be carcinomata, but carcinomas is commonly used.

\begin{table}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Table 2-4: Plural Ending}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|}
\hline WORD ENDING & PLURAL ENDING & SINGULAR EXAMPLE & PLURAL EXAMPLE \\
\hline a & ae & gingiva (gum) & gingivae \\
\hline en & ina & foramen (opening) & foramina \\
\hline ex, ix, yx & ices & appendix (something added) & appendices \\
\hline is & es & diagnosis (identification of disease) & diagnoses \\
\hline ma & mata & stigma (mark or scar) & stigmata \\
\hline nx (anx, inx, ynx) & nges & phalanx (bone of finger or toe) & phalanges \\
\hline on & a & spermatozoon (male reproductive cell) & spermatozoa \\
\hline um & a & ovum (egg) & ova \\
\hline us & ii & embolus & emboli \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\section*{CHAPTER TWO}

\section*{SUFFIXES}

Suffix Linking: In medical words, a suffix is added to the end of a word root or combining form to change its meaning. For example, the combining form gastr/o means stomach. The suffix -megaly means enlargement, and -it is means inflammation.

Gastr/o/megaly is an enlargement of the stomach; gastr/itis is an inflammation of the stomach. Whenever you change the suffix, you change the meaning of the word. Suffixes are also used to denote singular and plural forms of a word as well as a part of speech. The following tables provide additional examples to reinforce the rules you learned in Chapter 1.

This table provides examples of word roots used to link a suffix that begins with a vowel. It also lists combining forms (root + o) used to link a suffix that begins with a consonant

Words that contain more than one word root are known as compound words. Multiple word roots within a compound word are always changed to combining forms so that the roots are joined together with a combining vowel, regardless of whether the second word root begins with a vowel or a consonant.

Notice that a combining vowel is used in the Table $2-2$ between gastr and enter, even though the second word root, enter, begins with a vowel. Keep in mind the rule for linking multiple roots is slightly different from the rules for linking word roots to suffixes. Recall from Chapter 1 that suffixes that begin with a vowel are linked with a word root; suffixes that begin with a consonant are linked with a combining form.

\section*{Surgical, Diagnostic, Pathological, and Related Suffixes}

Surgical suffixes describe a type of invasive procedure performed on a body part. (See Table 2-3.) Diagnostic suffixes denote a procedure or test performed to identify the cause and nature of an illness. Pathological suffixes describe an abnormal condition or disease. (See Table 2-4.)

\section*{Suffix Types}

An effective method in mastering medical terminology is to learn the major types of suffixes in categories. By grouping the surgical, diagnostic, pathological, related, as well as grammatical suffixes, they will be easier to remember.

\section*{Grammatical Suffixes}

Grammatical suffixes are attached to word roots to form parts of speech, such as adjectives and nouns, or singular or plural forms of medical words. They are also used to denote a diminutive form, or smaller version, of a word-for example, tubule, which means a small tube. Many of these same suffixes are used in the English language. (See Table 2-5.)

\section*{Table 2-5 Adjective, Noun and Diminutive Suffixes}

A diminutive is a suffix which is added to a word to show affection or to indicate that something is small.

This table lists adjective, noun, and diminutive suffixes along with their meanings and word analyses.

\section*{Plural Suffixes}

Many medical words have Greek or Latin origins and follow the rules of these languages in building singular and plural forms. Once you learn these rules, you will find that they are easy to apply. You
will also find that some English endings have also been adopted for commonly used medical terms. When a word changes from a singular to a plural form, the suffix of the word is the part that changes.

\section*{CHAPTER THREE}

\section*{PREFIXES}

\section*{Prefix Linking}

Most medical words contain a root or combining form with a suffix. Some of them also contain prefixes. A prefix is a word element located at the beginning of a word. Substituting one prefix for another alters the meaning of the word. For example, in the term macro/cyte, macro- is a prefix meaning large; -cyte is a suffix meaning cell. A macrocyte is a large cell. By changing the prefix macro- to micro- (small), the meaning of the word changes. A microcyte* is a small cell. See Table 3-1 for three other examples of how a prefix changes the meaning of a word.

\section*{Prefix Types}

Learning the major types of prefixes, such as prefixes of position, number and measurement, and direction, as well as some others, will help you master medical terminology.

\section*{Prefixes of Position, Number, Measurement, and Direction}

Prefixes are used in medical terms to denote position, number and measurement, and direction. Prefixes of position describe a place or location. (See Table 3-2.) Prefixes of number and measurement describe an amount, size, or degree of involvement. (See Table 3-3.) Prefixes of direction indicate a pathway or route. (See Table 3-4.)

\section*{Other Common Prefixes}

Many other common prefixes may also be used to change the meaning of a word. See Table 3-5 for a list of some other common prefixes.

\section*{Table 3-1 Changing Prefixes and Meanings}

In this table, each word has the same root, nat (birth) and suffix, -al (pertaining to).By substituting different prefixes, new words with different meanings are formed.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|l|}
\hline Prefix + & Word Root + & Suffix = & Medical Word & Meaning \\
\hline Pre (before) + & □ & & prenatal & Pertaining to (the period) before birth. \\

\section*{Pathology}

All body cells require oxygen and nutrients for survival. They also need a stable internal environment that provides a narrow range of temperature, water, acidity, and salt concentration. This stable internal environment is called homeostasis. When homeostasis is disrupted and cells, tissues, organs, or systems are unable to function effectively, the condition is called disease.

From a clinical point of view, disease is a pathological or morbid condition that presents a group of signs, symptoms, and clinical findings. Signs are objective indicators that are observable. A palpable mass and tissue redness are examples of signs. A symptom is subjective and is experienced only by the patient. Dizziness, pain, and malaise are examples of symptoms. Clinical findings are the results of radiologic, laboratory, and other medical procedures performed on the patient or his specimens.

Etiology is the study of the cause or origin of a disease or disorder. Some possible causes of diseases include:
- metabolic (such as diabetes)
- infectious (such as measles and mumps)
- congenital (such as cleft lip)
- hereditary (such as hemophilia)
- environmental (such as burns and trauma)
- neoplastic (such as cancer)

Establishing the cause and nature of a disease is called diagnosis (Dx). Determining a diagnosis helps in the selection of a treatment. A prognosis is the prediction of the course of a disease and its
probable outcome. Any disease whose cause is unknown is said to be idiopathic. A variety of diagnostic procedures are used to identify diseases and determine their extent or involvement.

Diagnostic tests can be simple, such as listening to chest sounds with a stethoscope, or complex, such as a biopsy. Many of the diagnostic tests listed in this text can be categorized as surgical, clinical, endoscopic, laboratory, and radiological. Some tests include more than one testing modality.

\section*{Pathology}

General appearance and condition of the skin are clinically important because they may provide clues to body conditions or dysfunctions. Pale skin may indicate shock; red, flushed, very warm skin may indicate fever and infection. A rash may indicate allergies or local infections. Even chewed fingernails may be a clue to emotional problems. For diagnosis, treatment, and management of skin disorders, the medical services of a specialist may be warranted. Dermatology is the medical specialty concerned with diseases that directly affect the skin and systemic diseases that manifest their effects on the skin. The physician who specializes in diagnosis and treatment of skin diseases is known as a dermatologist.

\section*{Skin Lesions}

Lesions are areas of tissue that have been pathologically altered by injury, wound, or infection. Lesions may affect tissue over an area of a definite size (localized) or may be widely spread throughout the body (systemic). Evaluation of skin lesions, injuries, or changes to tissue helps establish the diagnosis of skin disorders. Lesions are described as primary or secondary. Primary skin lesions are the initial reaction to pathologically altered tissue and may be flat or elevated. Secondary skin lesions are changes that take place in the primary lesion due to infection, scratching, trauma, or various stages of a disease. Lesions are also described by their appearance, color, location, and size as measured in centimeters.

\section*{Burns}

Burns are tissue injuries caused by contact with thermal, chemical, electrical, or radioactive agents. Although burns generally occur on the skin, they can also affect the respiratory and digestive tract linings. Burns that have a local effect are not as serious as those that have a systemic effect.

Systemic effects are life threatening and may include dehydration, shock, and infection. Burns are usually classified as first-, second-, or third-degree burns. The extent of injury and degree of severity determine a burn's classification. First-degree (superficial) burns are the least serious type of burn because they injure only the top layers of the skin, the epidermis. These burns are most often caused by brief contact with either dry or moist heat (thermal burn), spending too much time in the sun (sunburn), or exposure to chemicals. Injury is restricted to local effects, such as skin redness (erythema) and acute sensitivity to sensory stimuli (hyperesthesia), such as touch, heat, or cold. Generally, blisters do not form and the burn heals without scar formation. Second degree (partialthickness) burns are deep burns that damage both the epidermis and part of the dermis. These burns may be caused by contact with flames, hot liquids, or chemicals. Symptoms mimic those of firstdegree burns, but fluid-filled blisters (vesicles or bullae) form and the burn may heal with little or no scarring. In third-degree (full-thickness) burns, the epidermis and dermis are destroyed and some of the underlying connective tissue is damaged, leaving the skin waxy and charred with insensitivity to touch. The underlying bones, muscles, and tendons may also be damaged. These burns may be caused by corrosive chemicals, flames, electricity, or extremely hot objects; immersion of the body in extremely hot water, or clothing that catches fire. Because of the extensiveness of tissue destruction, ulcerating wounds develop and the body attempts to heal itself by forming scar tissue. Skin grafting (dermatoplasty) is commonly required to protect the underlying tissue and assist in recovery. A formula for estimating the percentage of adult body surface area affected by burns is to apply the Rule of Nines. This method assigns values of $9 \%$ or $18 \%$ of surface areas to specific regions. The formula is modified in infants and children because of the proportionately larger head size. To determine treatment, it is important to know the amount of the burned surface area because IV fluids for hydration are required to replace fluids lost from tissue damage.

\section*{Oncology}

Neoplasms are abnormal growths of new tissue that are classified as benign or malignant. Benign neoplasms are noncancerous growths composed of the same type of cells as the tissue in which they are growing. They harm the individual only insofar as they place pressure on surrounding structures. If the benign neoplasm remains small and places no pressure on adjacent structures, it commonly is not removed. When it becomes excessively large, causes pain, or places pressure on other organs or structures, excision is necessary. Malignant neoplasms are composed of cells that are invasive and spread to remote regions of the body. These cells show altered function, altered appearance, and uncontrolled growth. They invade surrounding tissue and, ultimately, some of the malignant cells from the primary tumor may enter blood and lymph vessels and travel to remote regions of the body to form secondary tumor sites, a process called metastasis. The presence of a malignant growth (tumor) is the disease called cancer. The ability to invade surrounding tissues and spread to remote regions of the body is a distinguishing feature of cancer. If left untreated, cancer is usually progressive and generally fatal. Cancer (CA) treatment includes surgery, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and radiation therapy. Immunotherapy, also called biotherapy, is a recent treatment that stimulates the body's own immune defenses to fight tumor cells. To provide the most effective treatment, the physician may prescribe one of the above treatments or use a combination of them (combined modality treatment).

\section*{Grading and Staging Systems}

Pathologists' grade and stage tumors for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. A tumor grading system is used to evaluate the appearance and maturity of malignant cells in a tumor. Pathologists commonly describe tumors by four grades of severity based on the microscopic appearance of their cells. A patient with a grade I tumor has the best prognosis; one with grade IV tumor has the poorest prognosis. The tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) system of staging is used to identify the invasiveness of the malignant tumor. It also helps the oncologist determine the most effective method of treatment.

The TNM system stages tumors according to three basic criteria:
- T-size and invasiveness of the primary tumor
- $\mathbf{N}$-nodal involvement
- M-spreading of the primary tumor to remote regions of the body (metastasis).

Numbers are used to indicate size or spread of the tumor. The higher the number, the greater the extent or spread of the malignancy. For example, T2 designates a small tumor; M0 designates no evidence of metastasis.

The table below defines the four tumor grades and their characteristics

\begin{table}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Table 5-1 Tumor Grading}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline Grading & Tumor Characteristics \\
\hline Grade I Tumor cells well differentiated & - Close resemblance to tissue of origin, thus, retaining some specialized functions \\
\hline Grade II Tumor cells moderately differentiated & \begin{tabular}{l}
- Less resemblance to tissue of origin \\
- More variation in size and shape of tumor cells \\
- Increased mitoses
\end{tabular} \\
\hline Grade III Tumor cells poorly to very poorly differentiated & \begin{tabular}{l}
- Only remotely resembles tissue of origin \\
- Marked variation in shape and size of tumor cells \\
- Greatly increased mitoses
\end{tabular} \\
\hline Grade IV Tumor cells very poorly differentiated & \begin{tabular}{l}
- Little or no resemblance to tissue of origin \\
- Extreme variation in size and shape of tumor cells
\end{tabular} \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\section*{Basal Cell Carcinoma}

Basal cell carcinoma, the most common type of skin cancer, is a malignancy of the basal layer of the epidermis, or hair follicles. This type of cancer is commonly caused by overexposure to sunlight. These tumors are locally invasive but rarely metastasize. Basal cell carcinoma is most prevalent in blond, fair-skinned men and is the most common malignant tumor affecting white people. Although these tumors grow slowly, they commonly ulcerate as they increase in size and develop crusting that is firm to the touch. Metastases are uncommon with this type of cancer; however, the disease can invade the tissue sufficiently to destroy an ear, nose, or eyelid. Depending on the location, size, and depth of the lesion, treatment may include curettage and electrodesiccation, chemotherapy, surgical excision, irradiation, or chemosurgery.

\section*{Squamous Cell Carcinoma}

Squamous cell carcinoma arises from skin that undergoes pathological hardening (keratinizing) of epidermal cells. It is an invasive tumor with potential for metastasis and occurs most commonly in fair-skinned white men over age 60 . Repeated overexposure to the sun's ultraviolet rays greatly increases the risk of squamous cell carcinoma. Other predisposing factors associated with this type of cancer include radiation therapy, chronic skin irritation and inflammation, exposure to cancer causing agents (carcinogens), including tar and oil, hereditary diseases (such as xeroderma and pigmentosum and albinism), and the presence of premalignant lesions (such as actinic keratosis or Bowen disease). There are two types of squamous cell carcinoma: those that are confined to the original site (in situ) and those that penetrate the surrounding tissue (invasive). Treatment may consist of surgical excision; curettage and electrodesiccation, which provide good cosmetic results for smaller lesions; radiation therapy, usually for older or debilitated patients; and chemotherapy, depending on the location, size, shape, degree of invasion, and condition of underlying tissue. A combination of these treatment methods may be required for a deeply invasive tumor.

\section*{Malignant Melanoma}

Malignant melanoma is a neoplasm composed of abnormal melanocytes that commonly begin in a darkly pigmented mole. Although malignant melanoma is relatively rare, the incidence is rising more rapidly than any other malignancy.

It is the most lethal of the skin cancers and can metastasize extensively to the liver, lungs, or brain.
Several factors may influence the development of melanoma, but persons at greatest risk have fair complexions, blue eyes, red or blonde hair, and freckles. Excessive exposure to sunlight and severe sunburn during childhood are believed to increase the risk of melanoma in later life. Avoiding the sun and using sunscreen have proved effective in preventing the disease.

Melanomas are diagnosed by biopsy along with histological examination. Treatment requires surgery to remove the primary cancer, along with adjuvant therapies to reduce the risk of metastasis. The extent of surgery depends on the size and location of the primary tumor and is determined by staging the disease.

Skin test that identifies suspected allergens by subcutaneously injecting small amounts of extracts of the suspected allergens and observing the skin for a subsequent reaction. \\
Intradermal skin tests are used to determine immunity to diphtheria (Schick test) or tuberculosis (Mantoux test). \\
Skin test that identifies suspected allergens by topical application of the substance to be tested (such as food, pollen, and animal fur), usually on the forearm, and observing for a subsequent reaction. \\
After the patch is removed, a lack of noticeable reaction indicates a negative result; skin reddening or swelling indicates a positive result. \\
Skin test that identifies suspected allergens by placing a small quantity of the suspected allergen on a lightly scratched area of the skin. \\

\section*{Pharmacology}

Various medications are available to treat skin disorders. Because of their superficial nature and location, many skin disorders respond well to topical drug therapy. Such mild, localized skin disorders as contact dermatitis, acne, poison ivy, and diaper rash can be effectively treated with topical agents available as over-the-counter products.

Widespread or particularly severe dermatological disorders may require systemic treatment. For example, poison ivy with large areas of open, weeping lesions may be difficult to treat with topical medication and may require a prescription strength drug. In such a case, an oral steroid or antihistamine might be prescribed to relieve inflammation and severe itching.

\section*{Pathology}

Although some digestive disorders may be without symptoms (asymptomatic), many are associated with such symptoms as nausea, vomiting, bleeding, pain, and weight loss. Clinical signs, such as jaundice and edema, may indicate a hepatic disorder. Severe infection, drug toxicity, hepatic disease, and changes in fluid and electrolyte balance can cause behavioral abnormalities. Disorders of the GI tract or any of the accessory organs (liver, gallbladder, pancreas) may result in far-reaching metabolic or systemic problems that can eventually threaten life itself. Assessment of a suspected digestive disorder includes a thorough history and physical examination. A range of diagnostic tests assist in identifying abnormalities of the GI tract, liver, gallbladder, and pancreas.

For diagnosis, treatment, and management of digestive disorders, the medical services of a specialist may be warranted. Gastroenterology is the branch of medicine concerned with digestive diseases. The physician who specializes in the diagnoses and treatment of digestive disorders is known as a gastroenterologist. Gastroenterologists do not perform surgeries; however, under the broad classification of surgery, they do perform such procedures as liver biopsy and endoscopic examination.

\section*{Ulcer}

An ulcer is a circumscribed open sore, on the skin or mucous membranes within the body. Peptic ulcers are the most common type of ulcer that occurs in the digestive system. There are two main types of peptic ulcers: gastric ulcers, which develop in the stomach, and duodenal ulcers, which develop in the duodenum, usually in the area nearest the stomach. A third type of ulceration that affects the digestive system is associated with a disorder called colitis. As the name implies, it occurs in the colon.

\section*{Peptic Ulcer Disease}

Peptic ulcer disease (PUD) develops in the parts of the GI tract that are exposed to hydrochloric acid and pepsin, an enzyme secreted in the stomach that begins the digestion of proteins. Both of these products are found in gastric juice and normally act on food to begin the digestive process. The strong action of these digestive products can destroy the protective defenses of the mucous membranes of the stomach and duodenum, causing the lining to erode. However, current studies have identified the bacterium Helicobacter pylori as a leading cause of PUD. The spiral shape of this organism helps it to burrow into the mucosa, weakening it and making it more susceptible to the action of pepsin and stomach acid. Treatment includes antibiotics to destroy H. pylori and antacids to treat peptic ulcers. Patients are advised to avoid nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), caffeine, smoking, and alcohol, which intensify (exacerbate) the symptoms of gastric ulcers. If left untreated, mucosal destruction produces a whole (perforation) in the wall lining with resultant bleeding from the damaged area.

\section*{Ulcerative Colitis}

Ulcerative colitis, a chronic inflammatory disease of the large intestine and rectum, commonly begins in the rectum or sigmoid colon and extends upward into the entire colon. It is characterized by profuse, watery diarrhea containing varying amounts of blood, mucus, and pus. Ulcerative colitis is distinguished from other closely related bowel disorders by its characteristic inflammatory pattern. The inflammation involves only the mucosal lining of the colon, and the affected portion of the colon is uniformly involved, with no patches of healthy mucosal tissue evident. Ulcerative colitis is
associated with a higher risk of colon cancer. Severe cases may require surgical creation of an opening (stoma) for bowel evacuation to a bag worn on the abdomen.

\section*{Hernia}

A hernia is a protrusion of any organ, tissue, or structure through the wall of the cavity in which it is naturally contained. In general, though, the term is applied to protrusions of abdominal organs (viscera) through the abdominal wall. An (1) inguinal hernia develops in the groin where the abdominal folds of flesh meet the thighs. In initial stages, it may be hardly noticeable and appears as a soft lump under the skin, no larger than a marble. In early stages, an inguinal hernia is usually reducible; that is, it can be pushed gently back into its normal place. With this type of hernia, pain may be minimal. As time passes, pressure of the abdomen against the weak abdominal wall may increase the size of the opening as well as the size of the hernia lump. If the blood supply to the hernia is cut off because of pressure, a (2) strangulated hernia may develop leading to diagnoses and treatment of digestive disorders necrosis with gangrene. An (3) umbilical hernia is a protrusion of part of the intestine at the navel. It occurs more commonly in obese women and among those who have had several pregnancies. Hernias also occur in newborn infants (congenital) or during early childhood. If the defect has not corrected itself by age 2 , the deformity can be surgically corrected. Treatment consists of surgical repair of the hernia (hernioplasty) with suture of the abdominal wall (herniorrhaphy). Although hernias most commonly occur in the abdominal region, they may develop in the diaphragm. Two forms of this type include (4) diaphragmatic hernia, a congenital disorder, and (5) hiatal hernia, in which the lower part of the esophagus and the top of the stomach slides through an opening (hiatus) in the diaphragm into the thorax. With hiatal hernia, stomach acid backs up into the esophagus, causing heartburn, chest pain, and swallowing difficulty. Although many hiatal hernias are asymptomatic, if the disease continues for a prolonged period, it may cause gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).

\section*{Intestinal Obstruction}

An intestinal obstruction is a partial or complete blockage in the small or large intestine that prevents forward flow of digestive products. Complete obstruction in any part of the intestine constitutes a medical emergency and requires rapid diagnosis and treatment within a 24 -hour period to prevent death. The two forms of intestinal obstructions include mechanical blockage, also called ileus, where contents of the intestine are prevented from moving forward due to an obstacle or barrier that blocks the lumen. The second form, non-mechanical blockage, also called paralytic ileus, where peristaltic movement is lacking or absent and contents are no longer propelled through the intestine. Mechanical obstructions include tumors, scar tissues (adhesions), intestinal twisting (volvolus), intestinal "telescoping" where part of the intestine slips into another part just beneath it (intussusceptions),strangulated hernias, or the presence of foreign bodies, such as fruit pits and gallstones. Non-mechanical blockages often result after abdominal surgeries or with spinal cord lesions where peristalsis or other neurogenic stimuli are affected. Other less common causes include thrombosis or embolism of mesenteric vessels and trauma or bacterial injury to the peritoneum. The primary medical treatment for an intestinal obstruction is insertion of an intestinal tube. If the intestinal tube is ineffective in relieving the obstruction, surgery is indicated.

\section*{Hemorrhoids}

Enlarged veins in the mucous membrane of the anal canal are called hemorrhoids. Often they may bleed, hurt, or itch. They may occur inside (internal) or outside (external) the rectal area. Hemorrhoids are usually caused by abdominal pressure, such as from straining during bowel movement, pregnancy, and standing or sitting for long periods. They may also be associated with some disorders of the liver or the heart. A high-fiber diet as well as drinking plenty of water and juices plays a pivotal role in hemorrhoid prevention. Temporary relief from hemorrhoids can usually be obtained by cold compresses, sitz baths, stool softeners, or analgesic ointments. Treatment of an advanced hemorrhoidal condition involves surgical removal (hemorrhoidectomy).

\section*{Hepatitis}

Hepatitis is an inflammatory condition of the liver. The usual causes include exposure to toxic substances, especially alcohol; obstructions in the bile ducts; metabolic diseases; autoimmune diseases; and bacterial or viral infections. A growing public health concern is the increasing incidence of viral hepatitis. Even though its mortality rate is low, the disease is easily transmitted and can cause significant morbidity and prolonged loss of time from school or employment. Although forms of hepatitis range from hepatitis A through hepatitis E, the three most common forms are: hepatitis A , also called infectious hepatitis; hepatitis B , also called serum hepatitis; and hepatitis C . The most common causes of hepatitis A are ingestion of contaminated food, water, or milk. Hepatitis B and hepatitis C are usually transmitted by routes other than the mouth (parenteral), such as from blood transfusions and sexual contact. Because of patient exposure, health-care personnel are at increased risk for contracting hepatitis B , but a vaccine that provides immunity to hepatitis B is available. There is no vaccine available for hepatitis C . Patients with hepatitis C may remain asymptomatic for years or the disease may produce only mild flulike symptoms. Treatment for hepatitis includes antiviral drugs; however, there is no cure. As the disease progresses, scarring of the liver becomes so serious that liver transplantation is the only recourse.

One of the major symptoms of many liver disorders, including hepatitis and cirrhosis, is a yellowing of the skin, mucous membranes, and sclerae of the eyes (jaundice, icterus). This occurs because the liver is no longer able to remove bilirubin, a yellow compound formed when erythrocytes are destroyed. Jaundice may also result when the bile duct is blocked, causing bile to enter the bloodstream.

\section*{Diverticulosis}

Diverticulosisis a condition in which small, blister like pockets (diverticula) develop in the inner lining of the large intestine and may balloon through the intestinal wall. These pockets occur most commonly in the sigmoid colon. They usually do not cause any problem unless they become inflamed (diverticulitis). Signs and symptoms of diverticulitis include pain, often in the left lower quadrant (LLQ) of the abdomen; extreme constipation (obstipation) or diarrhea; fever; abdominal swelling; and occasional blood in bowel movements. The usual treatment for diverticulitis consists of bed rest, antibiotics, and a soft diet. In severe cases, however, excision of the diverticulum (diverticulectomy) may be advised.

\section*{Oncology}

Although stomach cancer is rare in United States, is common in many parts of the world where food preservation is problematic. It is an important medical problem because of its high mortality rate. Men are more susceptible to stomach cancer than women. The neoplasm nearly always develops
from the epithelial or mucosal lining of the stomach in the form of a cancerous glandular tumor (gastric adenocarcinoma). Persistent indigestion is one of the important warning signs of stomach cancer. Other types of GI carcinomas include esophageal carcinomas, hepatocellular carcinomas, and pancreatic carcinomas.

Colorectal cancer arises from the epithelial lining of the large intestine. Signs and symptoms, which depend largely on the location of the malignancy, include changes in bowel habits, passage of blood and mucus in stools, rectal or abdominal pain, anemia, weight loss, obstruction, and perforation. An obstruction that develops suddenly may be the first symptom of cancer involving the colon between the cecum and the sigmoid. In this region, where bowel contents are liquid, a slowly developing obstruction will not become evident until the lumen is almost closed. Cancer of the sigmoid and rectum causes symptoms of partial obstruction with constipation alternating with diarrhea, lower abdominal cramping pain, and distention.

\section*{Pharmacology}

Various pharmaceutical agents are available to counteract abnormal conditions that occur in the GI tract. Antacids counteract or decrease excessive stomach acid, the cause of heartburn, gastric discomfort, and gastric reflux. Antidiarrheals and antiemetics are prescribed to preserve water and electrolytes, which are essential for body hydration and homeostasis. Medications that increase or decrease peristalsis are used to regulate the speed at which food passes through the GI tract. These drugs include agents that relieve "cramping"(antispasmodics)and those that help in the movement of material through a sluggish bowel (laxatives).

\section*{Pathology}

Common signs and symptoms of many respiratory disorders include cough (dry or productive), chest pain, altered breathing patterns, shortness of breath (SOB), cyanosis, and fever. Many disorders of the respiratory system, including bronchitis and emphysema, begin as an acute problem but become chronic over time. Chronic respiratory diseases are usually difficult to treat. Their damaging effects are commonly irreversible.

For diagnosis, treatment, and management of respiratory disorders, the medical services of a specialist may be warranted. Pulmonology is the medical specialty concerned with disorders of the respiratory system. The physician who treats these disorders is called a pulmonologist.

\section*{Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease}

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) includes respiratory disorders that produce a chronic partial obstruction of the air passages. The patient finds it difficult to breath (dyspnea) especially upon exertion and usually exhibits a chronic cough. The three major disorders included in COPD are asthma, chronic bronchitis, and emphysema.

\section*{Asthma}

Asthma produces spasms in the bronchial passages (bronchospasms) that may be sudden and violent (paroxysmal) and lead to dyspnea. Asthma is commonly caused by exposure to allergens or irritants. Other causes include stress, cold, and exercise. During recovery, coughing episodes produce large amounts of mucus (productive cough). Over time, the epithelium of the bronchial passages thickens, and breathing becomes more difficult. Treatment includes agents that loosen and break down mucus (mucolytics) and medications that expand the bronchi (bronchodilators) by relaxing their smooth muscles. If usual measures do not reverse the bronchospasms, the condition is referred to as status asthmaticus.

\section*{Chronic Bronchitis}

Chronic bronchitis is an inflammation of the bronchi caused mainly by smoking and air pollution. However, other agents, such as viruses and bacteria may also cause the disorder. Bronchitis is characterized by swelling of the mucosa and a heavy, productive cough, commonly accompanied by chest pain. Patients usually seek medical help when they suffer exercise intolerance, wheezing, and
shortness of breath (SOB). Bronchodilators and medications that aid in the removal of mucus (expectorants) help to widen air passages. Steroids may be prescribed if the disease progresses or becomes chronic.

\section*{Emphysema}

Emphysema is characterized by decreased elasticity of the alveoli. The alveoli expand (dilate) but are unable to contract to their original size. The air that remains trapped in the chest results in a characteristic "barrel-chested" appearance. This disease commonly occurs with another respiratory disorder, such as asthma, tuberculosis, or chronic bronchitis. It is also found in long-term heavy smokers. Most emphysema sufferers find it easier to breathe when sitting upright or standing erect (orthopnea).As the disease progresses, relief even in the orthopneic position is not possible. Treatment for emphysema is similar to that of chronic bronchitis.

\section*{Influenza}

Influenza (flu) is an acute infectious respiratory viral disease. Three major viral types are responsible: type A, type B, and type C. Type A is of primary concern because it is associated with worldwide epidemics (pandemics) and its causative organism is highly infectious (virulent).Influenza type A epidemics occur about every 2 to 3 years. Type B is usually limited geographically and tends to be less severe than type A . Both viruses undergo antigenic changes; consequently, new vaccines must be developed in anticipation of outbreaks. Type C is a mild flu and is not associated with epidemics. The onset of the flu is usually rapid. Symptoms include fever, chills, headache, generalized muscle pain (myalgia), and loss of appetite, but recovery occurs in about 7 to 10 days. The flu virus rarely causes death. If death occurs, it is usually the result of a secondary pneumonia caused by bacteria or viruses that inyade the lungs. Children should not use aspirin for relief of symptoms caused by viruses because there appears to be a relationship between Reye syndrome and the use of aspirin by children 2 to 15 years of age.

\section*{Pleural Effusions}

Any abnormal fluid in the pleural cavity, the space between the visceral and parietal pleura, is called a pleural effusion. Normally, the pleural cavity contains only a small amount of lubricating fluid. However, some disorders may cause excessive fluid to collect in the pleural cavity. Two initial techniques used to diagnose pleural effusion are auscultation and percussion. Auscultation is the listening of sounds made by organs of the body using a stethoscope. Percussion is the gentle tapping the chest with the fingers and listening to the resultant sounds to determine the position, size, or consistency of the underlying structures. Chest x-ray (CXR) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirms the diagnosis.

Effusions are classified as transudates and exudates. A transudate is a non-inflammatory fluid that resembles serum but with slightly less protein. It results from an imbalance in venous arterial pressure or decrease of protein in blood. Both of these conditions allow serum to leak from the vascular system and collect in the pleural space. Common causes include left ventricular heart failure and liver disorders. An exudate is usually high in protein and often contains blood and immune cells. Common causes include tumors, infections, and inflammation. Various types of pleural effusions include serum (hydrothorax), pus (empyema orpyothorax), and blood (hemothorax). Although not considered a pleural effusion, air can enter the pleural space (pneumothorax), resulting in a partial or complete collapse of a lung.

Treatment consists of correcting the underlying cause of the effusion. Often a surgical puncture of the chest using a hollow-bore needle (thoracocentesis, thoracentesis) is undertaken to remove excess
fluid for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes. Sometimes chest tubes are inserted to drain fluid or remove air in pneumothorax.

\section*{Tuberculosis}

Tuberculosis (TB) is a communicable disease caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis. TB spreads by droplets of respiratory secretions (droplet nuclei) from an infected individual when he/she coughs, laughs, or sneezes. The waxy coat of the TB organism keeps it alive (viable) and infectious for 6 to 8 months outside the body. It also makes laboratory staining of this organism more challenging. Hence TB is also known as the acid-fast bacillus (AFB), a reference to its more complex method of laboratory staining.

The first time the TB organism enters the body (primary tuberculosis), the disease develops slowly. It eventually produces typical inflammatory nodules (granulomas) called tubercles. These granulomas usually remain dormant for years, during which time the patient is asymptomatic. When the immune system becomes impaired (immunocompromised) or when the patient is reexposed to the bacterium, a full-blown disease may develop. Although primarily a lung disease, TB can infect the bones, genital tract, meninges, and peritoneum.

Some TB strains that infect AIDS patients have become resistant and do not respond to standard medications. Treatment may include using several antibiotics (combination therapy) at the same time.

\section*{Pneumonia}

Pneumonia is any inflammatory disease of the lungs that may be caused by bacteria, viruses, or fungi. Chemicals or other agents can cause the lungs to become inflamed. A type of pneumonia associated with influenza is sometimes fatal. Other potentially fatal pneumonias may result from food or liquid inhalation (aspiration pneumonias).Some pneumonias affect only a lobe of the lung (lobar pneumonia),but some are more diffuse (bronchopneumonia).Chest pain, mucopurulent sputum, and spitting of blood (hemoptysis) are common signs and symptoms of the disease. If the air in the lungs is replaced by fluid and inflammatory debris, the lung tissue loses its spongy texture and become swollen and engorged (consolidation).Consolidation is associated primarily with bacterial pneumonias, not viral pneumonias. Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) is a type of pneumonia closely associated with AIDS. Recent evidence suggests that it is caused by a fungus that resides in or on most people (normal flora) but causes no harm as long as the individual remains healthy. When the immune system begins to fail, this organism becomes infectious (opportunistic). Diagnosis relies on examination of biopsied lung tissue or bronchial washings (lavage).

\section*{Cystic Fibrosis}

Cystic fibrosis is a hereditary disorder of the exocrine glands that causes the body to secrete extremely thick (viscous) mucus. This thickened mucus clogs ducts of the pancreas and digestive tract. As a result, digestion is impaired and the patient may suffer from malnutrition. It also blocks ducts of the sweat glands, causing the skin to become highly "salty." In the lungs, mucus blocks airways and impedes natural disease-fighting mechanisms, causing repeated infections. Medication in the form of mists (aerosols) along with postural drainage provides relief.

An important diagnostic test called the sweat test measures the amount of salt excreted in sweat. When elevated, it indicates cystic fibrosis. Although the disease is fatal, improved methods of treatment have extended life expectancy, and patient survival is approximately 30 years.

\section*{Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome}

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a condition in which the lungs no longer function effectively, threatening the life of the patient. It usually occurs as a result of very serious lung conditions, such as trauma, severe pneumonia, and other major infections that affect the entire body (systemic infections) or blood (sepsis).In ARDS, the alveoli fill with fluid (edema) caused by inflammation, and then collapse, making oxygen exchange impossible. Mechanical ventilation is commonly required to save the life of the patient.

Hyaline membrane disease (HMD), sometimes called infant respiratory distress syndrome (IRDS), is a form of respiratory distress syndrome. It is most commonly seen in preterm infants or infants born to diabetic mothers. It is caused by insufficient surfactant, a phospholipid substance that helps keep alveoli open. With insufficient surfactant, the alveoli collapse and breathing becomes labored. Clinical signs may include blueness (cyanosis) of the extremities. Flaring of the nostrils (nares) and central cyanosis are typically present. Other signs include rapid breathing (tachypnea), intercostal retraction, and a characteristic grunt audible during exhalation. Radiography shows a membrane that has a ground-glass appearance (hyaline membrane), bilateral decrease in volume, and alveolar consolidation. Although severe cases of HMD result in death, some forms of therapy are effective.

\section*{Oncology}

The most common form of lung cancer is bronchogenic carcinoma; also called primary pulmonary cancer. This cancer is usually associated with tobacco use. Cells of the bronchial epithelium divide repeatedly until the entire epithelium is involved. Within a short time, the epithelium begins to invade underlying tissues. As masses form, they block air passages and alveoli. Bronchogenic carcinoma spreads (metastasizes) rapidly to other areas of the body, including the lymph nodes, liver, bones, brain, and kidneys. Only about $10 \%$ of lung cancers are found in the early stages when the cure rate is high. Treatment of lung cancer includes surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy or a combination of these methods depending on specific cell type, how far the disease has spread, and the general health of the patient. Nevertheless, lung cancer is difficult to control and survival rates are very low.

\section*{Pharmacology}

In addition to antibiotics used to treat respiratory infections, there are several classes of drugs that treat pulmonary disorders. Bronchodilators are especially significant in the treatment of COPD and exercise-induced asthma. They relax smooth muscles of the bronchi, thus increasing airflow. Some bronchodilators are delivered as a fine mist directly to the airways/via aerosol delivery devices, including nebulizers and metered-dose inhalers (MDIs).

Another method of delivering medications directly to the lungs is dry-powder inhalers (DPIs) that dispense medications in the form of a powder. Steroidal and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are important in the control and management of many pulmonary disorders.

\section*{Pathology}

Many cardiac disorders, especially coronary artery disease, and valvular disorders are associated with a genetic predisposition. Thus, a complete history as well as a physical examination is essential in the diagnosis of cardiovascular disease. Although some of the most serious cardiovascular diseases have few signs and symptoms, when they occur they may include chest pain (angina), palpitations,
breathing difficulties (dyspnea), cardiac irregularities (arrhythmias) and loss of consciousness (syncope). The location, duration, pattern of radiation, and severity of pain are important qualities in differentiating the various forms of cardiovascular disease and are sometimes characteristic of specific disorders. Because of the general nature of the signs and symptoms of cardiovascular disorders, invasive and noninvasive tests are usually required to confirm or rule out a suspected disease.

For diagnosis, treatment, and management of cardiovascular disorders, the medical services of a specialist may be warranted. Cardiology is the medical specialty concerned with disorders of the cardiovascular system. The physician who treats these disorders is called a cardiologist.

\section*{Arteriosclerosis}

Arteriosclerosis is a hardening of arterial walls that causes them to become thickened and brittle. This hardening results from a build-up of a plaque-like substance composed of cholesterol, lipids, and cellular debris (atheroma).Over time, it builds up on the inside lining (tunica intima) of the arterial walls. Eventually, the plaque hardens (atherosclerosis), causing the vessel to lose elasticity. The lumen narrows as the plaque becomes larger. After a while, it becomes difficult for blood to pass through the blocked areas. Tissues distal to the occlusion become ischemic. In many instances, blood hemorrhages into the plaque and forms a clot (thrombus) that may dislodge. When a thrombus travels though the vascular system it is called an embolus (plural, emboli). Emboli in venous circulation may cause death. Emboli in arterial circulation commonly lodge in capillary bed and causes localized tissue death (infarct). Sometimes plaque weakens the vessel wall to such an extent that it forms a bulge (aneurysm) that may rupture. Arteriosclerosis usually affects large- or medium sized arteries, including the abdominal aorta; the coronary, cerebral, and renal arteries; and major arteries of the legs (femoral arteries). One of the major risk factors for developing arteriosclerosis is an elevated cholesterol level (hypercholesterolemia). Other major risk factors include age, family history, smoking, hypertension, and diabetes. Treatment for arthrosclerosis varies depending on the location and symptoms. In one method, occluding material and plaque are removed from the innermost layer of the artery (endarterectomy). In this procedure, the surgeon opens the site and removes the plaque, thereby resuming normal blood flow. Physicians commonly use endarterectomy to treat carotid artery disease, peripheral arterial disease, and diseases of the renal artery and aortic arch.

\section*{Coronary Artery Disease}

In order for the heart to function effectively, it must receive an uninterrupted supply of blood. This blood is delivered to the heart muscle by way of the coronary arteries. Failure of the coronary arteries to deliver an adequate supply of blood to the myocardium is called coronary artery disease (CAD). Its major cause is the accumulation of plaque which causes the walls of the artery to harden (arteriosclerosis). With partial occlusion, localized areas of the heart experience oxygen deficiency (ischemia). When the occlusion is total or almost total, the affected area of the heart muscle dies (infarction). The clinical signs and symptoms of myocardial infarction (MI) typically include intense chest pain (angina), profuse sweating (diaphoresis), paleness (pallor), and labored breathing (dyspnea).Arrhythmia with an abnormally rapid heart rate (tachycardia) or an abnormally slow heart rate (bradycardia) may also accompany an MI.

As the heart muscle undergoes necrotic changes, it releases several highly specific cardiac enzymes, including troponin T, troponin I, and creatinine kinase (CK).The rapid elevation of these enzymes at predictable times following MI helps differentiate MI from pericarditis, abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), and acute pulmonary embolism. When angina cannot be controlled with
medication, surgical intervention may be necessary. In percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA), a deflated balloon is passed through a small incision in the skin and into the diseased blood vessel. When the balloon inflates, it presses the occluding material against the lumen walls to force open the channel. After the procedure, the physician deflates and removes the balloon. Sometimes, the physician will place a hollow, thin mesh tube (stent) on the balloon and position it against the artery wall. It remains in place after the balloon catheter is removed and keeps the artery opened.

A more invasive procedure involves rerouting blood around the occluded area using a vein graft that bypasses the obstruction (coronary artery bypass graft [CABG]). One end of the graft vessel is sutured to the aorta and the other end is sutured to the coronary artery below the blocked area. This graft reestablishes blood flow to the heart muscle.

\section*{Endocarditis}

Endocarditis is an inflammation of the inner lining of the heart and its valves. It may be non-infective in nature, caused by thrombi formation, or infective, caused by various microorganisms. Although the infecting organism can be viral or fungal, the usual culprit is a bacterium. Congenital valvular defects, scarlet fever, rheumatic fever, calcified bicuspid or aortic valves, mitral valve prolapse, and prosthetic valves are predisposing factors. Bacteria traveling in the bloodstream (bacteremia) may lodge in the weakened heart tissue and form small masses called vegetations composed of fibrin and platelets. Vegetations usually collect on the leaflets of the valves and their cords, causing a backflow of blood (regurgitation) or scarring. Vegetations may dislodge (embolize) and travel to the brain, lungs, kidneys, or spleen. Scaring of the valves may cause them to narrow (stenosis) or not close properly (insufficiency). Although medications may prove helpful, if heart failure develops as a result of damaged heart valves, surgery may be the only option. Whenever possible, the original valve is repaired. When the damage is extensive, a mechanical or bioprosthetic valve may be used. Patients who are susceptible to endocarditis are given antibiotic treatment to protect against infection prior to invasive procedures (prophylactic treatment).Because many bacteria normally found in the mouth are also responsible for endocarditis, prophylactic treatment is essential for tooth removal, root canal procedures, and even routine cleaning.

\section*{Varicose Veins}

Varicose veins are enlarged, twisted, superficial veins. They develop when the valves of the veins do not function properly (incompetent) and fail to prevent the backflow of blood.

Blood accumulates and the vein becomes engorged and distended. Excess fluid eventually seeps from the vein, causing swelling in surrounding tissues (edema). Varicose veins may develop in almost any part of the body, including the esophagus (varices) and rectum (hemorrhoids), but occur most commonly in the greater and lesser saphenous veins of the lower legs. Types of varicose veins include reticular veins, which appear as small blue veins seen through the skin, and "spider"veins (teleangiectases), which look like short, fine lines, starburst clusters, or web-like mazes. Varicose veins of the legs are not typically painful but may be unsightly in appearance. However, if open lesions or pain is present, treatment includes laser ablation, microphlebectomies, sclerotherapy, and occasionally, ligation and stripping for heavily damaged or diseased veins. The same methods are used as an elective procedure to improve the appearance of the legs. Treatment of mild cases of varicose veins includes use of elastic stockings and rest periods during which the legs are elevated.

\section*{Oncology}

Although rare, the most common primary tumor of the heart is composed of mucous connective tissue (myxoma); however, these tumors tend to be benign. Although some myxomas originate in the endocardium of the heart chambers, most arise in the left atrium. Occasionally, they impede mitral valve function and cause a decrease in exercise tolerance, dyspnea, fluid in the lungs (pulmonary edema), and systemic problems, including joint pain (arthralgia), malaise, and anemia. These tumors are usually identified and located by two dimensional echocardiography. When present, they should be excised surgically. Most malignant tumors of the heart are the result of a malignancy originating in another area of the body (primary tumor) that has spread (metastasized) to the heart. The most common type originates in a darkly pigmented mole or tumor (malignant melanoma) of the skin. Other primary sites of malignancy that metastasize to the heart are bone marrow and lymphatic tissue. Treatment of the metastatic tumor of the heart involves treating the primary tumor.

\section*{Pharmacology}

A healthy, functional cardiovascular system is needed to ensure adequate blood circulation and efficient delivery of oxygen and nutrients to all parts of the body. When any part of the cardiovascular system malfunctions or becomes diseased, drug therapy plays an integral role in establishing and maintaining perfusion and homeostasis.

Medications are used to treat a variety of cardiovascular conditions, including angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, heart failure (HF), arrhythmias, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and yascular disorders. Many of the cardiovascular drugs treat multiple problems simultaneously.

\section*{Pathology}

Pathology associated with blood includes anemias, leukemias, and coagulation disorders. These groups of disorders typically share common signs and symptoms that generally include paleness, weakness, shortness of breath, and heart palpitations.

Lymphatic disorders are commonly associated with edema and lymphadenopathy. In these disorders, tissues are swollen with enlarged, tender nodes. Immunopathies include abnormally heightened immune responses to antigens (allergies, hypersensitivities, and autoimmune disorders) or abnormally depressed responses (immunodeficiencies and cancers).Many immunological disorders are manifested in other body systems. For example, asthma and hay fever are immunological disorders that affect the respiratory system; atopic dermatitis and eczema are immunological disorders that affect the integumentary system. Some of the most devastating diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, and AIDS, are caused by disordered immunity.

For diagnosis, treatment, and management of diseases that affect blood and blood-forming organs, the medical services of a specialist may be warranted. Hematology is the branch of medicine that studies blood cells, blood-clotting mechanisms, bone marrow, and lymph nodes. The physician who specializes in this branch of medicine is called a hematologist.

Allergy and immunology is the branch of medicine involving disorders of the immune system, including asthma and anaphylaxis, adverse reactions to drugs, autoimmune diseases, organ transplantations, and malignancies of the immune system. The physician who specializes in this combined branch of medicine is called an allergist and immunologist.

\section*{Anemias}

Anemia is any condition in which the oxygen carrying capacity of blood is deficient. It is not a disease but rather a symptom of various diseases. It results when there is a decrease in the number of circulating RBCs (erythropenia), the amount of hemoglobin (hypochromasia) within them, or in the volume of packed erythrocytes (hematocrit). Some of the causes of anemias include excessive blood loss, excessive blood-cell destruction, decreased blood formation, and faulty hemoglobin production. Anemia commonly causes changes in the appearance of RBCs when observed microscopically. In healthy individuals, RBCs fall within a normal range for size (normocytic) and amount of hemoglobin (normochromic). Variations in these normal values include RBCs that are excessively large (macrocytic), are excessively small (microcytic), or have decreased amounts of hemoglobin (hypochromic).Signs and symptoms associated with most anemias include difficulty breathing (dyspnea), weakness, rapid heartbeat (tachycardia), paleness (pallor), low blood pressure (hypotension) and ,commonly, a slight fever.

\section*{Table 9-4 Common Anemias}

This table lists various types of anemia along with descriptions and causes for each.

\end{tabular} & Caused by a defect in the gene responsible for hemoglobin synthesis (A person must have both genes for the disease to manifest. Those with only one gene for the trait are carriers of the disease.) \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\section*{Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS)}

Acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) is an infectious disease caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which slowly destroys the immune system. The immune system becomes so weak (immunocompromised) that, in the final stage of the disease, the patient falls victim to infections that usually do not affect healthy individuals (opportunistic infections).

Symptoms of AIDS begin to appear gradually, and include swollen lymph glands (lymphadenopathy), malaise, fever, night sweats, and weight loss. Kaposi sarcoma, a neoplastic disorder, and Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) are two diseases closely associated with AIDS.

Transmission of HIV occurs primarily through body fluids- mostly blood, semen, and vaginal secretions. The virus attacks the most important cell in the immune system, the helper T cell. Once infected by HIV, the helper T cell becomes a "mini-factory" for the replication of the virus. More importantly, the virus destroys the helper T cell, which impacts the effective functioning of the humoral and cellular arms of the immune system, ultimately causing the patient's death.

Although there is no cure for HIV, treatments are available that can slow the development of the virus and the progression of the disease. These medications have serious adverse effects; however, once the decision for medical management is made, the patient should continue treatment. Failure to do so causes the virus to become highly resistant to current treatment options.

\section*{Allergy}

An allergy is an acquired abnormal immune response. It requires initial exposure (sensitization) to an allergen (antigen). Subsequent exposures to the allergen produce increasing allergic reactions that cause a broad range of inflammatory changes.

Common signs and symptoms include hives (urticaria), eczema, allergic rhinitis, asthma and, in the extreme, anaphylactic shock, a life-threatening condition. The offending allergens are identified by allergy sensitivity tests. In one such test, small scratches are made on the patient's back and a liquid suspension of the allergen is introduced into the scratch. If antibodies to the allergen are present in the patient, the scratch becomes red, swollen, and hardened (indurated). A treatment called desensitization reduces the sensitivity of the patient to the offending allergen. This treatment involves repeated injections of highly diluted solutions containing the allergen. The initial concentration of the solution is too weak to cause symptoms. Additional exposure to higher concentrations promotes tolerance of the allergen.

\section*{Autoimmune Disease}

Autoimmunity is the failure of the body to distinguish accurately between "self" and "nonself." In this abnormal response, the immune system attacks the antigens found on its own cells to such an extent that tissue injury results.

Types of autoimmune disorders range from those that affect only a single organ to those that affect many organs and tissues (multisystemic). Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disorder that affects the neuromuscular junction. Muscles of the limbs and eyes and those affecting speech and swallowing are usually involved. Other autoimmune diseases include rheumatoid arthritis (RA), idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), vasculitis, and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).

Treatment consists of attempting to reach a balance between suppressing the immune response to avoid tissue damage, while still maintaining the immune mechanism sufficiently to protect against disease. Most autoimmune diseases have periods of flare-up (exacerbations) and latency (remissions). Autoimmune diseases are usually chronic, requiring lifelong care and monitoring, even when the person may look or feel well. Currently, few autoimmune diseases can be cured; however, with treatment, those afflicted can live relatively normal lives.

\section*{Edema}

Edema is an abnormal accumulation of fluids in the intercellular spaces of the body. A major cause of edema is a decrease in the blood protein level (hypoproteinemia), especially albumin, which controls the amount of plasma leaving the vascular channels. Other causes of edema include poor lymph drainage, high sodium intake, increased capillary permeability, and heart failure. Edema limited to a specific area (localized) may be relieved by elevation of that body part and application of cold packs. Systemic edema may be treated with medications that promote urination (diuretics). Closely associated with edema is a condition called ascites, in which fluid collects within the peritoneal or pleural cavity. The chief causes of ascites are interference in venous return in cardiac disease, obstruction of lymphatic flow, disturbances in electrolyte balance, and liver disease.

\section*{Hemophilia}

Hemophilia is a hereditary disorder in which the blood-clotting mechanism is impaired. There are two main types of hemophilia: hemophilia A, a deficiency in clotting factor VIII, and hemophilia B, a deficiency in clotting factor IX. The degree of deficiency varies from mild to severe. The disease is sex-linked and found most commonly in men. Women are carriers of the trait but generally do not have symptoms of the disease. Mild symptoms include nosebleeds, easy bruising, and bleeding from the gums. Severe symptoms produce areas of blood seepage (hematomas) deep within muscles. If blood enters joints (hemarthrosis), it is associated with pain and, possibly, permanent deformity. Uncontrolled bleeding in the body may lead to shock and death. Treatment consists of intravenous administration of the deficient factor. The amount of factor replaced depends on the seriousness of the hemorrhage and the amount of blood lost. Infectious Mononucleosis Infectious mononucleosis is one of the acute infections caused by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV).It is usually found in young adults and tends to appear in early spring and fall. Saliva and respiratory secretions have been implicated as significant infectious agents, hence the name "kissing disease." Sore throat, fever, and enlarged cervical lymph nodes characterize this disease. Other signs and symptoms include gum infection (gingivitis), headache, tiredness, loss of appetite (anorexia), and general malaise. In most cases, the disease resolves spontaneously and without complications. In some cases, however, the liver and spleen enlarge (hepatomegaly/ splenomegaly). Less common clinical findings include hemolytic anemia with jaundice and thrombocytopenia. Recovery usually ensures a lasting immunity.

\section*{Oncology}

Oncological disorders associated with the blood, lymph, and immune systems include leukemia, Hodgkin disease, and Kaposi sarcoma.

\section*{Leukemia}

Leukemia is an oncological disorder of the blood forming organs, characterized by an overgrowth (proliferation) of blood cells. With this condition, malignant cells replace healthy bone marrow cells. The disease is generally categorized by the type of leukocyte population affected: granulocytic (myelogenous) or lymphocytic.

The various types of leukemia may be further classified as chronic or acute. In the acute form, the cells are highly embryonic (blastic) with few mature forms, resulting in severe anemia, infections, and bleeding disorders. This form of leukemia is life threatening. Although there is a proliferation of blastic cells in chronic forms of leukemia, there are usually enough mature cells to carry on the functions of the various cell types.

Although the causes of leukemia are unknown, viruses, environmental conditions, high-dose radiation, and genetic factors have been implicated. Bone marrow aspiration and bone marrow biopsy
are used to diagnose leukemia. Treatment includes chemotherapy, radiation, biological therapy, bone marrow transplant, or a combination of these modalities. Left untreated, leukemias are fatal.

\section*{Hodgkin Disease}

Hodgkin disease, also called Hodgkin lymphoma, is a malignant disease of the lymph system, primarily the lymph nodes. Although malignancy usually remains only in neighboring nodes, it may spread to the spleen, GI tract, liver, or bone marrow. Hodgkin disease usually begins with a painless enlargement of lymph nodes, typically on one side of the neck, chest, or underarm. Other symptoms include severe itching (pruritus), weight loss, progressive anemia, and fever. If nodes in the neck become excessively large, they may press on the trachea, causing difficulty in breathing (dyspnea), or on the esophagus, causing difficulty in swallowing (dysphagia). Radiation and chemotherapy are important methods of controlling the disease. Newer methods of treatment include bone marrow transplants. Treatment is highly effective.

\section*{Kaposi Sarcoma}

Kaposi sarcoma is a malignancy of connective tissue, including bone, fat, muscle, and fibrous tissue. It is closely associated with AIDS and is commonly fatal because the tumors readily metastasize to other organs. Its close association with HIV has resulted in this disorder being classified as one of several "AIDS-defining conditions." The lesions emerge as purplish brown macules and develop into plaques and nodules. The lesions initially appear over the lower extremities and tend to spread symmetrically over the upper body, particularly the face and oral mucosa. Treatment for AIDS-related Kaposi sarcoma is usually palliative, relieving the pain and discomfort that accompany the lesions, but there is little evidence that it prolongs life.

\section*{Pharmacology}

Various drugs are prescribed to treat blood, lymph, and immune systems disorders. These drugs act directly on individual components of each system. For example, anticoagulants are used to prevent clot formation but are ineffective in destroying formed clots. Instead, thrombolytics are used to dissolve clots that obstruct coronary, cerebral, or pulmonary arteries and, conversely, hemostatics are used to prevent or control hemorrhage.

In addition, chemotherapy and radiation are commonly used to treat diseases of the blood and immune system. For example, antineoplastics prevent cellular replication to halt the spread of cancer in the body; antivirals prevent viral replication within cells and have been effective in slowing the progression of HIV and AIDS.

\section*{Pathology}

Joints are especially vulnerable to constant wear and tear. Repeated motion, disease, trauma, and aging affect joints as well as muscles and tendons. Overall, disorders of the musculoskeletal system are more likely to be caused by injury than disease. Other disorders of structure and bone strengthsuch as osteoporosis, which occurs primarily in elderly women - affect the health of the musculoskeletal system.

For diagnosis, treatment, and management of musculoskeletal disorders, the medical services of a specialist may be warranted. Orthopedics is the branch of medicine concerned with prevention, diagnosis, care, and treatment of musculoskeletal disorders. The physician who specializes in the diagnoses and treatment of musculoskeletal disorders is known as an orthopedist. These physicians employ medical, physical, and surgical methods to restore function that has been lost as a result of musculoskeletal injury or disease. Another physician who specializes in treating joint disease is the rheumatologist. Still another physician, a Doctor of Osteopathy (DO), maintains that good health requires proper alignment of bones, muscles, ligaments, and nerves. Like the medical doctor, osteopathic physicians combine manipulative procedures with state-of-the-art methods of medical treatment, including prescribing drugs and performing surgeries.

\section*{Bone Disorders}

Disorders involving the bones include fractures, infections, osteoporosis, and spinal curvatures.

\section*{Fractures}

A broken bone is called a fracture. The different types of fractures are classified by extent of damage.
A (1) closed (simple) fracture is one in which the bone is broken but no external wound exists.
An (2) open (compound) fracture involves a broken bone and an external wound that leads to the site of fracture. Fragments of bone commonly protrude through the skin.

A (3) complicated fracture is one in which a broken bone has injured an internal organ, such as when a broken rib pierces a lung.

In $\boldsymbol{a}$ (4) comminuted fracture, the bone has broken or splintered into pieces.
An (5) impacted fracture occurs when the bone is broken and one end is wedged into the interior of another bone.

An (6) incomplete fracture occurs when the line of fracture does not completely transverse the entire bone.

A (7) greenstick fracture is when the broken bone does not extend through the entire thickness of the bone; that is, one side of the bone is broken and one side of the bone is bent. It occurs most often in children as part of the bone is still composed of flexible cartilage. The term greenstick refers to new branches on a tree that bend rather than break. A greenstick fracture is also known as an incomplete fracture.

A (8) Colles fracture, a break at the lower end of the radius, occurs just above the wrist. It causes displacement of the hand and usually occurs as a result of flexing a hand to cushion a fall. A hairline fracture is a minor fracture in which all portions of the bone are in perfect alignment. The fracture is
seen on radiographic examination as a very thin hairline between the two segments but not extending entirely through the bone.

Pathological (spontaneous) fractures are usually caused by a disease process such as a neoplasm or osteoporosis. Unlike other repairs of the body, bones sometimes require months to heal. Several factors influence the rate at which fractures heal. Some fractures need to be immobilized to ensure that bones unite soundly in their proper position. In most cases, this is achieved with bandages, casts, traction, or a fixation device. Certain fractures, particularly those with bone fragments, require surgery to reposition and fix bones securely, so that surrounding tissues heal. In addition to promoting healing, immobilization prevents further injury and reduces pain.

Some bones have a natural tendency to heal more rapidly than others. For instance, the long bones of the arms usually mend twice as fast as those of the legs. Age also plays an important role in bone fracture healing rate; older patients require more time for healing. In addition, an adequate blood supply to the injured area and the nutritive state of the individual are crucial to the healing process.

\section*{Infections}

Infection of the bone and bone marrow is called osteomyelitis. It may be acute or chronic. Bone infections are primarily caused by pus-forming (pyogenic) bacteria. The disease usually begins with local trauma to the bone causing a blood clot (hematoma). Bacteria from an acute infection in another area of the body find their way to the injured bone and establish the infection. Most bone infections are more difficult to treat effectively than soft tissue infections. Eventually, some bone infections result in destruction (necrosis) of the bone and stiffening or freezing of the joints (ankylosis).Osteomyelitis may be acute or chronic. With early treatment, prognosis for acute osteomyelitis is good; prognosis for the chronic form of the disease is poor.

Paget disease, also known as osteitis deformans, is a chronic inflammation of bones resulting in thickening and softening of bones. It can occur in any bone but most commonly affects the long bones of the legs, the lower spine, the pelvis, and the skull. This disease is found in persons over age 40.Although a variety of causes have been proposed, a slow virus (not yet isolated) is currently thought to be the most likely cause.

\section*{Osteoporosis}

Osteoporosis is a common metabolic bone disorder in the elderly, particularly in postmenopausal women and especially women older than age 60.It is characterized by decreased bone density that occurs when the rate of bone resorption (loss of substance) exceeds the rate of bone formation. Among the many causes of osteoporosis are disturbances of protein metabolism, protein deficiency, disuse of bones due to prolonged periods of immobilization, estrogen deficiencies associated with menopause, a diet lacking vitamins or calcium, and long-term administration of high doses of corticosteroids. Patients with osteoporosis commonly complain of bone pain, typically in the back, which may be caused by repeated microscopic fractures. Thin areas of porous bone are also evident. Deformity associated with osteoporosis is usually the result of pathological fractures.

\section*{Spinal Curvatures}

Any persistent, abnormal deviation of the vertebral column from its normal position may cause an abnormal spinal curvature. Three common deviations are scoliosis, kyphosis, and lordosis. An abnormal lateral curvature of the spine, either to the right or left, is called scoliosis. Some rotation of a portion of the vertebral column may also occur. Scoliosis, or $\boldsymbol{C}$-shaped curvature of the spine, may be congenital, caused by chronic poor posture during childhood while the vertebrae are still growing,
or the result of one leg being longer than the other. Treatment depends on the severity of the curvature and may vary from exercises, physical therapy, and back braces to surgical intervention. Untreated scoliosis may result in pulmonary insufficiency (curvature may decrease lung capacity), back pain, sciatica, disk disease, or even degenerative arthritis.

An abnormal curvature of the upper portion of the spine is called kyphosis, more commonly known as humpback or hunchback. Rheumatoid arthritis, rickets, poor posture, or chronic respiratory diseases may cause kyphosis. Treatment consists of spine stretching exercises, sleeping with a board under the mattress, and wearing a brace to straighten the kyphotic curve; surgery is rarely required.

An abnormal, inward curvature of a portion of the lower portion of the spine is called lordosis, more commonly known as swayback. It may be caused by increased weight of the abdominal contents, resulting from obesity or excessive weight gain during pregnancy. Kyphosis and lordosis also occur in combination with scoliosis.

\section*{Joint Disorders}

Arthritis, a general term for many joint diseases, is an inflammation of a joint usually accompanied by pain, swelling and, commonly, changes in structure. Because of their location and constant use, joints are prone to stress injuries and inflammation. The main types of arthritis include rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, and gouty arthritis, or gout.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA), a systemic disease characterized by inflammatory changes in joints and their related structures, results in crippling deformities. This form of arthritis is believed to be caused by an autoimmune reaction of joint tissue. It occurs most commonly in women between ages 23 and 35 but can affect people of any age group. Intensified aggravations (exacerbations) of this disease are commonly associated with periods of increased physical or emotional stress. In addition to joint changes, muscles, bones, and skin adjacent to the affected joint atrophy. There is no specific cure, but nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), physical therapy, and orthopedic measures are used in treatment of less severe cases.

Osteoarthritis, also called degenerative joint disease (DJD), is the most common type of connective tissue disease. Cartilage destruction and new bone formation at the edges of joints (spurs) are the most common pathologies seen with osteoarthritis. Even though osteoarthritis is less crippling than rheumatoid arthritis, it may result in fusion of two bone surfaces, thereby completely immobilizing the joint. In addition, small, hard nodules may form at the distal interphalangeal joints of the fingers (Heberden nodes).

Gouty arthritis, also called gout, is a metabolic disease caused by the accumulation of uric acid crystals in the blood. These crystals may become deposited in joints and soft tissue near joints, causing painful swelling and inflammation. Although the joint chiefly affected is the big toe, any joint may be involved. Sometimes, renal calculi (nephroliths) form because of uric acid crystals collecting in the kidney.

\section*{Muscle Disorders}

Disorders involving the muscles include muscular dystrophy and myasthenia gravis.

\section*{Muscular Dystrophy}

Muscular dystrophy, a genetic disease, is characterized by gradual atrophy and weakening of muscle tissue. There are several types of muscular dystrophy. The most common type, Duchenne dystrophy,
affects children; boys more commonly than girls. It is transmitted as a sex-linked disease passed from mother to son. As muscular dystrophy progresses, the loss of muscle function affects not only skeletal muscle but also cardiac muscle. At present, there is no cure for this disease, and most children with muscular dystrophy die before age 30 .

\section*{Myasthenia Gravis}

Myasthenia gravis (MG), a neuromuscular disorder, causes fluctuating weakness of certain skeletal muscle groups (of the eyes, face and, sometimes, limbs).It is characterized by destruction of the receptors in the synaptic region that respond to acetylcholine, a substance that transmits nerve impulses (neurotransmitter).As the disease progresses, the muscle becomes increasingly weak and may eventually cease to function altogether. Women tend to be affected more often than men. Initial symptoms include a weakness of the eye muscles and difficulty swallowing (dysphagia). Later, the individual has difficulty chewing and talking. Eventually, the muscles of the limbs may become involved. Myasthenia gravis can be controlled, and medical management is the usual form of treatment.

\section*{Oncology}

The two major types of malignancies that affect bone are those that arise directly from bone or bone tissue, called primary bone cancer, and those that arise in another region of the body and spread (metastasize) to bone, called secondary bone cancer. Primary bone cancers are rare, but secondary bone cancers are quite prevalent. They are usually caused by malignant cells that have metastasized to the bone from the lungs, breast, or prostate.

Malignancies that originate from bone, fat, muscle, cartilage, bone marrow, and cells of the lymphatic system are called sarcomas. Three major types of sarcomas include fibrosarcoma, osteosarcoma, and Ewing sarcoma. Fibrosarcoma develops in cartilage and generally affects the pelvis, upper legs, and shoulders. Patients with fibrosarcoma are usually between ages 50 and 60 . Osteosarcoma develops from bone tissue and generally affects the knees, upper arms, and upper legs. Patients with osteosarcoma are usually between ages 20 and 25. Ewing sarcoma develops from primitive nerve cells in bone marrow. It usually affects the shaft of long bones but may occur in the pelvis or other bones of the arms or legs. This disease usually affects young boys between ages 10 and 20.

Signs and symptoms of sarcoma include swelling and tenderness, with a tendency toward fractures in the affected area. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), bone scan, and computed tomography (CT) scan are diagnostic tests that assist in identifying bone malignancies. All malignancies, including Ewing sarcoma, are staged and graded to determine the extent and degree of malignancy. This staging helps the physician determine an appropriate treatment modality. Generally, combination therapy is used, including chemotherapy for management of metastasis and radiation when the tumor is radiosensitive. In some cases, amputation is required.

\section*{Pharmacology}

Unlike other medications that treat specific disease, most pharmacological agents for musculoskeletal disorders are used to treat symptoms. Acute musculoskeletal conditions, such as strains, sprains, and
"pulled" muscles, are treated with analgesics and anti-inflammatory drugs. Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), salicylates, muscle relaxants, opioid analgesics, or narcotics are commonly used to treat pain by anesthetizing (numbing) the area or decreasing the inflammation. NSAIDs and salicylates are also used to treat arthritis, in addition to gold salts. Calcium supplements are used to treat hypocalcemia.

\section*{Pathology}

Pathology of the urinary system includes a range of disorders from those that are asymptomatic to those that manifest an array of signs and symptoms. Causes for these disorders include congenital anomalies, infectious diseases, trauma, or conditions that secondarily involve the urinary structures. Many times, asymptomatic urinary diseases are first diagnosed when a routine urinalysis shows abnormalities. Forms of glomerulonephritis and chronic urinary tract infection are two such disorders. Symptoms specific to urinary disorders include changes in urination pattern, output, or dysuria. Endoscopic tests, radiological evaluations, and laboratory tests that evaluate renal function are typically employed to diagnose disorders of the urinary system.

Signs and symptoms of male reproductive disorders include pain, swelling, erectile dysfunction, and loss of normal sexual drive (libido). Characteristics of infectious diseases, especially those transmitted through sexual activity, commonly include pain, discharge, or lesions as well as a vague feeling of fullness or discomfort in the perineal or rectal area. A complete evaluation of the genitalia, reproductive history, and past and present genitourinary infections and disorders is necessary to identify disorders associated with male reproductive structures.

For diagnosis, treatment, and management of genitourinary disorders, the medical services of a specialist may be warranted. Urology is the branch of medicine concerned with male and female urinary disorders and diseases of the male reproductive system. The physician who specializes in diagnoses and treatment of genitourinary disorders is known as a urologist. However, the branch of medicine concerned specifically with diseases of the kidney, electrolyte imbalance, renal transplantation, and dialysis therapy is known as nephrology. Physicians who practice in this specialty are called nephrologists.

\section*{Pyelonephritis}

One of the most common forms of kidney disease is pyelonephritis, (also called kidney infection or complicated urinary tract infection).In this disorder, bacteria invade the renal pelvis and kidney tissue, commonly as a result of a bladder infection that has ascended to the kidney via the ureters. When the infection is severe, lesions form in the renal pelvis, causing bleeding. The microscopic examination of urine shows large quantities of bacteria (bacteriuria), white blood cells (pyuria), and, when lesions are present, red blood cells (hematuria). The onset of the disease is usually acute, with symptoms including pain around the kidney, dysuria, fatigue, urinary urgency and frequency, chills, fever, nausea, and vomiting. Treatment with antibiotics is usually successful. However, in some cases, organisms may have developed a resistance and alternative antibiotics may be required.

\section*{Glomerulonephritis}

Any condition that causes the glomerular walls to become inflamed is referred to as glomerulonephritis. One of the most common causes of glomerular inflammation is a reaction to the toxins given off by pathogenic bacteria, especially streptococci that have recently infected another part of the body, usually the throat. Glomerulonephritis is also associated with diabetes and autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus, polyarthritis, and scleroderma.

When the glomerular membrane is inflamed, it becomes "leaky" (permeable). Red blood cells and protein pass through the glomerulus and enter the tubule. In some cases, protein solidifies in the nephron tubules and forms solid masses that take the shape of the tubules in which they develop. These masses are called casts. They commonly pass out of the kidney by way of the urine and may be visible when urine is examined microscopically. The clinical picture for glomerulonephritis includes blood and protein in the urine (hematuria and proteinuria) and red cell casts, along with high blood pressure (hypertension (HTN), edema, and impaired renal function. Most patients with acute glomerulonephritis associated with a streptococcal infection recover with no lasting kidney damage.

\section*{Nephrolithiasis}

Stones (calculi) may form in any part of the urinary tract (urolithiasis), but most arise in the kidney, a condition called nephrolithiasis. They commonly form when dissolved urine salts begin to solidify. These stones may increase in size and obstruct urinary structures. If they lodge in the ureters, they cause intense throbbing pain called colic. Because urine is hindered from passing into the bladder, it flows backward (refluxes) into the renal pelvis and the tubules, causing them to dilate. In one method of treatment called extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL), calculi are pulverized using concentrated ultrasound waves, called shock waves, directed at the stones from a machine outside the body. For excessively large stones or patients who have contraindications for ESWL, an alternative treatment is percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL). In this procedure, a small incision is made in the skin, and an opening is formed in the kidney. A nephroscope is inserted into the kidney to locate and remove the stone. If the stone is large, an ultrasonic or electrohydraulic probe is used to break the stone into smaller fragments, which are then more easily removed. A nephrostomy tube may be inserted and remain in place during healing. For stones that have descended into the ureters, it may be possible to remove them using a specialized ureteroscope fitted with a small basket. The ureteroscope is passed through the urethra and bladder and into the ureter where the basket collects the stone. For larger stones, it may be necessary to break them into smaller pieces using an endoscope fitted with a laser beam before the fragments are removed. This procedure is called ureteroscopic stone removal, and no incision is required.

\section*{Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia}

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), also called nodular hyperplasia or benign prostatic hypertrophy, is commonly associated with the aging process. As the prostate gland enlarges, it decreases the urethral lumen, and complete voiding of urine becomes difficult. Urine that remains in the bladder commonly becomes a breeding ground for bacteria .Bladder infection (cystitis) and, ultimately, kidney infection (nephritis) may result. If medical management of BPH fails, it may be necessary to employ surgical methods. Surgical removal of the entire prostate may be done through the perineum (perineal prostatectomy)or an abdominal opening above the pubis and directly over the bladder (suprapubic prostatectomy). These procedures are invasive and are performed when the entire prostate must be removed, such as when cancer is identified. These methods also enable the removal of lymph nodes for examination. When only a portion of the prostate must be removed, the less invasive transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) is usually performed. In TURP, a resectoscope is inserted through the urethra, and a small loop "chips away" some of the obstructing tissue. At the conclusion of the surgery, the urethra and bladder are irrigated to remove the small chips.

\section*{Cryptorchidism}

Failure of the testes to descend into the scrotal sac prior to birth is called cryptorchidism. In many infants born with this condition, the testes descend spontaneously by the end of the first year. If this does not occur, correction of the disorder involves surgical suspension of the testes (orchiopexy) in the scrotum. This procedure is usually done before the child reaches age 2. Because an inguinal hernia commonly accompanies cryptorchidism, the hernia may be sutured (herniorrhaphy) at the same time.

\section*{Acute Tubular Necrosis}

In acute tubular necrosis (ATN), the tubular portion of the nephron is injured by a decrease in blood supply (ischemic ATN) or after the ingestion of toxic chemicals (nephrotoxic ATN). Ischemia may occur because of circulatory collapse, severe hypotension, hemorrhage, dehydration, or other disorders that affect blood supply. ATN does not produce specific signs and symptoms, and diagnosis relies on a positive history of risk factors. General signs and symptoms of ATN include scanty urine production (oliguria) fluid retention, mental apathy, nausea, vomiting, and increased blood levels of calcium (hypercalcemia). When tubular damage is not severe, the disorder is usually reversible.

\section*{Oncology}

The most common form of cancer in men is carcinoma of the prostate. In the United States, the disease is rarely found in men younger than age 50 ; however, the incidence dramatically increases with age. Symptoms include difficulty starting urination (hesitancy) and stopping the urinary stream, dysuria, urinary frequency, and hematuria. By the time these symptoms develop and the patient seeks treatment, the disease is quite advanced and long-term survival is not likely. Early presymptomatic tests include a blood test for prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and periodic digital rectal examination (DRE).

Like other forms of cancer, prostatic carcinomas are staged and graded to determine metastatic potential, response to treatment, chances of survival, and appropriate forms of therapy. Surgery and radiation therapy are usual treatment modalities, but other forms of treatment may also be employed. Surgical treatment includes the removal of the entire prostate (radical prostatectomy).

Two forms of radiation oncology include brachytherapy and external beam radiation. In brachytherapy (also called internal radiation therapy), radioactive "seeds" are placed directly in the
malignant tissue. They remain in place for long or short periods of time depending on the type of malignancy, its location, and other diagnostic criteria. In external beam radiation (EBR), high energy x-ray beams are generated by a machine and directed at the tumor from outside the body to destroy prostate tissue.

Another treatment modality is the application of extreme cold (cryosurgery), which results in the destruction of prostate tissue. Administering antiandrogenic agents as well as hormones that deplete the body of testicular hormones (combined hormonal therapy) has been effective in treatment at the early stages of the disease. Because prostatic cancer is stimulated by testosterone, surgical removal of the testes (bilateral orchiectomy) may be necessary.

\section*{Pharmacology}

Pharmacological agents used to treat urinary tract disorders include antibiotics, diuretics, antidiuretics, urinary antispasmodics, and potassium supplements, which are commonly taken concurrently with many diuretics to counteract potassium depletion. Pharmacologic agents are used to treat conditions of the male reproductive system including hypogonadism, erectile disfunction, and reproductive concerns and disorders.

\section*{Pathology}

Many female reproductive disorders are caused by infection, injury, or hormonal dysfunction. Although some disorders may be mild and correct themselves over time, others, such as those caused by infection, may require medical attention. Pain, itching, lesions, and discharge are signs and symptoms commonly associated with sexually transmitted diseases and must not be ignored. Other common problems of the female reproductive system are related to hormonal dysfunction that may cause menstrual disorders.

As a preventive measure, a pelvic examination should be performed regularly throughout life. This diagnostic procedure helps identify many pelvic abnormalities and diseases. Cytological and bacteriological specimens are usually obtained at the time of examination.

Gynecology is the branch of medicine concerned with diseases of the female reproductive organs and the breast. Obstetrics is the branch of medicine that manages the health of a woman and her fetus during pregnancy, childbirth, and the puerperium. Because of the obvious overlap between gynecology and obstetrics, many practices include both specialties. The physician who simultaneously practices these specialties is called an obstetrician/gynecologist

\section*{Menstrual Disorders}

Menstrual disorders are usually caused by hormonal dysfunction or pathological conditions of the uterus and may produce a variety of symptoms.

\section*{Here are common disorders:}

Menstrual pain and tension (dysmenorrhea) may be the result of uterine contractions, pathological growths, or such chronic disorders as anemia, fatigue, diabetes, and tuberculosis. The female hormone estrogen is used to treat dysmenorrhea and also to regulate menstrual abnormalities.
- Irregular uterine bleeding between menstrual periods (metrorrhagia) or after menopause is usually symptomatic of disease, including benign or malignant uterine tumors. Consequently, early diagnosis and treatment are warranted. Metrorrhagia is probably the most significant form of menstrual disorder.
- Profuse or prolonged bleeding during regular menstruation (menorrhagia or hypermenorrhea) may, during early life, be caused by endocrine disturbances. However, in
later life, it is usually due to inflammatory diseases, fibroids, tumors, or emotional disturbances.
- Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is a disorder with signs and symptoms that range from complaints of headache and fatigue to mood changes, anxiety, depression, uncontrolled crying spells, and water retention. Signs and symptoms involving almost every organ have been attributed to PMS. This syndrome occurs several days before the onset of menstruation and ends when menses begins or a short time after and appears to be related to hormonal changes. The reason most individuals with PMS seek medical assistance is related to mood change. Simple changes in behavior, such as an increase in exercise and a reduction in caffeine, salt, and alcohol use, may be beneficial.

\section*{Endometriosis}

Endometriosis is the presence of functional endometrial tissue in areas outside the uterus. The endometrial tissue develops into what are called implants, lesions, or growths and can cause pain, infertility, and other problems. The ectopic tissue is usually confined to the pelvic area but may appear anywhere in the abdominopelvic cavity. Like normal endometrial tissue, the ectopic endometrium responds to hormonal fluctuations of the menstrual cycle.

\section*{Pelvic and Vaginal Infections}

Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is a general term for inflammation of the uterus, fallopian tubes, ovaries, and adjacent pelvic structures and is usually caused by bacterial infection. The infection may be confined to a single organ or it may involve all the internal reproductive organs. The disease producing organisms (pathogens) generally enter through the vagina during coitus, induced abortion, childbirth, or the postpartum period. As an ascending infection, the pathogens spread from the vagina and cervix to the upper structures of the female reproductive tract. Two of the most common causes of PID are gonorrhea and chlamydial infection, which are sexually transmitted diseases (STDs).Unless treated promptly, PID may result in scarring of the narrow fallopian tubes and the ovaries, causing sterility. The widespread infection of the reproductive structures can also lead to fatal septicemia. Because regions of the uterine tubes have an internal diameter slightly larger than the width of a human hair, the scarring and closure of the tubes is one of the major causes of female infertility.

\section*{Vaginitis}

The vagina is generally resistant to infection because of the acidity of vaginal secretions. Occasionally, however, localized infections and inflammations occur from viruses, bacteria, or yeast. If confined to the vagina, these infections are called vaginitis. Although symptoms may be numerous and varied, the most common symptoms are genital itching, painful intercourse, and foul-smelling vaginal discharge. It is not uncommon for vaginitis to be accompanied by urethral inflammation (urethritis) because of the proximity of the urethra to the vagina. Two of the most common types of vaginitis are candidiasis and trichomoniasis.

Candidiasis, also called moniliasis, is caused by Candida albicans, a yeast that is present as part of the normal flora of the vagina. Steroid therapy, diabetes, or pregnancy may cause a change in the vaginal environment that disrupts the normal flora and promotes the overgrowth of this organism, resulting in a yeast (fungal) infection. The use of antibiotics may also disrupt the normal balance of microorganisms in the vagina by destroying "friendly bacteria," thus allowing the overpopulation of yeast. Antifungal agents (mycostatics) that suppress the growth of fungi are used to treat this disease.

Trichomoniasis, caused by the protozoan Trichomonas vaginalis, is now known to be one of the most common causes of sexually transmitted lower genital tract infections. Trichomoniasis is discussed more fully in the sexually transmitted disease section below.

\section*{Sexually Transmitted Disease}

Sexually transmitted disease (STD), also called venereal disease, is any of several contagious diseases acquired as a result of sexual activity with an infected partner. As many as 20 different STDs have been identified, of which the newest and most serious is acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS).

In the United States, the widespread occurrence of STDs is regarded as an epidemic. As a group, STDs are the single most important cause of reproductive disorders. Until recently, gonorrhea and syphilis were the most common STDs. However, over the past few decades, chlamydia has become the most widespread STD. Viral diseases, such as genital herpes and genital warts, are also increasing in prevalence. The current STDs of medical concern include gonorrhea, syphilis, chlamydia, genital herpes, genital warts, and trichomoniasis.

\section*{Gonorrhea}

Gonorrhea is caused by the bacterium Neisseria gonorrhoeae. It involves the mucosal surface of the genitourinary tract and, possibly, the rectum and pharynx. This disease may be acquired through sexual intercourse and through orogenital and anogenital contact. Some women do not experience pain or manifest overt clinical symptoms (asymptomatic) until the disease has spread to the ovaries (oophoritis) and fallopian tubes (salpingitis), causing PID. The most common symptom of gonorrhea in women is a greenish yellow cervical discharge. The organism may infect the eyes of the newborn during vaginal delivery, which may result in blindness. As a precaution, silver nitrate is instilled in the eyes of newborns immediately after delivery as a preventive measure to ensure that this infection does not occur. The most common sign of gonorrhea in males is a discharge of pus from the penis. Other signs and symptoms include inflammation of the urethra (urethritis), which may cause painful urination (dysuria). If left untreated, the disease may infect the bladder (cystitis) and inflame the joints (arthritis).In addition; sterility may result from formation of scars that close the reproductive tubes of both sexes. Both sex partners must be treated because the infection can recur.

\section*{Syphilis}

Although less common than gonorrhea, syphilis is the more serious of the two diseases. It is caused by infection with the bacterium Treponema pallidum. If left untreated, syphilis may become a chronic, infectious, multisystemic disease.

Syphilis is characterized by three distinct phases. In the first phase, a primary sore (chancre) develops at the point where the organism enters the body. The chancre is an ulcerated sore with hard edges that contains contagious organisms. The second phase produces a variety of symptoms that make diagnosis of the disease difficult. The third phase is the latent phase whereby the disease may remain dormant for years.

Although there may be no symptoms of the disease during this time, the patient is nevertheless infectious. Symptoms may include blindness, insanity, and eventual death. Treatment with antibiotic therapy is effective.

\section*{Chlamydia}

Chlamydia, caused by infection with the bacterium Chlamydia trachomatis, is the most prevalent and one of the most damaging STDs in the United States. In women, chlamydial infections are associated with mucopurulent discharge and inflammation of the cervix uteri (cervicitis) that may lead to PID. Chlamydia can be transmitted to the newborn baby during the birth process and cause a form of conjunctivitis or pneumonia. In men, chlamydial infections are associated with a whitish discharge from the penis that may lead to urethritis or epididymitis. Chlamydia in men, women, and babies can be successfully treated with antibiotics. However, many cases are asymptomatic, especially in women, and the disease commonly remains untreated until irreversible damage to the reproductive structures has occurred.

\section*{Genital Herpes}

Genital herpes causes red, blister like, painful lesions that closely resemble the common fever blister or cold sore that appears on the lips and around the mouth. Although both diseases are caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV), genital herpes is associated with type 2 (HSV-2), and oral herpes is associated with type 1 (HSV-1). Regardless, both forms can cause oral and genital infections through oral-genital sexual activity. Fluid in the blisters is highly infectious and contains the active virus. However, this disease is associated with a phenomenon called viral shedding. During viral shedding, the virus is present on the skin of the infected patient, and can be transmitted to sexual partners, even when no lesions are present. Individuals with herpes infection may have only one episode or may have repeated attacks that usually lessen in severity over the years. The disease may be transmitted to a baby during the birth process and, although rare, may lead to death of the infant. In females, lesions appear in the vaginal area, buttocks, and thighs. In men, lesions appear on the glans, foreskin, or penile shaft.

\section*{Genital Warts}

Genital warts (condylomas) are caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV). Of the 100 identified types of HPV, only about 30 are spread through sexual contact. The warts may be very small and almost unnoticeable or may be large and appear in clusters. In females, the lesions may be found on the vulva, in the vagina, or on the cervix. In males, the lesions commonly appear on the penis or around the rectum. Many warts disappear without treatment, but there is no way to determine which ones will resolve.

When treatment is required, surgical excision or freezing the wart is the usual method. HPV infection has been found to increase the risk of certain cancers, including penile, vaginal, cervical, and anal cancer. The virus is linked to $80 \%$ of all cases of invasive cervical cancer. Thus, women who have been diagnosed with HPY infection are urged to have Papanicolaou (Pap) tests every 6 months after diagnosis. There is also a much greater incidence of miscarriages in individuals with HPV disease.

\section*{Trichomoniasis}

Trichomoniasis, caused by the protozoan Trichomonas vaginalis, affects males and females, but symptoms are more common in females. In women, it causes vaginitis, urethritis, and cystitis. Signs and symptoms include a frothy, yellow-green vaginal discharge with a strong odor. The infection may also cause discomfort during intercourse and urination. Irritation and itching in the female genital area and, in rare cases, lower abdominal pain can also occur. When symptoms are present in males, they include irritation inside the penis, mild discharge, or slight burning after urination or ejaculation. Treatment is generally very effective but reinfection is common if sexual partners are not treated simultaneously.

\section*{Uterine Fibroids}

About $30 \%$ to $40 \%$ of all women develop benign tumors called fibroids (also called leiomyomas or, more commonly, myomas). These benign tumors develop slowly between ages 25 and 40 and commonly enlarge in response to fluctuating endocrine stimulation after this period. Although some individuals are asymptomatic with these types of tumors, when present they include menorrhagia, backache, constipation, and urinary symptoms. In addition, such tumors commonly cause metrorrhagia and even sterility.

Treatment of uterine fibroid tumors depends on their size and location. If the patient plans to have children, treatment is as conservative as possible. As a rule, large tumors that produce symptoms, such as pelvic pain and pressure accompanied by heavy menstrual periods (menorrhagia) or bleeding in between periods (metrorrhagia), should be removed. Usually, the uterus is removed (hysterectomy), but the ovaries are preserved. If the tumor is small, a myomectomy may be performed. However, when the tumor is producing excessive bleeding, the uterus and the tumor are excised.

\section*{Oncology}

The two most common forms of cancer (CA) involving the female reproductive system are breast cancer and cervical cancer.

\section*{Breast Cancer}

Breast cancer, also called carcinoma of the breast, is the most common malignancy of women in the United States. This disease appears to be associated with ovarian hormonal function. In addition, $a$ diet high in fats appears to increase the incidence of breast cancer. Other contributing factors include a family history of the disease and, possibly, the use of hormone replacement therapy (HRT). Women who have not borne children (nulliparous) or those who have had an early onset of menstruation (menarche) or late onset of menopause are also more likely to develop breast cancer. Because this type of malignancy is highly responsive to treatment when detected early, women are urged to practice breast self-examination monthly and to receive periodic mammograms after age 40.Many breast malignancies are detected by the patient.

\section*{Cervical Cancer}

Cancer of the cervix most commonly affects women between ages 40 and 49 . Statistics indicate that infection associated with sexual activity has some relationship to the incidence of cervical cancer. First coitus at a young age, large number of sex partners, infection with certain sexually transmitted viruses, and frequent intercourse with men whose previous partners had cervical cancer are all associated with increased risk of developing cervical cancer. The Pap test, a cytological examination, can detect cervical cancer before the disease becomes clinically evident. Abnormal cervical cytology routinely calls for colposcopy, which can detect the presence and extent of preclinical lesions requiring biopsy and histological examination. Treatment of cervical cancer consists of surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. If left untreated, the cancer will eventually metastasize and lead to death.

\section*{Pharmacology}

Hormones perform a vital role in reproduction and sexual development of the female. Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is the use of synthetic or natural estrogens or a combination of estrogen and progestin to replace the decline or lack of natural hormones, a condition that accompanies hysterectomy and menopause. Such symptoms as vaginal dryness, hot flashes, and fatigue are commonly relieved or lessened using HRT. The medical profession is currently rethinking the use of hormone replacement in menopause because of an apparent increased risk of some disorders with extended use of the combination therapy. Use of estrogen alone for HRT is still in clinical trials but has not exhibited the strong contraindications of the combination form of HRT. Estrogen may be administered orally, transdermally, by injection, or as a topical cream (to treat vaginal symptoms only). Other hormones, including oxytocins and prostaglandins, are used for obstetrical applications. In addition, pharmacological agents are available for birth control and family planning. These include oral contraceptives, implants, morning-after pills (abortifacients), and spermicides.

\section*{Pathology}

Disorders of the endocrine system are caused by underproduction (hyposecretion) or overproduction (hypersecretion) of hormones. In general, hyposecretion is treated with drug therapy in the form of hormone replacement. Hypersecretion is generally treated by surgery. Most hormone deficiencies result from genetic defects in the glands, surgical removal of the glands, or production of poorquality hormones.

\section*{Pituitary Disorders}

Pituitary disorders are related to hypersecretion or hyposecretion of growth hormone, which leads to body-size abnormalities. Abnormal variations of ADH secretion lead to disorders in the composition of blood and marked electrolyte imbalance.

\section*{Thyroid Disorders}

Thyroid gland disorders are common and may develop at any time during life. They may be the result of a developmental problem, injury, disease, or dietary deficiency. One form of hypothyroidism that develops in infants is called cretinism. If not treated, this disorder leads to mental retardation, impaired growth, low body temperatures, and abnormal bone formation. Usually these symptoms do not appear at birth because the infant has received thyroid hormones from the mother's blood during fetal development. When hypothyroidism deyelops during adulthood, it is known as myxedema. The characteristics of this disease are edema, low blood levels of T3 and T4, weight gain, cold intolerance, fatigue, depression, muscle or joint pain, and sluggishness.

Hyperthyroidism results from excessive secretions of T3, T 4, or both. Two of the most common disorders of hyperthyroidism are Graves' disease and toxic goiter. Graves' disease is considerably more prevalent and is characterized by an elevated metabolic rate, abnormal weight loss, excessive perspiration, muscle weakness, and emotional instability. Also, the eyes are likely to protrude (exophthalmos) because of edematous swelling in the tissues behind them. At the same time, the thyroid gland is likely to enlarge, producing goiter.

It is believed that toxic goiter may occur because of excessive release of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) from the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland. Overstimulation by TSH causes thyroid cells to enlarge and secrete extra amounts of hormones. Treatment for hyperthyroidism may involve drug therapy to block the production of thyroid hormones or surgical removal of all or part of the thyroid gland. Another method for treating this disorder is to administer a sufficient amount of radioactive iodine to destroy the thyroid secretory cells.

\section*{Parathyroid Disorders}

As with the thyroid gland, dysfunction of the parathyroids is usually characterized by inadequate or excessive hormone secretion.

Insufficient production of parathyroid hormone (PTH), called hypoparathyroidism, can be caused by primary parathyroid dysfunction or elevated blood calcium levels. This condition can result from an injury or from surgical removal of the glands; sometimes in conjunction with thyroid surgery. The primary effect of hypoparathyroidism is a decreased blood calcium level (hypocalcemia). Decreased calcium lowers the electrical threshold, causing neurons to depolarize more easily, and increases the number of nerve impulses, resulting in muscle twitches and spasms (tetany).

Excessive production of PTH, called hyperparathyroidism, is commonly caused by a benign tumor. The increase in PTH secretion leads to demineralization of bones (osteitis fibrosa cystica), making them porous (osteoporosis) and highly susceptible to fracture and deformity. When this condition is the result of a benign glandular tumor (adenoma) of the parathyroid, the tumor is removed.
Treatment may also include orthopedic surgery to correct severe bone deformities. Excess PTH also causes calcium to be deposited in the kidneys. When the disease is generalized and all bones are affected, this disorder is known as von Recklinghausen disease. Renal symptoms and kidney stones (nephrolithiasis) may also develop.

\section*{Disorders of the Adrenal Glands}

As discussed, the adrenal glands consist of the adrenal cortex and adrenal medulla. Each has its own structure and function as well as its own set of associated disorders.

\section*{Adrenal Cortex}

The adrenal cortex is mainly associated with Addison disease and Cushing syndrome.

\section*{Addison disease}

Addison disease, a relatively uncommon chronic disorder caused by a deficiency of cortical hormones, results when the adrenal cortex is damaged or atrophied. Atrophy of the adrenal glands is probably the result of an autoimmune process in which circulating adrenal antibodies slowly destroy the gland. The gland usually suffers $90 \%$ destruction before clinical signs of adrenal insufficiency appear. Hypofunction of the adrenal cortex interferes with the body's ability to handle internal and external stress. In severe cases, the disturbance of sodium and potassium metabolism may be marked by depletion of sodium and water through urination, resulting in severe chronic dehydration. Other clinical manifestations include muscle weakness, anorexia, gastrointestinal symptoms, fatigue, hypoglycemia, hypotension, low blood sodium (hyponatremia), and high serum potassium (hyperkalemia). If treatment for this condition begins early, usually with adrenocortical hormone therapy, the prognosis is excellent. If untreated, the disease will continue a chronic course with progressive but relatively slow deterioration. In some patients, the deterioration may be rapid.

\section*{Cushing syndrome}

Cushing syndrome is a cluster of symptoms produced by excessive amounts of cortisol, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), or both circulating in the blood. Causes of this excess secretion include:
- Long-term administration of steroid drugs (glucocorticoids) in treating such diseases as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus erythematosus, and asthma.
Adrenal tumor resulting in excessive production of cortisol.
Cushing disease, a pituitary disorder caused by hypersecretion of ACTH from an adenoma in the anterior pituitary gland.
Regardless of the cause, Cushing syndrome alters carbohydrate and protein metabolism and electrolyte balance. Overproduction of mineralocorticoids and glucocorticoids causes blood glucose concentration to remain high, depleting tissue protein. In addition, sodium retention causes increased fluid in tissue that leads to edema. These metabolic changes produce weight gain and may cause structural changes, such as a moon-shaped face, grossly exaggerated head and trunk, and pencil-thin arms and legs. Other symptoms include fatigue, high blood pressure, and excessive hair growth in unusual places (hirsutism), especially in women. The treatment goal for this disease is to restore
serum cortisol to normal levels. Nevertheless, treatment varies with the cause and may necessitate radiation, drug therapy, surgery, or a combination of these methods.

\section*{Adrenal Medulla}

No specific diseases can be traced directly to a deficiency of hormones from the adrenal medulla. However, medullary tumors sometimes cause excess secretions. The most common disorder is a neoplasm known as pheochromocytoma, which produces excessive amounts of epinephrine and norepinephrine. Most of these tumors are encapsulated and benign. These hypersecretions produce high blood pressure, rapid heart rate, stress, fear, palpitations, headaches, visual blurring, muscle spasms, and sweating. Typical treatment consists of antihypertensive drugs and surgery.

\section*{Pancreatic Disorders}

Diabetes is a general term that, when used alone, refers to diabetes mellitus (DM).It is by far the most common pancreatic disorder.DM is a chronic metabolic disorder of impaired carbohydrate, protein, and fat metabolism due to insufficient production of insulin or the body's inability to utilize insulin properly. When body cells are deprived of glucose, their principal energy fuel, they begin to metabolize proteins and fats. As fat is metabolized, ketones are produced and enter the blood, causing a condition called ketosis. Hyperglycemia and ketosis are responsible for the host of troubling and commonly life-threatening symptoms of diabetes mellitus. Insulin is an essential hormone that prepares body cells to absorb and use glucose as an energy source. When insulin is lacking, sugar does not enter cells but returns to the bloodstream with a subsequent rise in its concentration in the blood (hyperglycemia). When blood glucose levels reach a certain concentration, sugar "spills" into the urine and is expelled from the body (glucosuria), along with electrolytes, particularly sodium. Sodium and potassium losses result in muscle weakness and fatigue. Because glucose is unavailable to cells, cellular starvation results and leads to hunger and an increased appetite (polyphagia.)

Although genetics and environmental factors, such as obesity and lack of exercise, seem significant in the development of this disease, the cause of diabetes is not always clear.

Diabetes mellitus occurs in two primary forms:
- Type 1 diabetes is usually diagnosed in children and young adults and was previously called juvenile diabetes. In type 1 diabetes, the body does not produce sufficient insulin. Treatment includes injection of insulin to maintain a normal level of glucose in the blood.
- Type 2 diabetes is the most common form and is distinctively different from type 1.Its onset was typically later in life but it has become more prevalent in children as the incidence of obesity has increased. Risk factors include a family history of diabetes and obesity. In type 2diabetes,the body is deficient in producing sufficient insulin or the body's cells are resistant to insulin action in target tissues. Hyperglycemia that results may cause cell starvation and, over time, may damage the kidneys, eyes, nerves, or heart. Treatment for type 2 diabetes includes exercise, diet, weight loss, and if needed, insulin or oral antidiabetic agents. Oral antidiabetic agents activate the release of pancreatic insulin and improve the body's sensitivity to insulin.

\section*{Complications}

Diabetes is associated with a number of primary and secondary complications. Patients with type 1 diabetes usually report rapidly developing symptoms. With type 2 diabetes, the patient's symptoms are usually vague, long standing, and develop gradually.

Primary complications of type 1 diabetes include diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA).DKA, also referred to as diabetic acidosis or diabetic coma may develop over several days or weeks. It can be caused by too little insulin, failure to follow a prescribed diet, physical or emotional stress, or undiagnosed diabetes.

Secondary complications due to long-standing diabetes emerge years after the initial diagnosis (Dx).Common chronic complications include diabetic retinopathy and diabetic nephropathy. In diabetic retinopathy, the retina's blood vessels are destroyed, causing visual loss and, eventually, blindness. In diabetic nephropathy, destruction of the kidneys causes renal insufficiency and commonly requires hemodialysis or renal transplantation.

Gestational diabetes may occur in women who are not diabetic, but develop diabetes during pregnancy. That is, they develop an inability to metabolize carbohydrates (glucose intolerance) with resultant hyperglycemia. Gestational diabetes most often resolves after childbirth (parturition); however, this places women at risk of the development of type 2 diabetes later in life.

\section*{Table 13-6 Clinical Manifestations of Diabetes}

\section*{According to the American Diabetes Association, the following signs and symptoms are manifestations of type 1 and type 2 diabetes.}

\section*{Type 1 Diabetes}

Type 1 diabetes may be suspected if any one of the associated signs and symptoms appears. Children usually exhibit dramatic, sudden symptoms and must receive prompt treatment. Signs and symptoms that signal type 1 diabetes can be remembered using the mnemonic CAUTION. Type 1 diabetes is characterized by the sudden appearance of:
- Constant urination (polyuria) and glycosuria
- Abnormal thirst (polydipsia)
- Unusual hunger (polyphagia)
- The rapid loss of weight
- Irritability
- Obvious weakness and fatigue
- Nausea and vomiting.

\section*{Type 2 Diabetes}

Many adults may have type 2 diabetes with none of the associated signs or symptoms. The disease is commonly discovered during a routine physical examination. In addition to any of the signs and symptoms associated with type 1 diabetes, those for type 2 diabetes can be remembered using the acronym DIABETES:

\section*{- Drowsiness}
- Itching
- A family history of diabetes
- Blurred vision - Excessive weight
- Tingling, numbness, and pain in the extremities
- Easily fatigued
- Skin infections and slow healing of cuts and scratches, especially of the feet

\section*{Oncology}

Oncological disorders of the endocrine system vary based on the organ involved and include pancreatic cancer, pituitary tumors, and thyroid carcinoma.

\section*{Pancreatic Cancer}

Most carcinomas of the pancreas arise as epithelial tumors (adenocarcinomas) and make their presence known by obstruction and local invasion. Because the pancreas is richly supplied with nerves, pain is a prominent feature of pancreatic cancer, whether it arises in the head, body, or tail of the organ.

The prognosis in pancreatic cancer is poor, with only a $2 \%$ survival rate in 5 years. Pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer death in the United States. The highest incidence is among people ages 60 to 70 . The etiology is unknown, but cigarette smoking, exposure to occupational chemicals, a diet high in fats, and heavy coffee intake are associated with an increased incidence of pancreatic cancer.

\section*{Pituitary Tumors}

Pituitary tumors are generally not malignant; however, because their growth is invasive, they are considered neoplastic and are usually treated as such. Initial signs and symptoms include weight changes, intolerance to heat or cold, headache, blurred vision, and, commonly, personality changes, dementia, and seizures. Tomography, skull radiographs, pneumoencephalography, angiography, and computed tomography scans assist in diagnosis. Depending on the size of the tumor and its location, different treatment modalities are employed. Treatments include surgical removal, radiation, or both.

\section*{Thyroid Carcinoma}

Cancer of the thyroid gland, or thyroid carcinoma, is classified according to the specific tissue that is affected. In general, however, all types share many predisposing factors, including radiation, prolonged TSH stimulation, familial disposition, and chronic goiter. The malignancy usually begins with a painless, commonly hard nodule or a nodule in the adjacent lymph nodes accompanied with an enlarged thyroid. When the tumor is large, it typically destroys thyroid tissue, which results in symptoms of hypothyroidism. Sometimes the tumor stimulates the production of thyroid hormone, resulting in symptoms of hyperthyroidism. Treatment includes surgical removal, radiation, or both.

\section*{Pharmacology}

Common disorders associated with endocrine glands include hyposecretion and hypersecretion of hormones. When deficiencies of this type occur, natural and synthetic hormones, such as insulin and thyroid agents, are prescribed. These agents normalize hormone levels to maintain proper functioning
and homeostasis. Therapeutic agents are also available to regulate various substances in the body, such as glucose levels in diabetic patients. Hormone replacement therapy (HRT), such as synthetic thyroid and estrogen, treat these hormonal deficiencies. Although specific drugs are not covered in this section, hormonal chemotherapy drugs are used to treat certain cancers, such as testicular, ovarian, breast, and endometrial cancer

\section*{Pathology}

Damage to the brain and spinal cord invariably causes signs and symptoms in other parts of the body. Common signs and symptoms for many neurological disorders include headache, insomnia, back or neck pain, weakness, and involuntary movement (dyskinesia). Careful observation of the patient during the history and physical examination may provide valuable clues about mental status and cognitive and motor ability. Muscle strength, coordination, gait, balance, and reflexes provide additional diagnostic clues. Lumbar puncture provides a sample of CSF for analysis and helps identify various types of meningitis and encephalitis. Radiology- especially computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans-provide detailed images that can locate cerebrovascular irregularities, lesions, and tumors.

Radiculopathy, also called radiculitis, is an inflammation of the nerve root associated with the spinal column. Spinal nerves exit the spinal column at each level along the length of the spine. When pressure is applied to the nerve root (compression), the patient experiences tingling, numbness, weakness, or a radiating pain starting in the spine and moving outward. Pressure can be the result of a herniated disc, degenerative changes, arthritis, fractures, bone spurs, or tumors. The area's most commonly affected are the neck (cervical radiculopathy)and the lower back (lumbar radiculopathy, sciatica). The offending nerve root is commonly identified during the history and physical examination by evaluating the area of the skin known to be served by a specific nerve. MRIs and CT scans help to localize the site and nature of compression. Rest and anti-inflammatory medications are usually recommended. However, for disabling pain that lasts for several months or is accompanied by loss of bowel or bladder control, surgery to remove the cause of the pressure (decompression surgery) may be the only option.

\section*{Cerebrovascular Disease}

Cerebrovascular disease refers to any functional abnormality of the cerebrum caused by disorders of the blood vessels of the brain. It is most commonly associated with a stroke, also called cerebrovascular accident (CVA). The three major types of strokes are ischemic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, and subarachnoid hemorrhage. The most common type, which accounts for about $80 \%$ of all strokes, is ischemic stroke. Ischemic stroke is caused by a narrowing of the arteries of the brain or the arteries of the neck (carotid), generally due to atherosclerosis. This narrowing causes insufficient oxygen delivery to the brain tissue and, within a few minutes, the tissue begins to die. Occasionally, pieces of plaque break loose and travel to the narrower vessels of the brain, causing occlusion, also resulting in ischemia. An intracerebral hemorrhage is caused by the sudden rupture of an artery within the brain. After the rupture, released blood compresses brain structures and destroys them. In a subarachnoid hemorrhage, blood is released into the space surrounding the brain. This condition is commonly caused by a ruptured aneurysm and is usually fatal.

Signs and symptoms of stroke include weakness in one half of the body (hemiparesis),paralysis in one half of the body (hemiplegia), inability to speak (aphasia),lack of muscle coordination (ataxia),stupor, loss of consciousness (LOC), coma, or even death. If the CVA is mild, the patient may experience a brief "blackout," blurred vision, or dizziness and may be unaware of the "minor stroke." Stroke symptoms that resolve within 24 hours are known as a transient ischemic attack (TIA).About one third of all strokes are preceded by a TIA. A family history of cerebrovascular disease and high blood pressure appears to be a contributing factor to stroke. Computed tomography (CT) is usually performed to determine the type of stroke. "Clot buster" (thrombolytic) medication is usually administered within 3 hours of symptom onset when ischemic stroke is diagnosed. Antihypertensives may also be administered to control blood pressure. Treatment involves speech, physical, and occupational therapy and various medications, depending on the type of stroke.

\section*{Seizure Disorders}

Seizure disorders include any medical condition characterized by sudden changes in behavior or consciousness as a result of uncontrolled electrical activity in the brain. However, chronic or recurring seizure disorders are called epilepsies. Causes of epilepsy include brain injury, congenital anomalies, metabolic disorders, brain tumors, vascular disturbances, and genetic disorders.

Seizures are characterized by sudden bursts of abnormal electrical activity in neurons, resulting in temporary changes in brain function. Two major types of seizures are partial and generalized.

In partial seizures, only a portion of the brain is involved. There is a short alteration of consciousness of about 10 to 30 seconds with repetitive, unusual movements and confusion. In a generalized seizure, the entire brain is involved. The most common type of generalized seizure is the tonic-clonic seizure; also called grand mal seizure. In the tonic phase of a tonic-clonic seizure, the entire body becomes rigid; in the clonic phase there is uncontrolled jerking. Recovery may take minutes to hours and usually leaves the patient weak. In status epilepticus, tonic-clonic seizures follow one after another without an intervening period of recovery. It is a life-threatening emergency that involves the whole cortex and emergency medical attention is essential. Diagnosis and evaluation commonly rely on electroencephalography and magnetoencephalography to locate the affected area of the brain. Epilepsy can usually be controlled by antiepileptic medications.

\section*{Parkinson Disease}

Parkinson disease, also called shaking palsy, is a progressive neurological disorder affecting the portion of the brain responsible for controlling movement. As neurons degenerate, the patient develops uncontrollable nodding of the head, decreased speed of movement (bradykinesia, hypokinesia), tremors, large joint stiffness, and a shuffling gait. Muscle rigidity causes facial expressions to appear fixed and masklike with unblinking eyes. Sometimes the patient exhibits "pill rolling," in which he or she inadvertently rubs the thumb against the index finger.

In patients with Parkinson disease, dopamine (a neurotransmitter that facilitates the transmission of impulses at synapses) is lacking in the brain. Management involves the administration of L-dopa, which can cross the blood-brain barrier. L-dopa is converted in the brain to dopamine. Even so, this treatment only reduces symptoms; it is not a cure for Parkinson disease.

\section*{Multiple Sclerosis}

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a progressive, degenerative disease of the central nervous system. MS is characterized by inflammation, hardening and, finally, loss of myelin (demyelination) throughout the spinal cord and brain. As myelin deteriorates, the transmission of electrical impulses from one neuron to another is impeded. In effect, the conduction pathway develops "short circuits."

Signs and symptoms of MS include tremors, muscle weakness, and bradykinesia. Occasionally, visual disturbances exist. During remissions, symptoms temporarily disappear, but progressive hardening of myelin areas leads to other attacks. Ultimately, most voluntary motor control is lost and the patient becomes bedridden. Death occurs anywhere from 7 to 30 years after the onset of the disease. Young adults, usually women, between ages 20 and 40 are the most common victims of MS. The etiology of the disease is unclear, but autoimmune disease or a slow viral infection is believed to be the most probable cause.

\section*{Alzheimer Disease}

Alzheimer disease (AD) is a progressive neurological disorder that causes memory loss and serious mental deterioration. Small lesions called plaques develop in the cerebral cortex and disrupt the passage of electrochemical signals between cells. The clinical manifestations of Alzheimer disease include memory loss and cognitive decline. There is also a decline in social skills and ability to carry out activities of daily living. Most patients undergo personality, emotional, and behavioral changes. As the disease progresses, loss of concentration and increased fatigue, restlessness, and anxiety are
common. Alzheimer disease was once considered rare but is now identified as a leading cause of senile dementia. Although there is no specific treatment, moderate relief has been associated with medications that prevent a breakdown of brain chemicals required for neurotransmission.

\section*{Mental Illness}

Mental illness includes an array of psychological disorders, syndromes, and behavioral patterns that cause alterations in mood, behavior, and thinking. Its forms range from mild to serious. For example, anxiety may manifest as a slight apprehension or uneasiness lasting a few days to a more severe form involving intense fears lasting for months and even years.

Psychosis refers to a serious mental disorder commonly characterized by false beliefs despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary (delusions). The psychotic patient typically "hears voices" and "sees visions" in the absence of an actual stimulus (hallucinations). The patient's speech is usually incoherent and disorganized and behavior is erratic. Neurosis is a mental disorder caused by an emotion experienced in the past that overwhelmingly interferes or affects a present emotion. For example, a child bitten by a dog may show irrational fear of animals as an adult. Many mental disorders are forms of neuroses, including irrational fears (phobias), exaggerated emotional and reflexive behaviors (hysterias), or irrational, uncontrolled performance of ritualistic actions for fear of a dire consequence (obsessive compulsive disorders).

Research and education have removed much of the stigma attached to mental illness. Today, mental illness is becoming a more recognizable and treatable disorder. Many psychological disorders can be effectively treated or managed by family physicians, school psychologists, marriage counselors, family counselors, and even support groups such as grief support groups and Alcoholics Anonymous.

Diagnosis and treatment of serious mental disorders usually require the skills of a medical specialist called a psychiatrist. In the capacity of a physician, the psychiatrist is licensed to prescribe medications and perform medical procedures not available to those who do not hold a medical license. Psychiatrists commonly work in association with clinical psychologists, who are individuals trained in evaluating human behavior, intelligence, and personality.

\section*{Oncology}

Intracranial tumors that originate directly in brain tissue are called primary intracranial tumors. They are commonly classified according to histological type and include those that originate in neurons and those that develop in glial tissue. Signs and symptoms of intracranial tumors include headaches, especially upon arising in the morning, during coughing episodes, and upon bending or sudden movement. Occasionally, the optic disc in the back of the eyeball swells (papilledema) because of increased intracranial pressure. Personality changes are common and include depression, anxiety, and irritability.

Intracranial tumors can arise from any structure within the cranial cavity, including the pituitary and pineal glands, cranial nerves, and the arachnoid and pia mater (leptomeninges). In addition, all of these tissues may be the sites of metastatic spread from primary malignancies that occur outside of the nervous system. Metastatic tumors of the cranial cavity tend to exhibit growth characteristics similar to those of the primary malignancy but tend to grow more slowly than the parent tumor. Metastatic tumors of the cranial cavity are usually easier to remove than primary intracranial tumors.

Computed tomography (CT) scans and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) help establish a diagnosis but are not definitive. Surgical removal relieves pressure and confirms or rules out malignancy. Even after surgery, most intracranial tumors require radiation therapy as a second line of treatment. Chemotherapy combined with radiation therapy usually provides the best chance for survival and quality of life.

\section*{Pharmacology}

Neurological agents are used to relieve or eliminate pain, suppress seizures, control tremors, and reduce muscle rigidity. Hypnotics, a class of drugs used as sedatives, depress CNS function to relieve agitation and induce sleep. Anesthetics are capable of producing a complete or partial loss of feeling
and are used for surgery. Psychotherapeutic agents alter brain chemistry to treat mental illness. These drugs are used as mood stabilizers in various mental disorders. They also reduce symptoms of depression and treat ADHD and narcolepsy.

\section*{Pathology}

Common signs and symptoms of eye disorders include decrease in visual acuity, headaches, and pain in the eye or adnexa. However, many disorders of the eye are serious but asymptomatic; therefore, regular eye checkups are necessary. For diagnosis, treatment, and management of visual disorders, the medical services of a specialist may be warranted. Ophthalmology is the medical specialty concerned with disorders of the eye. The physician who treats these disorders is called an ophthalmologist. Optometrists work with ophthalmologists in a medical practice or practice independently. Optometrists are not medical doctors, but are doctors of optometry (OD). They diagnose vision problems and eye disease, prescribe eyeglasses and contact lenses, and prescribe drugs to treat eye disorders. Although they cannot perform surgery, they commonly provide preoperative and postoperative care.

Common signs and symptoms of ear disorders include hearing impairment, ringing in the ears, pain or drainage from the ears, loss of balance, dizziness, or nausea. Young children are especially vulnerable to middle ear infections that, if not treated, may cause hearing loss. For diagnosis, treatment, and management of hearing disorders, the medical services of a specialist may be warranted. Otolaryngology is the medical specialty concerned with disorders of the ear, nose, and throat. The physician who treats these disorders is called an otolaryngologist. Many otolaryngologists employ audiologists. Audiologists are allied health-care professionals who work with patients with hearing, balance, and related problems. They perform hearing examinations, evaluate hearing loss, clean and irrigate the ear canal, fit and dispense hearing aids or other assistive devices, and provide audiological rehabilitation, including auditory training and instruction in speech or lip reading.

\section*{Eye Disorders}

Eye disorders include not only visual deficiencies associated with refractive errors, but also disorders of associated structures, such as the eye muscles, nerves, and blood vessels. A complete examination of the eye and its adnexa is necessary to identify the source of any disorder. Most ocular examinations begin by recording visual acuity (VA) and visual field (VF).Then the eyelids, pupils, cornea, and lacrimal structures are examined and intraocular pressure is assessed as well. If infection is detected, it must be located and identified by culturing eye and nasal discharges and performing
computed tomography (CT) of the sinuses. Occasionally, the patient may be referred for dental examination to determine if abscesses in the mouth are the source of infection. Family history is important because many eye disorders have a genetic predisposition, including glaucoma. Common eye disorders include errors of refraction, cataracts, glaucoma, strabismus, and macular degeneration.

\section*{Errors of Refraction}

An error of refraction (ametropia) exists when light rays fail to focus sharply on the retina. This may be due to a defect in the lens, cornea, or the shape of the eyeball. If the eyeball is too long, the image falls in front of the retina, causing nearsightedness. In farsightedness (hyperopia, hypermetropia), the opposite of myopia, the eyeball is too short and the image falls behind the retina. A form of farsightedness is presbyopia, a defect associated with the aging process. The onset of presbyopia usually occurs between ages 40 and 45.Distant objects are seen clearly, but near objects are not in proper focus. In another form of ametropia called astigmatism (Ast), the cornea or lens has a defective curvature. This curvature causes light rays to diffuse over a large area of the retina rather than being sharply focused.

Corrective lenses usually compensate for the various types of ametropia. An alternative to corrective lenses is laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) surgery. This procedure changes the shape of the cornea and, in most instances, the change is permanent. A small incision is made in the cornea to produce a flap. The flap is lifted to the side while a laser reshapes the underlying corneal tissue. At the completion of the procedure, the corneal flap is replaced. The procedure usually takes less than 15 minutes. However, not all people are candidates for this surgery. Some medical conditions, certain medications, or the shape and structure of the eye may preclude this procedure as a viable alternative to corrective lenses.

\section*{Cataracts}

Cataracts are opacities that form on the lens and impair vision. These opacities are commonly produced by protein that slowly builds up over time until vision is affected. The most common form of cataract is age related. More than one half of Americans older than age 65 have cataracts to a greater or lesser extent. Congenital cataracts found in children are usually a result of genetic defects or maternal rubella during the first trimester of pregnancy. This rare form of cataract is treated in the same manner as age-related cataract. The usual treatment is removal of the clouded lens by emulsifying it using ultrasound or a laser probe (phacoemulsification). This method is typically referred to as small incision cataract surgery (SICS)because the cataract is broken into very small particles that can be removed through the tiny incision. An artificial, bendable intraocular lens (IOL) is then inserted into the capsule. Once in position, the lens unfolds. The surgery is usually performed using a topical anesthetic, and the incision normally does not require stitches. This is one of the safest and most effective surgical procedures performed in medicine.

\section*{Glaucoma}

Glaucoma is characterized by increased intraocular pressure (IOP) caused by the failure of aqueous humor to drain from the eye through a tiny duct called the canal of Schlemm. The increased pressure on the optic nerve destroys it, and vision is permanently lost.

Although there are various forms of glaucoma, all of them eventually lead to blindness unless the condition is detected and treated in its early stages. Glaucoma may occur as a primary or congenital disease or secondary to other causes, such as injury, infection, surgery, or prolonged topical
corticosteroid use. Primary glaucoma can be chronic or acute. The chronic form is also called openangle, simple or wide-angle glaucoma. The acute form is called angle-closure or narrow angle glaucoma. Chronic glaucoma may produce no symptoms except gradual loss of peripheral vision over a period of years. Headaches, blurred vision, and dull pain in the eye may also be present. Cupping of the optic discs may be noted on ophthalmoscopic examination. Acute glaucoma is accompanied by extreme ocular pain, blurred vision, redness of the eye, and dilation of the pupil. Nausea and vomiting may also occur. If untreated, acute glaucoma causes complete and permanent blindness within 2 to 5 days.

Glaucoma is diagnosed by tonometry, a screening test that measures intraocular pressure by determining the resistance of the eyeball to indentation by an applied force. A slit lamp examination (SLE) with a high-intensity beam is used to assess the external surface and internal segments of the eye after administration of a local anesthetic. Devices such as a tonometer, which measures intraocular pressure, and a gonioscope, which visualizes the anterior chamber angle, expand the scope of the examination. Several methods of tonometry are available, but the one that is considered most accurate is applanation tonometry. Numbing drops are used and the test is pain free. Treatment for glaucoma includes medications that cause the pupils to constrict ( miotics), which permits aqueous humor to escape from the eye, thereby relieving pressure. If miotics are ineffective, surgery may be necessary.

\section*{Strabismus}

Strabismus, also called heterotropiaortropia, is a condition in which one eye is misaligned with the other and the eyes do not focus simultaneously when viewing an object. This misalignment may be in any direction-inward (esotropia),outward (exotropia),up, down, or a combination. The deviation may be a constant condition or may arise intermittently with stress, exhaustion, or illness. In normal vision, each eye views an image from a somewhat different vantage point, thus transmitting a slightly different image to the brain. The result is binocular perception of depth or three-dimensional space, a phenomenon known as stereopsis. Strabismus commonly causes a loss of stereopsis. In children, strabismus is commonly, but not always, associated with "lazy-eye syndrome" (amblyopia).Vision is suppressed in the "lazy" eye so that the child uses only the "good" eye for vision. The vision pathway fails to develop in the "lazy" eye.

There is a critical period during which amblyopia must be corrected, usually before age 6.If not detected and treated early in life, amblyopia can cause a permanent loss of vision in the affected eye, with associated loss of stereopsis. Treatment for strabismus depends on the cause. It commonly consists of covering the normal eye, forcing the child to use the deviated, or lazy, eye. Eye exercises and corrective lenses may be prescribed, or surgical correction may be necessary.

\section*{Macular Degeneration}

Macular degeneration is a deterioration of the macula, the most sensitive portion of the retina. The macula is responsible for central, or "straight-ahead," vision required for reading, driving, detail work, and recognizing faces. Although deterioration of the macula is associated with toxic effects of some drugs, the most common type is age related macular degeneration (ARMD, AMD). ARMD is a leading cause of visual loss in the United States. The disease is unpredictable and progresses differently in each individual. So far, two forms of ARMD have been identified: wet and dry. The less common, but more severe, form is wet, or neovascular ARMD. It affects about $10 \%$ of those afflicted with the disease. Small blood vessels form under the macula. Blood and other fluids leak from these vessels and destroy the visual cells, leading to severe loss of central vision and permanent visual impairment. If identified in its early stages, laser surgery can be employed to destroy the
newly forming vessels. This treatment is called laser photocoagulation. It is successful in about one half of the patients with wet ARMD. However, the effects of the procedure commonly do not last and new vessels begin to form. The more common form of the macular degeneration is dry ARMD. Small yellowish deposits called drusen develop on the macula and interfere with central vision. Drusen are dried retinal pigment epithelial cells that form granules on the macula. Although some vision is lost, this form of the disease rarely leads to total blindness. Patients with dry ARMD are encouraged to see their ophthalmologist frequently and perform a simple at-home test that identifies visual changes that may indicate the development of the more serious neovascular ARMD.

\section*{Ear Disorders}

Common signs and symptoms of ear disorders include hearing loss, earache, vertigo, and tinnitus. Hearing tests are important in diagnosing hearing loss as well as aiding in localizing the source and nature of the hearing deficiency. In addition, many infections of the nose and throat refer pain (synalgia) to the ear. Therefore, an examination of the nose and throat is usually essential in identifying the cause of ear pain. Common ear disorders include otitis media and otosclerosis.

\section*{Otitis Media}

Otitis media (OM) is an inflammation of the middle ear. This infection may be caused by a virus or bacterium. However, the most common culprit is Streptococcus pneumoniae. Otitis media is found most commonly in infants and young children, especially in the presence of an upper respiratory infection (URI). Symptoms may include earache and draining of pus from the ear (otopyorrhea).In it's most severe form, otitis media may lead to infection of the mastoid process (mastoiditis) or inflammation of brain tissue near the middle ear (otoencephalitis). Recurrent episodes of otitis media may cause scarring of the tympanic membrane, leading to hearing loss. Treatment consists of bed rest, medications to relieve pain (analgesics), and antibiotics. Occasionally, an incision of the eardrum (myringotomy, tympanotomy) may be necessary to relieve pressure and promote drainage. The usual treatment for children with recurrent infection is the use of pressure-equalizing tubes (PE tubes) that are passed through the tympanic membrane. These tubes help drain fluid from the middle ear.

\section*{Otosclerosis}

Otosclerosis is a disorder characterized by an abnormal hardening (ankylosis) of bones of the middle ear that causes hearing loss. The ossicle most commonly affected is the stapes, the bone that attaches to the oval window of the cochlea. The formation of a spongy growth at the footplate of the stapes decreases its ability to move the oval window, resulting in hearing loss. Occasionally, the patient perceives a ringing sound (tinnitus) within the ear, along with dizziness and a progressive loss of hearing, especially of low tones. Development of otosclerosis is typically closely tied to genetic factors; if one or both parents have the disorder, the child is at high risk for developing the disease. Surgical correction involves removing part of the stapes (stapedectomy or, more commonly, stapedotomy) and implanting a prosthetic device that allows sound waves to pass to the inner ear. The procedure requires only a local anesthetic and usually lasts only 45 minutes. Hearing is immediately restored.

\section*{Oncology}

Two major neoplastic diseases account for more than $90 \%$ of all primary intraocular diseases: retinoblastoma, found primarily in children, and melanoma, found primarily in adults. Most retinoblastomas tend to be familial. The cell involved is the retinal neuron. Vision is impaired and, in about $30 \%$ of patients, the disease is found in both eyes (bilateral).Melanoma may occur in the orbit;
the bony cavity of the eyeball, the iris, or the ciliary body, but it arises most commonly in the pigmented cells of the choroid. The disease is usually asymptomatic until there is a hemorrhage into the anterior chamber. Any discrete, fleshy mass on the iris should be examined by an ophthalmologist. If malignancy occurs in the choroid, it usually appears as a brown or gray mushroom-shaped lesion.

Treatment for retinoblastoma usually involves the removal of the affected eye(s) (enucleation), followed by radiation. In melanoma where the lesion is on the iris, an iridectomy is performed. For melanoma of the choroid, enucleation is necessary. Many eye tumors are noninvasive and are not necessarily life threatening.

Both malignant and nonmalignant tumors can arise in the external ear, the canal, or the middle ear. Malignant tumors of the ear include basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell tumors. The most common ear malignancy is basal cell carcinoma, which usually occurs on the top of the pinna as the result of sun exposure. It is found more commonly in elderly patients or those with fair skin. Small, craterlike ulcers form as the disease progresses. Basal cell carcinoma does not readily metastasize; however, failure to treat it in a timely manner may result in the need for extensive surgery to remove the tumor. Squamous cell carcinoma, on the other hand, is much more invasive. However, it is a very rare type of ear tumor. In appearance, it closely resembles basal cell carcinoma, and biopsy is required to make a definitive diagnosis. Squamous cell carcinoma grows more slowly than basal cell carcinoma; however, because of its tendency to metastasize to the surrounding nodes and the nodes of the neck, it must be removed. Surgery combined with radiation therapy is the most effective treatment for squamous cell carcinoma.

\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
Audiometry \\
audi/o: hearing \\
-metry: act of measuring
\end{tabular} & \begin{tabular}{l}
Measurement of hearing acuity at various sound wave frequencies. \\
In audiometry, pure tones of controlled intensity are delivered through earphones to one ear at a time while the patient indicates if the tone was heard. The minimum intensity (volume) required to hear each tone is graphed.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline caloric stimulation test & Test that uses different water temperatures to assess the vestibular portion of the nerve of the inner ear (acoustic nerve) to determine if nerve damage is the cause of vertigo. In the caloric stimulation test, cold and warm water are separately introduced into each ear while electrodes placed around the eye record nystagmus. Eyes move in a predictable pattern when the water is introduced, except with acoustic nerve damage. \\
\hline electronystagmography (ENG) & Method of assessing and recording eye movements by measuring the electrical activity of the extraocular muscles. In ENG, electrodes are placed above, below, and to the side of each eye. A ground electrode is placed on the forehead. The electrodes record eye movement relative to the position of the ground electrode. \\
\hline Ophthalmodynamometry & Measurement of the blood pressure of the retinal vessels. Ophthalmodynamometry is a screening test used to determine reduction of blood flow in the carotid artery. \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
tonometry \\

-metry: act of measuring
\end{tabular} & Evaluation of intraocular pressure by measuring the resistance of the eyeball to indentation by an applied force. Tonometry is used to detect glaucoma. Several kinds' of tonometers can be used. The applanation method of tonometry uses a sensor to depress the cornea and is considered the most accurate method of tonometry. \\
\hline visual acuity & Part of an eye examination that determines the smallest letters that can be read on a standardized chart at a distance of 20 feet Visual acuity (VA) is expressed as a fraction. The top number refers to the distance from the chart and the bottom number indicates the distance at which a person with normal eyesight could read the same line. For example 20/40 indicates that the patient correctly read letters at 20 feet that could be read by a person with normal vision at 40 feet. \\
