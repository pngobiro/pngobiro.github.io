                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The blood cells (Fig. 10-1) are <strong>erythrocytes</strong>, or red blood cells; <strong>leukocytes</strong>, or white blood cells; and <strong>platelets</strong>, also called <strong>thrombocytes</strong>. All blood cells are produced in red bone marrow. Some white blood cells multiply in lymphoid tissue as well.</p>

                        <h3>Erythrocytes</h3>
                        <p>The major function of erythrocytes is to carry oxygen to cells. This oxygen is bound to an iron-containing pigment within the cells called <strong>hemoglobin</strong>. Erythrocytes are small, disk-shaped cells with no nucleus. Their concentration of about 5 million per µL (cubic millimeter) of blood makes them by far the most numerous of the blood cells. The hemoglobin that they carry averages 15 g per deciliter (100 mL) of blood.</p>
                        <p>A red blood cell gradually wears out and dies in about 120 days, so these cells must be constantly replaced. Production of red cells in the bone marrow is regulated by the hormone <strong>erythropoietin</strong> (EPO), which is made in the kidneys.</p>

                        <h3>Leukocytes</h3>
                        <p>White blood cells all show prominent nuclei when stained. They total about 5,000 to 10,000 per µL, but their number may increase during infection. There are five different types of leukocytes, which are identified by the size and appearance of the nucleus and by their staining properties. Granular leukocytes or <strong>granulocytes</strong> have visible granules in the cytoplasm when stained; there are three types of granulocytes: neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils, named for the kind of stain they take up. <strong>Agranulocytes</strong> do not have visible granules when stained. There are two types of agranulocytes: lymphocytes and monocytes. Characteristics of the different types of white cells are given in Display 10-1.</p>

                        <p>White blood cells protect against foreign substances. Some engulf foreign material by the process of <strong>phagocytosis</strong>; others function as part of the immune system. In diagnosis it is important to know not only the total number of leukocytes but also the relative number of each type because these numbers can change in different disease conditions. The most numerous white blood cells, neutrophils, are called <em>polymorphs</em> because of their various-shaped nuclei. They are also referred to as <em>segs</em>, <em>polys</em>, or <em>PMNs</em> (polymorphonuclear leukocytes). A <strong>band cell</strong>, also called a <em>stab</em> or <em>staff</em> cell, is an immature neutrophil with a solid curved nucleus (Fig. 10-2). Large numbers of band cells in the blood indicate an active infection.</p>

                            <h4 class="callout-title"><span class="callout-icon">ℹ️</span> Box 10-1 Acronyms</h4>
                            <p>Acronyms are abbreviations that use the first letters of the words in a name or phrase. They have become very popular because they save time and space in writing as the number and complexity of technical terms increases. Some examples that apply to studies of the blood are CBC (complete blood count), RBC, and WBD for blood cells. Some other common acronyms are CNS (central nervous system), ECG (electrocardiograph), NIH (National Institutes of Health), and STD (sexually transmitted disease).</p>
                            <p>If the acronym has vowels and lends itself to pronunciation, it may be used as a word in itself, such as AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome); ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay); JAMA (<em>Journal of the American Medical Association</em>); NSAID (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent), pronounced "en-sayd"; and CABG (coronary artery bypass graft), which inevitably becomes "cabbage." Few people even know that LASER is an acronym that means "light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation."</p>
                            <p>An acronym usually is introduced the first time a phrase appears in an article and is then used without explanation. If you have spent time searching back through an article in frustration for the meaning of an acronym, you probably wish, as does this author, that all the acronyms used and their meanings would be listed at the beginning of each article.</p>

                        <h3>Platelets</h3>
                        <p>The blood platelets (thrombocytes) are fragments of larger cells formed in the bone marrow. They number from 200,000 to 400,000 per µL of blood. Platelets are important in <strong>hemostasis</strong>, the prevention of blood loss, a component of which is the process of blood clotting, also known as <strong>coagulation</strong>.</p>
                        <p>When a vessel is injured, platelets stick together to form a plug at the site. Substances released from the platelets and from damaged tissue then interact with clotting factors in the plasma to produce a wound-sealing clot. Clotting factors are inactive in the blood until an injury occurs. To protect against unwanted clot formation, 12 different factors must interact before blood coagulates. The final reaction is the conversion of <strong>fibrinogen</strong> to threads of <strong>fibrin</strong> that trap blood cells and plasma to produce the clot (Fig. 10-3). What remains of the plasma after blood coagulates is <strong>serum</strong>.</p>

                        <p>Genetically inherited proteins on the surface of red blood cells determine blood type. More than 20 groups of these proteins have now been identified, but the most familiar are the ABO and Rh blood groups. The ABO system includes types A, B, AB, and O. The Rh types are Rh positive (Rh+) and Rh negative (Rh−). In giving blood transfusions, it is important to use blood that is the same type as the recipient's blood or a type to which the recipient will not show an immune reaction, as described below. Compatible blood types are determined by <strong>cross-matching</strong>, as illustrated in Figure 10-4. Whole blood may be used to replace a large volume of blood lost, but in most cases requiring blood transfusion, a blood fraction such as packed red cells, platelets, plasma, or specific clotting factors is administered.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">The Immune System</h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Our bodies have an array of defenses against foreign matter. Some of these defenses are nonspecific, that is, they protect against any intruder. Such defenses include the unbroken skin, blood-filtering lymphoid tissue, cilia and mucus that trap foreign material, bactericidal body secretions, and reflexes such as coughing and sneezing.</p>
                        <p>Specific attacks on disease organisms are mounted by the immune system. The immune response involves complex interactions between components of the lymphatic system and the blood. Any foreign particle may act as an <strong>antigen</strong>, that is, a substance that provokes a response by the immune system. This response comes from two types of lymphocytes that circulate in the blood and lymphatic system. One type, the <strong>T cells</strong> (T lymphocytes), mature in the thymus gland. They are capable of attacking a foreign cell directly, producing <em>cell-mediated immunity</em>. <strong>Macrophages</strong>, descendants of monocytes, are important in the function of T cells.</p>
                        <p>Macrophages take in and process foreign antigens. A T cell is activated when it contacts an antigen on the surface of a macrophage in combination with some of the body's own proteins.</p>
                        <p>The <strong>B cells</strong> (B lymphocytes) mature in lymphoid tissue. When they meet a foreign antigen, they multiply rapidly, transforming into <strong>plasma cells</strong>. These cells produce <strong>antibodies</strong>, also called <strong>immunoglobulins</strong> (Ig), that inactivate an antigen (Fig. 10-5). Antibodies remain in the blood, often providing long-term immunity to the specific organism against which they were formed. Antibody-based immunity is referred to as <em>humoral immunity</em>.</p>

                        <h3>Types of Immunity</h3>
                        <p>Passive immunity involves the transfer of antibodies to an individual either naturally, through the placenta or mother's milk, or artificially, by the administration of an immune serum. Active immunity involves the individual's own response to a disease organism, either through natural contact with the organism or by the administration of an artificially prepared vaccine.</p>
                        <p>Immunology has long been a very active area of research. The above description is only the barest outline of the events that are known to occur in the immune response, and there is much still to be discovered. Some of the areas of research include autoimmune diseases, in which an individual produces antibodies to his or her own body tissues; hereditary and acquired immune deficiency diseases; the relationship between cancer and immunity; and the development of techniques for avoiding rejection of transplanted tissue.</p>

                        <h3>Anemia</h3>
                        <p><strong>Anemia</strong> is defined as a decrease in the amount of hemoglobin in the blood. Anemia may result from too few red blood cells, cells that are too small, or too little hemoglobin in the cells. Cells may be normal in size (normocytic) or abnormal (microcytic or macrocytic), and they may be normal in hemoglobin (normochromic) or have too little (hypochromic). Key tests in diagnosing anemia are blood counts, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) (Display 10-2). The general symptoms of anemia include fatigue, shortness of breath, heart palpitations, pallor, and irritability. There are many different types of anemia, some of which are caused by underproduction of red cells, others by loss or destruction of cells.</p>
                        <p><strong>Aplastic anemia</strong> results from destruction of the bone marrow and affects all blood cells (pancytopenia). It may be caused by drugs, toxins, viruses, radiation, or bone marrow cancer.

                        <p>Nutritional anemia may result from a deficiency of vitamin B<sub>12</sub>, folic acid (a B vitamin), or most commonly, iron. A specific form of B<sub>12</sub> deficiency is <strong>pernicious anemia</strong>. This results from the lack of a substance produced in the stomach, <strong>intrinsic factor</strong> (IF), which aids in the absorption of this vitamin from the intestine. Pernicious anemia must be treated with regular injections of B<sub>12</sub>. Folic acid deficiency commonly appears in those with poor diet, in pregnant and lactating women, and in those who abuse alcohol. Iron-deficiency anemia result from poor diet, poor absorption of iron, and blood loss. Both folic acid deficiency and iron deficiency respond to dietary supplementation.</p>
                        <p>In <strong>sideroblastic anemia</strong>, there is adequate iron available, but the iron is not used properly to manufacture hemoglobin. This disorder may be hereditary or acquired, as by exposure to toxins or drugs, or as secondary to another disease. The excess iron precipitates out in immature red cells (normoblasts).</p>
                        <p>Hemorrhagic anemia results from blood loss. This may be a sudden loss, as from injury, or loss from chronic internal bleeding, as from the digestive tract in cases of ulcers or cancer.</p>
                        <p>Several hereditary diseases cause hemolysis (rupture) of red cells, resulting in anemia. <strong>Thalassemia</strong> appears in Mediterranean populations. It affects the production of hemoglobin and is designated as α (alpha) or β (beta), according to the part of the molecule affected. Severe β thalassemia is also called Cooley anemia. In <strong>sickle cell anemia</strong>, a mutation alters the hemoglobin molecule so that it precipitates when it gives up oxygen and distorts the red blood cells into a crescent shape (Fig. 10-7). The altered cells block small blood vessels and deprive tissues of oxygen, an episode termed <em>sickle cell crisis</em>. The misshapen cells are also readily destroyed (hemolyzed). The disease predominates in black populations. Genetic carriers of the defect, those with one normal and one abnormal gene, show sickle cell trait. They usually have no symptoms, except when oxygen is low, such as at high altitudes. They can, however, pass the defective gene to offspring. Sickle cell anemia, as well as many other genetic diseases, can be diagnosed in carriers and in the fetus before birth.</p>
                        <p>Reticulocyte counts are useful in diagnosing the causes of anemia. Reticulocytes are immature red blood cells that normally appear in a small percentage in the blood. An increase in the number of reticulocytes indicates increased red blood cell formation, as in response to hemorrhage or destruction of red cells. A decrease indicates a failure in red blood cell production, as caused by nutritional deficiency or aplastic anemia.</p>

                        <h3>Coagulation Disorders</h3>
                        <p>The most common cause of coagulation problems is a deficiency in the number of circulating platelets, a condition termed <strong>thrombocytopenia</strong>. Possible causes include aplastic anemia, infections, cancer of the bone marrow, or agents that destroy bone marrow, such as x-rays or certain drugs. This disorder results in bleeding into the skin and mucous membranes, variously described as <strong>petechiae</strong>, <strong>ecchymoses</strong>, and <strong>purpura</strong>.</p>
                        <p>In <strong>disseminated intravascular coagulation</strong> (DIC) there is widespread clotting in the vessels, which obstructs circulation to the tissues. This is followed by diffuse hemorrhages as clotting factors are removed and the coagulation process is impaired. DIC may result from a variety of causes, including infection, cancer, hemorrhage, injury, or allergy.</p>
                        <p><strong>Hemophilia</strong> is a hereditary deficiency of a specific clotting factor. It is a sex-linked disease that is passed from mother to son. There is bleeding into the tissues, especially into the joints (hemarthrosis). Hemophilia must be treated with transfusions of the necessary clotting factor.</p>

                        <h3>Neoplasms</h3>
                        <p><strong>Leukemia</strong> is a neoplasm of white blood cells. The rapidly dividing but incompetent white cells accumulate in the tissues and crowd out the other blood cells. The symptoms of leukemia include anemia, fatigue, easy bleeding, <strong>splenomegaly</strong>, and sometimes hepatomegaly (enlargement of the liver). Myelogenous leukemia originates in the bone marrow and involves mainly the granular leukocytes. Lymphocytic leukemia affects B cells and the lymphatic system, causing lymphadenopathy and adverse effects on the immune system.</p>
                        <p>Leukemias are further differentiated as acute or chronic based on clinical progress. The acute forms of leukemia are acute lymphoblastic (lymphocytic) leukemia (ALL) and acute myeloblastic (myelogenous) leukemia (AML). Acute leukemia is the most common form of cancer in young children. With treatment, remission rate is high for ALL, but the prognosis in AML is poor for both children and adults. Chronic granulocytic leukemia, also called chronic myelogenous leukemia, affects young to middle-aged adults. Most cases show the <strong>Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)</strong>, an inherited anomaly in which part of chromosome 22 shifts to chromosome 9. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) appears mostly in the elderly and is the most slowly growing form of the disease.</p>
                        <p>The causes of leukemia are unknown but may include exposure to radiation or harmful chemicals, hereditary factors, and perhaps virus infection.</p>
                        <p>Treatment of leukemia includes chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and bone marrow transplantation. One advance in transplantation is the use of umbilical cord blood to replace blood-forming cells in bone marrow. This blood is more readily available than bone marrow and does not have to match as closely to avoid rejection.</p>
                        <p><strong>Hodgkin disease</strong> is a disease of the lymphatic system that may spread to other tissues. It begins with enlarged but painless lymph nodes in the cervical (neck) region and then progresses to other nodes. A feature of Hodgkin disease is giant cells in the lymph nodes called <strong>Reed-Sternberg cells</strong> (Fig. 10-8). There are fever, night sweats, weight loss, and itching of the skin (pruritus). Persons of any age may be affected, but the disease predominates in young adults and those over age 50. Most cases can be cured with radiation and chemotherapy.</p>

                        <p><strong>Non-Hodgkin lymphoma</strong> (NHL) is also a malignant enlargement of lymph nodes but does not show Reed-Sternberg cells. It is more common than Hodgkin disease and has a higher mortality rate. Cases vary in severity and prognosis. It is most prevalent in the older adult population and in those with AIDS and other forms of immunodeficiency. NHL involves the T or B lymphocytes, and some cases may be related to infection with certain viruses. It requires systemic chemotherapy and, sometimes, bone marrow transplantation.</p>
                        <p><strong>Multiple myeloma</strong> is a cancer of the blood-forming cells in bone marrow, mainly the plasma cells that produce antibodies. The disease causes anemia, bone pain, and weakening of the bones. There is a greater susceptibility to infection because of immune deficiency. Abnormally high levels of calcium and protein in the blood often lead to kidney failure. Multiple myeloma is treated with radiation and chemotherapy, but the prognosis is generally poor.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p><strong>Hypersensitivity</strong> is a harmful overreaction of the immune system, commonly known as <strong>allergy</strong>. In cases of allergy, a person is more sensitive to a particular antigen than the average individual. Common <strong>allergens</strong> are pollen, animal dander, dust, and foods, but there are many more. A seasonal allergy to inhaled pollens is commonly called "hay fever." Responses may include itching, redness or tearing of the eyes (conjunctivitis), skin rash, asthma, runny nose (rhinitis), sneezing, <strong>urticaria</strong> (hives), and <strong>angioedema</strong>, a reaction similar to hives but involving deeper layers of tissue.</p>
                        <p>An <strong>anaphylactic reaction</strong> is a severe generalized allergic response that can lead rapidly to death as a result of shock and respiratory distress. It must be treated by immediate administration of <strong>epinephrine</strong> (adrenaline), maintenance of open airways, and antihistamines. Common causes of anaphylaxis are drugs, especially penicillin and other antibiotics, vaccines, diagnostic chemicals, foods, and insect venom.</p>
                        <p>A <strong>delayed hypersensitivity reaction</strong> involves T cells and takes at least 12 hours to develop. A common example is the reaction to contact with plant irritants such as those of poison ivy and poison oak.</p>
                        <p>The term <strong>immunodeficiency</strong> refers to any failure in the immune system. This may be congenital (present at birth) or acquired and may involve any components of the system. The deficiency may vary in severity but is always evidenced by an increased susceptibility to disease.</p>
                        <p><strong>AIDS</strong> is acquired by infection with HIV, which attacks certain T cells. These cells have a specific surface attachment site, the CD4 receptor, for the virus. HIV is spread by sexual contact, use of contaminated needles, blood transfusions, and passage from an infected mother to a fetus. It leaves the host susceptible to opportunistic infections such as pneumonia caused by the protozoon <em>Pneumocystis carinii</em>; thrush, a fungal infection of the mouth caused by <em>Candida albicans</em>; and infection with <em>Cryptosporidium</em>, a protozoon that causes cramps and diarrhea. It also predisposes to <strong>Kaposi sarcoma</strong>, a once-rare form of skin cancer. It may also induce autoimmunity or attack the nervous system.</p>
                        <p>AIDS is diagnosed and followed by <strong>CD4+ T lymphocyte counts</strong>, which measure the number of cells that have the HIV receptor. A count of less than 200/µL of blood signifies severe immunodeficiency. Antibody levels to HIV and direct viral counts in the blood are also used to track the course of the disease. At present there is no vaccine or cure for AIDS, but some drugs can delay progress of the disease.</p>
                        <p>A disease that results from an immune response to one's own tissues is classified as an <strong>autoimmune disorder</strong>. The cause may be a failure in the immune system or a reaction to body cells that have been slightly altered by mutation or disease. The list of diseases that are believed to be caused, at least in part, by autoimmunity is long. Some, such as <strong>systemic lupus erythematosus</strong> (SLE), <strong>systemic sclerosis</strong> (scleroderma), and <strong>Sjögren syndrome</strong>, affect tissues in multiple systems. Others target more specific organs or systems. Examples are pernicious anemia, rheumatoid arthritis, Graves disease (of the thyroid), myasthenia gravis (a muscle disease), fibromyalgia syndrome (a musculoskeletal disorder), rheumatic heart disease, and glomerulonephritis (a kidney disease). These diseases are discussed in more detail in other chapters.</p>

                        <h3>Case Study 10-1: Latex Allergy</h3>
                        <p>M.R., a 36-year-old certified registered nurse anesthetist (CRNA), was diagnosed 7 years ago with latex allergy. She first noticed that she developed contact dermatitis when she wore powdered latex gloves. She soon developed tachycardia, hypotension, bronchospasm, urticaria, and rhinitis with contact or proximity to latex in surgery. She had one frightening episode of anaphylaxis. Her allergy is of the type I hypersensitivity, IgE T-cell-mediated latex allergy, which was diagnosed by both a radioallergosorbent test (RAST) and a skin-prick test.</p>
                        <p>M.R. avoids all contact with any natural rubber latex in her home and at work. She can only work in a pediatric OR because they are latex-free, since many children with congenital disorders are latex allergic. She wears a medical alert bracelet, uses a bronchodilator inhaler at the first symptom of bronchospasm, and carries a syringe of epinephrine at all times.</p>

                        <h3>Case Study 10-2: Blood Replacement</h3>
                        <p>C.L., a 16-year-old girl, sustained a ruptured liver when she hit a tree while sledding. Emergency surgery was needed to stop the internal bleeding. During surgery, the ruptured segment of the liver was removed and the laceration was sutured with a heavy, absorbable suture on a large smooth needle. Before surgery, her hemoglobin was 10.2 g/dL, but the reading decreased to 7.6 g/dL before hemostasis was attained. Cell salvage, or autotransfusion, was set up. In this procedure, the free blood was suctioned from her abdomen and mixed with an anticoagulant (heparin). The RBCs were washed in a sterile centrifuge with NSS and transfused back to her through tubing fitted with a filter. She also received 6 units of homologous, leukocyte-reduced whole blood, 5 units of fresh frozen plasma, and 2 units of platelets. During the surgery, the CRNA repeatedly tested her Hgb and Hct as well as prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time to monitor her clotting mechanisms.</p>
                        <p>C.L. is B positive. Fortunately, there was enough B-positive blood in the hospital blood bank for her surgery. The lab informed her surgeon that they had 2 units of B-negative and 6 units of O-negative blood, which she could have received safely if she needed more blood during the night. However, her hemoglobin level increased to 12 g/dL, and she was stable during her recovery. She was monitored for DIC and pulmonary emboli.</p>

                        <h3>Case Study 10-3: Myelofibrosis</h3>
                        <p>A.Y., a 52-year-old kindergarten teacher, had myelofibrosis that had been in remission for 25 years. She had seen her hematologist regularly and had had routine blood testing since the age of 27. After several weeks of fatigue, idiopathic joint and muscle aching, weakness, and a frightening episode of syncope, she saw her hematologist for evaluation. Her hemoglobin was 9.0 g/dL and her hematocrit was 29%. Concerned that she was having an exacerbation, her doctor scheduled a bone marrow aspiration, and the results were positive for myelofibrosis.</p>
                        <p>A.Y. went through a 6-month therapy regimen of iron supplements in the form of ferrous sulfate tablets and received weekly vitamin B<sub>12</sub> injections. Interferon was given every other week in addition to erythropoiesis therapy, which was unsuccessful. She was treated for presumed aplastic anemia. During treatment, she developed splenomegaly, which compromised her abdominal organs and pulmonary function. She continued to lose weight, and her hemoglobin dropped as low as 6.0 g/dL. Weekly transfusions of packed RBCs did not improve her hemoglobin and hematocrit.</p>
                        <p>After a regimen of high-dose chemotherapy to shrink the fibers in her bone marrow and a splenectomy, A.Y. received a stem cell transplant. The stems cells were obtained from blood donated by her brother, who was a perfect immunologic match. After a 6-month period of recovery in a protected environment, required because of her immunocompromised state, A.Y. returned home and has been free of disease symptoms for over 1 year.</p>
