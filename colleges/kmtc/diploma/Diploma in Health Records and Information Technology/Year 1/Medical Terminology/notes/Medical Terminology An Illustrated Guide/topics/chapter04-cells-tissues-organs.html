                        <p>The body can be studied from its simplest to its most complex level, beginning with the cell, the basic unit of living organisms (Fig. 4-1). Cells carry out <strong>metabolism</strong>, the sum of all of the physical and chemical activities that occur in the body. Providing the energy for metabolic reactions is the chemical <strong>ATP</strong> (adenosine triphosphate), commonly described as the energy compound of the cell. The main categories of organic compounds in the body are:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li><strong>Proteins</strong>, which include the enzymes, some hormones, and structural materials.</li>
                            <li><strong>Carbohydrates</strong>, which include sugars and starches. The main carbohydrate is the sugar glucose, which circulates in the blood to provide energy for the cells.</li>
                            <li><strong>Lipids</strong>, which include fats. Some hormones are derived from lipids, and adipose (fat) tissue is designed to store lipids.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Within the <strong>cytoplasm</strong> that fills the cell are subunits called organelles, each with a specific function. The main cell structures are named and described in Display 4-1.</p>
                        
                        <figure>

                        <p>All body functions derive from the activities of billions of specialized cells. The <strong>nucleus</strong> is the control region of the cell. It contains the <strong>chromosomes</strong>, which carry genetic information (Fig. 4-2). Each human cell, except for the sex cells, contains 46 chromosomes. The chromosomes are composed of a complex organic substance, <strong>DNA</strong> (deoxyribonucleic acid), which is organized into separate units called <strong>genes</strong>. Genes control the formation of <strong>enzymes</strong>, the catalysts needed for metabolic reactions. To help manufacture enzymes, the cells use a compound called <strong>RNA</strong> (ribonucleic acid), which is chemically related to DNA.</p>

                        <p>Cells are organized into four basic types of <strong>tissues</strong> that perform specific functions (Fig. 4-4)</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Epithelial (<em>ep-i-THĒ-lē-al</em>) tissue covers and protects body structures and lines organs, vessels, and cavities.</li>
                            <li>Connective tissue supports and binds body structures. It contains fibers and other nonliving material between the cells. Included are adipose (fat) tissue, cartilage, bone (Chapter 19), and blood (Chapter 10).</li>
                            <li>Muscle tissue (root <em>my/o</em>) contracts to produce movement. There are three types of muscle tissue:
                                <ul style="list-style-type: circle; margin-left: 1rem;">
                                    <li>Skeletal or voluntary muscle moves the skeleton. Skeletal muscle is discussed in greater detail in Chapter 20.</li>
                                    <li>Cardiac muscle forms the heart. It functions without conscious control and is described as involuntary.</li>
                                    <li>Smooth, or visceral, muscle forms the walls of the abdominal organs; it is also involuntary.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>Nervous tissue (root <em>neur/o</em>) makes up the brain, spinal cord, and nerves. It coordinates and controls body responses by the transmission of electrical impulses. The nervous system and senses are discussed in Chapters 17 and 18.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The simplest tissues are membranes. Mucous membranes secrete <strong>mucus</strong>, a thick fluid that lubricates surfaces and protects underlying tissue. Serous membranes, which secrete a thin, watery fluid, line body cavities and cover organs.</p>

                        <p>Tissues are arranged into organs, which serve specific functions (Fig. 4-5). The organs, in turn, are grouped into systems. Each of the body systems is discussed in Part 3. Bear in mind, however, that the body functions as a whole—no system is independent of the others. They work together to maintain the body's state of internal stability, termed <strong>homeostasis</strong>.</p>

                            <p>Biopsy is the removal and examination of living tissue to determine a diagnosis. The term is also applied to the specimen itself. Biopsy comes from the Greek word <em>bios</em>, meaning "life," plus <em>opsis</em>, meaning "vision." Together they mean the visualization of living tissue.</p>
                            <p>Some other terms that apply to cells and tissues come from Latin. <em>In vivo</em> means "in the living body," as contrasted with <em>in vitro</em>, which literally means "in glass" and refers to procedures and experiments done in the laboratory, as compared with studies done in living organisms. <em>In situ</em> means "in its original place," and is used to refer to tumors that have not spread.</p>
                            <p><em>In toto</em> means "whole" or "completely," as in referring to a structure or organ removed totally from the body. <em>Postmortem</em> literally means "after death," as in referring to an autopsy performed to determine the cause of death.</p>
                        </aside>

                        <p>The roots in Table 4-2 are often combined with a simple noun suffix (<em>-in</em>, <em>-y</em>, or <em>-ia</em>) or an adjective suffix (<em>-ic</em>) and used as word endings. Such combined forms that routinely appear as word endings will simply be described and used as suffixes in this book. Examples from the above list are <em>-trophy</em>, <em>-plasia</em>, <em>-tropin</em>, <em>-philic</em>, <em>-genic</em>.</p>

                        <p>J.E. had a blood test as required for preoperative anesthesia assessment in preparation for scheduled plastic surgery on her breasts. The report read as follows:</p>

                        <p>The surgeon reviewed these results and concluded that they were within normal limits (WNL).</p>

                        <h3>Case Study 4-2: Pathology Laboratory Tests</h3>
                        <p>R.C., the manager of the clinical and pathology laboratory, received several surgical specimens taken from a 26-year-old female patient with a 4-week history of nonspecific pelvic pain. The specimens included several small containers of pink-tinged cloudy fluid labeled <em>pelvic lavage</em> (washing) for <em>cytology</em>, which R.C. took to the cytology laboratory to be made into slides and checked microscopically for abnormal cells. R.C. also received a tissue specimen labeled <em>uterine myoma</em>, a wedge biopsy of right ovarian neoplasm, and four jars each labeled <em>pelvic lymph nodes</em>. She took all of the tissue specimens to the pathology laboratory for gross and microscopic evaluation. A test tube half-filled with a cloudy gel and a cotton-tipped applicator labeled <em>swab of pelvic fluid for culture and sensitivity and Gram stain</em> was taken to the microbiology laboratory to be streaked on a culture plate and incubated to look for growth. Any organisms that grew out would be Gram-stained and tested for sensitivity to antibiotics that might be used in treatment.</p>
                        <p>The laboratory form was accompanied by a surgeon's note stating that the patient's preoperative diagnosis was cervical dysplasia with atypical cells and a positive urine leukocyte esterase, indicating a urinary tract infection. R.C. placed a copy of the laboratory forms and surgeon's note on the desk of the pathologist who was involved in carcinogenesis (cancer) research.</p>
