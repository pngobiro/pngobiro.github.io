                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h4>Primary level prevention</h4>
                        <p>Here the goal is to protect healthy people from developing a disease or experiencing an injury in the first place. For example:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>education about good nutrition, the importance of regular exercise, and the dangers of tobacco, alcohol and other drugs</li>
                            <li>education and legislation about proper seatbelt and helmet use</li>
                            <li>regular exams and screening tests to monitor risk factors for illness</li>
                            <li>immunization against infectious disease</li>
                            <li>controlling potential hazards at home and in the workplace</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Secondary level prevention</h4>
                        <p>These interventions happen after an illness or serious risk factors have already been diagnosed. The goal is to halt or slow the progress of disease (if possible) in its earliest stages; in the case of injury, goals include limiting long-term disability and preventing re-injury. For example:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>telling people to take daily, low-dose aspirin to prevent a first or second heart attack or stroke</li>
                            <li>recommending regular exams and screening tests in people with known risk factors for illness</li>
                            <li>providing suitably modified work for injured workers</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Tertiary level prevention</h4>
                        <p>This focuses on helping people manage complicated, long-term health problems such as diabetes, heart disease, cancer and chronic musculoskeletal pain. The goals include preventing further physical deterioration and maximizing quality of life. For example:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>cardiac or stroke rehabilitation programs</li>
                            <li>chronic pain management programs</li>
                            <li>patient support groups</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>Prevention is the first line of defense against disease. At least 8 preventive techniques are available for disease prevention:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li><strong>Exclusion</strong> - of causative agents of disease from specific geographic areas, or quarantine.</li>
                            <li><strong>Control methods</strong> - such as immunization, environmental control, and chemical agents to protect specific animal populations from endemic diseases, diseases normally present in an area.</li>
                            <li><strong>The mass education</strong> - of people about disease prevention.</li>
                            <li><strong>Early diagnosis</strong> - of illness among members of an animal population is important so that disease manifestations do not become too severe and so that affected animals can be more easily managed and treated.</li>
                            <li><strong>Recognition</strong> - of the relationship among high risk population</li>
                            <li><strong>Health protection measures</strong> - and the second group is the health promotion measures. The two approaches are complementary and interactive, and it is unlikely that one would be effective without the other. A third group of measures include preventive health services.</li>
                            <li><strong>Health promotion measures</strong> - include activities that individuals and communities can use to promote healthy life style. For example: public education programs, health warning labels, advertising and marketing, and media portrayals.</li>

Each Strategic Direction guides actions that will demonstrably improve health. Together, the Strategic Directions create the web needed to fully support in leading longer and healthier lives.</p>
                        <p><strong>The four Strategic Directions are:</strong></p>

                        <span class="heading-text">The Challenges to Disease Prevention</span>
                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h4>Political challenges</h4>
                        <p>The scope for the prevention of diseases is enormous. There will be scope for prevention of all types and at all levels, and much of this will require political change. Widespread disease and death still occur in many countries which don't have a clean and plentiful water supply. Wars and armed conflict have hindered or destroyed the development of basic infrastructure in many parts of the world. Worldwide, it is evident that measures at government level will yield the greatest gains.</p>

                        <h4>Specific challenges</h4>
                        <p>Many of these are clinical or individual challenges. This may include the barriers to prevention.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Taxation and cost issues</h4>
                        <p>Consumption may fall so much that total revenue from that source falls. This can be politically challenging with industry concerned about economic damage. Most interventions have costs and do not have the advantages of revenue generation associated with, for example, taxation on tobacco. This includes screening programmes or advertising campaigns.</p>

                        <h4>Demographic issues</h4>
                        <p>A growing elderly population puts more strain on health and social services. A significant number of people now spend a quarter of their lives as pensioners retired from working life.</p>

                        <h4>Personal barriers</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Cost and quality</li>
                            <li>Information</li>
                            <li>Exercise</li>
                            <li>Social, educational and cultural barriers</li>
