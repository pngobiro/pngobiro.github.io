                                    <li>statistical information is best presented as rates or ratios for comparison</li>

                                <li><strong>Community situated</strong> -begins with a research topic of practical relevance to the community (as opposed to individual scholars) and is carried out in community settings.</li>
                                <li><strong>Collaborative and partnership</strong> -community members and researchers equitably share control of the research agenda through active and reciprocal involvement in the research design, implementation and dissemination.</li>
                                <li><strong>Knowledge and action-oriented</strong> -the process and results are useful to community members in making positive social change and to promote social equity.</li>
                                <li>Recognizes community as a unit of identity</li>
                                <li>Builds on strengths and resources within the community</li>
                                <li>Involves long term commitment by all partners</li>

                            <ul style="list-style-type: circle; margin-left: 20px;">
                                <li><strong>Mapping</strong> - Take a group on a walk through the community, and let them draw a map of the area. Let the map include communal facilities, personal and family buildings, assets and liabilities.</li>
                                <li><strong>Models</strong> - If the community members add sticks and stones to a map scratched onto the ground, they are making a simple model: a three dimensional map. As you watch them, note if some facilities are made before others, if some are larger in proportion than others. This will give you some insight into what issues may be more important than others to the participants. Maps and models can later lead to transect walks, in which greater detail is recorded</li>
                                <li><strong>Community Inventory</strong> - The process of making the community inventory is sometimes called semi structured interviewing. It assesses the strengths and weaknesses of the community. Your job is not to create the inventory, but to guide the community members to construct it as a group.</li>
                                <li><strong>Focus group discussion</strong> - FGD is useful to collect a range of sensitive information from the community members. It involves about 8 participants. There will be a facilitator to moderate the discussion and there will be a note taker. People sit in a semicircular manner.</li>
                                <li><strong>Preference ranking</strong> - A community may have many issues that they need to address. Preference ranking will enable them select the most important issue to address</li>
                                <li><strong>Wealth ranking</strong> - This is a method of making the community categorize poverty and wealth. The following questions may be used: Who is perceived to be poor? Who is perceived to be wealthy?</li>
