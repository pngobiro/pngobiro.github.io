                        <p><strong>What is a problem?</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Problems are opportunities to make some good things happen. If it weren't for problems, what would be our motivation to create change?</li>
                            <li>Problems are also challenges. They call upon the best of our abilities, and ask us to go beyond what we thought we could do. They make life interesting, and, at least sometimes, fun. Without problems, life could be pretty boring.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Problem solving process:</strong></p>

                        <h4>Step 1 - Problem Definition</h4>
                        <p>Before you are ready to take any steps to solve the problem, you first have to be sure that you are clear about what the problem really is. It can be easy to get distracted by solving a different problem than what is actually causing distress if it is easier than dealing with the real problem. This step involves thinking about the following questions:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>How is the current situation different from what I actually want it to be?</li>
                            <li>What do I actually want, or how do I actually want things to be?</li>
                            <li>What is preventing me from achieving my goals, or from things being the way I want them to be?</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Step 2 - Problem Analysis</h4>
                        <p>Once you have defined the problem, you need to think about it from different perspectives to insure that you understand all the dimensions of the problem. The following questions can be useful to help you analyze the problem.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>How is this problem affecting me?</li>
                            <li>How is this problem affecting other people?</li>
                            <li>Who else is experiencing this problem?</li>
                            <li>How do other people deal with this problem?</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h4>STEP 3 - Establish your goals</h4>
                        <p>Once you have looked at the problem from different perspectives, you can decide what you want to achieve and establish your goals. You need to answer the very specific question - "What is my immediate goal?"</p>
                        <p>Examples:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Improve my time management skills</li>
                            <li>Complete assignments on time</li>
                            <li>Improve my grades</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>STEP 4 - Generate possible solutions</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>During this stage the goal is to generate as many possible solutions as you can.</li>
                            <li>Do not worry about whether or not they are realistic, practical, or effective.</li>
                            <li>Be sure to write down all the possibilities you generate so that you can approach this task systematically.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>STEP 5 - Analyze the solutions</h4>
                        <p>During this stage, you will examine each alternative and write down both the advantages and disadvantages to each. Some considerations to keep in mind include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Is it relevant to my situation?</li>
                            <li>Is it realistic?</li>
                            <li>Is it manageable?</li>
                            <li>What are the consequences - both good and bad?</li>
                            <li>What is the likelihood that it is going to help me reach my goal?</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4>STEP 6 - Implementation</h4>
                        <p>The last step is to implement the solution you have chosen. This step involves identification of all the steps necessary to implement it, and also on-going monitoring of the effectiveness of the solution to make sure that it actually solved the problem. During this stage of the process, ask yourself the following questions:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>How effective is the solution?</li>
                            <li>Did it achieve what I wanted?</li>
                            <li>What consequences (good and bad) did it have in my situation?</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3>What are communicable diseases?</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>A communicable disease such as a cold is a disease that spreads from person to person. Its also known as infectious or contagious.</li>
                            <li>Communicable diseases are diseases that you can "catch" from someone or something else.</li>
                            <li>Some people may use the words contagious or infectious when talking about communicable diseases.</li>
                            <li>Communicable diseases spread from one person to another or from an animal to a person. The spread often happens via airborne viruses or bacteria, but also through blood or other bodily fluid.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Examples of communicable disease are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>HIV/AIDS</li>
                            <li>Influenza</li>
                            <li>Malaria</li>
                            <li>Polio</li>
                            <li>Tuberculosis</li>
                            <li>Hepatitis</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>What are germs?</h3>
                        <p>Germs are tiny organisms (living things) that may cause disease. Germs are so small and sneaky that they creep into our body without being noticed. In fact, germs are so tiny that you need to use a microscope to see them. We don't know what hit us until we have symptoms (runny nose, cough, sore throat, fever, etc.)</p>
                        <p>Germs are microbes. A microbe is a tiny living organism that can only be seen with a microscope. Microbes are the smallest form of life on Earth. Although some microbes can make you sick or may even kill you, most are harmless, and some are extremely helpful. Microbes can be found virtually anywhere - in air, water, plants, animals and humans. A Germ is a microorganism that causes disease. Germs are also known as pathogens.</p>
                        <p>Broad example of germs are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Bacteria</strong> - are everywhere. They live in sub-freezing cold temperatures and boiling hot temperatures. They live up high in the sky and down deep below the ocean. In fact scientists have found colonies of bacteria thriving 1,600 feet below sea level without oxygen or sunlight. Scientists also think there are signs of microbial life on Mars! Some bacteria are harmful but most are harmless or even helpful.</li>
                            <li><strong>Viruses</strong> - depend upon a host to survive, grow, and reproduce. A host is the plant or animal on which or in in which another organism lives. Viruses can't live outside of other living cells. Once they are inside the body, viruses can spread and make people sick. They reproduce by injecting their genes into a cell to produce thousands of new viruses. Viruses cause chicken pox, measles, flu, and many other diseases.</li>
                            <li><strong>Fungi</strong> - are multi-celled plant-like organisms. Unlike other plants, fungi aren't able to produce their own food from soil, water, and air. Instead, fungi get their nutrition from plants, food, and animals. Fungi thrive in warm, damp environments. Most fungi are not dangerous. An example of something caused by fungi is athlete's foot - that itchy rash that teens and adults sometimes get between their toes.</li>
                            <li><strong>Protozoa</strong> - are one-celled organisms like bacteria. Protozoa also love moisture and often spread diseases through contaminated water. Some protozoa cause intestinal infections.</li>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The epidemiologic triangle or triad is the traditional model of infectious disease causation. It has 3 components:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>External agent</li>
                            <li>Susceptible host</li>
                            <li>Environment that brings the host and agent together</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Environment influences the agent, the host and the route of transmission of the agent from a source to the host.</p>
                        <h4>Agent factors</h4>
                        <p>Originally refers to an infectious microorganism - virus, bacterium, parasite, or other microbe. These agents must be present for a disease to occur. That is, they are necessary but not sufficient to cause a disease.</p>
                        <h4>Host factors</h4>
                        <p>Are intrinsic factors that influence individual's exposure, susceptibility, or response to a causative agent. Age, race, sex, socio-economic status and behaviors (smoking, drug abuse, lifestyle, sexual practices and contraception, eating habits) are some of the many host factors which affect a person's likelihood of exposure.</p>
                        <h4>Environmental factors</h4>
                        <p>Are extrinsic factors which affect the agent and the opportunity for exposure. It includes physical factors such as geology, climate, physical surrounding, biological factors such as insects that transmit agents, socio-economic factors such as crowding, sanitation etc. Agents, host and environmental factors interrelate in a variety of complex ways to produce a disease in humans.</p>

                        <h3>Transmission Cycle & Chain of Infection</h3>
                        <p>Transmission occurs when the agent leaves its reservoir or host through a portal of exit, and is conveyed by some mode of transmission, and enters through an appropriate portal of entry to infect a susceptible host.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Reservoir</h4>
                        <p>Reservoir of an agent is the habitat in which an infectious agent normally lives, grows and multiplies. This includes humans, animals and the environment. The reservoir may or may not be the source from which an agent is transferred to a host.</p>
                        <figure>
                           <img src="../assets/images/2025_11_14_73e9871a89d943507edfg-09-1.jpg" alt="Diagram of the chain of infection, showing the cyclical relationship between an infectious agent, reservoir, portal of exit, mode of transmission, portal of entry, and a susceptible host." class="content-image">

                        </figure>

                        <h4>Modes of transmission</h4>
                        <p>After an agent exists its natural reservoir, it may be transmitted to a susceptible host in numerous ways. These modes of transmission are classified as:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Direct (Direct contact and direct spread)</strong> - There is immediate transfer of the agent from a reservoir to a susceptible host by direct contact or droplet spread. It occur through kissing, skin-to-skin contact. Also refer to contact with soil or vegetation harboring infectious organisms.</li>
                            <li><strong>Indirect (Airborne, Vehicle borne, Vector borne)</strong> - This can be mechanical or biologic. An agent is carried from a reservoir (a susceptible host) by suspended air particles or by animate (vector) or inanimate (vehicle) intermediaries. Most vectors are arthropods such as mosquitoes, fleas and ticks. This is in contrast of instances in which an agent undergoes part of its life cycle inside a vector before being transmitted to a new host. When the agent undergoes changes within the vector, the vector is serving as both intermediate host and a mode of transmission. This type of direct transmission is called a biologic transmission.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Vehicles that may directly transmit an agent include food, water, blood, handkerchiefs, bedding etc.</p>

                        <h4>Investigation and Control of Epidemics</h4>
                        <p>Health departments investigate suspected outbreaks for various reasons:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Need to institute control and prevention measures</li>
                            <li>Opportunity for research and training</li>
                            <li>Program considerations</li>
                            <li>Public relations</li>
                            <li>Political concern</li>
                            <li>Legal obligations</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4>Steps of Outbreak Investigation</h4>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Prepare for fieldwork</strong> - Prepare before leaving for the field. Preparation can be grouped into 3 categories: Investigation, Administration, and Consultation.</li>
                            <li><strong>Establish the existence of an outbreak</strong> - An outbreak or epidemic is the occurrence of more cases of disease than expected in a given area over a particular period of time.</li>
                            <li><strong>Verify the diagnosis</strong> - Establish what disease is occurring by proper diagnosis. Review clinical findings and laboratory results.</li>
                            <li><strong>Define and identify cases</strong> - Establish a case definition, which is a standard set of criteria for deciding whether an individual should be classified as having the health condition of interest.</li>
                            <li><strong>Perform descriptive epidemiology</strong> - Characterizing an outbreak by variables such as time, place and person is called descriptive epidemiology. Develop and evaluate hypotheses.</li>
                            <li><strong>Implement control and prevention measures</strong></li>
                            <li><strong>Document and communicate findings</strong> through oral briefs or written report.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h4>Methods of Control and Eradication of Diseases</h4>
                        <p>There is an important distinction among the 3 terms, prevention, control, and eradication.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Control:</strong> The reduction of disease incidence, prevalence, morbidity or mortality to a locally acceptable level as a result of deliberate efforts; continued intervention measures are required to maintain the reduction. Example: diarrheal diseases.</li>
                            <li><strong>Elimination of infections:</strong> Reduction to zero of the incidence of infection caused by a specific agent in a defined geographical area as a result of deliberate efforts; continued measures to prevent reestablishment of transmission are required. Example: measles, poliomyelitis.</li>
                            <li><strong>Eradication:</strong> Permanent reduction to zero of the worldwide incidence of infection caused by a specific agent as a result of deliberate efforts; intervention measures are no longer needed. Example: smallpox.</li>
                            <li><strong>Extinction:</strong> The specific infectious agent no longer exists in nature or in the laboratory. Example: none.</li>
                        </ul>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>These are medical conditions of noninfectious or non-transmittable to another person. Currently, the NCD are the leading causes of death and disease burden worldwide. The 4 main types of non-communicable diseases are cardiovascular diseases (like heart attacks and stroke), cancers, chronic respiratory diseases (such as chronic obstructed pulmonary disease and asthma) and diabetes.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Risk Factors</h4>
                        <p>All age groups and all regions are affected by NCDs. A risk factor is any attribute, characteristic or exposure of an individual that increases the likelihood of developing a disease or injury.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Modifiable behavioral risk factors</strong> - Tobacco use, physical inactivity, unhealthy diet and the harmful use of alcohol increase the risk of NCDs.</li>
                            <li><strong>Metabolic/physiological risk factors</strong> - These behaviors lead to four key metabolic/physiological changes that increase the risk of NCDs: Raised blood pressure, Overweight/obesity, Hyperglycemia (high blood glucose levels) and Hyperlipidemia (high levels of fat in the blood).</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Prevention and Control Strategies</h4>
                        <p>A comprehensive approach is needed that requires all sectors to work together to reduce the risks associated with NCDs. Prevention for NCDs occurs on three levels:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Primary prevention</strong> - is aimed at maintaining a healthy population; i.e., preventing the occurrence of disease.</li>
                            <li><strong>Secondary prevention</strong> - (also called disease control) attempts to minimize resultant damage after disease has occurred.</li>
                            <li><strong>Tertiary prevention</strong> - consists of rehabilitation after primary and secondary prevention has failed.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Basic Treatment</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Common:</strong> Diseases like colds and flu can typically be treated with adequate rest and over-the-counter medication.</li>
                            <li><strong>Chronic:</strong> Severe diseases spread via parasites, sexual contact or bodily fluids. Treatment usually involves hospitalization, intravenous antibiotics, and intensive care.</li>
                            <li><strong>Vaccines:</strong> An effective way to treat a communicable disease is by receiving a vaccine before infection.</li>
                            <li><strong>Prevention/Solution:</strong> Prevention is the most effective form of treatment. Boost your immune system through diet, exercise, and good hygiene.</li>
                        </ul>

                            <h4 class="callout-title">Warning</h4>
                            <p>Some communicable diseases have no cure. For example, there is no cure for sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) like herpes and HIV. Avoiding sexual contact with infected individuals is the only way to ensure you do not become infected.</p>
