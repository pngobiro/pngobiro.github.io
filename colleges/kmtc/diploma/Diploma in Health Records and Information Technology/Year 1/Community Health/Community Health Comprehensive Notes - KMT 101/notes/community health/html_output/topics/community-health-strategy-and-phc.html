                        <p><strong>Specific objectives:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>To understand the meaning and objectives of community strategy</li>

                        <p><strong>Community strategy</strong> - this is an approach that sets up an assurance that Kenyan communities have the capacity and motivation to take up their essential role in health care delivery.</p>
                        <p><strong>Goal</strong> - is a desired result that a person or a system envisions, plans and commits to achieve. The overall goal of the community strategy is to enhance community access to health care in order to improve productivity and thus reduce poverty, hunger, and child and maternal deaths, as well as improve education performance across all the stages of the life cycle.</p>

                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4>Roles of households and community</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Health promotion</strong> - through: ensuring healthy diet, building social capital, demanding entitlements, monitoring health status, and ensuring gender equity.</li>
                            <li><strong>Disease prevention</strong> - through: practicing good personal hygiene, using safe drinking water, ensuring adequate shelter, and preventing accidents and abuse.</li>
                            <li><strong>Care seeking compliance with treatment and advice</strong> - through: giving appropriate home care, taking children for immunization, recognizing need for referral, and ensuring pregnant women receive care.</li>
                            <li><strong>Governance and management of health services</strong> - through: attending and taking an active part in community meetings.</li>

                        <p><strong>Goal:</strong> To improve the knowledge and skills on primary health care</p>
                        <p><strong>Specific objectives:</strong></p>

                        <p><strong>Meaning</strong> - Primary Health Care is defined as an essential health care based on practical, scientifically sound, socially acceptable methods, technology made universally acceptable to individuals, families and community through their full participation and affordable cost that the community can sustain and become self-reliant.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Origin - The Declaration of Alma-Ata</h4>
                        <p>The concept of PHC started as follows: The Declaration of Alma-Ata was adopted in September 1978 at the International Conference on PHC. This was the first international declaration underlining the importance of primary health care. Goals and targets were set for achieving "Health for All" by the Year 2000. It expressed the need for urgent action by all governments, all health and development workers, and the world community to protect and promote the health of all people. The PHC approach has since then been accepted by member countries of the WHO as the key to achieving the goal of "Health for All".</p>
                        
                        <h4>Principles of PHC</h4>
                        <p>The five basic principles are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Equitable distribution:</strong> Fair distribution of available resources to all individuals and families.</li>
                            <li><strong>Manpower development:</strong> Mobilizing the human potential of the entire community by making use of available resources.</li>
                            <li><strong>Community participation:</strong> The process by which individuals, families and communities take responsibility in promoting their own health and welfare.</li>
                            <li><strong>Appropriate technology:</strong> Technology that is scientifically sound, adaptable to local needs, and affordable for the community to maintain.</li>
                            <li><strong>Multi-sector or Inter-sector approach:</strong> PHC requires coordinated effort with other related sectors whose activities impact on health (e.g., agriculture, water, education).</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4>Elements of PHC</h4>
                        <p>In the Alma Ata conference of 1978, eight essential elements of PHC were identified:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Health education</li>
                            <li>Local disease control</li>
                            <li>Expanded programme of immunization</li>
                            <li>Maternal and child health care and family planning</li>
                            <li>Essential drug supply</li>
                            <li>Nutrition and adequate food supply</li>
                            <li>Treatment and prevention of common diseases and injuries</li>
                            <li>Safe water supply and good sanitation</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Kenya government has added more elements. These are:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Mental Health</li>
                            <li>Dental Health</li>
                            <li>Community Based Rehabilitation</li>
                            <li>HIV/AIDS Prevention</li>
                            <li>Health information systems</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h4>Success & Failures of PHC Implementation</h4>
                        <p>The following are reasons why PHC did not achieve its intentions in most countries:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Many ordinary people felt PHC was a cheap form of healthcare and bypassed this level for secondary and tertiary centers.</li>
                            <li>Civil war, natural disasters, and HIV affected the ability of PHC to maintain comprehensive services.</li>
                            <li>Political commitment was not sustained after the initial euphoria of Alma-Ata.</li>
                            <li>Issues of governance and corruption in the use of resources resulted in donors becoming wary of funding comprehensive programs.</li>
                        </ul>
