                        <p>Budgeting is the process of creating a plan to spend your money. This spending plan is called
                            a budget. Creating this spending plan allows you to determine in advance whether you will
                            have enough money to do the things you need to do or would like to do.</p>

                            <p><strong>Budgeting is simply balancing your expenses with your income. If they don't
                                    balance and you spend more than you make, you will have a problem. Many people don't
                                    realize that they spend more than they earn and slowly sink deeper into debt every
                                    year.</strong></p>

                        <p>Since budgeting allows you to create a spending plan for your money, it ensures that you will
                            always have enough money for the things you need and the things that are important to you.
                            Following a budget or spending plan will also keep you out of debt or help you work your way
                            out of debt if you are currently in debt.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Project management is the application of processes, methods, skills, knowledge and experience
                            to achieve specific project objectives according to the project acceptance criteria within
                            agreed parameters. Project management has final deliverables that are constrained to a
                            finite timescale and budget.</p>
                        <p>A key factor that distinguishes project management from just 'management' is that it has this
                            final deliverable and a finite timespan, unlike management which is an ongoing process.
                            Because of this a project professional needs a wide range of skills; often technical skills,
                            and certainly people management skills and good business awareness.</p>

                        <h3>What is a project?</h3>
                        <p>A project is a unique, transient endeavour, undertaken to achieve planned objectives, which
                            could be defined in terms of outputs, outcomes or benefits. A project is usually deemed to
                            be a success if it achieves the objectives according to their acceptance criteria, within an
                            agreed timescale and budget. Time, cost and quality are the building blocks of every
                            project.</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">

                        <h3>PROJECT BUDGET PLANNING</h3>
                        <p>Every project boils down to money. If you had a bigger budget, you could probably get more
                            people to do your project more quickly and deliver more. That's why no project plan is
                            complete until you come up with a budget. But no matter whether your project is big or
                            small, and no matter how many resources and activities are in it, the process for figuring
                            out the bottom line is always the same.</p>
                        <p>It is important to come up with detailed estimates for all the project costs. Once this is
                            compiled, you add up the cost estimates into a budget plan. It is now possible to track the
                            project according to that budget while the work is ongoing.</p>
                        <p>Often, when you come into a project, there is already an expectation of how much it will cost
                            or how much time it will take. When you make an estimate early in the project without
                            knowing much about it, that estimate is called a rough order-of-magnitude estimate (or a
                            ballpark estimate). This estimate will become more refined as time goes on and you learn
                            more about the project. Here are some tools and techniques for estimating cost:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Determination of resource cost rates: People who will be working on the project all work
                                at a specific rate. Any materials you use to build the project (e.g., wood or wiring)
                                will be charged at a rate too. Determining resource costs means figuring out what the
                                rate for labour and materials will be.</li>
                            <li>Vendor bid analysis: Sometimes you will need to work with an external contractor to get
                                your project done. You might even have more than one contractor bid on the job. This
                                tool is about evaluating those bids and choosing the one you will accept.</li>
                            <li>Reserve analysis: You need to set aside some money for cost overruns. If you know that
                                your project has a risk of something expensive happening, it is better to have some cash
                                available to deal with it. Reserve analysis means putting some cash away in case of
                                overruns.</li>
                            <li>Cost of quality: You will need to figure the cost of all your quality-related activities
                                into the overall budget. Since it's cheaper to find bugs earlier in the project than
                                later, there are always quality costs associated with everything your project produces.
                                Cost of quality is just a way of tracking the cost of those activities. It is the amount
                                of money it takes to do the project right.</li>

                        <p>Cost management is concerned with the process of finding the right project and carrying out
                            the project the right way. It includes activities such as planning, estimating, budgeting,
                            financing, funding, managing, controlling, and benchmarking costs so that the project can be
                            completed within time and the approved budget and the project performance could be improved
                            in time.</p>
                        <p>Cost management covers the full life cycle of a project from the initial planning phase
                            towards measuring the actual cost performance and project completion. This article will
                            explain the different steps and processes in Project Cost Management, in line with methods
                            such as the Total Cost Management Framework of AACE International [1].</p>

                        <h4>Step 1: Resource planning</h4>
                        <p>Resource planning is the process of ascertaining future resource requirements for an
                            organization or a scope of work. This involves the evaluation and planning of the use of the
                            physical, human, financial, and informational resources required to complete work activities
                            and their tasks. Most activities involve using people to perform work. Some activities
                            involve materials and consumables. Other tasks involve creating an asset using mainly
                            information inputs (e.g., engineering or software design). Usually, people use tools such as
                            equipment to help them. In some cases, automated tools may perform the work with little or
                            no human effort.</p>
                        <p>Resource planning begins in the scope and execution plan development process during which the
                            work breakdown structure, organizational breakdown structure (OBS), work packages, and
                            execution strategy are developed. The OBS establishes categories of labor resources or
                            responsibilities; this categorization facilitates resource planning because all resources
                            are someone's responsibility as reflected in the OBS.</p>
                        <p>Resource estimating (usually a part of cost estimating) determines the activity's resource
                            quantities needed (hours, tools, materials, etc.) while schedule planning and development
                            determines the work activities be performed. Resource planning then takes the estimated
                            resource quantities, evaluates resource availability and limitations considering project
                            circumstances, and then optimizes how the available resources (which are often limited) will
                            be used in the activities over time. The optimization is performed in an iterative manner
                            using the duration estimating and resource allocation steps of the schedule planning and
                            development process.</p>

                        <h4>Step 2: Cost estimating</h4>
                        <p>Cost estimating is the predictive process used to quantify, cost, and price the resources
                            required by the scope of an investment option, activity, or project. It involves the
                            application of techniques that convert quantified technical and programmatic information
                            about an asset or project into finance and resource information. The outputs of estimating
                            are used primarily as inputs for business planning, cost analysis, and decisions or for
                            project cost and schedule control processes.</p>
                        <p>The cost estimating process is generally applied during each phase of the asset or project
                            life cycle as the asset or project scope is defined, modified, and refined. As the level of
                            scope definition increases, the estimating methods used become more definitive and produce
                            estimates with increasingly narrow probabilistic cost distributions.</p>
                        <p>The estimation of the time duration of activities must be considered concurrently with costs
                            because costs are often dependent on time duration and resource requirements identified in
                            cost estimating may affect the schedule. Iterative approaches are used because outcomes of a
                            cost estimate often lead to changes in scope or plans. In fact, the estimating process can
                            be viewed as part of the scope definition process because iterative trading off between cost
                            and scope intertwine the processes.</p>

                            <li>Connected cost estimating and cost control. With the Cost Control Module, you can track
                                project costs during the execution phase.</li>
                            <li>Traditionally, management would ask to deliver an estimate based on the time remaining
                                to the TA execution. More organizations now require estimators to follow a staged
                                approach to estimating, delivering three different types of estimates during the
                                preparation phase.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Step 3: Cost budgeting</h4>
                        <p>Budgeting is a sub-process within estimating used for allocating the estimated cost of
                            resources into cost accounts against which cost performance will be measured and assessed.
                            This forms the baseline for cost control. Cost accounts used from the chart of accounts must
                            also support the cost accounting process. Budgets are often time-phased in accordance with
                            the schedule or to address budget and cash flow constraints.</p>

                        <h4>Step 4: Cost control</h4>
                        <p>Cost control is concerned with measuring variances from the cost baseline and taking
                            effective corrective action to achieve minimum costs. Procedures are applied to monitor
                            expenditures and performance against the progress of a project. All changes to the cost
                            baseline need to be recorded and the expected final total costs are continuously forecasted.
                            When actual cost information becomes available an important part of cost control is to
                            explain what is causing the variance from the cost baseline. Based on this analysis
                            corrective action might be required to avoid cost overruns.</p>
                        <p>Below figure is a process map for project performance measurement [1]. This process should be
                            run in a continuous improvement cycle until project completion:</p>

                        <h4>Bonus Step: Benchmarking</h4>
                        <p>As a bonus step, it is wise to add Benchmarking to the project cost management process.</p>
                        <p>Benchmarking helps close the loop between project A and project B. The knowledge from project
                            A (referring to the running and executed projects) are analyzed and the feedback is
                            reflected in project B (the next projects). That's how an improvement cycle is created to
                            increase project performance. Benchmarking is widely used by technical industries to improve
                            the performance of the projects. The goal of project benchmarking is to store data from
                            executed and running projects to extract valuable project metrics and to benchmark current
                            estimates. Performing statistical analysis on historical data can result in valuable
                            information on relationships between variables, which can be used to set up a reliable cost
                            knowledgebase or calibrate existing ones.</p>

                        <p>It is important to note that project benchmarking does not only include the comparison
                            between projects, as it is also interesting to compare revisions within a project.</p>

                        <h3>PROJECT MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM (PMIS)</h3>
                        <p>A project management information system (PMIS) is the coherent organization of the
                            information required for an organization to execute projects successfully. A PMIS is
                            typically one or more software applications and a methodical process for collecting and
                            using project information. These electronic systems "help [to] plan, execute, and close
                            project management goals." ${ }^{[1]}$ PMIS systems differ in scope, design and features
                            depending upon an organisation's operational requirements.</p>
                        <p>The project management information system, which is part of the environmental factors,
                            provides access to tools, such as a scheduling tool, a work authorization system, a
                            configuration management system, an information collection and distribution system, or
                            interfaces to other online automated systems. Automated gathering and reporting on key
                            performance indicators (KPI) can be part of this system.</p>
                        <p>Project Management Information System (PMIS) are system tools and techniques used in project
                            management to deliver information. Project managers use the techniques and tools to collect,
                            combine and distribute information through electronic and manual means. Project Management
                            Information System (PMIS) is used by upper and lower management to communicate with each
                            other.</p>
                        <p>Project Management Information System (PMIS) help plan, execute and close project management
                            goals. During the planning process, project managers use PMIS for budget framework such as
                            estimating costs. The Project Management Information System is also used to create a
                            specific schedule and define the scope baseline. At the execution of the project management
                            goals, the project management team collects information into one database. The PMIS is used
                            to compare the baseline with the actual accomplishment of each activity, manage materials,
                            collect financial data, and keep a record for reporting purposes. During the close of the
                            project, the Project Management Information System is used to review the goals to check if
                            the tasks were accomplished. Then, it is used to create a final report of the project close.
                        </p>
                        <p>To conclude, the project management information system (PMIS) is used to plan schedules,
                            budget and execute work to be accomplished in project management.</p>

                        <h3>PROJECT MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM SOFTWARE</h3>
                        <p>At the center of any modern PMIS is software. Project management information system can vary
                            from something as simple as a File system containing Microsoft Excel documents, to a full
                            blown enterprise PMIS software.</p>
