                        <p>Report writing is the creation of a structured document that precisely describes, and
                            examines an event or occurrence. A report is a document that is short, sharp and specially
                            written for a particular audience and purpose. This article looks into the various features
                            of a report, reasons for writing a report, common mistakes to avoid when writing a report
                            and stages involved in writing a compelling report.</p>

                        <h3>Features of a report</h3>
                        <p>Being that reports provide factual information based on decisions that were made, various
                            guidelines are followed to ensure that a report has the essentials of an effective report.
                            Here are the features of a satisfying report:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Has an abstract or summary that provides a brief synopsis of the contents.</li>
                            <li>Has a specific purpose and target audience.</li>
                            <li>Has clearly labeled sections and headings.</li>
                            <li>May contain data presented in for example graphs or tables.</li>
                            <li>Often the text is broken up-bullet points, lists: is not always continuous prose.</li>
                            <li>Written concisely and to the point.</li>
                            <li>Written formally and objectively.</li>

                        <h3>Five ways to make your report more effective</h3>
                        <p>A simple arrangement should be followed to ensure you write an effective report. Below are
                            five useful stages of report writing:</p>
                        <ol class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Read the brief or terms of reference carefully; maintaining the focus on the brief will
                                help you keep the content of your report relevant throughout.</li>
                            <li>Plan; planning each section should be considered before you begin writing your work.
                            </li>
                            <li>Relate your findings to the background research conducted which will help you place the
                                results in a broader context.</li>
                            <li>Put yourself in the position of the reader by asking yourself if what you have written
                                will make sense to someone else.</li>
                            <li>Edit and proofread your work thoroughly.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Whatever the type of report you are writing, it should be clearly structured and well
                            written. An organized report saves your audience time as they can navigate through it with
                            ease.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>There are many different types of reports, including business, scientific and research
                            reports, but the basic steps for writing them are the same. These are outlined below.</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Step 1: Decide on the 'Terms of reference'</li>
                            <li>Step 2: Decide on the procedure</li>
                            <li>Step 3: Find the information</li>
                            <li>Step 4: Decide on the structure</li>
                            <li>Step 5: Draft the first part of your report</li>
                            <li>Step 6: Analyze your findings and draw conclusions</li>
                            <li>Step 7: Make recommendations</li>
                            <li>Step 8: Draft the executive summary and table of contents</li>
                            <li>Step 9: Compile a reference list</li>
                            <li>Step 10: Revise your draft report</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Step 1: Decide on the 'Terms of reference'</h3>
                        <p>To decide on the terms of reference for your report, read your instructions and any other
                            information you've been given about the report, and think about the purpose of the report:
                        </p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>What is it about?</li>
                            <li>What exactly is needed?</li>
                            <li>Why is it needed?</li>
                            <li>When do I need to do it?</li>
                            <li>Who is it for, or who is it aimed at?</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>This will help you draft your Terms of reference.</p>

                        <h3>Step 2: Decide on the procedure</h3>
                        <p>This means planning your investigation or research, and how you'll write the report. Ask
                            yourself:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>What information do I need?</li>
                            <li>Do I need to do any background reading?</li>
                            <li>What articles or documents do I need?</li>
                            <li>Do I need to contact the library for assistance?</li>
                            <li>Do I need to interview or observe people?</li>
                            <li>Do I have to record data?</li>
                            <li>How will I go about this?</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Answering these questions will help you draft the procedure section of your report, which
                            outlines the steps you've taken to carry out the investigation.</p>

                        <h3>Step 3: Find the information</h3>
                        <p>The next step is to find the information you need for your report. To do this you may need to
                            read written material, observe people or activities, and/or talk to people.</p>
                        <p>Make sure the information you find is relevant and appropriate. Check the assessment
                            requirements and guidelines and the marking schedule to make sure you're on the right track.
                            If you're not sure how the marks will be assigned contact your lecturer.</p>
                        <p>What you find out will form the basis, or main body, of your report - the findings.</p>

                        <h3>Step 4: Decide on the structure</h3>
                        <p>Reports generally have a similar structure, but some details may differ. How they differ
                            usually depends on:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>The type of report - if it is a research report, laboratory report, business report,
                                investigative report, etc.</li>
                            <li>How formal the report has to be.</li>
                            <li>The length of the report.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Depending on the type of report, the structure can include:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>A title page.</li>
                            <li>Executive summary.</li>
                            <li>Contents.</li>
                            <li>An introduction.</li>
                            <li>Terms of reference.</li>
                            <li>Procedure.</li>
                            <li>Findings.</li>
                            <li>Conclusions.</li>
                            <li>Recommendations.</li>
                            <li>References/Bibliography.</li>
                            <li>Appendices.</li>
                            <li>The sections, of a report usually have headings and subheadings, which are usually
                                numbered</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Step 5: Draft the first part of your report</h3>
                        <p>Once you have your structure, write down the headings and start to fill these in with the
                            information you have gathered so far. By now you should be able to draft the terms of
                            reference, procedure and findings, and start to work out what will go in the report's
                            appendix.</p>

                        <h3>Findings</h3>
                        <p>The findings are result of your reading, observations, interviews and investigation. They
                            form the basis of your report. Depending on the type of report you are writing, you may also
                            wish to include photos, tables or graphs to make your report more readable and/or easier to
                            follow.</p>
                        <p><strong>Appendices</strong></p>
                        <p>As you are writing your draft decide what information will go in the appendix. These are used
                            for information that:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>is too long to include in the body of the report, or</li>
                            <li>supplements or complements the information in the report. For example, brochures,
                                spreadsheets or large tables.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Step 6: Analyze your findings and draw conclusions</h3>
                        <p>The conclusion is where you analyze your findings and interpret what you have found. To do
                            this, read through your findings and ask yourself:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>What have I found?</li>
                            <li>What's significant or important about my findings?</li>
                            <li>What do my findings suggest?</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>For example, your conclusion may describe how the information you collected explains why the
                            situation occurred, what this means for the organisation, and what will happen if the
                            situation continues (or doesn't continue).</p>
                        <p>Don't include any new information in the conclusion.</p>

                        <h3>Step 7: Make recommendations</h3>
                        <p>Recommendations are what you think the solution to the problem is and/or what you think
                            should happen next. To help you decide what to recommend:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Reread your findings and conclusions.</li>
                            <li>Think about what you want the person who asked for the report should to do or not do;
                                what actions should they carry out?</li>
                            <li>Check that your recommendations are practical and are based logically on your
                                conclusions.</li>
                            <li>Ensure you include enough detail for the reader to know what needs to be done and who
                                should do it.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Your recommendations should be written as a numbered list, and ordered from most to least
                            important.</p>

                        <h3>Step 8: Draft the executive summary and table of contents</h3>
                        <p>Some reports require an executive summary and/or list of contents. Even though these two
                            sections come near the beginning of the report you won't be able to do them until you have
                            finished it, and have your structure and recommendations finalised.</p>
                        <p>An executive summary is usually about 100 words long. It tells the readers what the report is
                            about, and summarise the recommendations.</p>

                        <h3>Step 9: Compile a reference list</h3>
                        <p>This is a list of all the sources you've referred to in the report and uses APA referencing.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Step 10: Revise your draft report</h3>
                        <p>It is always important to revise your work. Things you need to check include:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>If you have done what you were asked to do. Check the assignment question, the
                                instructions/guidelines and the marking schedule to make sure.</li>
                            <li>That the required sections are included, and are in the correct order.</li>
                            <li>That your information is accurate, with no gaps.</li>
                            <li>If your argument is logical. Does the information you present support your conclusions
                                and recommendations?</li>
                            <li>That all terms, symbols and abbreviations used have been explained.</li>
                            <li>That any diagrams, tables, graphs and illustrations are numbered and labelled.</li>
                            <li>That the formatting is correct, including your numbering, headings, are consistent
                                throughout the report.</li>
                            <li>That the report reads well, and your writing is as clear and effective as possible.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>Here are the main sections of the standard report writing format:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li><strong>Title Section</strong> - This includes the name of the author(s) and the date of
                                report preparation.</li>
                            <li><strong>Summary</strong> - There needs to be a summary of the major points, conclusions,
                                and recommendations. It needs to be short as it is a general overview of the report.
                                Some people will read the summary and only skim the report, so make sure you include all
                                the relevant information. It would be best to write this last so you will include
                                everything, even the points that might be added at the last minute.</li>
                            <li><strong>Introduction</strong> - The first page of the report needs to have an
                                introduction. You will explain the problem and show the reader why the report is being
                                made. You need to give a definition of terms if you did not include these in the title
                                section, and explain how the details of the report are arranged.</li>
                            <li><strong>Body</strong> - This is the main section of the report. There needs to be
                                several sections, with each having a subtitle. Information is usually arranged in order
                                of importance with the most important information coming first.</li>
                            <li><strong>Conclusion</strong> - This is where everything comes together. Keep this section
                                free of jargon as most people will read the Summary and Conclusion.</li>
                            <li><strong>Recommendations</strong> - This is what needs to be done. In plain English,
                                explain your recommendations, putting them in order of priority.</li>
                            <li><strong>Appendices</strong> - This includes information that the experts in the field
                                will read. It has all the technical details that support your conclusions.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Remember that the information needs to be organized logically with the most important
                            information coming first.</p>
