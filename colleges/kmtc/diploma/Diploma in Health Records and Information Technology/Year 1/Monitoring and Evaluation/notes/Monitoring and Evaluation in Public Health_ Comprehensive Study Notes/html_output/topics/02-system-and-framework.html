                            system; 2) selected quality data can be reported to national programme leaders; and 3) the
                            national programme is able to meet donor and international reporting requirements under a
                            unified global effort to contain the HIV/AIDS pandemic. As a programme or intervention

                        <h3>1.4.3 M & E Workplan Development and Elements</h3>
                        <p>Monitoring & Evaluation Workplan = is a flexible guide to the steps used to document project
                            activities, show progress towards project goals/objectives and answer evaluation questions.
                            As a guide, the M&E Workplan must include the following elements:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>goals/objectives of the overall plan as well as the evaluation questions and indicators,
                            </li>
                            <li>methodologies,</li>
                            <li>implementation plan,</li>
                            <li>matrix of expected results,</li>
                            <li>proposed timeline and M&E instruments for data collection.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>To ensure that M&E activities produce useful results, it is essential to (i) incorporate M&E
                            in the program design stage (ii) collaborate with all stakeholders to develop an integrated
                            and comprehensive M&E plan. M&E workplans are often written to cover a four-five-year period
                            as they may involve numerous M&E efforts on multiple interventions for different target
                            populations and both short and long-term goals/objectives.</p>
                        <p>In summary the key elements of a M&E Workplan are: 1) The scope of the M&E specifying goals
                            and developing conceptual framework that integrates the inputs, activities, outputs,
                            outcomes and impacts and establishes realistic expectations for what M&E can produce; 2) The
                            methodological approach - determining M&E methods including identification of outcome
                            indicators, data source, and plans for data analysis; 3) The implementation plan -
                            delineating activities, roles, responsibilities and a timetable for identified activities
                            with realistic expectations of when data will be analyzed and results will be available and
                            4) A plan for disseminating and using the results: - determining who will translate the
                            results into terms understandable to program designers, managers and decision-makers,
                            stakeholders' feedback sessions and the implications for future monitoring.</p>

                        <h3>1.4.4 Evaluation Plan and Team</h3>
                        <h4>- Rationale for developing an evaluation plan</h4>
                        <p>It is often helpful in the beginning stages to review with all stakeholders the reasons for
                            developing a comprehensive evaluation plan. Some of the benefits that can be derived from
                            the evaluation planning process are:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Evaluation planning will provide program managers and stakeholders alike with the
                                opportunity to assess the evaluation needs, resources, capabilities, and priorities in
                                their area.</li>
                            <li>Having an evaluation plan will show stakeholders how the program plans to be accountable
                                for the resources they have received.</li>
                            <li>In the process of developing the evaluation plan, existing data sources and past or
                                concurrent evaluation activities are often identified. Capitalizing on such existing
                                data sources and past evaluative efforts can lead to a more efficient, less redundant
                                plan for new evaluation monies.</li>
                            <li>Having a long-term evaluation plan can clarify future decision-making regarding
                                evaluation priorities.</li>
                            <li>Finally, having a comprehensive evaluation plan in place may also favorably influence
                                donor decision-making.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>- KEY ELEMENTS OF AN EVALUATION PLAN</h4>
                        <p>In developing an evaluation plan, a planning team should focus on the following key elements:
                        </p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Scope of the evaluation-Specifying the goals and objectives of the program and
                                developing a conceptual framework (or logic model) that integrates and correlates the
                                inputs, activities, outputs, outcomes, and impact, and establishing realistic
                                expectations for what the evaluation will provide or show.</li>
                            <li>Methodological approach- developing an evaluation design, includes specifying the
                                outcome indicators or measures and the data source and plans for data analysis.</li>
                            <li>Implementation plan-Delineating activities, roles, and responsibilities, and a timetable
                                for identified activities with realistic expectations of when data will be analyzed and
                                results will be available.</li>
                            <li>Dissemination plan for the results- Determining who will translate the results into
                                language that is useful to program designers, managers, and decision makers, how
                                findings will be disseminated (for example, written papers, oral presentations, program
                                materials), and implications for setting priorities for future evaluation activities.
                            </li>

                        <h3>PRINCIPAL COMPONENTS OF PROGRAM MONITORING AND EVALUATION</h3>
                        <p>Principal components of M& E include cost-effectiveness, efficiency , accountability and
                            relevance analysis as described below:</p>

                        <h4>- Cost-effectiveness Analysis</h4>
                        <p>Cost-effectiveness analysis also measures program effectiveness, but expands the analysis by
                            adding a measure of program cost per unit of effect (for example, per number of HIV
                            infections averted). By comparing the costs and consequences of various interventions, cost
                            analyses and cost effectiveness estimates can assist in priority setting, resource
                            allocation decisions, and program design.</p>

                        <h4>Efficiency</h4>
                        <p>Measures programme proper use of resources as per budget line items.</p>

                        <h4>- Accountability</h4>
                        <p>Measures how the programme is meeting the needs of the beneficiaries or communities based on
                            the situation analysis which informed the development of the programme.</p>

                        <h4>- Relevance</h4>
                        <p>Assess whether the programme objectives are in line with the national and global policies.

                        <h3>Routine Monitoring and Performance Reviews for government projects</h3>
                        <p>Routine monitoring is the continuous tracking and reporting of priority information about a
                            program or project, its inputs and intended outputs, outcomes and impacts while performance
                            review is the degree to which an intervention or organization operates according to specific
                            criteria or standards or guidelines or achieves results in accordance with stated goals or
                            plans.</p>
                        <p>In Kenya, planning and budgeting is guided by the Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF), a
                            three-year rolling revenue and expenditure budget plan for the government both at the
                            national and the county levels. The concept of the "three year rolling" timeline consists of
                            the following:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>The current budget year (X): the budget for the current financial year.</li>
                            <li>The next budget year $(X+1)$: the target period of the current budget process i.e. the
                                year the current budget process is being prepared for.</li>
                            <li>The following two outer years $(X+2)$ and $(X+3)$: these are estimates of the likely
                                expenditure to provide services beyond the next budget year.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Procedurally, determination of the health sector's priorities for the next subsequent
                            financial year (FY) (x+1) should be dependent on a systematic review of the previous year (
                            $\mathrm{x}-1$ ) performance/achievement. However, this cycle is always broken and does not
                            conform to the MTEF cycle. The reviews aid programming of interventions, promote use of
                            evidence to determine priority setting and enhance accountability in resource allocation.

                            will need to acquaint themselves with this critical calendar, but most importantly,
                            preparation is needed in the following areas:</p>

                        <h4>Key milestones in the MTEF and performance review cycle</h4>
                        <ol class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>The approved budgets for the current $\mathrm{FY}(\mathrm{X})$ for both national and
                                county governments are launched in July of every financial year. The launch allows the
                                start of the implementation of the activities of both governments through a work plan,
                                as entrenched in the Constitution (no spending without a plan).</li>
                            <li>As the entities continue implementing year (X), a performance review process should be
                                initiated from August of the same year (X). The review is for the year ( $\mathrm{X}-1$
                                ) and informs the year ( $\mathrm{X}+1$ ). The performance reviews is aimed at
                                identifying achievements against the targets for year (X-1), factors that impact on the
                                achievements and identify priorities, and interventions and projects for the year (
                                $\mathrm{X}+1$ ). This process should be steered by an already constituted M&E
                                governance structure at both the national and county levels. At the county-level,
                                performance reviews start with the lowest planning units at the subcounty level,
                                including community units, health facilities and the subcounty health management teams.
                            </li>
                            <li>In the month of September every year, counties, through their county departments of
                                health, consolidate the sub counties' reports into county- specific health review
                                reports; this should be followed by a mini summit for stakeholders at the county level
                                to agree on the priorities.</li>
                            <li>In the month of October every year, a consolidation of performance review reports from
                                planning entities at the national and county levels is done to form an annual health
                                sector performance review report. This activity should be steered by the M\&E unit at
                                the national level and should precede the Annual Health Congress or Annual Health Summit
                                in November. To ensure completeness of the report, continuous engagement with
                                stakeholders is required until the final report is signed off.</li>
                            <li>The Annual Health Sector Summit is held in November every year. The summit draws members
                                from different stakeholders and is purposely meant to authenticate the review report
                                plus the priorities identified for the year ( $\mathrm{X}+1$ ). Financing schemes of the
                                already agreed priorities for the year ( $\mathrm{X}+1$ ) are discussed and gaps are
                                identified. The process ties well with the release of the budget outlook papers for year
                                ( $\mathrm{X}+1$ ) and allows sectors to fit the priorities as per the ceiling. At all
                                levels that is, national and county summit forum, communiqués on the commitments should
                                be drafted and signed by all stakeholders.</li>
                            <li>Sectors (planning entities) should request development partners to consider funding
                                programs that are a priority but which are not funded by the national treasury.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h4>Criteria for program and activities prioritization</h4>
                        <p>Determination and selection of the key programs, projects and activities at all levels should
                            adhere to the principles of equity, social accountability, efficiency, participation,
                            people- centeredness and should further be guided by the following:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Linkage of the program with objectives of Vision 2030 and MTPs</li>
                            <li>Linkage to government flagship projects and interventions</li>
                            <li>Degree to which the program addresses core poverty interventions</li>
                            <li>Degree to which the program addresses the core mandate and expected outputs and outcomes
                                of the program</li>
                            <li>Linkage of the program with other programs</li>
                            <li>Cost-effectiveness and sustainability of the program</li>
                            <li>Response to the requirements and furtherance of the implementation of the Constitution
                            </li>
                            <li>Emerging and re-emerging health issues (e.g. disaster management, disease surveillance,
                                outbreak investigations)</li>
                            <li>Continuity of the already ongoing projects and programs</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The programs identified should follow the program-based budgeting (PBB) approach adopted by
                            the Kenyan government since FY 2014/15 with clear program goals, objectives, outcomes,
                            outputs, and inputs comprehensively costed.</p>
