                            <li>Definition: Edema is increased fluid in the interstitial tissue spaces or it is a fluid accumulation in the body cavities in excessive amount.</li>
                            <li>Depending on the site, fluid accumulation in body cavities can be variously designated as:
                                <ol type="a">
                                    <li>Hydrothorax • fluid accumulation in pleural cavity in a pathologic amount.</li>
                                    <li>Hydropericardium pathologic amount of fluid accumulated in the pericardial cavity.</li>
                                    <li>Hydroperitonium (ascites) • fluid accumulation in peritoneal cavity.</li>
                                    <li>Ancsarca o is a severe & generalized edema of the body with profound subcutaneous swelling.</li>
                                </ol>
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Mechanism of edema formation:</h3>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Approximately $60\%$ of the lean body weight is water, two-thirds of which is intracellular with the remainder in the extracellular compartment.</li>
                            <li>The capillary endothelium acts as a semipermeable membrane and highly permeable to water & to almost all solutes in plasma with an exception of proteins. Proteins in plasma and interstial fluid are especially important in controlling plasma & interstitial fluid volume.</li>
                            <li>Normally, any outflow of fluid into the interstitium from the arteriolar end of the microcirculation is nearly balanced by inflow at the venular end. Therefore, normally, there is very little fluid in the interstitium.</li>
                            <li>Edema formation is determined by the following factors:
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Hydrostatic pressure</li>
                                    <li>Oncotic pressure</li>
                                    <li>Vascular permeability</li>
                                    <li>Lymphatic channels</li>
                                    <li>Sodium and water retention</li>
                                </ol>
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Hydrostatic and oncotic pressures:</h3>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>The passage of fluid across the wall of small blood vessels is determined by the balance between hydrostatic & oncotic pressures.</li>
                            <li>There are four primary forces that determine fluid movement across the capillary membrane.</li>
                            <li>Each of them can be listed under the above two basic categories, the hydrostatic pressure & the oncotic pressure. These four primary forces are known as Starling forces & they are:
                                <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                    <li>The capillary hydrostatic pressure (Pc): This pressure tends to force fluid outward from the intravascular space through the capillary membrane to the interstitium.</li>
                                    <li>The interstial fluid hydrostatic pressure (Pif): This pressure tends to force fluid from the interstitial space to the intravascular space.</li>
                                    <li>The plasma colloid osmotic (oncotic) pressure (.p): This pressure tends to cause osmosis of fluid inward through the capillary membrane from the interstitium. The plasma oncotic pressure is caused by the presence of plasma proteins.</li>
                                    <li>The interstial fluid colloid osmotic (oncotic) pressure (.if): This pressure tends to cause osmosis of fluid outward through the capillary membrane to the interstitium.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>In addition, some fluid is normally drained by the lymphatic channels. Usually, excess fluid will accumulate in the interstitium (i.e. edema is formed) when the capillary hydrostatic pressure is increased or when the plasma oncotic pressure is decreased or when the lymphatic drainage is blocked.</li>
                            <li>Hence, basically, one can divide pathologic edema into two broad categories:</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>A. Edema due to decreased plasma oncotic pressure. The plasma oncotic pressure is decreased when the plasma proteins are decreased in various diseases such as:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Protein loosing glomerulopathies like nephroticsyndrome with leaky glomerulus.</li>
                            <li>Liver cirrhosis which leads to decreased protein synthesis by the damaged liver.</li>
                            <li>Malnutrition</li>
                            <li>Protein loosing enteropathy.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>B. Edema resulting from increased capillary hydrostatic pressure as in the following diseases:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Deep venous thrombosis resulting in impaired venous return.</li>
                            <li>Pulmonary oedema</li>
                            <li>Cerebral oedema</li>
                            <li>Congestive heart failure</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3>Clinical classification of edema:</h3>
                        <p>One can also clinically classify edema into localized & generalized types.</p>

                            <li>Increased vascular permeability usually occurs due to acute inflammation. In inflammation, chemical mediators are produced. Some of these mediators (See the chapter on inflammation) cause increased vascular permeability which leads to loss of fluid & high molecular weight albumin and globulin into the interstitium. Such edema (i.e. that caused by increased vascular permeability) is called inflammatory edema. Inflammatory edema differs from non-inflammatory edema by the following features:</li>
                        </ul>

                            <li>Also important is the lymphatic system which returns to the circulation the small amount of proteinaceous fluid that does leak from the blood into the interstial spaces. Therefore, obstruction of lymphatic channels due to various causes leads to the accumulation of the proteinaceous fluid normally drained by the lymphatic channels.

                            <li>Slightly $>3 \mathrm{mm}$ hemorrhage occurring in the skin is referred to as purpura.</li>
                            <li>Larger than $1-2 \mathrm{cm}$ subcutaneous hematoma is called ecchymosis (bruises). It is typical after trauma.</li>

                            <li>Hemostasis depends on three general components:

                        <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Thrombosis is defined as the formation of a solid or semisolid mass from the constituents of the blood within the vascular system during life.</p>
                        <p><strong>Pathogenesis:</strong> There are three factors that predispose to thrombus formation. These factors are called Virchow’s triad:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Endothelial injury</li>

                        </ul>

                        <h3>Endothelial injury</h3>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>It is the most important factor in thrombus formation and by itself can lead to thrombosis.</li>
                            <li>Endothelial injury is particularly important in thrombus formation in the heart & arterial circulation.</li>
                            <li>Some Examples:
                                <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                    <li>Endocardial injury during myocardial infarction & eosinophilic endocarditis in which eosiophils release from their granules crystals called Charcot - Leyden damaging the endocardial endothelium.</li>
                                    <li>Injury over ulcerated plaque in severely atherosclerotic arteries.</li>
                                    <li>In hemodynamic stress like severe hypertension & turbulence of flow over scarred valves directly damaging the endothelium.</li>
                                    <li>Bacterial endtoxin & hyperchloestrolemia, radiation & cigarette smoking may be sources of endothelial injury.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>Irrespective of endothelial damage, the final event is exposure of the highly thrombogenic subendothelial extracellular matrix, mainly collagen & tissue factors up on which platelets undergo adherence & contact activation.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Turbulence or Stasis (Alterations in normal blood flow)</h3>
                        <p>Under physiologic conditions normal blood flow is laminar, that is, the cellular elements flow centrally in the vessel lumen separated from endothelium by slowing moving clear zone of plasma. Stasis & turbulence therefore:</p>
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li>Disrupt the laminar flow and bring platelets in to contact with the endothelium</li>
                            <li>Prevent dilution of activated clotting factors by freshly flowing blood</li>
                            <li>Retard or make a time lag in the inflow of clotting factor inhibitors and permit the buildup of thrombi.</li>
                            <li>Turbulence causes reduction in endothelial PGI2 and tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) which has fibrinolytic activity causing endothelial cell activation.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Stasis is a major factor in the development of venous thrombi while turbulence contributes to arterial & cardiac thrombosis by causing direct endothelial injury or by forming countercurrents & local pockets of stasis.</li>
                            <li>Examples:
                                <ol type="a">
                                    <li>Ulcerated atherosclerotic plaque, which forms a sort of irregularity on endothelial surface, not only exposes subendothelial extracellular matrix but are also sources of local turbulence.</li>
                                    <li>Aneurysms are favoured sites of stasis</li>
                                    <li>Myocardial infarction not only has endothelial injury but also has a region of noncontractile myocardium, creating an area of stasis resulting in mural thrombus formation.</li>
                                    <li>Mitral valve stenosis after chronic rheumatic fever may result in left atrial dilation, usually associated with arterial fibrillation. A dilated left atrium is a site of stasis & a prime location of thrombus development.</li>
                                    <li>Hypervisicosity syndrome, i.e an increase in hematocrit in excessive amount due to various reasons such as polycythemia causes stasis in small vessels.</li>
                                </ol>
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>HYPERCOAGULABLITY</h3>
                        <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Hypercoagulability is any alteration of the coagulation pathway that predisposes to thrombosis. Hypercoagulability is a less common cause of thrombosis & & it can be divided into:</p>

                            <li>Temporal arteries</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Damaged valves can be infected by bacteria or fungi (infective endocarditis) which lead to the development of small infected thrombi on the valves. These small infected thrombi (vegetations) can further damage the valve.</p>

                        <h3>Fates of a thrombus</h3>
                        <p>A thrombus can have one of the following fates:</p>
                        <p><strong>A: Propagation:</strong> The thrombus may accumulate more platelets and fibrin & propagate to cause vessel obstruction.</p>
                        <p><strong>B: Embolization:</strong> The thrombus may dislodge and travel to other sites in the vasculature. Such a traveling thrombus is called an embolus. An embolus may obstruct a vessel. The obstruction leads to the death of the tissue supplied by the blood vessel. Death of a tissue due to a decreased blood supply or drainage is called infarction. Therefore, an embolus can eventually lead to an infarction of an organ. E.g cerebral infarction can be caused by a thromboembolus.</p>
                        <p><strong>C: Dissolution:</strong> The thrombus may be removed by fibrinolytic activity.</p>
                        <p><strong>D: Organization and recanalization:</strong> Organization refers to the ingrowth of endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, and fibroblasts into the fibrin-rich thrombus. Organization is accompanied by the formation of capillary channels across the thrombus, re-establishing lumen continuity to some extent. This is known as recanalization. The recanalization eventually converts the thrombus into a vasscularized mass of tissue which is later on incorporated as a subendothelial swelling of the vessel wall.</p>

                        <h3>Clinical significance of thrombi</h3>

                        <h3>A. Venous Thrombosis (Phlebothrombosis)</h3>
                        <p>Venous thrombosis affects veins of the lower extremity in $90\%$ of cases. It can be divided into superficial & deep vein thrombosis:</p>

                        <h4>1. Superficial venous thrombosis</h4>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Usually occurs in saphenous venous system, particularly when there are varicosities.</li>
                            <li>Rarely embolizes</li>
                            <li>Causes local edema, pain, and tenderness (i.e. it is symptomatic)</li>
                            <li>Local edema due to impaired venous drainage predisposes the involved overlying skin to infection after slight trauma leading to a condition known as varicose ulcer.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>2. Deep venous thrombosis (DVT)</h4>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>May embolize, hence, is more serious.</li>
                            <li>Usually starts in deep veins within the calf muscles.</li>
                            <li>Although they may cause local pain & edema, unlike superficial veinous thrombosis, they are entirely asymptomatic in approximately $50\%$ of patients. This is because deep venous obstruction is rapidly offset or relieved by collateral bypass channels.</li>
                            <li>Has higher incidence in middle aged & elderly people due to increased platelet aggregation & reduced PGI2 production by the endothelium.</li>
                            <li>Has the following predisposing factors:
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Trauma, surgery, burns which usually result in:-
                                        <ol type="i">
                                            <li>Reduced physical activity leading to stasis</li>
                                            <li>Injury to vessels</li>
                                            <li>Release of procagulant substance from the tissue</li>
                                            <li>Reduced t-PA activity (fibrinolysis)</li>
                                        </ol>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Pregnancy & puerperal states increase coagulation factors & reduce the synthesis of antithrombotic substances. Myocardial infarction & heart failure cause venous stasis to the left side.</li>
                                    <li>Malnutrition, debilitating conditions and wasting diseases such as cancer. DVT due to these conditions is known as marantic thrombosis.</li>
                                    <li>Inflammation of veins (thrombophlebitis) also predisposes to thrombosis.</li>
                                    <li>Migratory thrombophlebitis is a condition that affects various veins throughout the body & is usually of obscure aetiology, but sometimes it is associated with cancer, particularly pancreatic cancer. Migratory thrombophlebitis is also known as Trosseau syndrome.</li>
                                </ol>
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>B. Arterial Thrombosis</h3>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>The rapid flow of arterial blood prevents the occurrence of thrombosis unless the vessel wall is abnormal.</li>
                            <li>In western society, atheroma is by far the commonest predisposing lesion for arterial thrombosis. Atheromatous plaques produce turbulence and may ulcerate & cause endothelial injury, both of which can lead to thrombosis. These thrombi may narrow or occlude the lumen of arteries such as the coronary and cerebral arteries. Occlusion of these arteries will lead to myocardial infarction (MI) & cerebral infarction respectively.</li>
                            <li>Cardiac thrombi can be caused by infective endocarditis, atrial fibrillation,& myocardial infarcion.</li>
                            <li>Cardiac thrombosis is common on the heart valves & in the auricular appendages (especially, of the right atrium). A thrombus develops in the atrium in patients with atrial fibrillation & dilatation superimposed on mitral stenosis.</li>
                            <li>Myocardial infarction causes dyskinetic myocardial contraction & damage to the endocardium, which usually result in mural thrombi in the ventricles.</li>
                            <li>Apart from obstructive features, arterial thrombi (especially, cardiac mural thrombi) may embolize to any tissue, but, particularly, commonly to the brain, kidney, & spleen because of large volume of blood flow to these organs.</li>

                        <p>Unless otherwise specified, the term embolism should be considered to mean thromboembolism. This is because thromboembolism is the commonest form of embolism.</p>

                        <p><strong>Thromboembolism:</strong> Based on its sites of origin & impaction, thromboembolism can be divided into:</p>
                        <p>a) Pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE)</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>PTE refers to the impaction of an embolus in the pulmonary arteries & their branches. Such an embolus is derived from a thrombus in the systemic veins or the right side of the heart.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>b) Systemic thromboembolism</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Systemic emboli arise from the left side of the heart or from thrombi & atheromatous debris in large arteries. And they impact in the systemic arteries.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>c) Crossed embolism (Paradoxical embolism)</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>This occurs in the presence of patent foremen ovale when an embolus is transferred from the right to the left side of the heart, then into the systemic circulation.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>PULMONARY THROMBEOMBLISM (PTE)</h3>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>$95\%$ of PTE arise from thrombi in the deep leg veins. The thromboembolus will travel long with the venous return & reach the right side of the heart. From there, it will go into the pulmonary trunk & pulmonary arteries. Depending on the size of the embolus and on the state of pulmonary circulation, the pulmonary embolism can have the following effects:
                                <ol type="i">
                                    <li>If the thrombus is large, it may block the outflow tract of the right ventricle or the bifurcation of the main pulmonary trunk (saddle embolus) or both of its branches, causing sudden death by circulatory arrest. Sudden death, right side heart failure (cor pulmonale), or cardiovascular collapse occurs when $60\%$ or more of the pulmonary circulation is obstructed with emboli.</li>
                                    <li>If the embolus is very small (as in $60-80\%$ of the cases), the pulmonary emboli will be clinically silent. Embolic obstruction of medium sized arteries manifests as pulmonary haemorrhage but usually does not cause infarction because of dual blood inflow to the area from the bronchial circulation.</li>
                                    <li>If the cardiorespiratory condition of the patient is poor (i.e., if the patient previously had cardiac or pulmonary disease), then obstruction of a medium sized pulmonary artery by a medium-sized embolus can lead to pulmonary infarction.</li>
                                    <li>Recurrent thromboembolism can lead to pulmonary hypertension in the long run.</li>
                                </ol>
                            </li>
                            <li>A patient who has had one pulmonary embolus is at high risk of having more.</li>

                            <li>Most systemic emboli ( $80\%$ ) arise from intracardiac mural thrombi. In turn, two thirds of intracardiac mural thrombi are associated with left ventricular wall infarcts and another quarter with dilated left atria secondary to rheumatic valvular heart disease.</li>
                            <li>The remaining ( $20\%$ ) of systemic emboli arise from aortic aneurysm, thrombi on ulcerated athrosclerotic plaques, or fragmentation of valvular vegetation.</li>
                            <li>Unlike venous emboli, which tend to lodge primarily in one vascular bed (the lung), arterial emboli can travel to a wide variety of sites. The major sites for arteriolar embolization are the lower extremities ($75\%$) & the brain ($10\%$), with the rest lodging in the intestines, kidney, & spleen. The emboli may obstruct the arterial blood flow to the tissue distal to the site of the obstruction. This obstruction may lead to infarction. The infarctions, in turn, will lead to different clinical features which vary according to the organ involved.</li>

                        <h3>Rare forms of embolism.</h3>
                        <h4>FAT EMBOLISM</h4>
                        <p>Fat embolism usually follows fracture of bones and other type of tissue injury. After the injury, globules of fat frequently enter the circulation. Although traumatic fat embolisms occur usually it is as symptomatic in most cases and fat is removed. But in some severe injuries the fat emboli may cause occlusion of pulmonary or cerebral microvasculature and fat embolism syndrome may result. Fat embolism syndrome typically begins 1 to 3 days after injury during which the raised tissue pressure caused by swelling of damaged tissue forces fat into marrow sinsosoid & veins. The features of this syndrome are a sudden onset of dyspnea, blood stained sputum, taccycardia, mental confusion with neurologic symptoms including irritability & restlessness, sometimes progress to delirium & coma.</p>

                        <h4>AIR EMBOLISM</h4>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Gas bubbles within the circulation can obstruct vascular flow and cause distal ischemic injury almost as readily as thrombotic masses. Air may enter the circulation during:
                                <ol type="a">
                                    <li>Obstetric procedures</li>
                                    <li>Chest wall injury</li>
                                    <li>In deep see divers & under water construction workers.</li>
                                    <li>In individuals in unpressurized aircrafts</li>
                                    <li>Neck wounds penetrating the large veins</li>
                                    <li>Cardio thoracic surgery.</li>
                                    <li>Arterial catheterisation & intravenous infusion. Etc.</li>
                                </ol>
                            </li>
                            <li>Generally, in excesses of 100 cc is required to have a clinical effect and 300 cc or more may be fatal. The bubbles act like physical obstructions and may coalesce to form a frothy mass sufficiently large to occlude major vessels.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>AMNIOTIC FLUID EMBOLISM</h4>
                        <p>It is a grave but uncommon, unpredictable complication of labour which may complicate vaginal delivery, caesarean delivery and abortions. It had mortality rate over $80\%$. The amniotic fluid containing fetal material enters via the placental bed & the ruptured uterine veins. The onset is characterized by sudden severe dyspnea, cyanosis, hypotensive shock followed by seizure & coma of the labouring mother. If the patient survives the initial crisis, pulmonary oedema typically develops & $50\%$ of the cases will develop DIC due to activation of the coagulation cascade by fetal material.</p>

                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>The following organs have a dual blood supply.
                                <ol type="a">
                                    <li>Lung: pulmonary artery and Bronchial artery</li>

                            </li>
                            <li>The effect of such a dual blood supply is that if there is obsrtuction of one of the arterial supplies, the other one may offset the rapid occurrence of infarction in these organs unlike the renal & splenic circulations which have end arterial supply.</li>
                            <li>Infarction caused by venous thrombosis is more likely to occur in organs with single venous outflow channels, such as testis &ovary.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Rate of development occlusion</h3>

                            <li>Slowly developing occlusions are less likely to cause infarction since they provide time for the development of collaterals.</li>

                            <li>The susceptibility of a tissue to hypoxia influences the likelihood of infarction. Neurons undergo irreversible damage when deprived of their blood supply for only 3 to 4 minutes.</li>
                            <li>Myocardial cells die after 20-30 minutes of ischemia. Fibroblasts are more resistant, especially those in the myocardium.</li>

                        <p>Infarcts are classified depending on:</p>
                        <p>A) The basis of their colour (reflecting the amount of haemorrhage) into:</p>
                        <ol type="i">
                            <li>Hemorrhagic (Red) infarcts</li>
                            <li>Anemic (White) infarcts</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>B) The presence or absence of microbial infection into:</p>
                        <ol type="i">
                            <li>Septic infarcts</li>

                        </ol>

                        <p><strong>1. Red infarcts occur in:</strong></p>
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li>Venous occlusions as in ovarian torsion</li>
                            <li>Loose tissues such as the lung which allow blood to collect in infarct zone.</li>
                            <li>Tissues with dual circulations (eg. the lung), permitting flow of blood from unobstructed vessel in to necrotic zone.</li>
                            <li>In tissues that were previously congested because of sluggish outflow of blood.</li>
                            <li>When blood flow is reestablished to a site of previous arterial occlusion & necrosis.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <p><strong>2. White infarcts occur in:</strong></p>
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li>Arterial occlusion in organs with a single arterial blood supply.</li>
                            <li>Solid organs such as the heart, spleen, & kidney, where the solidity of the tissue limits the amount of hemorrhage that can percolate or seep in to the area of ischemic necrosis from the nearby capillaries.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3>Morphology of infarcts</h3>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li><strong>Gross:</strong> All infarcts are wedge-shaped with the occluded vessel at the apex and the periphery of the organ forming the base of the wedge. The infarction will induce inflammation in the tissue surrounding the area of infarction. Following inflammation, some of the infarcts may show recovery, however, most are ultimately replaced with scars except in the brain.</li>
                            <li><strong>Microscopy:</strong> The dominant histologic feature of infarction is ischemic coagulative necrosis. The brain is an exception to this generalization, where liquefactive necrosis is common.</li>
                        </ul>

                            <li>A fatal increase in intracranial pressure may occur due to swelling of large cerebral infarction, as recent infarcts are raised above the surface since hypoxic cells lack the ability to maintain ionic gradients & they absorb water & swell.</li>
                            <li>Is one type of cerebrovascular accidents (CVA) or stroke which has various clinical manifestations.</li>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p><strong>Definition:</strong> -DIC is an acute, or chronic thrombohaemorrhagic disorder occurring as a result of progressive activation of coagulation pathway beyond physiologic set point secondary to a variety of diseases resulting in failure of all components of haemostasis. Hence the other term for DIC is consumption coagulopathy.</p>

                        <h3>Etiology and Pathogenesis</h3>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>At the outset, it must be emphasize that DIC is not a primary disease. It is a coagulopathy that occurs in the course of variety of clinical conditions. DIC follows massive or prolonged release of soluble tissue factors & /or endothelial-derived thromboplastin into the circulation with generalized (pathologic) activation of coagulation system.</li>
                            <li>Therefore, DIC results from pathologic activation of the extrinsic & /or intrinsic pathways of coagulation or impairment of clot inhibiting influences by different causes. Two major mechanisms activating the coagulation pathway to cause DIC are: (1) release of tissue factor or thromboplastic substance into the circulation (2) widespread injury to the endothelial cells.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p><strong>1. Tissue thromboplastin substance may be derived from a variety of sources such as:</strong></p>
                        <ol type="i">
                            <li>Massive trauma, severe burns & extensive surgery. The major mechanism of DIC is believed to be auto infusion of thromboplastin from the tissues.</li>
                            <li>Obstetric conditions in which thromboplastin derived from the placenta, dead retained fetus, or amniotic fluid may enter the circulation. .</li>
                            <li>Cancers such as acute promyelocytic leukaemia, adenocarcinoma of the lung in which a variety of thromboplastin substances like mucus are released which directly activate factor X, VII, & proteolytic enzymes.</li>
                            <li>Gram negative sepsis (an important cause of DIC) in which bacterial endotoxins cause increased synthesis, membrane exposure, & release of tissue factor from monocytes. Furthermore, activated monocytes release intereukin-1 (IL-I), TNF-a, both of which:
                                <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                    <li>Increase expression of tissue factor in endothelial membrane.</li>
                                    <li>Decrease expression of thrombmodulin which is a potent activator of protein Can anti coagulant</li>
                                    <li>TNF-a, an extremely important mediator of septic shock, in addition to the above, up regulates the expression of adhesion molecules on endothelial cells and favours adhesion of leukocytes, with subsequent damage of endothelial cells by free radicals & preformed proteases.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ol>

                        <p><strong>2. Endothelial injury:</strong> Widespread endothelial injury may result from:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Deposition of antigen-antibody complexes as it occurs in systemic lupus erythematosus</li>
                            <li>Extreme temperature eg. Heat stroke, burns</li>
                            <li>Hypoxia, acidosis, shock</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Clinical Course</h3>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>The consequences of DIC are twofold. First, there is a widespread deposition of fibrin within the microcirculation. This may lead to ischemia of the more severely affected or more vulnerable organs and hemolytic anemia resulting from fragmentation of led cells as they squeeze through the narrowed microvasculature (Microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia).</li>
                            <li>Second, a hemorrhagic diathesis may dominate the clinical picture because of consumption of the coagulation factors and increased fibrinolysis.</li>
                            <li>The onset may be fulminant when caused by endotoxic shock or amniotic fluid embolism or it may be chronic in the case of carcinomatosis or retention of dead fetus. The clinical presentation varies with stage & severity of the syndrome. Overall $50\%$ of patients with DIC are obstetric patients & about $33\%$ of patients have carcinomatosis.</li>
                            <li>Clinically, patients with DIC may present with extensive skin & mucus membrane bleeding and haemorrhage from multiple sites, usually from surgical incision, vein punctures, or catheter sites. Respiratory symptoms such as dyspnea, cyanosis may occur. They may present with convulsion & coma in the case of CNS bleeding or with acute renal failure with oliguria. Less often, they may present with cyanosis, pre-gangrenous changes in the digits, genitalia, & nose areas where blood flow may be markedly decreased. Circulatory failure may appear suddenly & may be progressing. The presentations of acute DIC, as it occurs in case of trauma or obstetric conditions, are dominated by bleeding diathesis.</li>
                            <li>Laboratory manifestations include thrombocytopenia secondary to platelets aggregation in the thrombus, schistocytes or fragmented RBCs, prolonged PT, PTT, thrombin time & reduced fibrinogen from depleted coagulation proteins. There is also increased fibrin degradation product (FDP) from intense fibrinolysis. The cardinal manifestation of DIC, which correlates most closely with bleeding is plasma fibrinogen level, i.e. low fibrinogen means increased tendency of bleeding.</li>

                            <li><strong>Definition:</strong> Shock is a state in which there is failure of the circulatory system to maintain adequate cellular perfusion resulting in widespread reduction in delivery of oxygen & other nutrients to tissues. In shock, the mean arterial pressure is less than $60 \mathrm{mmHg}$ or the systolic blood pressure is less than $90 \mathrm{mmHg}$.</li>
                            <li>Regardless of the underlying pathology, shock constitutes systemic hypoperfusion due to reduction either in cardiac output or in the effective circulating blood volume.</li>
                            <li>The end results are hypotension followed by impaired tissue perfusion and cellular hypoxia.</li>
                            <li>Adequate organ perfusion depends on arterial blood pressure (BP) which, in turn, depends on:
                                <ol type="i">
                                    <li>Cardiac output (CO)</li>
                                    <li>Peripheral vascular resistance (PVR)</li>
                                </ol>
                            </li>
                            <li>$CO = \text{stroke volume} \times \text{heart rate}$</li>
                            <li>In turn, stroke volume depends on:
                                <ol type="a">
                                    <li>Preload i.e. blood volume,</li>
                                    <li>Afterload i.e. arterial resistance, &</li>
                                    <li>Myocardial contractility.</li>
                                </ol>
                            </li>
                            <li>Therefore, shock (i.e. widespread decreased perfusion of tissues) occurs when the preload (i.e. the blood volume) is decreased, or when the afterload (the peripheral vascular resistance) is decreased, or when the myocardium fails to contract. These basic mechanisms of shock are used to classify it.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Classification of shock.</h3>
                        <p>Shock can be divided into:</p>
                        <ol type="i">
                            <li>Hypovolemic shock</li>
                            <li>Cardiogenic shock</li>
                            <li>Distributive shock</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h4>HYPOVOLEMIC SHOCK</h4>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li><strong>Definition:</strong> This is shock caused by reduced blood volume. Reduction in circulating blood volume results in the reduction of the preload which leads to inadequate left ventricular filling, reflected as decreased left & right ventricular end diastolic volume and pressure. The reduced preload culminates in decreased cardiac output which leads to widespread tissue perfusion (shock).</li>
                            <li>Causes of hypovolumic shock include:
                                <ol type="a">
                                    <li>Haemorrhage</li>
                                    <li>Diarrhoea & vomiting</li>
                                    <li>Burns</li>
                                    <li>Trauma, etc</li>
                                </ol>
                            </li>
                            <li>The effect of haemorrhage depends on the rate and amount of blood loss. Hypovolumic shock is the most common type of shock in clinical medicine .A normal healthy adult can lose $550 \mathrm{ml}$ ( $10\%$ of blood volume) without significant symptoms. But loss of $25\%$ or more of the blood volume ($N=1250 \mathrm{ml}$) results in significant hypovolemia.</li>

                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Septic shock has a mortality rate of over $50\%$ ranking the first among the causes of death in intensive care units. It results from the spread & expansion of an initially localized infection like pneumonia into the blood stream.</li>
                            <li>Most causes of septic shock ( $\sim 70\%$ ) are caused by endotoxin-producing gram-negative bacilli, hence the term endotoxic shock. Endotoxins are bacterial wall lipopolyssacharides (LPS) released when cell walls are degraded. Analogues molecules in the walls of gram positive bacteria & fungi can also elicit septic shock. LPS bind with CD14 molecule on leucocytes, especially monocytes & macrophages, endothelial cells & others. Depending on the dosage of LPS • protein complex, initiation of a cascade of cytokine-mediated events take place.</li>
                            <li>The mononuclear phagocytes respond to LPS by producing TNF which, in turn, induces IL • 1 synthesis. TNF & IL-1 both act on endothelial cells to produce further cytokines like IL-6, IL-8, & secondary effectors like NO & PAF (platelet aggregating factor).</li>
                            <li>High levels of the above molecules or mediators (TNF-a, IL-1, etc ⋅ ) cause septic shock by acting on:
                                <ol type="i">
                                    <li>The heart causing decreased myocardial contractility which results in low cardiac output,</li>
                                    <li>Blood vessel • causing systemic vasodilatation which decreases the peripheral arteries.</li>
                                    <li>The mediators also cause widespread endothelial injury & activation of the coagulation system resulting in DIC, &</li>
                                    <li>Lung • causing alveolar capillary damage resulting in adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).</li>

                        <h3>Stages of shock</h3>
                        <p>Uncorrected shock passes through 3 important stages:</p>
                        <h4>1) An initial nonprogressive phase</h4>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>It is also called a period of early compensatory period, during which compensatory mechanisms are activated & perfusion of vital organs maintained.</li>
                            <li>Mechanisms
                                <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                    <li>A variety of neurohumoral mechanisms operate:
                                        <ol type="i">
                                            <li>A decrease in cardiac output will stimulate peripheral & central baro receptors with subsequent intense sympatho-adrenal stimulation. This sometimes leads to up to 200 fold increase in plasma catecholamine level. The net effect is tachycardia, CO, Peripheral vasoconstriction and BP. This is a major autocompensatory response.</li>
                                            <li>The fall in renal perfusion stimulates the renin - aldosterone secretion mechanism. renal conservation of fluid.</li>
                                        </ol>
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>2. Progressive stage (Established shock)</h4>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>This is characterized by tissue hypoperfusion with onset of worsening circulatory & metabolic imbalances including acidosis.</li>
                            <li>There is a widespread tissue hypoxia.</li>
                            <li>Anaerobic glycolysis results in excessive lactic acid production. The lactic acid reduces tissue PH & blunts vasomotor response. The hypoxic cells leak glucose leading to insulin-resistant hyperglycaemia and increased glycogenolysis. Impaired carbohydrate metabolism causes a fall in production of ATP, failure in function of Na+-K+ ATPase, result in Na & water entrance into the cell, causing cellular swelling also called sick cell syndrome. Anoxic injury to endothelial cells results in DIC.</li>
                        </ul>

                            <li>All organs are affected in severe shock. In shock, there is widespread tissue hypoperfusion involving various organs such as the heart, brain, & kidney. This leads to widespread hypoxic tissue necrosis. The widespread tissue necrosis manifests as multiple organ dysfunction [MODS]. Various organs may fail to perform their normal functions. And lungs may show ARDS or Shock lung.</li>
