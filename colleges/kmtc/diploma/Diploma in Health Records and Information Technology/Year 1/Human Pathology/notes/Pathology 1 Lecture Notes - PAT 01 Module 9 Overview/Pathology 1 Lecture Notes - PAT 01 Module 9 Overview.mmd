\section*{UNIT 1: INTRODUCTION TO CELL PATHOLOGY}
- Pathology • from latin; Pathos= suffering (disease); Logos= study

Study of suffering (diseases) by scientific methods
- Pathology is the bridging discipline between basic science and clinical practice.
- Pathology deals with the structural and functional changes in the cells, tissues and organs that underlie disease.
- Pathology attempts to explain the why and wherefore and of signs and symptoms manifested by the patients by use of molecular, microbiologic, immunologic, and morphologic techniques.

\section*{Branches of pathology}
- Traditionally, the study of pathology is divided into;
- General pathology
- Systemic pathology
- General pathology is concerned with basic reactions of cells and tissues to abnormal stimuli that underlie all diseases.
- Systemic pathology or special pathology deals with the specific responses of specialized organs and tissues to more or less well defined stimuli.

\section*{Aspects of disease process that forms the core of pathology}
- Pathology gives explanations of a disease by studying the following aspects of disease
i. Etiology o cause of disease
ii. Pathogenesis • mechanism of diseases
iii. Pathological (morphological) changes • structural alterations • lesion
iv. Clinical feature • functional consequences of morphologic changes; Leads to signs and symptoms of patients
v. Complication
vi. Prognosis o prediction of the future of the victim

\section*{Normal cell homeostasis}
- The normal cell is confined to a fairly narrow range of function and structure by its genetic programs of metabolism, differentiation, and specialization, by constraints of neighboring cells and by the availability of metabolic substrates. It is able to handle normal physiologic demands which are called normal homeostasis.

\section*{General main causes of diseases}
- Can be divided into;

\section*{A) congenital causes}
- Genetic - inherited =cystic fibrosis;
-Spontaneous $=$ Down . s syndrome
- Non genetic causes - environmental.

Accidental • cerebral palsy (birth hypoxia).

\section*{B) Acquired causes}
i. Inflammation (bodies response to injury) e.g. appendicitis, TB
ii. Injury/trauma, disordered repair e.g. fracture, ASA induced PUD
iii. Hemodynamic disorder e.g. shock
iv. Growth disorders e.g. neoplasia
v. Immune disorders e.g. AIDS, Graves disease
vi. Metabolic disorders e.g. Diabetes
vii. Degeneration disorders e.g. osteoarthritis
viii. Iatrogenic diseases e.g. Cushing syndrome - excess steroids; Aplastic Anemia - chloramphenicol.

\section*{Diagnostic techniques used in pathology}
- The pathologist uses the following techniques to diagnose diseases:
i. Histopathology
ii. Cytopathology
iii. Hematopathology
iv. Immunohistochemistry
v. Microbiological examination
vi. Biochemical examination
vii. Cytogenetics
viii. Molecular techniques
ix. Autopsy

\section*{Histopathological techniques}
- Histopathological examination studies tissues under the microscope. During this study, the pathologist looks for abnormal structures in the tissue.
- Tissues for histopathological examination are obtained by biopsy. Biopsy is a tissue sample from a living person to identify the disease. Biopsy can be either incisional or excisional.
- Once the tissue is removed from the patient, it has to be immediately fixed by putting it into adequate amount of $10 \%$ Formaldehyde ( $10 \%$ formalin) before sending it to the pathologist.
- The purpose of fixation is:
1. To prevent autolysis and bacterial decomposition and putrefaction
2. To coagulate the tissue to prevent loss of easily diffusible substances
3. To fortify the tissue against the deleterious effects of the various stages in the preparation of sections and tissue processing.
4. To leave the tissues in a condition which facilitates differential staining with dyes and other reagents.
- Once the tissue arrives at the pathology department, the pathologists will exam it macroscopically (i.e. naked-eye examination of tissues).
- Then the tissue is processed to make it ready for microscopic examination. The whole purpose of the tissue processing is to prepare a very thin tissue (i.e. five to seven $\mu \mathrm{m}$ or one cell thick tissue) which can be clearly seen under the microscope. The tissue is processed by putting it into different chemicals. It is then impregnated (embedded) in paraffin, sectioned (cut) into thin slices, \& is finally stained. The stains can be Hematoxylin/Eosin stain or special stains such as PAS, Immunohistochemistry, etc...
- The Hematoxylin/Eosin stain is usually abbreviated as H\&E stain. The H\&E stain is routinely used. It gives the nucleus a blue color \& the cytoplasm \& the extracellular matrix a pinkish color. Then the pathologist will look for abnormal structures in the tissue.
- And based on this abnormal morphology he/she will make the diagnosis. Histopathology is usually the gold standard for pathologic diagnosis.

Cytopathologic techniques: Cytopathology is the study of cells from various body sites to determine the cause or nature of disease.

\section*{Applications of cytopathology:}
- The main applications of cytology include the following:
1. Screening for the early detection of asymptomatic cancer. For example, the examination of scrapings from cervix for early detection and prevention of cervical cancer.
2. Diagnosis of symptomatic cancer. Cytopathology may be used alone or in conjunction with other modalities to diagnose tumors revealed by physical or radiological examinations.

It can be used in the diagnosis of cysts, inflammatory conditions and infections of various organs.
3. Surveillance of patients treated for cancer. For some types of cancers, cytology is the most feasible method of surveillance to detect recurrence. The best example is periodic urine cytology to monitor the recurrence of cancer of the urinary tract.

\section*{Advantages of cytologic examination}
- Compared to histopathologic technique it is cheap, takes less time and needs no anesthesia to take specimens. Therefore, it is appropriate for developing countries with
limited resources like Kenya. In addition, it is complementary to histopathological examination.

\section*{Cytopathologic methods}
- There are different cytopathologic methods including:

\section*{1. Fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC)}
- In FNAC, cells are obtained by aspirating the diseased organ using a very thin needle under negative pressure. Virtually any organ or tissue can be sampled by fine-needle aspiration.
- The aspirated cells are then stained \& are studied under the microscope. Superficial organs (e.g. thyroid, breast, lymph nodes, skin and soft tissues) can be easily aspirated. Deep organs, such as the lung, mediastinum, liver, pancreas, kidney, adrenal gland, and retroperitoneum are aspirated with guidance by fluoroscopy, ultrasound or CT scan.
- FNAC is cheap, fast, \& accurate in diagnosing many diseases.

\section*{2. Exfoliative cytology}
- Refers to the examination of cells that are shed spontaneously into body fluids or secretions. Examples include sputum, cerebrospinal fluid, urine, effusions in body cavities (pleura, pericardium, peritoneum), nipple discharge and vaginal discharge.

\section*{3. Abrasive cytology}
- Refers to methods by which cells are dislodged by various tools from body surfaces (skin, mucous membranes, and serous membranes). E.g. preparation of cervical smears with a spatula or a small brush to detect cancer of the uterine cervix at early stages. Such cervical smears, also called Pap smears, can significantly reduce the mortality from cervical cancer.

Hematological examination: This is a method by which abnormalities of the cells of the blood and their precursors in the bone marrow are investigated to diagnose the different kinds of anemia \& leukemia.

Immunohistochemistry: This is a method is used to detect a specific antigen in the tissue in order to identify the type of disease.

Microbiological examination: This is a method, by which body fluids, excised tissue, etc. are examined by microscopical, cultural and serological techniques to identify micro-organisms responsible for many diseases.

Biochemical examination: This is a method by which the metabolic disturbances of disease are investigated by assay of various normal and abnormal compounds in the blood, urine, etc.

Clinical genetics (cytogenetics): This is a method in which inherited chromosomal abnormalities in the germ cells or acquired chromosomal abnormalities in somatic cells are investigated using the techniques of molecular biology.

Molecular techniques: Different molecular techniques such as fluorescent in situ hybridization, Southern blot, etc. can be used to detect genetic diseases.

Autopsy: Autopsy is examination of the dead body to identify the cause of death. This can be for forensic or clinical purposes.

The relative importance of each of the above disciplines to our understanding of disease varies for different types of diseases. For example, in diabetes mellitus, biochemical investigation provides the best means of diagnosis and is of greatest value in the control of the disease, whereas in the diagnosis of tumors, FNAC \& histopathology contribute much.

However, for most diseases, diagnosis is based on a combination of pathological investigations.

\section*{CELLULAR INJURY AND ADAPTATION}
- These are the visible changes that occur in cells as a result of exposure to causative agents of disease; the degree of these changes varies according to the severity and duration of the damaging process.
- Cellular adaptation is a state that lies intermediate between the normal, unstressed cell and injured overstressed cells. Cells must continuously adapt, even under normal conditions, to changes in their environment.
- Somewhat more excessive physiologic stress or some pathologic stimuli can bring about a number of physiologic and morphologic changes in which a new but altered steady state is achieved while preserving the viability of the cells is cell adaptation.
- Cell injury can be divided into:
i. Reversible cell injury; indicating that the changes will regress and disappear when the injurious agent is removed and the cell will return to the normal morphologically and physiologically.
ii. Irreversible cell injury; occur when the injury is persistent or when it is severe from the onset. Here the cell alterations reach the point of no return and progression to cell death is inevitable.

\section*{Classification of injurious agents}
- Injurious agents can be classified into;
- Hypoxia (oxygen deprivation)
- Physical agents
- Chemical agents
- Infectious agents
- Immunological reactions
- Genetic derangements
- Nutritional imbalance

\section*{Hypoxia}
- Refers to a decrease in oxygen supply to the cells. It acts through interference with oxidative respiration of cells.
- Hypoxia results from;
- Loss of blood supply (ischaemia), which is the most common cause and occur when arterial flow is interfered with by e.g. narrowing of the lumen of an artery by atherosclerosis, thrombi or emboli.
- Inadequate blood oxygenation due to, for example, cardiac failure and /or respiratory failure.
- Decrease in oxygen carrying capacity of the blood e.g. Anaemia and carbon monoxide poisoning.
- Depending on the severity and duration of hypoxia, the cells may show one of the following;
- Adaptive atrophy (shrink in size)
- Injury
- Necrosis (the morphological expression of cell death)

\section*{Physical agents}
- That include;
- mechanical trauma
- Extremes of temperature; Deep cold and Extreme heat
- Radiation
- Electric shock
- Sudden change in atmospheric pressure
- These agents apply excess physical energy, in any form, to the body.

\section*{Chemical agents}

That include;
- Simple chemicals such as glucose and salt in hypertonic solution
- Oxygen in high concentration
- Poisons such as arsenic or cyanide
- Air pollutions
- Insecticides
- Occupational exposures e.g. Asbestos
- Social poisons such as Alcohol and narcotic drugs

\section*{Infectious agents and infestations}

That includes viruses, bacteria, fungi, parasites

\section*{Immunological factors}

These are primarily protective defense mechanisms against, for example, infectious agents; however they are sometimes harmful and injurious e.g.
- Hypersensitivity reactions - (exaggerated immune response to an antigen which may be triggered e.g. by drugs)
- Autoimmune disease - Directed to self antigens E.g. type 1 diabetes.
- Immunodeficiency - this is due to a deficiency component of the immune system which leads to increased susceptibility to different diseases e.g. HIV/AIDS.

\section*{Genetic derangements}

Exemplified by the wide range of hereditary diseases that range from those that are the result of gross chromosomal defects leading to severe congenital malformations e.g. Down □ syndrome, to those that are caused by a single amino acid substitution in the structure of the haemoglobin leading to the synthesis of abnormal Hb e.g. Hbs in sickle cell.

\section*{Nutritional factors}

Deficiency of nutrients; these arise as a result of poor supply, interference with absorption, inefficient transport within the body, or defective utilization as of proteins • calorie malnutrition or vitamin deficiency.

Excesses as of lipids that leads to obesity with all its consequences including fatty changes in cells and predisposition to atherosclerosis.

\section*{Course of disease}
- The course of disease is shown with a simplified diagram as follows:

Exposure - Biological onset - Clinical onset -Permanent damage- Death

\section*{Latency period}
- The course of disease in the absence of any intervention is called the natural history of disease. The different stages in the natural history of disease include:
i. Exposure to various risk factors (causative agents).
ii. Latency, period between exposure and biological onset of disease
iii. Biological onset of disease; this marks the initiation of the disease process, however, without any symptom sign of disease. Following biological onset of disease, it may remain asymptomatic or subclinical (i.e. without any clinical manifestations) or may lead to overt clinical disease.
iv. Incubation (induction) period refers to variable period of time without any obvious signs and symptoms from the time of exposure.
v. The clinical onset of disease is when the signs and symptoms become apparent. The expression of the disease may variable in severity or in terms of range of manifestations.
vi. The onset of permanent damage, and
vii. Death.

Natural recovery, i.e. recovery without any intervention, can occur at any stage in the progression of the disease.

\section*{Outcome and consequences of disease}
- Resolution can occur without any sequelae.
- The disease can settle down, but sequelae are left.
- It may result in death.

\section*{Clinical and biological death}
a) Clinical death
- Clinical death is the reversible transmission between life and biologic death. Clinical death is defined as the period of respiratory, circulatory and brain arrest during which initiation of resuscitation can lead to recovery.
- Clinical death begins with either the last agonal inhalation or the last cardiac contraction.
- Signs indicating clinical death are;
- The patient is without pulse or blood pressure and is completely unresponsive to the most painful stimulus.
- The pupils are widely dilated.
- Some reflex to external stimulation is preserved. For example, during intubations, respiration may be restored in response to stimulation of the receptors of the superior laryngeal nerve, the nucleus of which is located in the medulla oblongata near the respiratory centre.
- Recovery can occur with resuscitation.
b) Biological death
- Biological death (sure sign of death), which sets in after clinical death, is an irreversible state of cellular destruction. It manifests with irreversible cessation of circulatory and respiratory functions, or irreversible cessation of all functions of the entire brain, including brain stem.

\section*{CELLULAR RESPONSES (REACTIONS) TO INJURIOUS STIMULI}

Include;
1. Cellular adaptations
- Atrophy
- Hypertrophy
- Hyperplasia
- Metaplasia
2. Acute cell injury
- Reversible cell injury; cellular swelling and fatty change
- Irreversible cell injury (cell death); necrosis and apoptosis
3. Other patterns
- Intracellular accumulation; occurs as a result of derangement in metabolism or excessive storage.
- Pathologic calcification; a common consequence of cell and tissue injury
- Subcellular alteration and cell inclusions; occur as a response to more chronic or persistent injurious stimuli

\section*{MECHANISMS OF CELL INJURY}

Injurious agents induce cell injury through their effects on one or more of the following cellular targets;
a) Aerobic respiration
b) Cell membrane
c) Protein synthesis
d) Cytoskeleton
e) Genetic apparatus (chromosomes and their contents of genes)

\section*{Factors influencing the severity of cell injury}
- Type, duration, and severity of the injurious agents
- Type of the cells affected; cells differ in their susceptibility to the effects of injurious agents, for example;

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline Type of cell & Susceptibility to damage by ischaemia & Time of damage \\
\hline Neurons & High & 3 to 5 minutes \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
-Myocardial cells \\
-Hepatocytes
\end{tabular} & Intermediate & 30 to 60 minutes \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
-Skeletal muscles \\
-Epidermis of skin \\
-Fibroblast
\end{tabular} & Low & Many hours \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\section*{Types of cell and tissue damage}

\section*{1. Cell death;}
- This is irreversible process
- It is of two types;
- Apoptosis
- Necrosis

\section*{2. Degeneration;}

This is reversible process. It includes all the changes in the cells which is short of necrosis (i.e. before the stage of cell death and necrosis); e.g.
- Fatty changes
- Pigmentation

\section*{APOPTOSIS}
- Is programmed cell death; it is a physiological process by which cells are eliminated when they are no longer required by the body. It is part of normal turnover of body cells.
- Here, there is no inflammatory reaction against apoptosis because it is a normal physiological process.
- The cells become shrunk and compact and become eosinophilic in colour. Later it is fragmented and then other cells in the body will come and eat these fragments by a process called phagocytosis.
- Apoptosis is an irreversible process e.g. include;
- During embryogenesis i.e. it is responsible for shaping various organs and structures (morphogenesis).
- Hormone - dependent innovation e.g.
a) Physiological e.g. involution of endometrium during the menstrual cycle or lactating breast after weaning.
b) Pathological e.g. atrophy of prostate after castration.

\section*{NECROSIS}
- Is a morphological change that follows cell death in living tissues or organs.
- Necrosis represents cell death while still forming a part of the living body.
- It is always pathological and it occurs as a result of severe cell damage.
- It is always associated with inflammatory reactions.
- Necrosis results from the degrading actions of enzymes on irreversibly damaged cells with denaturation of cellular protein.
- In necrosis, there is cytoplasmic as well as nuclear changes.
a) Cytoplasmic changes
- In the haematoxylin • Eosin stain ( $\mathrm{H} \& \mathrm{E}$ ), the haematoxylin stain acidic materials (including the nucleus) blue, where as eosin stains alkaline materials (including cytoplasm) pink. The necrotic cells are more eosinophilic than viable cells (i.e. more intensely pinkish). This is due to:
- Loss of cytoplasmic RNA
- Increase of binding of eosin to the denatured protein
- The cells may have more glass homogenous appearance than normal cells; this is due to loss of glycogen particles (which normally give the granular appearance to the cytoplasm).

\section*{a) Nuclear changes}

The earliest change is chromatin dumping which is followed by one of the following two changes;
1. The nucleus may shrink and get transformed into small wrinkled mass (pyknosis). With time, there is progressive disintegration of chromatin with subsequent disappearance of nucleus together (karyolysis) or ;
2. The nucleus may break into many clumps (karyorrhexis).

\section*{Types of necrosis}

Macroscopically, there are five types of necrosis;
1) Coagulative necrosis
2) Liquefactive necrosis
3) Fat necrosis
4) Caseation (gaseous) necrosis
5) Gangrenous necrosis

\section*{Coagulative necrosis}
- Results from sudden severe ischaemia in such organs as the heart, kidneys etc.
- Microscopically, the fine structural details of the affected tissues and cells are lost but their outlines are maintained.
- The nucleus is lost.
- The cytoplasm is converted into homogenous deeply eosinophilic and structurally less material.
- The outlines of the affected cells are still discernible.

\section*{Liquefactive necrosis}
- This type of necrosis is usually seen in two situations;
- Brain infarctions i.e. ischaemic destruction of the brain tissues
- Abscess i.e. suppurative bacterial infections.
- Liquefactive necrosis is characterized by complete digestion of dead cells by enzymes and thus necrotic area is eventually liquefied i.e. converted into a cyst filled with debris and fluid.

\section*{Fat necrosis}
- This is a specific pattern of cell deaths seen in adipose tissue due to action of lipase.
- It is more commonly seen in acute pancreatitis. The released fatty acids from necrotic cells, complex with calcium to create calcium soaps. These are grossly seen as chalky white deposit.
- Fat necrosis can also be induced by mechanical trauma as in female breast (traumatic fat necrosis).

\section*{Caseation (Gaseous) necrosis}
- This combines the features of coagulative and liquefactive necrosis
- It is encountered principally in the centre of tuberculous granuloma
- The body responds to tuberculous infections in a specific form of chronic inflammation; the morphologic unit of this is called granuloma.
- Grossly, the caseous material is soft, friable, whitish-gray cheesy material.
- Microscopically, the area is surrounded by granulomatous inflammation. It has distinctive amorphous granular pinkish debris.

\section*{Gangrenous necrosis}
- It describes the limb (usually the lower limb) that has lost its blood supply and has subsequently been attacked by bacteria; so it is a combination of coagulative necrosis modified by liquefactive action of enzymes derived from bacteria and inflammatory cells.
- When coagulative pattern dominates, the affected parts shrink and appear contracted (dry), the process is termed dry gangrene. Conversely, when the affected parts are swollen (oedematous) the process is termed wet gangrene.

\section*{TYPES OF CELLULAR ADAPTATION}

Include;

\section*{1) Physiologic adaptation}

Usually represents responses of cells to normal stimulation by hormones or endogenous chemical substances e.g. enlargement of breast and induction of lactation by pregnancy.

\section*{2) Pathologic adaptation}

Many share the same underlying mechanism but they provide the cells with the ability to survive in their environment and perhaps escape injury.

\section*{General mechanism of cellular adaptation}
- Up and down • regulation of specific cellular receptor involved in metabolism of certain components, e.g. in regulation of cell surface receptors involved in the uptake and degradation of low density lipoproteins (LDL).
- Induction of new protein synthesis by the target cells, e.g. heat shock response.
- Production of one type of a family of proteins to another or markedly overproducing one protein e.g. cells producing various types of collagens and extra cellular matrix (ECM) proteins in chronic inflammation and fibrosis.

NB: Adaptation involves all steps of cellular metabolism of proteins;
- Receptor binding
- Signal transduction
- Transcription or regulation of protein packaging
- Release

\section*{Morphological types of cellular adaptation}

There are numerous types of cellular adaptation but four are common;
1) Atrophy
2) Hypertrophy
3) Hyperplasia
4) Metaplasia

\section*{HYPERPLASIA}
- Is one type of cellular adaptation in which there is an increase in number of cells in an organ or tissue which may cause increased volume/size.
- Hyperplasia takes place if the cellular population is capable of synthesizing DNA, permitting mitotic division.

Types of hyperplasia
- Physiologic hyperplasia
- Hormonal hyperplasia
- Compensatory hyperplasia
- Pathologic hyperplasia

\section*{Hormonal physiologic hyperplasia}

It occurs due to hormonal stimulation in response to physiologic demand, e.g. proliferation of glandular epithelium of the female breast at puberty and during pregnancy and hyperplasia of pregnant uterus.

\section*{Compensatory physiologic hyperplasia}

It occurs when a part of an organ is removed, e.g. hyperplasia that occurs when a portion of liver is removed.

\section*{Pathologic hyperplasia}

Most forms of pathologic hyperplasia are instances of excessive hormonal stimulation or are effects of growth factors on target cells, e.g. hyperplasia of endometrium, hyperplasia of prostate, hyperplasia of connective tissue cells in wound healing, skin warts.

\section*{HYPERTROPHY}

Is one type of adaptive response in which there is an increase in size of cells resulting from synthesis of more structural components in response to increased functional demand or by specific hormonal stimulation.

\section*{Types of hypertrophy}
i. Physiologic hypertrophy
ii. Pathologic hypertrophy

Examples:
- Physiologic hypertrophy
- Hypertrophy of myometrium during pregnancy stimulated by oestrogen
- Hypertrophy of skeletal muscle of muscle-builders induced by workload
- Pathologic hypertrophy
- Hypertrophy of cardiac muscles induced by increased workload in hypertension or chronic haemodynamic overload.

\section*{ATROPHY}
- Is an adaptive response in which there is shrinkage of the size of cells by loss of cell substances.
- When sufficient numbers of cells are involved, the entire tissue or organ diminishes in size or becomes atrophic.

\section*{Causes of atrophy}

Include;
1. Disuse/Decreased workload
2. Denervation/Loss of innervations
3. Diminished blood supply
4. Inadequate nutrition
5. Loss of endocrine stimulation
6. Aging

Examples of atrophy
- When a limb is immobilized in plaster cast or when muscle becomes paralyzed from loss of innervations, as in poliomyelitis, atrophy of the muscle occur
- In late adult life, the brain undergoes progressive atrophy, presumably due to atherosclerosis, narrows its blood supply and the sex glands shrinks with depletion of endocrine stimulation.

\section*{Types of atrophy}
- Physiologic atrophy
- Loss of endocrine stimulation following menopause
- Pathologic atrophy
- Due to loss of nerve

\section*{Mechanisms of atrophy}
- Atrophy represents a reduction in structural components of cells.
- The cell contains fewer mitochondria and microfilaments and lesser amounts of endoplasmic reticulum.
- There is a finely regulated balance between protein synthesis and degradation in normal cells. Either decreased synthesis or increased catabolism or both may cause atrophy.
- Slight increase of degradation over a long period of time may result in atrophy.
- Intracellular non-lysomal proteinases play a role in such protein degradation.
- Atrophy also accompanied by marked increases in number of autophagic vacuoles within the cell that contain fragments of cell components (e.g. mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum), which are destined for destruction, into which the lysosome discharge their hydrolytic contents. The cellular components are then digested.

\section*{METAPLASIA}

Is one type of adaptive response in which one adult cell type (epithelial or messenchymal) is replaced by another cell type. It represents an adaptive substitution of cells more sensitive to stress by cell types better able to withstand the adverse environment.

\section*{Examples of metaplasia}
1. Epithelial metaplasia
a) Columnar to squamous metaplasia;
- Occurs in respiratory tract in response to irritation. In habitual cigarette smoker, the normal columnar ciliated epithelial cells of the trachea and bronchi are often replaced focally or widely by stratified squamous epithelial cells.
- Stone in the excretory duct of salivary glands, pancreas and bile ducts may cause replacement of normal columnar epithelium by non-functioning stratified squamous epithelial cells.
- Deficiency of vitamin A induces squamous metaplasia in the respiratory epithelium.
- Squamous metaplasia of endocervical epithelium in response to chronic inflammation.

NOTE: In all instances, the more rugged stratified squamous epithelium is able to survive under circumstances in which more fragile specialized epithelium most likely would have succumbed.

The influences that predispose to such metaplasia, if present, may induce cancer transformation of metaplastic epithelium. Thus common cancer in respiratory tract is composed of squamous cells.
b) Squamous to columnar metaplasia

Barret □ s oesophagus, in which the squamous oesophageal epithelium is replaced by gastric columnar cells. The resulting cancers that may arise are glandular (adeno) carcinoma.

\section*{2. Messenchymal metaplasia}

Fibrous connective tissue cells may become transformed to osteoblasts or chondroblasts to produce bone or catillage where it is normally not encountered. This occurs particularly in the foci of injury but occasionally with no cause.

\section*{Pathogenesis of metaplasia}

Metaplasia is thought to arise from genetic reprogramming of stem cells that are known to exist in most epithelium or undifferentiated messenchymal cells present in connective tissue. Chemical, vitamins or growth factors most likely play a role in such metaplasia.

\section*{Reversible cellular changes \& accumulations}

Even though there are many different kinds of reversible cellular changes \& accumulations, here we will only mention fatty change \& accumulation of pigments.
1. Fatty change This is accumulation of triglycerides inside parenchymal cells. It is caused by an imbalance between the uptake, utilization, \& secretion of fat. Fatty change is usually seen in the liver, heart, or kidney. Fatty liver may be caused by alcohol, diabetes mellitus, malnutrition, obesity, \& poisonings.

These etiologies cause accumulation of fat in the hepatocytes by the following mechanisms:
i. Increased uptake of triglycerides into the parenchymal cells.
ii. Decreased use of fat by cells.
iii. Overproduction of fat in cells.
iv. Decreased secretion of fat from the cells.

\section*{2. The accumulations of pigments}
- Pigments can be exogenous or endogenous. Endogenous pigments include melanin, bilirubin, hemosiderin, \& lipofuscin. Exogenous pigments include carbon. These pigments can accumulate inside cells in different situations.
a. Melanin: Melanin is a brownish-black pigment produced by the melanocytes found in the skin. Increased melanin pigmentation is caused by suntanning \& certain diseases e.g. nevus, or malignant melanoma. Decreased melanin pigmentation is seen in albinism \& vitiligo.
b. Bilirubin: Bilirubin is a yellowish pigment, mainly produced during the degradation of hemoglobin. Excess accumulation of bilirubin causes yellowish discoloration of the sclerae, mucosae, \& internal organs. Such a yellowish discoloration is called jaundice.

Jaundice is most often caused by
i. Hemolytic anemia: Hemolytic anemia is characterized by increased destruction of red blood cells.
ii. Biliary obstruction: This is obstruction of intrahepatic or extrahepatic bile ducts. It can be caused by gallstones.
iii. Hepatocellular disease: This is associated with failure of conjugation of bilirubin.
C. Hemosiderin: Hemosiderin is an iron-containing pigment derived from ferritin. It appears in tissues as golden brown amorphous aggregates \& is identified by its staining reaction (blue color) with the Prussian blue dye. Hemosiderin exists normally in small amounts within tissue macrophages of the bone marrow, liver, \& spleen as physiologic iron stores. It accumulates in tissues in excess amounts in certain diseases. This excess accumulation is divided into 2 types:
- Hemosiderosis; When accumulation of hemosiderin is primarily within tissue macrophages \& is not associated with tissue damage, it is called hemosiderosis.
- Hemochromatosis; when there is more extensive accumulation of hemosiderin, often within parenchymal cells, which leads to tissue damage, scarring \& organ dysfunction, it is called hemochromatosis.

UNIT 2: INFLAMMATION AND HEALING

\section*{INFLAMMATION}

Inflammation is a physiological response of living tissue to injury. The response to injury is divided into:
- General body response
- Local body response

\section*{General body response}
- This involves the nervous and hormonal adjustments and result in considerable metabolic alteration.
- At the same time the lymphoreticular system will respond by proliferation to provide more phagocytic cells and antibody forming cells.

\section*{Local body response}
- Initially, the adjacent living tissue will undergo changes which enable phagocytic cells and circulating antibodies to enter the area of damage. This phase is called acute inflammation which continues as long as tissue damage goes on.
- When the causative agent is eliminated, the debris of inflammatory reaction is removed by the scavenger cells. The tissue may return to normal, but when tissue loss is substantial, there is a final stage of healing by regeneration, repair or both.

\section*{General features of inflammation}
- Inflammation is a beneficial host response to foreign invaders and necrotic tissue, but it is itself capable of causing tissue damage.
- The main components of inflammation are a vascular reaction and a cellular response; both are activated by mediators that are derived from plasma proteins and various cells.

1) Recognition of the injurious agent
2) Recruitment of leucocytes
3) Removal of the agent
4) Regulation (control) of the response

\section*{5) Resolution (repair)}
- Inflammation accomplishes its protective mission by diluting, destroying or otherwise neutralizing harmful agents.
- There are three types of inflammation;
- Acute inflammation
- Sub-acute inflammation
- Chronic inflammation

\section*{ACUTE INFLAMMATION}
- Acute inflammation is a rapid response to injury or microbes and other foreign substances that is designed to deliver leucocytes and plasma proteins to sites of injury.
- The major local manifestations of acute inflammation are;
a) vascular dilatations (causing erythema and warmth)
b) extravasation of plasma fluid and protein (oedema)
c) leucocytes emigration and accumulation at site of injury

\section*{i. Vascular changes}
1. Changes in blood flow and caliber

These begin early after tissue injury but develop but develop at varying rates depending on the severity of injury. They are characterized by;
a) Transient vasoconstriction of arterials.
- This is an inconstant finding and in mild injury it disappears within $3-5$ seconds but in severe injury such as burns, it may last several minutes.
- The mechanism is unknown; it may be neurogenic due to axonal reflex.
b) Persistent vasodilatation;
- Which firstly involves arterials and then results in opening of new micro-vascular beds in the area. Mediators include prostaglandins and nitric oxide.
- The blood flow thus will increase in injured and the volume of blood there will be 10 fold the normal level, this called active hyperaemia, which is the hallmark of the early haemodynamic changes in acute inflammation and it is the cause of hotness and redness which is observed clinically in acute inflammation.
- This stage of increased blood flow will last for $10-15$ minutes and is caused by chemical mediators such as histamine and serotonin (5-HT); these are liberated from the tissues during their damage.
2. Changes in vascular permeability
- Once the vasodilatation has started, plasma proteins which include fibrinogen will pass through the gaps between the endothelial cells.
- Increased vascular permeability is caused by;
- Endothelial gap formation
a) Endothelial cell contraction
- Which is irreversible process elicited by chemical mediators e.g. histamine, bradykinin, leukotriens and others. These bind to specific receptors on endothelial cell surface.
- It lasts 15-30 minutes and only affects venules.
b) Junctional retraction
- Which is a reversible process caused by chemical mediators like TNF and IL1, which induce structural reorganization of the cytoskeleton of cells.
- It lasts for 4-6 hours.
- Endothelial cell injury
- Direct
- Leucocyte mediated
- Direct endothelial cell injury is caused directly e.g. by burn or infection; it lasts for 2-12 hours.
- Leucocyte dependent injury results from accumulation of leucocytes during inflammation; leucocytes will be activated and release toxic oxygen metabolites and proteolytic enzymes.
c) Increased transcytosis (vesicular trafficking).
d) Angiogenesis

\section*{Cellular response}
- Normal blood flow is characterized by axial flow in which the plasma is seen near vessel wall and cellular components (RBC, WBC, platelets) occupying the central column.
- In case of acute inflammation, the red cells and more importantly, white cells will become more closely packed near the vessel wall especially in the venules, this is
called margination of leucocytes. Some of the leucocytes may pass through the vessel wall and migrate into the extra vascular space of an inflamed area.
a) Sticking
- The WBC adheres in great number to endothelial surface of blood vessels. The binding is due to presence of the adhesion moelecules on the leucocytes and endothelial cell surface.
b) Emigration 11111

L111
- This is the process by which mobile WBC escape from the blood vessels into the peri-vascular space and tissues (PMN).
- They pass by their amoeboid movement into the endothelial junctions.
c) Chemotaxis
- This refers to the directional movement of cells towards an attractant.
- Chemotactic agents include:
- Exogenous or endogenous substance like soluble bacterial product
- Component of complement system
- Cytokines as IL-8
d) Phagocytosis
- Phagocytosis and release of lysosomal enzymes are two of the major benefits occurring from the accumulation of the leucocytes at the site of inflammation.
- There are three distinct steps in phagocytosis:
- Recognition and attachment
- Engulfment
- Killing/degradation/digestion.

\section*{1). Recognition and attachment of the particle to be ingested by the leukocytes:}

Phagocytosis is enhanced if the material to be phagocytosed is coated with certain plasma proteins called opsonins. These opsonins promote the adhesion between the particulate material and the phagocyte s sell membrane. The three major opsonins are:
- The Fc fragment of the immunoglobulin, components of the complement system
- C3b and C3bi, and
- The carbohydrate-binding proteins - lectins.

Thus, IgG binds to receptors for the Fc piece of the immunoglobulin $(\mathrm{FcR})$ whereas
3cb and 3bi are ligands for complement receptors CR1 and CR2 respectively.
2). Engulfment: During engulfment, extension of the cytoplasm (pseudopods) flow around the object to be engulfed, eventually resulting in complete enclosure of the particle within the phagosome created by the cytoplasmic membrane of the phagocytic cell.

As a result of fusion between the phagosome and lysosome, a phagolysosome is formed and the engulfed particle is exposed to the degradative lysosomal enzymes.
3) Killing or degradation: The ultimate step in phagocytosis of bacteria is killing and degradation. There are two forms of bacterial killing
a). Oxygen-independent mechanism: This is mediated by some of the constituents of the primary and secondary granules of polymorphonuclear leukocytes. These include:
- Bactericidal permeability increasing protein (BPI)
- Lysozymes
- Lactoferrin
- Major basic protein
- Defenses

It is probable that bacterial killing by lysosomal enzymes is inefficient and relatively unimportant compared with the oxygen dependent mechanisms. The lysosomal enzymes are, however, essential for the degradation of dead organisms within phagosomes.
b) Oxygen-dependent mechanism: There are two types of oxygen- dependent killing mechanisms
i) Non-myeloperoxidase dependent

The oxygen - dependent killing of microorganisms is due to formation of reactive oxygen species such as hydrogen peroxide ( H 2 O 2 ), super oxide ( O 2 ) and hydroxyl ion ( $\mathrm{HO}-$ ) and possibly single oxygen (102). These species have single unpaired electrons in their outer orbits that react with molecules in cell membrane or nucleus to cause damages. The destructive effects of H 2 O 2 in the body are gauged by the action of the glutathione peroxidase and catalase.
ii) Myloperoxidase dependent

The bactericidal activity of H 2 O 2 involves the lysosomal enzyme myeloperoxidase, which in the presence of halide ions converts H 2 O 2 to hypochlorous acid ( HOCI ). This H 2 O 2 - halide myecloperoxidease system is the most efficient bactericidal system in neutrophils. A similar mechanism is also effective against fungi, viruses, protozoa and helminths.

Like the vascular events, the cellular events (i.e. the adhesion, the transmigration, the chemotaxis, \& the phagocytosis) are initiated or activated by chemical mediators.

\section*{Cardinal signs of acute inflammation}
1) Swelling (tumor) - this is due to oedematous fluid accumulation.
2) Redness (rubor) - this is due to hyperaemia because of vasodilation.
3) Hotness (calor) - this is due to because of vasodilatation and slowing of the blood, so it will give heat locally to the affected area.
4) Pain (dalor) this is due to stimulation of nerve ending of the affected area by bacteria or tissue toxin.
5) Loss of function (functio laesa).

\section*{Cells of acute inflammation}
a) Neutrophils : are the main cells of acute inflammation. Their main functions include;
i. Phagocytosis of bacteria and tissue fragment of necrotic cells.
ii. Release of proteolytic enzymes lead to digestion of necrotic cells.
iii. Release of mediators.
iv. Stimulation of leucocytosis.
v. Release of substances.
vi. Release of substances that cause fever.
b) Eosinophils: seen in allergic and sub-acute inflammation. Their granules contain antihistamine which is a histamine neutralization substance.
c) Basophils: are seen in peripheral blood and when they are seen in the tissues they are called mast cells. They secret heparin and histamine.

\section*{Morphology of acute inflammation}
- Characteristically, the acute inflammatory response involves production of exudates.
- An exudate is an edema fluid with high protein concentration, which frequently contains inflammatory cells.
- A transudate is simply a non-inflammatory edema caused by cardiac, renal, under nutritional, \& other disorders.
- The differences between an exudate and a transudate are:

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline FEATURE & EXUDATE & TRANSUDATE \\
\hline Cause: & Acute inflammation & Non-inflammatory disorders \\
\hline Appearance & Colored, turbid, hemorrhagic & Clear, translucent or pale yellow \\
\hline Specific gravity & Greater than or equal to 1.020 & Much less \\
\hline Spontaneous coagulability & Yes & No \\
\hline Protein content & $>3 \mathrm{gm}$ \% & No \\
\hline Cells: & Abundant WBC, RBC, & \begin{tabular}{l}
Only few mesothelial cells \\
\& Cell debris usually present
\end{tabular} \\
\hline Bacteria: & Present & Absent. \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

There are different morphologic types of acute inflammation:

\section*{1) Serous inflammation}
- This is characterized by an outpouring of a thin fluid that is derived from either the blood serum or secretion of mesothelial cells lining the peritoneal, pleural, and pericardial cavities.
- It resolves without reactions

\section*{2) Fibrinous inflammation}
- More severe injuries result in greater vascular permeability that ultimately leads to exudation of larger molecules such as fibrinogens through the vascular barrier.
- Fibrinous exudate is characteristic of inflammation in serous body cavities such as the pericardium (butter and bread appearance) and pleura.
- Course of fibrinous inflammation include:
i. Resolution by fibrinolysis
ii. Scar formation between perietal and visceral surfaces i.e. the exudates get organized
iii. Fibrous strand formation that bridges the pericardial space.

\section*{3) Suppurative (Purulent) inflammation}
- This type of inflammation is characterized by the production of a large amount of pus.
- Pus is a thick creamy liquid, yellowish or blood stained in colour and composed of :
i. A large number of living or dead leukocytes (pus cells)
ii. Necrotic tissue debris
iii. Living and dead bacteria
iv. Edema fluid
- There are two types of suppurative inflammation:
a) Abscess formation: An abscess is a circumscribed accumulation of pus in a living tissue. It is encapsulated by a so-called pyogenic membrane, which consists of layers of fibrin, inflammatory cells and granulation tissue.
b) Acute diffuse (phlegmonous) inflammation: This is characterized by diffuse spread of the exudate through tissue spaces. It is caused by virulent bacteria (eg. streptococci) without either localization or marked pus formation. Example: Cellulitis (in palmar spaces).

\section*{4) Catarrhal inflammation}

This is a mild and superficial inflammation of the mucous membrane. It is commonly seen in the upper respiratory tract following viral infections where mucous secreting glands are present in large numbers, eg. Rhinitis.

\section*{5) Pseudomembranous inflammation}
- The basic elements of pseudomembranous inflammation are extensive confluent necrosis of the surface epithelium of an inflamed mucosa and severe acute inflammation of the underlying tissues. The fibrinogens in the inflamed tissue coagulate within the necrotic epithelium. And the fibrinogen, the necrotic epithelium, the neutrophilic polymorphs, red blood cells, bacteria and tissue debris form a false (pseudo) membrane which forms a white or colored layer over the surface of inflamed mucosa.
- Pseudomembranous inflammation is exemplified by Dipthetric infection of the pharynx or larynx and Clostridium difficille infection in the large bowel following certain antibiotic use.

\section*{Effects of acute inflammation:}

\section*{A. Beneficial effects}
1. Dilution of toxins: The concentration of chemical and bacterial toxins at the site of inflammation is reduced by dilution in the exudate and its removal from the site by the flow of exudates from the venules through the tissue to the lymphatics.
2. Protective antibodies: Exudation results in the presence of plasma proteins including antibodies at the site of inflammation. Thus, antibodies directed against the causative organisms will react and promote microbial destruction by phagocytosis or complement-mediated cell lysis.
3. Fibrin formation: This prevents bacterial spread and enhances phagocytosis by leukocytes.
4. Plasma mediator systems provisions: The complement, coagulation, fibrinolytic, \& kinin systems are provided to the area of injury by the process of inflammation.
5. Cell nutrition: The flow of inflammatory exudates brings with it glucose, oxygen and other nutrients to meet the metabolic requirements of the greatly increased number of cells. It also removes their solute waste products via lymphatic channels.
6. Promotion of immunity: Micro-organisms and their toxins are carried by the exudates, either free or in phagocytes, along the lymphaics to local lymph nodes where they stimulate an immune response with the generation of antibodies and cellular immune mechanisms of defense.

\section*{B. Harmful effects}
1. Tissue destruction Inflammation may result in tissue necrosis and the tissue necrosis may, in turn, incite inflammation.
2. Swelling: The swelling caused by inflammation may have serious mechanical effects at certain locations. Examples include acute epiglottitis with interference in breathing; Acute meningitis and encephalitis with effects of increased intracranial pressure.
3. Inappropriate response: The inflammatory seen in hypersensitivity reactions is inappropriate (i.e. exaggerated).

\section*{Fate of acute inflammation}
1) Resolution this means complete restoration of injured area to normal. Usually only single cells or small group of cells are killed, removed and replaced by newly regenerated cells.
2) Healing by fibrosis - fibrosis and scarring may result from:
- Heavy fibrin deposition
- Death of large amounts of tissues
- Progression of acute inflammation to chronic inflammation
3) Suppuration with abscess formation e formation of pus is a common sequel of acute inflammation. However, if it is left untouched, it may result in
- Sinus formation - when an abscess cavity makes contact with only one epithelial lining.
- Fistula formation: when an abscess tract connects two epithelial surface.
- Or very rarely to septicemia or Pyemia with subsequent metastatic abscess in heart, kidney, brain
4) Progression to chronic inflammation.

\section*{CHRONIC INFLAMMATION}

Definition: Chronic inflammation can be defined as a prolonged inflammatory process (Weeks or months) where an active inflammation, tissue destruction and attempts at repair are proceeding simultaneously.

\section*{Causes of chronic inflammation:}
- Persistent infections
- Certain microorganisms associated with intracellular infection such as tuberculosis, leprosy, certain fungi etc characteristically cause chronic inflammation.
- These organisms are of low toxicity and evoke delayed hypersensitivity reactions.
- Prolonged exposure to nondegradable but partially toxic substances either endogenous lipid components which result in atherosclerosis or exogenous substances such as silica, asbestos.
- Progression from acute inflammation: Acute inflammation almost always progresses to chronic inflammation following Persistent suppuration as a result of uncollapsed abscess cavities, foreign body materials (dirt, cloth, wool, etc), sequestrum in osteomylitis, or a sinus/fistula from chronic abscesses.
- Autoimmuniy: Autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosis are chronic inflammations from the outset.

\section*{Morphology:}

\section*{Cells of chronic inflammation:}
- Monocytes and Macrophages are the prima Dona (primary cells) in chronic inflammation. Macrophages arise from the common precursor cells in the bone marrow, which give rise to blood monocytes. These cells are then diffusely scattered in various
parts of the body, in the liver (Kupffer cells), spleen, lymph nodes (sinus histiocytes), lungs (alveolar macrophages), bone marrow, brain (microglia), skin (Langerhan s cells), etc •
- These cells constitute the mononuclear- phagocytic system.
- Macrophages are scavenger cells of the body.

\section*{Other cells in chronic inflammation:}
1. T-Lymphocytes are primarily involved in cellular immunity with lymphokine production, and they are the key regulator and effector cells of the immune system.
2. B-lymphocytes and Plasma cells produce antibody directed either against persistent antigen in the inflammatory site or against altered tissue components.
3. Mast cells and eosinophils appear predominantly in response to parasitic infestations \& allergic reactions.

Though neutrophils are hallmarks of acute inflammatory reactions, large numbers of neutrophils may be seen in some forms of chronic inflammation, notably chronic osteomylitis, actinomycosis, \& choric lung diseases induced by smoking and other stimuli.

Thus, the overall differentiation points between acute and chronic inflammations include:

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|}
\hline & Characteristics & Acute inflammation & chronic inflammation \\
\hline i. & Duration & Short & Relatively long \\
\hline ii. & Pattern & Stereotyped & Varied \\
\hline \multirow[t]{2}{*}{iii.} & \multirow[t]{2}{*}{Predominant cell} & Neutrophils & Macrophages, \\

\section*{Classification of chronic inflammation:}
- Chronic inflammation can be classified into the following two types based on histologic features:
- Nonspecific chronic inflammation: This involves a diffuse accumulation of macrophages and lymphocytes at site of injury that is usually productive with new fibrous tissue formations. E.g. Chronic cholecystitis.
- Specific inflammation (granulomatous inflammation):
- Definition: Granulomatous inflammation is characterized by the presence of granuloma. A granuloma is a microscopic aggregate of epithelioid cells. Epithelioid cell is an activated macrophage, with a modified epithelial cell-like appearance (hence the name epithelioid). The epitheloid cells can fuse with each other \& form multinucleated giant cells. So, even though, a granuloma is basically a collection of epithelioid cells, it also usually contains multinucleated giant cell \& is usually surrounded by a cuff of lymphocytes and occasional plasma cells.
- There are two types of giant cells:
a. Foreign body-type giant cells which have irregularly scattered nuclei in presence of indigestible materials.
b. Langhans giant cells in which the nuclei are arranged peripherally in a horse -shoe pattern which is seen typically in tuberculosis, sarcoidosis etc •

Giant cells are formed by fusion of macrophages perhaps by a concerted attempt of two or more cells to engulf a single particle.

\section*{Pathogenesis:}

There are two types of granulomas, which differ in their pathogenesis:
A. Foreign body granuloma: These granulomas are initiated by inert foreign bodies such as talc, sutures (nonabsorbable), fibers, etc that are large enough to preclude phagocytosis by a single macrophage and do not incite an immune response.
B. Immune granulomas: Antigen presenting cells (macrophages) engulf a poorly soluble inciting agent. Then, the macrophage processes and presents part of the antigen (in association with MHC type2 molecules) to CD4+T helper 1 cells which become activated. The activated CD4+ T-cells produce cytokines (IL-2 and interferon gamma). The IL-2 activates other CD4+T helper cells and perpetuates the response while IFN-. is important in transforming macrophages into epitheloid cells and multinucleated giant cells. The cytokines have been implicated not only in the formation but also in the maintenance of granuloma.

Macrophage inhibitory factor helps to localize activated macrophages and epitheloid cells.

\section*{Causes:}

Major causes of granulomatious inflammation include:
a) Bacterial: Tuberculosis, Leprosy, Syphilis, Cat scratch disease, Yersiniosis
b) Fungal: Histoplasmosis, Cryptococcosis, Coccidioidomycosis, Blastomycosis
c) Helminthic: Schistosomiasis
d) Protozoal: Leishmaniasis, Toxoplasmosis
e) Chlamydia: Lymphogranuloma venerum
f) Inorganic material: Berrylliosis
g) Idiopathic: Acidosis, Cohn □ s disease, Primary biliary cirrhosis

\section*{SYSTEMIC EFFECTS OF INFLAMMATIONS}

The systemic effects of inflammation include:
1. Fever
2. Endocrine \& metabolic responses
3. Autonomic responses
4. Behavioral responses
5. Leukocytosis
6. Leukopenia
7. Weight loss

Fever: Fever is the most important systemic manifestation of inflammation. It is coordinated by the hypothalamus \& by cytokines (IL-1, IL-6, TNF-a) released from macrophages and other cells.

\section*{Endocrine and metabolic responses include:}
- The liver secrets acute phase proteins such as:
- C-reactive proteins
- Serum Amyloid A
- Complement and coagulation proteins
- Glucocorticoids (increased)
- Vasopressin (decreased)

\section*{Autonomic responses include:}
- Redirection of blood flow from the cutaneous to the deep vascular bed.
- Pulse rate and blood pressure (increased)
- Sweating (decreased)

\section*{Behavioral responses include:}
- Rigor, chills, anorexia, somnolence, and malaise.

Leucocytosis is also a common feature of inflammation, especially in bacterial infections. Its usual count is 15,000 to 20,000 cells $/ \mathrm{mm} 3$. Most bacterial infections induce neutrophilia. Some viral infections such as infectious mononucleosis, \& mumps cause lymphocytosis. Parasitic infestations \& allergic reactions such as bronchial ashma \& hay fever induce eosinophilia.

Leukopenia is also a feature of typhoid fever and some parasitic infections.
Weight loss is thought to be due to the action of IL-1 and TNF-a which increase catabolism in skeletal muscle, adipose tissue and the liver with resultant negative nitrogen balance.

\section*{HEALING}

\section*{I. Definition of healing}
- The word healing, used in a pathological context, refers to the body ⊗ s replacement of destroyed tissue by living tissue.

\section*{II. Processes of healing}
- The healing process involves two distinct processes:
- Regeneration, the replacement of lost tissue by tissues similar in type and
- Repair (healing by scaring), the replacement of lost tissue by granulation tissue which matures to form scar tissue. Healing by fibrosis is inevitable when the surrounding specialized cells do not possess the capacity to proliferate.

Whether healing takes place by regeneration or by repair (scarring) is determined partly by the type of cells in the damaged organ \& partly by the destruction or the intactness of the stromal frame work of the organ. Hence, it is important to know the types of cells in the body.

\section*{Types of cells}

Based on their proliferative capacity there are three types of cells:

\section*{1. Labile cells}
- These are cells which have a continuous turn over by programmed division of stem cells. They are found in the surface epithelium of the gastrointestinal treat, urinary tract or the skin. The cells of lymphoid and haemopoietic systems are further examples of labile cells.
- The chances of regeneration are excellent.

\section*{2. Stable cells}
- Tissues which have such type of cells have normally a much lower level of replication and there are few stem cells. However, the cells of such tissues can undergo rapid division in response to injury. For example, mesenchymal cells such as smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts, osteoblasts and endothelial cells are stable cells which can proliferate. Liver, endocrine glands and renal tubular epithelium has also such type of cells which can regenerate.
- Their chances of regeneration are good.

\section*{3. Permanent cells}
- These are non-dividing cells. If lost, permanent cells cannot be replaced, because they don not have the capacity to proliferate. For example: adult neurons, striated muscle cells, and cells of the lens.

\section*{a. Healing by regeneration}
- Definition: Regeneration (generare=bring to life) is the renewal of a lost tissue in which the lost cells are replaced by identical ones.
- Regeneration involves two processes:
- Proliferation of surviving cells to replace lost tissue
- Migration of surviving cells into the vacant space.
- The capacity of a tissue for regeneration depends on its:
i. proliferative ability,
ii. degree of damage to stromal framework and
iii. On the type and severity of the damage.
- Tissues formed of labile and stable cells can regenerate provided that stromal framework are intact.

\section*{b. Repair (Healing by connective tissue)}
- Definition: - Repair is the orderly process by which lost tissue is eventually replaced by a scar.
- A wound in which only the lining epithelium is affected heals exclusively by regeneration. In contrast, wounds that extend through the basement membrane to the connective tissue, for example, the dermis in the skin or the sub-mucosa in the gastrointestinal tract, lead to the formation of granulation tissue and eventual scarring.
- Tissues containing terminally differentiated (permanent) cells such as neurons and skeletal muscle cells can not heal by regeneration. Rather the lost permanent cells are replaced by formation of granulation tissue.
- In granulation-tissue formation, three phases may be observed:
1. Phase of inflammation: At this phase, inflammatory exudate containing polymorphs is seen in the area of tissue injury. In addition, there is platelet aggregation and fibrin deposition.
2. Phase of demolition: The dead cells liberate their autolytic enzymes, and other enzymes (proteolytic) come from disintegrating polymorphs. There is an associated macrophage infiltration. These cells ingest particulate matter, either digesting or removing it.
3. Ingrowths of granulation tissue This is characterized by proliferation of fibroblasts and ingrowths of new blood vessels into the area of injury, with a variable number of inflammatory cells.
- Fibroblasts actively synthesize and secrete extra-cellular matrix components, including fibronectin, proteoglycans, and collagen types I and III. The fibronectin and proteoglycans form the ŏ scaffolding ⟸ for rebuilding of the matrix. Fibronectin binds to fibrin and acts as a chemotactic factor for the recruitment of more fibroblasts and macrophages. The synthesis of collagen by fibroblasts begins within 24 hours of the injury although its deposition in the tissue is not apparent until 4 days. By day 5 , collagen type III is the predominant matrix protein being produced; but by day 7 to 8 , type I is prominent, and it eventually becomes the major collagen of mature scar tissue. This type I collagen is responsible for providing the tensile strength of the matrix in a scar.
- Coincident with fibroblast proliferation there is angiogenesis (neovascularization), a proliferation and formation of new small blood vessels. Vascular proliferation starts 48 to 72 hours after injury and lasts for several days.
- With further healing, there is an increase in extracellular constituents, mostly collagen, with a decrease in the number of active fibroblasts and new vessels. Despite an increased collagenase activity in the wound (responsible for removal of built collagen), collagen accumulates at a steady rate, usually reaching a maximum 2 to 3 months after the injury.
- The tensile strength of the wound continues to increase many months after the collagen content has reached a maximum. As the collagen content of the wound increases, many of the newly formed vessels disappear. This vascular involution which takes place in a few weeks, dramatically transforms a richly vascularized tissue in to a pale, avascular scar tissue.

\section*{Wound contraction}
- Wound contraction is a mechanical reduction in the size of the defect. The wound is reduced approximately by $70-80 \%$ of its original size. Contraction results in much faster healing, since only one-quarter to one-third of the amount of destroyed tissue has to be replaced. If contraction is prevented, healing is slow and a large ugly scar is formed.

\section*{Causes of contraction}
- It is said to be due to contraction by myofibroblasts. Myofibroblasts have the features intermediate between those of fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells. Two to three days after the injury they migrate into the wound and their active contraction decrease the size of the defect.

\section*{Summary}
- Following tissue injury, whether healing occurs by regeneration or scarring is determined by the degree of tissue destruction, the capacity of the parenchymal cells to proliferate, and the degree of destructon of stromal framework.
- In the above discussion, regeneration, repair, and contraction have been dealt with separately. Yet they are not mutually exclusive processes. On the contrary, the three processes almost invariably participate together in wound healing.

\section*{Molecular control of healing process}
- As seen above, healing involves an orderly sequence of events which includes regeneration and migration of specialized cells, angiogenesis, proliferation of fibroblasts and related cells, matrix protein synthesis and finally cessation of these processes.
- These processes, at least in part, are mediated by a series of low molecular weight polypeptides referred to as growth factors.
- These growth factors have the capacity to stimulate cell division and proliferation. Some of the factors, known to play a role in the healing process, are briefly discussed below.

\section*{Sources of Growth Factors:}
- Following injury, growth factors may be derived from a number of sources such as:
- Platelets, activated after endothelial damage,
- Damaged epithelial cells,
- Circulating serum growth factors,
- Macrophages, or
- Lymphocytes recruited to the area of injury
- The healing process ceases when lost tissue has been replaced. The mechanisms regulating this process are not fully understood. TGF- $\beta$ act as a growth inhibitor for both epithelial and endothelial cells and regulate their regeneration.

\section*{Wound Healing}
- The two processes of healing, described above, can occur during healing of a diseased organ or during healing of a wound. A wound can be accidental or surgical.
- Healing of a wound demonstrates both epithelial regeneration (healing of the epidermis) and repair by scarring (healing of the dermis).
- There are two patterns of wound healing depending on the amount of tissue damage:
1. Healing by first intention (Primary union)
2. Healing by second intention
- These two patterns are essentially the same process varying only in amount.

\section*{1. Healing by first intention (primary union)}
- The least complicated example of wound healing is the healing of a clean surgical incision. The wound edges are approximated by surgical sutures, and healing occurs with a minimal loss of tissue. Such healing is referred to, surgically, as primary unionsint or

Foly by first intentionsing. The incision causes the death of a limited number of epithelial cells as well as of dermal adnexa and connective tissue cells; the incisional space is narrow and immediately fills with clotted blood, containing fibrin and blood cells; dehydration of the surface clot forms the well-known scab that covers the wound and seals it from the environment almost at once.
- Within 24 hours, neutrophils appear at the margins of the incision, moving toward the fibrin clot. The epidermis at its cut edges thickens as a result of mitotic activity of basal cells and, within 24 to 48 hours, spurs of epithelial cells from the edges both migrate and grow along the cut margins of the dermis and beneath the surface scab to fuse in the midline, thus producing a continuous but thin epithelial layer.
- By day 3, the neutrophils have been largely replaced by macrophages. Granulation tissue progressively invades the incisional space. Collagen fibers are now present in the margins of the incision, but at first these are vertically oriented and do not bridge the incision.
- Epithelial cell proliferation continues, thickening the epidermal covering layer.
- By day 5, the incisional space is filled with granulation tissue. Neovascularization is maximal. Collagen fibrils become more abundant and begin to bridge the incision. The epidermis recovers its normal thickness and differentiation of surface cells yields a mature epidermal architecture with surface keratinization.
- During the second week, there is continued accumulation of collagen and proliferation of fibroblasts. Leukocytic infiltrate, edema, and increased vascularity have largely disappeared. At this time, the long process of blanching begins, accomplished by the increased accumulation of collagen within the incisional scar, accompanied by regression of vascular channels.
- By the end of the first month, the scar comprises a cellular connective tissue devoid of inflammatory infiltrate, covered now by an intact epidermis. The dermal appendages that have been destroyed in the line of the incision are permanently lost. Tensile strength of the wound increases thereafter, but it may take months for the wounded area to obtain its maximal strength.

\section*{2. Healing by second intention (secondary union)}
- When there is more extensive loss of cells and tissue, such as occurs in infarction, inflammatory ulceration, abscess formation, and surface wounds that create large defects, the reparative process is more complicated. The common denominator in all these situations is a large tissue defect that must be filled. Regeneration of parenchymal cells cannot completely reconstitute the original architecture. Abundant granulation tissue grows in from the margin to complete the repair. This form of healing is referred to as Fecondary unionston or phealing by second intention.
- Secondary healing differs from primary healing in several respects:
1. Inevitably, large tissue defects initially have more fibrin and more necrotic debris and exudate that must be removed. Consequently, the inflammatory reaction is more intense.
2. Much larger amounts of granulation tissue are formed. When a large defect occurs in deeper tissues, such as in a viscus, granulation tissue bears the full responsibility for its closure, because drainage to the surface cannot occur.
3. Perhaps the feature that most clearly differentiates primary from secondary healing is the phenomenon of wound contraction, which occurs in large surface wounds.
4. Healing by second intention takes much longer than when it occurs by first intention.

\section*{Factors that influence wound healing}
- A number of factors can alter the rate and efficiency of healing. These can be classified in to those which act locally, and those which have systemic effects. Most of these factors have been established in studies of skin wound healing but many are likely to be of relevance to healing at other sites.

\section*{Local Factors}

\section*{† Type, size, and location of the wound}
- A clean, aseptic wound produced by the surgeon ↓ scalpel heals faster than a wound produced by blunt trauma, which exhibits abundant necrosis and irregular edges. Small blunt wounds heal faster than larger ones. Injuries in richly vascularized areas (e.g., the face) heal faster than those in poorly vascularized ones (e.g., the foot).
- In areas where the skin adheres to bony surfaces, as in injuries over the tibia, wound contraction and adequate apposition of the edges are difficult. Hence, such wounds heal slowly.

\section*{† Vascular supply}
- Wounds with impaired blood supply heal slowly. For example, the healing of leg wounds in patients with varicose veins is prolonged. Ischemia due to pressure produces bed sores and then prevents their healing. Ischemia due to arterial obstruction, often in the lower extremities of diabetics, also prevents healing.

\section*{† Infection}
- Wounds provide a portal of entry for microorganisms. Infection delays or prevents healing, promotes the formation of excessive granulation tissue (proud flesh), and may result in large, deforming scars.

\section*{† Movement}
- Early motion, particularly before tensile strength has been established, subjects a wound to persistent trauma, thus preventing or retarding healing.

\section*{† Ionizing radiation}
- Prior irradiation leaves vascular lesions that interfere with blood supply and result in slow wound healing. Acutely, irradiation of a wound blocks cell proliferation, inhibits contraction, and retards the formation of granulation tissue.

\section*{Systemic Factors}

\section*{† Circulatory status}
- Cardiovascular status, by determining the blood supply to the injured area, is important for wound healing. Poor healing attributed to old age is often due, largely, to impaired circulation.

\section*{† Infection}
- Systemic infections delay wound healing.

\section*{† Metabolic status}
- Poorly controlled diabetes mellitus is associated with delayed wound healing. The risk of infection in clean wound approaches fivefold the risk in non- diabetics.
- In diabetic patients, there can be impaired circulation secondary to arteriosclerosis and impaired sensation due to diabetic neuropathy. The impaired sensation renders the lower extremity blind to every day hazards. Hence, in diabetic patients, wounds heal the very slowly.

\section*{† Nutritional deficiencies}
- Protein deficiency: In protein depletion there is an impairment of granulation tissue and collagen formation, resulting in a great delay in wound healing.
- Vitamin deficiency: Vitamin C is required for collagen synthesis and secretion. It is required in hydroxylation of proline and lysine in the process of collagen synthesis. Vitamin C deficiency (scurvy) results in grossly deficient wound healing, with a lack of vascular proliferation and collagen deposition.
- Trace element deficiency: Zinc (a co-factor of several enzymes) deficiency will retard healing by preventing cell proliferation. Zinc is necessary in several DNA and RNA polymerases and transferases; hence, a deficiency state will inhibit mitosis. Proliferation of fibroblasts (fibroplasia) is, therefore, retarded.

\section*{† Hormones}
- Corticosteroids impair wound healing, an effect attributed to an inhibition of ollagen synthesis. However, these hormones have many other effects, including antiinflammatory actions and a general depression of protein synthesis. It also inhibits fibroplasia and neovascularization. Both epithelialization and contraction are impaired. It is, therefore, difficult to attribute their inhibition of wound healing to any one specific mechanism.
- Thyroid hormones, androgens, estrogens and growth hormone also influence wound healing. This effect, however, may be more due to their regulation of general metabolic status rather than to a specific modification of the healing process.

\section*{† Anti-inflammatory drugs}
- Anti-inflammatory medications do not interfere with wound healing when administered at the usual daily dosages. Asprin and indomethacin both inhibit prostaglandin synthesis and thus delay healing.

\section*{Complications of Wound Healing}
- Abnormalities in any of the three basic healing processes • contraction, repair, and regeneration result in the complications of wound healing.
1. Infection: A wound may provide the portal of entry for many organisms. Infection may delay healing, and if severe stop it completely.

\section*{2. Deficient Scar Formation}
- Inadequate formation of granulation tissue or an inability to form a suitable extracellular matrix leads to deficient scar formation and its complications. The complications of deficient scar formation are:
a. Wound dehiscence \& incisional hernias
b. Ulceration
a. Wound Dehiscence and Incisional Hernias:
- Dehiscence (bursting of a wound) is of most concern after abdominal surgery. If insufficient extracellular matrix is deposited or there is inadequate cross-linking of the matrix, weak scars result. Dehiscence occurs in $0.5 \%$ to $5 \%$ of abdominal operations. Inappropriate suture material and poor surgical techniques are important factors. Wound infection, increased mechanical stress on the wound from vomiting, coughing, or ileus is a factor in most cases of abdominal dehiscence. Systemic factors that predispose to dehiscence include poor metabolic status, such as vitamin C deficiency, hypoproteinemia, and the general inanition that often accompanies metastatic cancer. Dehiscence of an abdominal wound can be a life threatening complication, in some studies carrying mortality as high as $30 \%$.
- An incisional hernia, usually of the abdominal wall, refers to a defect caused by poor wound healing following surgery into which the intestines protrude.
- Ulceration: Wounds ulcerate because of an inadequate intrinsic blood supply or insufficient vascularization during healing. For example, leg wounds in persons with varicose veins or severe atherosclerosis typically ulcerate. Non-healing wounds also develop in areas devoid of sensation because of persistent trauma. Such trophic or neuropathic ulcers are occasionally seen in patients with leprosy, diabetic peripheral neuropathy and in tertiary syphilis from spinal involvement (in tabes dorsalis).

\section*{3. Excessive Scar Formation}
- An excessive deposition of extracellular matrix at the wound site results in a hypertrophic scar or a keloid. The rate of collagen synthesis, the ratio of type III to type I collagen, and the number of reducible cross-links remain high, a situation that indicates a $=$ maturation arrest thint, or block, in the healing process.

\section*{Keloid Formation}
- An excessive formation of collagenous tissue results in the appearance of a raised area of scar tissue called keloid. It is an exuberant scar that tends to progress and recur after excision. The cause of this is unknown. Genetic predisposition, repeated trauma, and
irritation caused by foreign body, hair, keratin, etc., may play a part. It is especially frequent after burns. It is common in areas of the neck \& in the ear lobes.

\section*{Hypertrophic Scar}
- Hypertrophic scar is structurally similar to keloid. However, hypertrophic scar never gets worse after 6 months unlike keloid, which gets worse even after a year and some may even progress for 5 to 10 years. Following excision, a keloid recurres, whereas a hypertrophic scar does not.

\section*{4. Excessive contraction}
- A decrease in the size of a wound depends on the presence of myofibroblasts, development of cell-cell contacts and sustained cell contraction. An exaggeration of these processes is termed contracture (cicatrisation) and results in severe deformity of the wound and surrounding tissues. Contracture (cicatrisation) is also said to arise as a result of late reduction in the size of the wound. Interestingly, the regions that normally show minimal wound contraction (such as the palms, the soles, and the anterior aspect of the thorax) are the ones prone to contractures. Contractures are particularly conspicuous in the healing of serious burns. Contractures of the skin and underlying connective tissue can be severe enough to compromise the movement of joints. Cicatrisation is also important in hollow viscera such as urethra, esophagus, and intestine. It leads to progressive stenosis with stricture formation. In the alimentary tract, a contracture (stricture) can result in an obstruction to the passage of food in the esophagus or a block in the flow of intestinal contents.
- Several diseases are characterized by contracture and irreversible fibrosis of the superficial fascia, including Dupuytren disease (palmar contracture), plantar contracture (Lederhosen disease), and Peyronie disease (contracture of the cavernous tissues of the penis). In these diseases, there is no known precipitating injury, even though the basic process is similar to the contracture in wound healing.

\section*{5. Miscellaneous}
- Implantation (or epidermoid cyst: Epithelial cells which flow into the healing wound may later sometimes persist, and proliferate to form an epidermoid cyst.

\section*{Fracture Healing}
- The basic processes involved in the healing of bone fractures bear many resemblances to those seen in skin wound healing. Unlike healing of a skin wound, however, the defect caused by a fracture is repaired not by a fibrous scarton tissue, but by specialized bone forming tissue so that, under favorable circumstances, the bone is restored nearly to normal.

\section*{Structure of bone}
- Bone is composed of calcified osteoid tissue, which consists of collagen fibers embedded in a mucoprotein matrix (osteomucin). Depending on the arrangement of the collagen fibers, there are two histological types of bone:
1. Woven, immature or non-lamellar bone: This shows irregularity in the arrangement of the collagen bundles and in the distribution of the osteocytes. The osseomucin is less abundant and it also contains less calcium.
2. Lamellar or adult bone: In this type of bone, the collagen bundles are arranged in parallel sheets.

\section*{Stages in Fracture Healing (Bone Regeneration)}
- Stage 1: Haematoma formation. Immediately following the injury, there is a variable amount of bleeding from torn vessels; if the periosteum is torn, this blood may extend into the surrounding muscles. If it is subsequently organized and ossified, myositis ossificans results.
- Stage 2: Inflammation. The tissue damage excites an inflammatory response, the exudate adding more fibrin to the clot already present. The inflammatory changes differ in no way from those seen in other inflamed tissues. There is an increased blood flow and a polymorphonuclear leucocytic infiltration. The haematoma attains a fusiform shape.
- Stage 3: Demolition. Macrophages invade the clot and remove the fibrin, red cells, the inflammatory exudate, and debris. Any fragments of bone, which have become detached from their blood supply, undergo necrosis, and are attacked by macrophages and osteoclasts.
- Stage 4: Formation of granulation tissue. Following this phase of demolition, there is an ingrowth of capillary loops and mesenchymal cells derived from the periosteum and the endosteum of the cancellous bone. These cells have osteogenic potential and together with the newly formed blood vessels contribute to the granulation - tissue formation.
- Stage 5: Woven bone and cartilage formation. The mesenchymal =osteoblastsishen next differentiate to form either woven bone or cartilage. The term 돔callus 帷, derived from the Latin and meaning hard, is often used to describe the material uniting the fracture ends regardless of its consistency. When this is granulation tissue, the callus attry is soft, but as bone or cartilage formation occurs, it becomes hard.
- Stage 6: Formation of lamellar bone. The dead calcified cartilage or woven bone is next invaded by capillaries headed by osteoclasts. As the initial scaffolding (Fprovisional callusithis) is removed, osteoblasts lay down osteoid, which calcifies to form bone. Its collagen bundles are now arranged in orderly lamellar fashion, for the most part concentrically around the blood vessels, and in this way the Haversian systems are formed. Adjacent to the periosteum and endosteum the lamellae are parallel to the surface as in the normal bone. This phase of formation of definitive lamellar bone merges with the last stage.
- Stage 7: Remodelling. The final remodeling process involving the continued osteoclastic removal and osteoblastic laying down of bone results in the formation of a bone, which differs remarkably little from the original tissue. The external callus is slowly removed, the intermediate callus becomes converted into compact bone containing Haversian systems, while the internal callus is hollowed out into a marrow cavity in which only a few spicules of cancellous bone remain.

\section*{UNIT 3: HEMODYNAMIC DISORDERS (DISORDERS OF CIRCULATION \& FLUID BALANCE)}

\section*{I. LEARNING OBJECTIVES}

Upon completion of this chapter, students should be able to:
1. Explain how fluid balance is maintained across the arteriolar \& venular end of the vasculature by Starling forces
2. Know the pathologic conditions occurring when the balance between the above forces is disrupted across the vascular wall under different conditions, i.e. edema.
3. Understand and explain the cause and pathogenesis of clinical conditions like myocardial infarction, deep venous thrombosis, pulumonary thromboembolism, etc • .
4. Know the pathogenesis of edema of congestive heart failure, nephrotic syndrome, cirrosis, and other clinical conditions
5. Have the basic knowledge about various types of shock, their pathogenesis, manifestations, and complications.

\section*{II. INTRODUCTION}
- The health and well-being of cells \& tissues depend not only on an intact circulation to deliver nutrients but also on normal fluid haemostasis. This chapter reviews the major disturbances involving the hemodynamic system.

\section*{III. OEDEMA}
- Definition: Edema is increased fluid in the interstitial tissue spaces or it is a fluid accumulation in the body cavities in excessive amount.
- Depending on the site, fluid accumulation in body cavities can be variously designated as:
a) Hydrothorax e fluid accumulation in pleural cavity in a pathologic amount.
b) Hydropericardium pathologic amount of fluid accumulated in the pericardial cavity.
c) Hydroperitonium (ascites) • fluid accumulation in peritoneal cavity.
d) Ancsarca o is a severe \& generalized edema of the body with profound subcutaneous swelling.

\section*{Mechanism of edema formation:}
- Approximately $60 \%$ of the lean body weight is water, two-thirds of which is intracellular with the remainder in the extracellular compartment.
- The capillary endothelium acts as a semipermeable membrane and highly permeable to water \& to almost all solutes in plasma with an exception of proteins. Proteins in plasma and interstial fluid are especially important in controlling plasma \& interstitial fluid volume.
- Normally, any outflow of fluid into the interstitium from the arteriolar end of the microcirculation is nearly balanced by inflow at the venular end. Therefore, normally, there is very little fluid in the interstitium.
- Edema formation is determined by the following factors:
1) Hydrostatic pressure
2) Oncotic pressure
3) Vascular permeability
4) Lymphatic channels
5) Sodium and water retention

\section*{Hydrostatic and oncotic pressures:}
- The passage of fluid across the wall of small blood vessels is determined by the balance between hydrostatic \& oncotic pressures.
- There are four primary forces that determine fluid movement across the capillary membrane.
- Each of them can be listed under the above two basic categories, the hydrostatic pressure \& the oncotic pressure. These four primary forces are known as Starling forces \& they are:
- The capillary hydrostatic pressure (Pc): This pressure tends to force fluid outward from the intravascular space through the capillary membrane to the interstitium.
- The interstial fluid hydrostatic pressure (Pif): This pressure tends to force fluid from the interstitial space to the intravascular space.
- The plasma colloid osmotic (oncotic) pressure (.p): This pressure tends to cause osmosis of fluid inward through the capillary membrane from the interstitium. The plasma oncotic pressure is caused by the presence of plasma proteins.
- The interstial fluid colloid osmotic (oncotic) pressure (.if): This pressure tends to cause osmosis of fluid outward through the capillary membrane to the interstitium.
- In addition, some fluid is normally drained by the lymphatic channels. Usually, excess fluid will accumulate in the interstitium (i.e. edema is formed) when the capillary hydrostatic pressure is increased or when the plasma oncotic pressure is decreased or when the lymphatic drainage is blocked.
- Hence, basically, one can divide pathologic edema into two broad categories:
A. Edema due to decreased plasma oncotic pressure. The plasma oncotic pressure is decreased when the plasma proteins are decreased in various diseases such as:
1. Protein loosing glomerulopathies like nephroticsyndrome with leaky glomerulus.
2. Liver cirrhosis which leads to decreased protein synthesis by the damaged liver.
3. Malnutrition
4. Protein loosing enteropathy.
B. Edema resulting from increased capillary hydrostatic pressure as in the following diseases:
1. Deep venous thrombosis resulting in impaired venous return.
2. Pulmonary oedema
3. Cerebral oedema
4. Congestive heart failure

\section*{Clinical classification of edema:}

One can also clinically classify edema into localized \& generalized types.
A) Localized
B) Generalized
1) Deep venous thrombosis
1) Nephrotic syndrome
2) Pulmonary edema
2) Liver cirrhosis
3) Brain edema
3) Malnutrition
4) Lymphatic edema
4) Heart failure
5) Renal failure

\section*{1. Localized edema}
a. Edema of the brain:
- May be localized at the site of lesion e.g neoplasm, trauma.
- May be generalized in encephalitis, hypertensive crisis, \& trauma
- Narrowed sulci \& distended gyri.
- increased Edema leads to compression of medulla towards foramen magnum which in turn leads to compression of vital centers leading to Herniation of the brain =Patient dies

\section*{b. Pulmonary edema}
- Usually occurs in left ventricular failure.
- May occur in adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
- Lung increases 2.3 x its weight.
2. Generalized edema (anasarca) occurs due to:
a. Reduction of albumin due to excessive loss or reduced synthesis as is caused by:
i. Protein loosing glomerulopathies like nephrotic syndrome
ii. Liver cirrhosis
iii. Malnutrition
iv. Protein-losing enteropathy
b. Increased volume of blood secondary to sodium retention caused by congestive heart failure:

\section*{Vascular permeability:}
- Increased vascular permeability usually occurs due to acute inflammation. In inflammation, chemical mediators are produced. Some of these mediators (See the chapter on inflammation) cause increased vascular permeability which leads to loss of fluid \& high molecular weight albumin and globulin into the interstitium. Such edema (i.e. that caused by increased vascular permeability) is called inflammatory edema. Inflammatory edema differs from non-inflammatory edema by the following features:
a) Inflammatory edema (exudate):
- Due to inflammation-induced increased permeability and leakage of plasma proteins.
- Forms an exudate [protein rich]
- Specific gravity > 1.012
b) Non-inflammatory oedema (transudate)
- A type of edema occurring in hemodynamic derangement (i.e. increased plasma hydrostatic pressure \& decreased plasma oncotic pressure. See above)
- Formed transudate [protein poor]
- Specific gravity $<1.012$

\section*{Lymphatic channels:}
- Also important is the lymphatic system which returns to the circulation the small amount of proteinaceous fluid that does leak from the blood into the interstial spaces. Therefore, obstruction of lymphatic channels due to various causes leads to the accumulation of the proteinaceous fluid normally drained by the lymphatic channels. Such kind of edema is called lymphatic edema.
- Lymphatic edema occurs in the following conditions:
i. Parasitic infection. E.g filariasis which causes massive lymphatic and inguinal fibrosis
ii. Lymphatic obstruction secondary to neoplastic infiltration. E.g. breast cancer
iii. post surgical or post irradiation, i.e surgical resection of lymphatic channels or scarring after irradiation

\section*{Sodium and water retention:}
- Sodium \& subsequently water retention occurs in various clinical conditions such as congetive heart failure \& renal failure. In these conditions, the retained sodium \& water result in increased capillary hydrostatic pressure which leads to the edema seen in these diseases.

\section*{Morphology of edema}

\section*{Microscopy}
- Manifests only as subtle cell swelling. Clearing \& separation of extracellular matrix.

\section*{IV. HYPERAEMIA AND CONGESTION}

Definition: Both of them can be defined as a local increase in volume of blood in a particular tissue.

\section*{HYPERAEMIA}
- is an active process resulting from an increased inflow of blood into a tissue because of arteriolar vasodilatation.
- Commonly occurs in exercising skeletal muscle or acute inflammation.
- Affected tissue becomes red as there is engorgement with oxygenated blood.

\section*{CONGESTION}
- is a passive process resulting from impaired outflow of blood from a tissue.
- occurs systemically as in cardiac failure or locally as in isolated venous obstruction.
- Affected tissue appears blue-red due to accumulation of deoxygenated blood.
- In long-standing congestion (also called chronic passive congestion states), poorly oxygenated blood causes hypoxia which results in parenchyma cell degeneration or cell death.

\section*{a) Pulmonary congestion}
- Cut surface: hemorrhagic \& wet.

\section*{1. Acute pulmonary congestion:}
- Alveolar capillaries engorged with blood
- Septal edema

\section*{2. Chronic pulmonary congestion:}
- Thickened \& fibrotic septa
- Alveolar spaces contain hemosiderin-laden macrophages resulting in an appearance termed brown indurations.
- Can result in pulmonary hypertension.

\section*{b) Hepatic congestion}

\section*{1) Acute hepatic congestion:}
- Central vein \& sinusoids are distended
- There may be even central hepatocyte degeneration.
- Peripheral hepatocytes better oxygenated \& develop only fatty changes.

\section*{2) Chronic passive congestion of liver:}
- Central lobules grossly depressed because of loss of cells \& appear red brown
- (nutmeg liver).
- Hemosiderin laden macrophages
- In longstanding hepatic congestion, commonly associated with cardiac failure, there is a grossly evident hepatic fibrosis called cardiac cirrhosis.

\section*{V. HAEMORRHAGE}

Definition:
- Hemorrhage is extravasation of blood outside the blood vessel.

Causes:
t Physical trauma - Stabbing
- Stick injury
- Gunshot
- Motor vehicle accident
† Inadequacies in blood clotting which can be due to:
- Too few or poorly functioning platelets (i.e. qualitative \& quantitative defect of platelets)
- Missing or low amount of clotting factors E.g. Low levels of prothrombin, fibrinogen \& other precursors.

Inadequate vitamin K leads to clotting factor deficiency because this vitamin is important in the synthesis of the clotting factors by the liver.

\section*{Terminology:}
1) Haemorrhage enclosed within a tissue or a cavity is known as hematoma.
2) Minute $1-2 \mathrm{~mm}$ hemorrhages occurring in the skin, mucosal membrane, or serosal surface are called petechiae.
3) Slightly $>3 \mathrm{~mm}$ hemorrhage occurring in the skin is referred to as purpura.
4) Larger than $1-2 \mathrm{~cm}$ subcutaneous hematoma is called ecchymosis (bruises). It is typical after trauma.

\section*{Effects of haemorrhage:}

Depend on the rate and amount of blood loss:
† If $>20 \%$ the total blood volume is rapidly lost from the body, it may lead to hypovolumic shock \& death.
† Chronic loss of blood leads to anaemia.

\section*{VI. HEMOSTASIS AND BLOOD COAGULATION}

\section*{Hemostasis}
- Definition: Hemostasis is the maintainence of the clot-free state of blood \& the prevention of blood loss via the formation of hemostatic plug.
- Hemostasis depends on three general components:
i. Vascular wall
ii. Platelets
iii. Coagulation pathways

Whenever a vessel is ruptured or severed, hemostasis is achieved by several mechanisms:
i. Vascular spasm
ii. Formation of platelet plug
iii. Formation blood clot as a result of blood coagulation
iv. Eventual growth of fibrous tissue in to the blood clot to close the hole in the vessel permanently.

\section*{VII. THROMBOSIS}

Definition: Thrombosis is defined as the formation of a solid or semisolid mass from the constituents of the blood within the vascular system during life.

Pathogenesis: There are three factors that predispose to thrombus formation. These factors are called Virchow ⊗ s triad:
- Endothelial injury
- Stasis or turbulence of blood flow
- Blood hypercoagulability

\section*{Endothelial injury}
- It is the most important factor in thrombus formation and by itself can lead to thrombosis.
- Endothelial injury is particularly important in thrombus formation in the heart \& arterial circulation.
- Some Examples:
† Endocardial injury during myocardial infarction \& eosinophilic endocarditis in which eosiophils release from their granules crystals called Charcot - Leyden damaging the endocardial endothelium.
† Injury over ulcerated plaque in severely atherosclerotic arteries.
† In hemodynamic stress like severe hypertension \& turbulence of flow over scarred valves directly damaging the endothelium.
† Bacterial endtoxin \& hyperchloestrolemia, radiation \& cigarette smoking may be sources of endothelial injury.
- Irrespective of endothelial damage, the final event is exposure of the highly thrombogenic subendothelial extracellular matrix, mainly collagen \& tissue factors up on which platelets undergo adherence \& contact activation.

\section*{Turbulence or Stasis (Alterations in normal blood flow)}

Under physiologic conditions normal blood flow is laminar, that is, the cellular elements flow centrally in the vessel lumen separated from endothelium by slowing moving clear zone of plasma. Stasis \& turbulence therefore:
a. Disrupt the laminar flow and bring platelets in to contact with the endothelium
b. Prevent dilution of activated clotting factors by freshly flowing blood
c. Retard or make a time lag in the inflow of clotting factor inhibitors and permit the buildup of thrombi.
d. Turbulence causes reduction in endothelial PGI2 and tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) which has fibrinolytic activity causing endothelial cell activation. ???
† Stasis is a major factor in the development of venous thrombi while turbulence contributes to arterial \& cardiac thrombosis by causing direct endothelial injury or by forming countercurrents \& local pockets of stasis.

\section*{† Examples:}
a) Ulcerated atherosclerotic plaque, which forms a sort of irregularity on endothelial surface, not only exposes subendothelial extracellular matrix but are also sources of local turbulence.
b) Aneurysms are favoured sites of stasis
c) Myocardial infarction not only has endothelial injury but also has a region of noncontractile myocardium, creating an area of stasis resulting in mural thrombus formation.
d) Mitral valve stenosis after chronic rheumatic fever may result in left atrial dilation, usually associated with arterial fibrillation. A dilated left atrium is a site of stasis \& a prime location of thrombus development.
e) Hypervisicosity syndrome, i.e an increase in hematocrit in excessive amount due to various reasons such as polycythemia causes stasis in small vessels.

\section*{HYPERCOAGULABLITY}
- Definition: Hypercoagulability is any alteration of the coagulation pathway that predisposes to thrombosis. Hypercoagulability is a less common cause of thrombosis \& \& it can be divided into:
1. Primary (Genetic)
- Mutations in factor V[Lieden factor]
- Anti thrombin III deficiency
- Protein C or S deficiency
2. Secondary (Acquired) which, in turn, can be categorized into:
a) High-risk for hypercoagulablity
- Prolonged bed rest or immobilization
- Myocardial infarction
- Tissue damage (surgery, fracture, burns)
- Cancers (Cancers release procoagulant tissue products to cause thrombosis)
- Prosthetic cardiac valves
- Disseminated intra vascular coagulation
b) Low risk factor for hypercoagulablity
- A trial fibrillation
- Cardiomyopathy
- Nephrotic syndrome
- Smoking
- Oral contraceptives
- Hyperestrogenic state eg. Pregnancy.

\section*{Morphology of Thrombi}
† Thrombi may develop anywhere in the cardiovascular system.
† According to their location, thrombi can be divided into venous \& arterial thrombi.
(Cardiac thrombi can be considered as arterial thrombi because of certain similarities between the two). The differences between arterial \& venous thrombi are:

\section*{Arterial thrombi}
a) Arise at the site of endothelial injury
b) Grow in a retrograde fashion, against its flow towards the heart
c) Has firm attachment
d) They usually occlude the blood flow
tail may undergo fragmentation.

\section*{Venous thrombi}
a) Arise at area of stasis
b) Grow in the direction of blood flow from site of attachment.
c) Has loose attachment, hence, propagating
d) Almost invariably occlusive
† The most common site of arterial thrombi in descending order are:
- Coronary arteries
- Cerebral arteries
- Temporal arteries
† Damaged valves can be infected by bacteria or fungi (infective endocarditis) which lead to the development of small infected thrombi on the valves. These small infected thrombi (vegetations) can further damage the valve.

\section*{Fates of a thrombus}

A thrombus can have one of the following fates:

A: Propagation: The thrombus may accumulate more platelets and fibrin \& propagate to cause vessel obstruction.

\section*{B: Embolization:}

The thrombus may dislodge and travel to other sites in the vasculature. Such a traveling thrombus is called an embolus. An embolus may obstruct a vessel. The obstruction leads to the death of the tissue supplied by the blood vessel. Death of a tissue due to a decreased blood supply or drainage is called infarction. Therefore, an embolus can eventually lead to an infarction of an organ. E.g cerebral infarction can be caused by a thromboembolus.

C: Dissolution: The thrombus may be removed by fibrinolytic activity.

D: Organization and recanalization: Organization refers to the ingrowth of endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, and fibroblasts into the fibrin-rich thrombus. Organization is accompanied by the formation of capillary channels across the thrombus, re-establishing lumen continuity to some extent. This is known as recanalization. The recanalization eventually converts the thrombus into a vasscularized mass of tissue which is later on incorporated as a subendothelial swelling of the vessel wall.

\section*{Clinical significance of thrombi}
† Thrombi are significant clinically because:
i. They cause obstruction of arteries and veins \&
ii. They are possible source of emboli.

\section*{A. Venous Thrombosis (Phlebothrombosis)}

Venous thrombosis affects veins of the lower extremity in $90 \%$ of cases. It can be divided into superficial \& deep vein thrombosis:

\section*{1. Superficial venous thrombosis}
- Usually occurs in saphenous venous system, particularly when there are varicosities.
- Rarely embolizes
- Causes local edema, pain, and tenderness (i.e. it is symptomatic)
- Local edema due to impaired venous drainage predisposes the involved overlying skin to infection after slight trauma leading to a condition known as varicose ulcer.

\section*{2. Deep venous thrombosis (DVT)}
- May embolize, hence, is more serious.
- Usually starts in deep veins within the calf muscles.
- Although they may cause local pain \& edema, unlike superficial veinous thrombosis, they are entirely asymptomatic in approximately $50 \%$ of patients. This is because deep venous obstruction is rapidly offset or relieved by collateral bypass channels.
- Has higher incidence in middle aged \& elderly people due to increased platelet aggregation \& reduced PGI2 production by the endothelium.
- Has the following predisposing factors:
1. Trauma, surgery, burns which usually result in:-
i. Reduced physical activity leading to stasis
ii. Injury to vessels
iii. Release of procagulant substance from the tissue
iv. Reduced t-PA activity (fibrinolysis)
2. Pregnancy \& puerperal states increase coagulation factors \& reduce the synthesis of antithrombotic substances. Myocardial infarction \& heart failure cause venous stasis to the left side.
3. Malnutrition, debilitating conditions and wasting diseases such as cancer. DVT due to these conditions is known as marantic thrombosis.
4. Inflammation of veins (thrombophlebitis) also predisposes to thrombosis.
5. Migratory thrombophlebitis is a condition that affects various veins throughout the body \& is usually of obscure aetiology, but sometimes it is associated with cancer, particularly pancreatic cancer. Migratory thrombophlebitis is also known as Trosseau syndrome.

\section*{B. Arterial Thrombosis}
- The rapid flow of arterial blood prevents the occurrence of thrombosis unless the vessel wall is abnormal.
- In western society, atheroma is by far the commonest predisposing lesion for arterial thrombosis. Atheromatous plaques produce turbulence and may ulcerate \& cause endothelial injury, both of which can lead to thrombosis. These thrombi may narrow or occlude the lumen of arteries such as the coronary and cerebral arteries.

Occlusion of these arteries will lead to myocardial infarction (MI) \& cerebral infarction respectively.
- Cardiac thrombi can be caused by infective endocarditis, atrial fibrillation,\& myocardial infarcion.
- Cardiac thrombosis is common on the heart valves \& in the auricular appendages (especially, of the right atrium). A thrombus develops in the atrium in patients with atrial fibrillation \& dilatation superimposed on mitral stenosis.
- Myocardial infarction causes dyskinetic myocardial contraction \& damage to the endocardium, which usually result in mural thrombi in the ventricles.
- Apart from obstructive features, arterial thrombi (especially, cardiac mural thrombi) may embolize to any tissue, but, particularly, commonly to the brain, kidney, \& spleen because of large volume of blood flow to these organs.

\section*{VIII. EMBOLISM}

\section*{Definition:-}
- An embolus is a detached intravascular solid, liquid or gaseous mass that is carried by blood to sites distant from its point of origin. After traveling via the blood, the embolus can obstruct a vessel.

\section*{Causes of embolism:}
- An embolus can arise from:
i. Thrombus ( $99 \%$ of emboli arise from a thrombus. Such an embolus is called thromboembolus)
ii. Platelets aggregates
iii. Fragment of material from ulcerating atheromatous plaque
iv. Fragment of a tumour
v. Fat globules
vi. Bubbles of air
vii. Amniotic fluid
viii. Infected foreign material
ix. Bits of bone marrow
x. Others.
- Unless otherwise specified, the term embolism should be considered to mean thromboembolism. This is because thromboembolism is the commonest form of embolism.
- Thromboembolism: Based on its sites of origin \& impaction, thromboembolism can be divided into:

\section*{a) Pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE)}
- PTE refers to the impaction of an embolus in the pulmonary arteries \& their branches. Such an embolus is derived from a thrombus in the systemic veins or the right side of the heart.

\section*{b) Systemic thromboembolism}
- Systemic emboli arise from the left side of the heart or from thrombi \& atheromatous debris in large arteries. And they impact in the systemic arteries.

\section*{c) Crossed embolism (Paradoxical embolism)}
- This occurs in the presence of patent foremen ovale when an embolus is transferred from the right to the left side of the heart, then into the systemic circulation.

\section*{PULMONARY THROMBEOMBLISM (PTE)}
- $95 \%$ of PTE arise from thrombi in the deep leg veins. The thromboembolus will travel long with the venous return \& reach the right side of the heart. From there, it will go into the pulmonary trunk \& pulmonary arteries. Depending on the size of the embolus and on the state of pulmonary circulation, the pulmonary embolism can have the following effects:
i. If the thrombus is large, it may block the outflow tract of the right ventricle or the bifurcation of the main pulmonary trunk (saddle embolus) or both of its branches, causing sudden death by circulatory arrest. Sudden death, right side heart failure (cor pulmonale), or cardiovascular collapse occurs when $60 \%$ or more of the pulmonary circulation is obstructed with emboli.
ii. If the embolus is very small (as in $60-80 \%$ of the cases), the pulmonary emboli will be clinically silent. Embolic obstruction of medium sized arteries manifests as pulmonary haemorrhage but usually does not cause infarction because of dual blood inflow to the area from the bronchial circulation.
iii. If the cardiorespiratory condition of the patient is poor (i.e., if the patient previously had cardiac or pulmonary disease), then obstruction of a medium sized pulmonary artery by a medium-sized embolus can lead to pulmonary infarction.
iv. Recurrent thromboembolism can lead to pulmonary hypertension in the long run.
- A patient who has had one pulmonary embolus is at high risk of having more.

\section*{SYSTEMIC THROMBOEMBOLISM}
- Systemic thromboembolism refers to emboli travelling within arterial circulation \& impacting in the systemic arteries.
- Most systemic emboli ( $80 \%$ ) arise from intracardiac mural thrombi. In turn, two thirds of intracardiac mural thrombi are associated with left ventricular wall infarcts and another quarter with dilated left atria secondary to rheumatic valvular heart disease.
- The remaining ( $20 \%$ ) of systemic emboli arise from aortic aneurysm, thrombi on ulcerated athrosclerotic plaques, or fragmentation of valvular vegetation.
- Unlike venous emboli, which tend to lodge primarily in one vascular bed (the lung), arterial emboli can travel to a wide variety of sites. The major sites for arteriolar embolization are the lower extremities (75\%) \& the brain (10\%), with the rest lodging in the intestines, kidney, \& spleen. The emboli may obstruct the arterial blood flow to the tissue distal to the site of the obstruction. This obstruction may lead to infarction. The infarctions, in turn, will lead to different clinical features which vary according to the organ involved.

\section*{Rare forms of embolism.}

\section*{FAT EMBOLISM}

Fat embolism usually follows fracture of bones and other type of tissue injury. After the injury, globules of fat frequently enter the circulation. Although traumatic fat embolisms occur usually it is as symptomatic in most cases and fat is removed. But in some severe injuries the fat emboli may cause occlusion of pulmonary or cerebral microvasculature and fat embolism syndrome may result. Fat embolism syndrome typically begins 1 to 3 days after injury during which the raised tissue pressure caused by swelling of damaged tissue forces fat into marrow sinsosoid \& veins. The features of this syndrome are a sudden onset of dyspnea, blood stained sputum, taccycardia, mental confusion with neurologic symptoms including irritability \& restlessness, sometimes progress to delirium \& coma.

\section*{AIR EMBOLISM}
- Gas bubbles within the circulation can obstruct vascular flow and cause distal ischemic injury almost as readily as thrombotic masses. Air may enter the circulation during:
a. Obstetric procedures
b. Chest wall injury
c. In deep see divers \& under water construction workers.
d. In individuals in unpressurized aircrafts
e. Neck wounds penetrating the large veins
f. Cardio thoracic surgery.
g. Arterial catheterisation\& intravenous infusion. Etc.
- Generally, in excesses of 100 cc is required to have a clinical effect and 300 cc or more may be fatal. The bubbles act like physical obstructions and may coalesce to form a frothy mass sufficiently large to occlude major vessels.

\section*{AMNIOTIC FLUID EMBOLISM}

It is a grave but uncommon, unpredictable complication of labour which may complicate vaginal delivery, caesarean delivery and abortions. It had mortality rate over $80 \%$. The amniotic fluid containing fetal material enters via the placental bed \& the ruptured uterine veins. The onset is characterized by sudden severe dyspnea, cyanosis, hypotensive shock followed by seizure \& coma of the labouring mother. If the patient survives the initial crisis, pulmonary oedema typically develops \& 50\% of the cases will develop DIC due to activation of the coagulation cascade by fetal material.

\section*{IX. INFARCTION}

Definition: An infarct is an area of ischemic necrosis caused by occlusion of either the arterial supply or venous drainage in a particular tissue.
- Nearly $99 \%$ of all infarcts result from thrombotic or embolic events. Other mechanisms include [almost all of them are arterial in origin]:
a. Local vasospasm
b. Expansion of atheroma due to hemorrhage in to atheromatous plaque.
c. External compression of the vessels. e.g. trauma
d. Entrapment of vessels at hernial sacks etc.
- The development \& the size of an infarct are determined by the following factors:
i. The nature of the vascular supply
ii. The rate of development of occlusion
iii. Susceptibility of the tissue for hypoxia
iv. Oxygen content of the blood
v. The severity \& duration of ischemia

\section*{The nature of vascular supply}
- The following organs have a dual blood supply.
a. Lung: pulmonary artery and Bronchial artery
b. Liver: hepatic artery and Portal vein
c. Hand \& forearm: Radial arteries and Ulnar arteries.
- The effect of such a dual blood supply is that if there is obsrtuction of one of the arterial supplies, the other one may offset the rapid occurrence of infarction in these organs unlike the renal \& splenic circulations which have end arterial supply.
- Infarction caused by venous thrombosis is more likely to occur in organs with single venous outflow channels, such as testis \&ovary.

\section*{Rate of development occlusion}
- Slowly developing occlusions are less likely to cause infarction since they provide time for the development of collaterals.

\section*{Tissue susceptibility to hypoxia:}
- The susceptibility of a tissue to hypoxia influences the likelihood of infarction. Neurons undergo irreversible damage when deprived of their blood supply for only 3 to 4 minutes.
- Myocardial cells die after 20-30 minutes of ischemia. Fibroblasts are more resistant, especially those in the myocardium.

\section*{Oxygen content of blood}
- Partial obstruction of the flow of blood in an anaemic or cyanotic patient may lead to tissue infarction.

\section*{The severity \& duration of ischemia.}

\section*{Types of infarcts}
- Infarcts are classified depending on:
A) The basis of their colour (reflecting the amount of haemorrhage) into:
i. Hemorrhagic (Red) infarcts
ii. Anemic (White) infarcts
B) The presence or absence of microbial infection into:
i. Septic infarcts
ii. Bland infarcts
1. Red infarcts occur in:
a. Venous occlusions as in ovarian torsion
b. Loose tissues such as the lung which allow blood to collect in infarct zone.
c. Tissues with dual circulations (eg. the lung), permitting flow of blood from unobstructed vessel in to necrotic zone.
d. In tissues that were previously congested because of sluggish outflow of blood.
e. When blood flow is reestablished to a site of previous arterial occlusion \& necrosis.
2. White infarcts occur in:
a. Arterial occlusion in organs with a single arterial blood supply.
b. Solid organs such as the heart, spleen, \& kidney, where the solidity of the tissue limits the amount of hemorrhage that can percolate or seep in to the area of ischemic necrosis from the nearby capillaries.

\section*{Morphology of infarcts}
- Gross: All infarcts are wedge-shaped with the occluded vessel at the apex and the periphery of the organ forming the base of the wedge. The infarction will induce
inflammation in the tissue surrounding the area of infarction. Following inflammation, some of the infarcts may show recovery, however, most are ultimately replaced with scars except in the brain.
- Microscopy: The dominant histologic feature of infarction is ischemic coagulative necrosis. The brain is an exception to this generalization, where liquefactive necrosis is common.

\section*{Clinical examples of infarction:}

\section*{A. Myocardial infarction}
- Usually results from occlusive thrombosis supervening on ulcerating atheroma of a major coronary artery.
- Is a white infarct.
- Can cause sudden death, cardiac failure, etc...

\section*{B. Cerebral infarcts}
- May appear as pale or hemorrhagic
- A fatal increase in intracranial pressure may occur due to swelling of large cerebral infarction, as recent infarcts are raised above the surface since hypoxic cells lack the ability to maintain ionic gradients \& they absorb water \& swell.
- Is one type of cerebrovascular accidents (CVA) or stroke which has various clinical manifestations.

\section*{C. Lung infarcts}
- Are typically dark red \& conical (wedge-shaped).
- Can cause chest pain, haemoptysis, etc

\section*{D. Splenic infarcts}
- Conical \& sub capsular
- Initially dark red later turned to be pale.

\section*{X. DISSEMINATED INTRAVASCULAR COAGULATION (DIC)}

Definition: -DIC is an acute, or chronic thrombohaemorrhagic disorder occurring as a result of progressive activation of coagulation pathway beyond physiologic set point secondary to a variety of diseases resulting in failure of all components of haemostasis. Hence the other term for DIC is consumption coagulopathy.

\section*{Etiology and Pathogenesis}
- At the outset, it must be emphasize that DIC is not a primary disease. It is a coagulopathy that occurs in the course of variety of clinical conditions. DIC follows massive or prolonged release of soluble tissue factors \& /or endothelial-derived thromboplastin into the circulation with generalized (pathologic) activation of coagulation system.
- Therefore, DIC results from pathologic activation of the extrinsic \&/or intrinsic pathways of coagulation or impairment of clot inhibiting influences by different causes. Two major mechanisms activating the coagulation pathway to cause DIC are: (1) release of tissue factor or thromboplastic substance into the circulation (2) widespread injury to the endothelial cells.
1. Tissue thromboplastin substance may be derived from a variety of sources such as:
i. Massive trauma, severe burns \& extensive surgery. The major mechanism of DIC is believed to be auto infusion of thromboplastin from the tissues.
ii. Obstetric conditions in which thromboplastin derived from the placenta, dead retained fetus, or amniotic fluid may enter the circulation. .
iii. Cancers such as acute promyelocytic leukaemia, adenocarcinoma of the lung in which a variety of thromboplastin substances like mucus are released which directly activate factor X, VII, \& proteolytic enzymes.
iv. Gram negative sepsis (an important cause of DIC) in which bacterial endotoxins cause increased synthesis, membrane exposure, \& release of tissue factor from monocytes. Furthermore, activated monocytes release intereukin-1 (IL-I), TNF-a, both of which:
- Increase expression of tissue factor in endothelial membrane.
- Decrease expression of thrombmodulin which is a potent activator of protein Can anti coagulant
- TNF-a, an extremely important mediator of septic shock, in addition to the above, up regulates the expression of adhesion molecules on endothelial cells and favours adhesion of leukocytes, with subsequent damage of endothelial cells by free radicals \& preformed proteases.
2. Endothelial injury: Widespread endothelial injury may result from:
- Deposition of antigen-antibody complexes as it occurs in systemic lupus erythematosus
- Extreme temperature eg. Heat stroke, burns
- Hypoxia, acidosis, shock

\section*{Clinical Course}
- The consequences of DIC are twofold. First, there is a widespread deposition of fibrin within the microcirculation. This may lead to ischemia of the more severely affected or more vulnerable organs and hemolytic anemia resulting from fragmentation of led cells as they squeeze through the narrowed microvasculature (Microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia).
- Second, a hemorrhagic diathesis may dominate the clinical picture because of consumption of the coagulation factors and increased fibrinolysis.
- The onset may be fulminant when caused by endotoxic shock or amniotic fluid embolism or it may be chronic in the case of carcinomatosis or retention of dead fetus. The clinical presentation varies with stage \& severity of the syndrome. Overall $50 \%$ of patients with DIC are obstetric patients \& about $33 \%$ of patients have carcinomatosis.
- Clinically, patients with DIC may present with extensive skin \& mucus membrane bleeding and haemorrhage from multiple sites, usually from surgical incision, vein punctures, or catheter sites. Respiratory symptoms such as dyspnea, cyanosis may occur. They may present with convulsion \& coma in the case of CNS bleeding or with acute renal failure with oliguria. Less often, they may present with cyanosis, pre-gangrenous changes in the digits, genitalia, \& nose areas where blood flow may be markedly decreased. Circulatory failure may appear suddenly \& may be progressing. The presentations of acute DIC, as it occurs in case of trauma or obstetric conditions, are dominated by bleeding diathesis.
- Laboratory manifestations include thrombocytopenia secondary to platelets aggregation in the thrombus, schistocytes or fragmented RBCs, prolonged PT, PTT, thrombin time \& reduced fibrinogen from depleted coagulation proteins. There is also increased fibrin degradation product (FDP) from intense fibrinolysis. The cardinal manifestation of DIC, which correlates most closely with bleeding is plasma fibrinogen level, i.e. low fibrinogen means increased tendency of bleeding.

\section*{XI. SHOCK}
- Definition: Shock is a state in which there is failure of the circulatory system to maintain adequate cellular perfusion resulting in widespread reduction in delivery of oxygen \& other nutrients to tissues. In shock, the mean arterial pressure is less than 60 mmHg or the systolic blood pressure is less than 90 mmHg .
- Regardless of the underlying pathology, shock constitutes systemic hypoperfusion due to reduction either in cardiac output or in the effective circulating blood volume.
- The end results are hypotension followed by impaired tissue perfusion and cellular hypoxia.
- Adequate organ perfusion depends on arterial blood pressure (BP) which, in turn, depends on:

\section*{i. Cardiac output (CO)}

\section*{ii. Peripheral vascular resistance (PVR)}
- $\quad \mathrm{CO}=$ stroke volume X heart rate
- In turn, stroke volume depends on:
a. Preload i.e. blood volume,
b. Afterload i.e. arterial resistance, \&
c. Myocardial contractility.
- Therefore, shock (i.e. widespread decreased perfusion of tissues) occurs when the preload (i.e. the blood volume) is decreased, or when the afterload (the peripheral vascular resistance) is decreased, or when the myocardium fails to contract. These basic mechanisms of shock are used to classify it.

\section*{Classification of shock.}

Shock can be divided into:
i. Hypovolemic shock
ii. Cardiogenic shock
iii. Distributive shock

\section*{HYPOVOLEMIC SHOCK}
- Definition: This is shock caused by reduced blood volume. Reduction in circulating blood volume results in the reduction of the preload which leads to inadequate left ventricular filling, reflected as decreased left \& right ventricular end diastolic volume and pressure. The reduced preload culminates in decreased cardiac output which leads to widespread tissue perfusion (shock).
- Causes of hypovolumic shock include:
a. Haemorrhage
b. Diarrhoea \& vomiting
c. Burns
d. Trauma, etc
- The effect of haemorrhage depends on the rate and amount of blood loss. Hypovolumic shock is the most common type of shock in clinical medicine .A normal healthy adult can lose 550 ml ( $10 \%$ of blood volume) without significant symptoms. But loss of $25 \%$ or more of the blood volume $(\mathrm{N}=1250 \mathrm{ml})$ results in significant hypovolemia.

\section*{CARDIOGENIC SHOCK}
- Definition: This is shock that results from severe depression of cardiac performance. It primarily results from pump failure [myocardial failure].
- Cardiogenic shock is haemodynamically defined as:
i. $\mathrm{DBP}<60 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$
ii. Left ventricle filling pressure $>18 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$
iii. Cardiac index $<1.81 / \mathrm{min} / \mathrm{m} 2$
iv. Usually pulmonary oedema coexists.
- Causes of cardiogenic shock can be divided into:
- Myopathic
- Mechanical

\section*{Myopathic causes include:}
- Acute myocardial infarction. Usually shock occurs in this condition if $=40 \%$ of the left ventricular mass \& more on the right ventricle is involved by infarction.
- Mycocarditis
- Dilated cardiomyopathy/hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
- Myocardial depression in septic shock

\section*{Mechanical causes include:}
i) Intracardiac
- Left ventricle outflow obstruction E.g. Aortic stenosis, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
- Reduction in forward cardiac output E.g. Aortic or mitral regurgitation
- Arrhythmia
ii) Extracardiac
- This can be called obstructive shock. The extracardiac causes of cardiogenic shock can be caused by:
a. Pericardial tamponade (gross fluid accumulation in the pericardial space) results in a decreased ventricular diastolic filling. .CO
b. Tension pneumothorax (gas accumulation in pleural space); this decreases the venous return by creating a positive pressure.
c. Acute massive pulmonary embolism occupying $50-60 \%$ of pulmonary vascular bed.
d. Severe pulmonary hypertension ( 10 pulmonary hypertension).

\section*{DISTRIBUTIVE SHOCK}
- Definition: Distributive shock refers to a group of shock subtypes caused by profound peripheral vasodilatation despite normal or high cardiac output.
- Causes of distributive shock
1) Septic shock 都 commonest among the group \& clinically very important.
2) Neurogenic shock
- Usually occurs in the setting of anaesthetic procedure [cephalo-caudal migration of anaesthetic agent] or spinal cord injury owing to loss of vascular tone \& peripheral pooling of blood.
3) Anaphylactic shock
- Initiated by generalized $\operatorname{IgE}$ - mediated hypersensitivity response, associated with systemic vasodilatation \& increased vascular permeability.
4) Endocrine shock
- This is a type of shock that typically occurs in adrenal insufficiency.

\section*{SEPTIC SHOCK}
- Definition: This is a kind of shock caused by systemic microbial infection, most commonly by gram negative infection (endotoxic shock) but can also occur with gram - positive or fungal infections, or
- It can be defined as sepsis with
i. Hypotension, arterial blood pressure less than 90 mmHg or 40 mmHg less than the patient □ s normal blood pressure,
ii. Organ dysfunction, \&
iii. Unresponsiveness to fluid administration.

\section*{Pathogenesis of septic shock:}
- Septic shock has a mortality rate of over $50 \%$ ranking the first among the causes of death in intensive care units. It results from the spread \& expansion of an initially localized infection like pneumonia into the blood stream.
- Most causes of septic shock ( $\sim 70 \%$ ) are caused by endotoxin-producing gram-negative bacilli, hence the term endotoxic shock. Endotoxins are bacterial wall lipopolyssacharides (LPS) released when cell walls are degraded. Analogues molecules in the walls of gram positive bacteria \& fungi can also elicit septic shock. LPS bind with CD14 molecule on leucocytes, especially monocytes \& macrophages, endothelial cells \& others. Depending on the dosage of LPS • protein complex, initiation of a cascade of cytokine-mediated events take place.
- The mononuclear phagocytes respond to LPS by producing TNF which, in turn, induces IL • 1 synthesis. TNF \& IL-1 both act on endothelial cells to produce further cytokines like IL-6, IL-8, \& secondary effectors like NO \& PAF (platelet aggregating factor).
† High levels of the above molecules or mediators (TNF-a, IL-1, etc ⋅ ) cause septic shock by acting on:
i. The heart causing decreased myocardial contractility which results in low cardiac output,
ii. Blood vessel • causing systemic vasodilatation which decreases the peripheral arteries.
iii. The mediators also cause widespread endothelial injury \& activation of the coagulation system resulting in DIC, \&
iv. Lung • causing alveolar capillary damage resulting in adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

\section*{Stages of shock}

Uncorrected shock passes through 3 important stages:

\section*{1) An initial nonprogressive phase}
- It is also called a period of early compensatory period, during which compensatory mechanisms are activated \& perfusion of vital organs maintained.
- Mechanisms
- A variety of neurohumoral mechanisms operate:
i. A decrease in cardiac output will stimulate peripheral \& central baro receptors with subsequent intense sympatho-adrenal stimulation. This sometimes leads to up to 200 fold increase in plasma catecholamine level. The net effect is tachycardia, CO, Peripheral vasoconstriction and BP. This is a major autocompensatory response.
ii. The fall in renal perfusion stimulates the renin - aldosterone secretion mechanism. renal conservation of fluid.

\section*{2. Progressive stage (Established shock)}
- This is characterized by tissue hypoperfusion with onset of worsening circulatory \& metabolic imbalances including acidosis.
- There is a widespread tissue hypoxia.
- Anaerobic glycolysis results in excessive lactic acid production. The lactic acid reduces tissue PH \& blunts vasomotor response. The hypoxic cells leak glucose leading to insulin-resistant hyperglycaemia and increased glycogenolysis. Impaired carbohydrate metabolism causes a fall in production of ATP, failure in function of $\mathrm{Na}+-\mathrm{K}+\mathrm{ATP}$ ase, result in Na \& water entrance into the cell, causing cellular swelling also called sick cell syndrome. Anoxic injury to endothelial cells results in DIC.

\section*{3. An irreversible stage}
- A sage at which, even if hemodynamic disorders are corrected survival is not possible.
- Transition to irreversible damage is mediated via various mechanisms.

\section*{Morphology of septic shock:}
- All organs are affected in severe shock. In shock, there is widespread tissue hypoperfusion involving various organs such as the heart, brain, \& kidney. This leads to widespread hypoxic tissue necrosis. The widespread tissue necrosis manifests as multiple organ dysfunction [MODS]. Various organs may fail to perform their normal functions. And lungs may show ARDS or Shock lung.

\section*{Clinical course of shock}
- Patient with shock may manifest as having a weak and rapid pulse, tachypnoea, \& cool, clammy, cyanotic skin. In septic shock, the skin will initially be warm \& flushed because of peripheral vasodilatation. The patient may present with confusion, restlessness, decreased urine output, coma, and death.

\section*{II. Introduction}

Knowledge of the normal human genetics will facilitate the understanding of genetic diseases. to students

Genetic information is stored in DNA. The typical normal human cell contains 46 chromosomes \{i.e. 23 pairs of chromosomes: 22 homologous pairs of autosomes \& one pair of sex chromosomes (XX or XY)\}. Members of a pair (described as homologous chromosomes or homologs] carry matching genetic information. I.e. they have the same gene loci in the same sequence, though at any specific locus they may have either identical or slightly different forms, which are called alleles. One member of each pair of chromosomes is inherited from the father, the other from the mother.Each chromosome is in turn composed of a very long unbranched molecule of DNA bound to histones \& other proteins. This interaction between the long DNA molecule \& the histones decreases the space occupied by the long DNA. I.e. this interaction packages the long DNA into the shorter chromosomes.

Each chromosome contains a single continuous DNA molecule. DNA is composed of two very long complementary chains of deoxynucleotides. The 2 chains (strands) of DNA wind around each other i.e. twist about each other forming a double helix - the twisted ladder model Each deoxynucleotide, in turn, is composed of a nitrogenous base \{i.e. adenine (A), or guanine $(\mathrm{G})$, or cytosine $(\mathrm{C})$, or thymine $(\mathrm{T})$ \} bound to deoxyribose \& phosphate.

DNA has two basic functions:
i. It codes for the proteins which are important for the metabolic \& structural functions of the cell. I.e. it provides the genetic information for protein synthesis.
ii. It transmits the genetic information to the daughter cells \& to the offsprings of the individual.

\section*{DNA}

DNA stores genetic information. This is done by the sequence of the nucleotides in the DNA. The portion of DNA that is required for the production of a protein is called a gene. A gene has exons (coding sequences) \& introns (intervening sequences). The transcription of a gene is regulated by a promoter region, enhancer region, etc • The sequence of nucleotides in a gene determines the sequence of amino acids in a specific protein. Three consecutive nucleotides form a code word or codon. Each codon signifies a single amino acid. Since the number of condons (64) outnumbers the number of amino acids (20), most amino acids are specified by more than 1 condon, each of which is completely specific.

To translate its genetic information into a protein, a segment of DNA (i.e. a gene) is first transcribed into mRNA. The mRNA contains a sequence of nucleotides that is complementary to the nucleotides of the DNA. Each DNA triplet codon is converted into a corresponding RNA triplet codon. Then each mRNA codon codes for a specific amino acid.

Hence, the sequences of the RNA codons is translated into a sequence of amino acids (i.e. protein). Therefore, the sequence of the amino acids in the protein is determined by the sequence of the codons in the mRNA which in turn is determined by the sequence of nucleotides in the DNA.

In summary, the primary sequence of bases in the coding regions of DNA determines the sequence of amino acids in the protein. Hence, any alteration in the sequence of bases in the normal gene causes an alteration of the protein at a specific point in its sequence. Such alteration is called mutation \& is the basis of genetic diseases.

Genetic information is transmitted to the daughter cells under two circumstances:
i. Somatic cells divide by mitosis, allowing the diploid ( 2 n ) genome to replicate itself completely in conjunction with cell division.
ii. Germ cells (sperm \& ova) undergo meiosis o a process that enables the reduction of the diploid ( 2 n ) set of chromosomes to the haploid state ( 1 n ). When the egg is fertilized by the sperm, the 2 haploid sets are combined, thereby restoring the diploid state in the zygote.

\section*{Terminology:-}
i. Hereditary (familial) disorders are disorders derived from one □ s parents.
ii. Congenital means - born with. Ith It may be genetic, for example Down □ syndrome. Or it may not be genetic, for example congenital syphilis. Not all genetic diseases are congenital, for example patients with Huntington □ s disease begin to manifest their disease in the 3rd or 4th decades.
iii. Genotype means the genetic constitution (genome).
iv. Phenotype means the observed biochemical, physiological, \& morphological characteristics of an individual as determined by his/her genotype \& the environment in which it is expressed.
v. Allele means one of the alternative versions of a gene that may occupy a given locus.
vi. Gene, as already stated, is the portion of DNA that codes for a protein.

\section*{III. Mutations}
i. Are the bases of genetic diseases.
ii. Are defined as permanent changes in the primary nucleotide sequence of DNA regardless of its functional significance.
iii. Occur spontaneously during cell division or are caused by mutagens such as radiation, viruses, \& chemicals.
iv. Can occur in germ line cells (sperm or oocytes) or in somatic cells or during embryogenesis. Germline mutations can be passed from one generation to the next \& thus cause inherited disease. Somatic mutations do not cause hereditary disease but they may cause cancer (because they confer a growth advantage to cells) \& some congenital malformations. Mutations that occur during development (embryogenesis) lead to
mosaicism. Mosaicism is a situation in which tissues are composed of cells with different genetic constitutions. If the germ line is mosaic, a mutation can be transmitted to some progeny but not others. This can sometimes lead to confusion in assessing the patterns of inheritance.
v. Affect the various levels of protein synthesis.
vi. Can be classified into the following three categories based on the extent of the genetic damage:

\section*{2. Genome mutations}

Are due to chromosome missegregation.

Are gain or loss of one or more whole chromosomes.

Are exemplified by aneuploidy \& polyploidy.
Are often incompatible with survival.

\section*{3. Chromosome mutations}
i. Are due to rearrangement of genetic material in a chromosome which results in structural changes in the chromosome.
ii. Can be seen by the microscope.
iii. Are exemplified by translocations.
iv. Are infrequently transmitted because most are incompatible with survival (like genome mutations).

\section*{4. Gene mutations}
i. Cause most of the hereditary diseases.
ii. Are submicroscopic (i.e. cannot be seen by the microscope).
iii. May affect a single base (more common) or they may affect a larger portion of a gene.
iv. Have the following types:
a) Single base pair change (Point Mutation)
b) Deletions \& Insertions
c) Expansions of repeat sequences

Each of these types is discussed below.

\section*{Point mutation (Single base pair change)}
- Is the substitution of one base for another.
- Includes the following types:-
a) Silent mutations
b) Missense mutations
c) Nonsense mutations

\section*{Silent (Synonymous) mutation.}

The genetic code is redundant (i.e. there is more than one codon for most amino acids) \& therefore a change in one base may result in no change in the amino acid sequence of the protein. The base replacement does not lead to a change in the amino acid but only to the substitution of a different codon for the same amino acid. For example, the change of the codon UUU which codes for phenylalanine to UUC (i.e. the replacement of U by C) is a silent mutation because the new codon (UUC) also codes the same amino acid (phenylalanine).

\section*{Missense mutations}
- Changes the codon for one amino acid to the codon for another amino acid.
-Is exemplified by the mutation which causes sickle cell anemia.
Hemoglobin is composed of a heme, two a-globin polypeptide chains, \& two $\beta$-globin polypeptide chains. In normal individuals, the codon GAG codes for glutamic acid in the 6th
position of the $\beta$-globin polypeptide chain. But in sickle cell anemia this codon is changed to GUG which codes valine. Hence, as a result of this single base substitution, valine substitutes glutamic acid in the $\beta$-globin chain. This amino acid substitution alters the physicochemical properties of hemoglobin, which is now called Hemoglobin S. This leads to sickle cell anemia.

\section*{Nonsense mutation}
- Changes the codon for an amino acid to a stop codon, leading to termination of translation of the mRNA transcript \& a truncated protein.
- Is exemplified by the mutation which causes ßo o thalassemia. In this, a substitution of U for C in the codon 39 of the $\beta$ globin chain of hemoglobin (i.e. the change of CAG to UAG) converts the codon for glutamine to a stop codon. This results in premature termination of the $\beta$ globin gene translation. I.e. protein synthesis stops at the 38th amino acid. This results in short peptide which is rapidly degraded leading to the absence of $\beta$ globin chains. This leads to so - thalassemia.

\section*{B. Deletions \& insertions}
- Can occur within coding sequences or within noncoding sequences.
i. Deletions \& insertions of one or two bases within coding sequences lead to frameshift mutations because they alter the reading frame of the triplet genetic code in the mRNA so that every codon distal to the mutation in the same gene is read in the wrong frame. This leads to altered amino acid sequence \& usually premature termination of the peptide chain because of the occurrence of a termination codon in the altered reading frame.
ii. Deletion or insertion of three or a multiple of three base pairs within coding sequences does not cause frameshift mutation, instead it results in abnormal protein missing one or more amino acid.
iii. Deletions affecting the promoter/enhancer sequences (i.e. in the noncoding regions) lead to promoter / enhancer mutations.

\section*{C. Expansion of repeat sequences (trinucleotide repeat mutations)}
- Show expansion of a sequence of 3 nucleotides. Normally, 3 nucleotides are repeated 2030 times. Trinucleotide repeat mutation is when there is expansion of these normally repeated sequences to more than 100 repeats.
- The mechanism leading to an increase in the number of repeats is not clear. It is also not clear how the increase leads to disease.
- Cause myotonic dystrophy, Huntington □ s disease, fragile X syndrome, etc are not stable (i.e. they are dynamic) (i.e. the degree of amplification increases during gametogenesis).

This leads to the phenomenon of anticipation (i.e. the disease worsens during the subsequent generations).

Summary:-
- Mutations can interfere with normal protein synthesis at various levels:-
- Promoter/enhancer mutations- No transcription/ increased transcription - No protein/increased protein.
- Missense mutation - Abnormal protein with a different amino acid- A protein altered with function or loss of function
- Nonsense mutation- Affects translation - Truncated protein- Rapidly degraded protein- Absence of the protein.
- Many different proteins are synthesized in each cell of the body. These proteins include enzymes \& structural components responsible for all the developmental \& metabolic processes of an organism. Mutation can result in abnormality in any of these proteins.
- Mutation - Abnormal protein/No protein/ Increased protein - Abnormal metabolic processes Tissue injury- Genetic diseases.

\section*{IV. Categories of genetic diseases}
- Genetic diseases generally fall into one of the following 4 categories:
i. Mendelian disorders
ii. Chromosomal disorders
iii. Multifactorial disorders
iv. Single gene diseases with nonclassic patterns of inheritance.
- Each of these categories is discussed below.

\section*{V. MENDELIAN DISORDERS}
- Each mendelian disorder is caused by a single mutant gene
i. Affects transcription, mRNA processing, or translation
ii. Abnormal protein or decreased protein - may affect any type of protein .Disease.
iii. Show the classic mendelian patterns of inheritance.
- are also called monogenic mendelian disorders.
- are uncommon.
- can be classified into the following based on their patterns of inheritance:
1) Autosomal dominant inheritance
2) Autosomal recessive inheritance
3) X-linked recessive inheritance
- The mode of inheritance for a given phenotypic trait/disease is determined by pedigree analysis in which all affected \& unaffected individuals in the family are recorded in a pedigree using standard symbols \& indicating the sex, the generation, \& biologic relationship among the family members. In all mendelian disorders, the distribution of the parental alleles to their offspring depends on the combination of the alleles present in the parents.

\section*{Autosomal dominant disorders}
- will be discussed under the following 4 headings:-
- The criteria for autosomal inheritance
- Additional features of autosomal dominant disorders
- Pathogenesis
- Clinical examples
- Dominant implies that the disease allele needs to be present only in a single copy (as in the heterozygote) to result in the phenotype.
a. The criteria of autosomal inheritance include:
i. The transmission of the trait is from generation to generation without skipping. In a typical dominant pedigree, there can be many affected family members in each generation.
ii. Except for new mutation, every affected child will have an affected parent. Some patients do not have affected parents because the disease in such cases is due to new mutations in the sperm/ovum from which the patients were derived. New germ line mutations occur more frequently in fathers of advanced age.
iii. In the mating of an affected heterozygote to a normal homozygote (the usual situation), each child has a $50 \%$ chance to inherit the abnormal allele $\&$ be affected $\&$ a $50 \%$ chance inherit the normal allele.
iv. The 2 sexes are affected in equal numbers (because the defective gene resides on one of the 22 autosomes (i.e. nonsex chromosomes). The exceptions to this rule are the sexlimited disorders such as breast \& ovarian cancers in females \& familial male precocious puberty in boys.

\section*{b. Additional features of autosomal dominant disorders}
- Each of the following may alter the idealized dominant pedigree (\& they should be considered to provide the most accurate counseling):-

i. Autosomal dominant disorders can sometimes be caused by new mutations. New mutations may give rise to an isolated case of a dominant disorder. New mutations are more often seen with diseases that are so severe that people who are affected by them are less likely to reproduce than normal. For example, the majority of cases of achondroplasia are the results of new mutations.
ii. Autosomal dominant disorders can show reduced penetrance (i.e. some individuals inherit the mutant gene but are phenotypically normal). Penetrance is the probability of expressing the phenotype given a defined genotype. Penetrance is expressed as the percentage of individuals who have the mutant allele \& are actually phenotypically affected. For example, $25 \%$ penetrance indicates that $25 \%$ of those who have the gene express the trait. Penetrance can be complete or incomplete. Reduced (incomplete) penetrance is when the frequency of expression of a genotype is $<100 \%$. Nonpenetrance is the situation in which the mutant allele is inherited but not expressed.
iii. Autosomal dominant disorders commonly show variable expressivity. Variable expressivity is the ability of the same genetic mutation to cause a phenotypic spectrum. It is when the trait is seen in all individuals carrying the mutant gene but is expressed differently among individuals. For example, some patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (which is an autosomal dominant disorder) have only brownish spots (café au lait spots) on their skin whereas other patients with the same disease have multiple skin tumors \& skeletal deformities. Therefore, neurofibromatosis is said to show variable expressivity. Variable expressivity most likely results from the effects of other genes or environmental factors that modify the phenotypic expression of the mutant allele. For example, individuals with familial hypercholesterolemia who take cholesterol-rich diet have a higher risk of manifesting with atherosclerosis than those individuals with hypercholesterolemia \& who take low cholesterol diet. Hence, the variable expressivity in this case is brought about by the influence of an environmental factor (i.e. the diet).In general, variable expressivity \& reduced penetrance can modify the clinical picture of autosomal dominant disorders.

\section*{c. Pathogenesis of autosomal dominant disorders}
- Autosomal dominant disorders are caused by 2 types of mutations:

\section*{1. Loss of function mutations}

\section*{2. Gain of function mutations}
1) Loss of function mutations cause autosomal dominant disorders when they result in inactive or decreased amount of regulatory proteins (e.g. cell membrane receptors such as LDL receptor), or structural proteins (e.g. collagen, fibrillin, spectrin, dystrophin).

A 50\% reduction in the levels of such nonenzyme proteins results in an abnormal phenotype (i.e. the heterozygote, who produces this much amount, will manifest the disorder). This can sometimes be explained by the dominant negative effect of the mutant allele (i.e. product of the mutant allele impairs the function of the product of the normal allele).
2) Gain of function mutations is much less common than loss of function mutations. In such cases, the mutant gene produces a toxic protein (i.e. the protein will have a new toxic function). This is exemplified by Huntington disease. Gain of function mutations almost always have autosomal dominant pattern.

\section*{d. Clinical examples of autosomal dominant disorders:}
- Marfan syndrome*
- Some variants of Ehlers - Danlos syndrome
- Osteogenesis imperfecta
- Achondroplasia
- Huntington disease
- Neurofibromatosis*
- Tuberous sclerosis
- Myotonic dystrophy
- Familial hypercholesterolemia*
- Hereditary spherocytosis
- Familial polyposis coli
- Polycystic kidney disease
* Only these are briefly described here.

\section*{Marfan syndrome}
- Is a defect of connective tissue characterized by faulty scaffolding.
- Is caused by mutations of FBN1 gene - Abnormal fibrillin (which is a structural protein) No normal microfibrils in the extracellular matrix- No scaffolding on which tropoelastin is deposited to form elastic fibers - Marfan □ s syndrome- Microfibrils are normally abundant in the aorta, ligaments, \& ciliary zonules of the lens where they support the lens. Hence, Marfan syndrome (in which there is deficiency of normal fibrillin \& microfibrils) mainly involves these tissues.
- Is characterized by defects in skeletal, visual, \& cardiovascular structures:-
i. Patients are tall \& thin with abnormally long legs \& arms, spider like fingers (arachnodactyly), hyperextensible joints.
ii. Dislocation of the ocular lens (Ectopia lentis) is frequent.
iii. Cardiovascular changes include:
- Mitral valve prolapse due to loss of connective tissue support in the mitral valve leaflets.
- Dilatation of the ascending aorta due to cystic medionecrosis (.lack of medial support).Dilatation of the aortic valve ring \& the root of the aorta - Aortic regurgitation.
- Dissecting aneurysm of the aorta due to medial necrosis \& intimal tear.

\section*{Familial hypercholesterolemia}
- is possibly the most frequent mendelian disorder
- Is caused by mutation of the gene for LDL (low density lipoprotein) receptor .
- Decreased functional LDL receptor . Increased plasma cholesterol . Premature atherosclerosis . Increased risk of myocardial infarction \& other complications of atherosclerosis/ The occurrence of xanthomas (which are raised yellow lesions filled with lipid-laden macrophages in the skin \& tendons).
- is best understood by knowing the normal process of cholesterol metabolism \& transport which is briefly described below. $7 \%$ of the body □ s cholesterol circulates in the plasma, predominantly in the form of LDL. The level of plasma cholesterol is influenced by its synthesis \& catabolism. The liver plays an important role in both these processes. The following flow chart illustrates the normal cholesterol metabolism. Abbreviations used in this flow chart
- TG $=$ Triglyceride VLDL $=$ Very Low Density Lipoprotein $=$ has a lot of triglyceride
- (TG), very little cholesterol, \& 3 apoproteins. IDL $=$ Intermediate Density Lipoprotein= has less TG \& more cholesterol than VLDL \& also has 2 apoproteins.LDL $=$ Low Density Lipoprotein $=$ has much more cholesterol than IDL. Liver cell Secrets . VLDL . VLDL is transported to the capillaries of adipose tissue or muscle which contain lipoprotein lipase. The lipoprotein lipase degrades the VLDL into TG \& IDL.
a. The TG is stored in fat cells or is used for energy in skeletal muscle.
b. The IDL follows 2 pathways:-
i. $50 \%$ of plasma IDL is cleared by the liver. The liver uses LDL receptors to remove plasma IDL.
ii. The rest of IDL is converted to plasma LDL (which is cholesterol-rich)..Plasma LDL is removed by the following 2 pathways:-
1. The scavenger receptor pathway:- In which oxidized LDL or acetylated LDL is removed by a scavenger receptor on the cells of the mononuclear phagocyte system, \&
2. Hepatic clearance:- 70\% of plasma LDL is removed by the liver (because LDL binds with LDL receptors which are concentrated in certain regions ( called the coated pits) of the cell membrane of the hepatocyte). Then, the coated vesicles containing the bound LDL fuse with the lysosomes.. in the lysosomes, LDL is degraded into free cholesterol which enters the cytoplasm.

There, cholesterol does the following things:-
i. It is used for the synthesis of cell membrane \& bile acids.
ii. It stimulates storage of excess cholesterol
iv. It inhibits the synthesis of LDLreceptors thus protects the cell from excessive accumulation of cholesterol.

\section*{Familial hypercholesterolemia}
- is caused by different types of mutations in the gene for LDL receptor . No functional LDL receptor . Leads to:-
i. Impaired plasma LDL clearance. This leads to the accumulation of LDL in plasma (i.e. hypercholesterolemia).
ii. Impaired IDL uptake by the liver ( because IDL uses hepatic LDL receptors for this uptake).. Diversion of a greater proportion of plasma IDL into the precursor pool for plasma LDL. . Hypercholesterolemia.
iii. Increased scavenger receptor mediated clearance of LDL into the cells of the mononuclear phagocyte system \& possibly the vascular walls. This leads to xanthomas \& contributes to premature atherosclerosis.
- The hypercholesterolemia \& the accumulation of LDL inside macrophages produced by the above mechanisms lead to premature atherosclerosis \& xanthomas.
- This knowledge of the pathogenesis of familial hypercholesterolemia has led to a logical discovery of its treatment. We have said that the basic problem in this disease is absence of LDL receptors. Hence, the logical treatment is to increase the number of LDL receptors. (i.e. to remove the basic problem). This can be done by:-

\section*{1. Statins}
- are drugs which inhibit hepatic HMG CoA reductase. Inhibits intracellular cholesterol synthesis. leads to greater synthesis of LDL receptors (See the normal cholesterol metabolism above)
2. Gene therapy (under investigation)
- by giving normal LDL receptor genes via a viral vector.

This illustrates that knowing the pathogenesis of diseases greatly helps not only in understanding their morphologic \& clinical features but also in the logical discovery of their treatment.

\section*{Neurofibromatosis:-}
- is a familial neoplasm. Familial neoplasms have neoplasm-causing mutations ransmitted through the germ line. Familial neoplasms account for about $5 \%$ of all cancers \& they are mendelian disorders. They are often inherited in autosomal dominant pattern with few exceptions. They are caused by mutations that affect proteins which regulate cell growth. And they are exemplified by neurofibromatosis types $1 \& 2$. It should be noted that most cancers are not familial \& these non-familial cancers are caused by mutations of tumor-suppressor genes, proto-oncogenes, \& apoptosis- regulating genes in somatic cells. Hence, these mutations are not passed in the germ line. Therefore, most cancers are not mendelian disorders i.e. they are sporadic or nonfamilial disorders. Here, neurofibromatosis which is a mendelian neoplasm is discussed.

\section*{1. Neurofibromatosis type 1}
- was previously called von Recklinghausen disease.
- has autosomal dominant transmission in 50\% of cases. (The rest 50\% are due to new mutations.
- has extremely variable expressivity but the penetrance is $100 \%$.
- is due to a mutation in the NF1 gene (which is a tumor-suppressor gene).
- mainly shows neurofibromas in the skin \& other locations, café au lait spots (i.e. light brown skin pigmentations), \& pigmented iris hamartomas (Lisch nodules). The benign neurofibromas can sometimes become malignant.
- may also show skeletal disorders such as scoliosis \& bone cysts \& increased incidence of other tumors especially pheochromocytoma \& malignancies such as Wilm □ s tumor, rhabdomyosarcoma, \& leukaemia.
2. Neurofibromatosis type 2
- was in the past called acoustic neurofibromatosis.
- is much less common than neurofibromatosis type 1 .
- is an autosomal dominant disorder.
- is due to a mutation of the NF-2 gene ( which is a tumor suppressor gene)
- shows bilateral acoustic schwannomas, multiple meningiomas, \& gliomas (typically ependymomas of the spinal cord).

Autosomal recessive disorders
- will be discussed under the following headings:-
a. Criteria
b. Additional features
c. Pathogenesis
d. Clinical examples
- In autosomal recessive disorders, the phenotype is usually observed only in the homozygote. The typical pedigree shows affected male \& female siblings with normal parents \& offspring. Recessive inheritance is suspected when parents are consanguineous; it is considered proven when the corresponding enzyme levels are low or absent in affected individuals \& are at half normal values in both parents.

\section*{a. Criteria}
i. If the trait is rare, parents \& relatives other than siblings are usually normal
ii. In the mating of 2 phenotypically normal heterozygotes, the segregation frequency with each pregnancy is 25\% homozygous normal, 50\% heterozygous normal, \& 25\% homozygous affected. See Fig. 2 below.
iii. All children of two affected parents are affected.
iv. Both sexes are affected in equal numbers
v. If the trait is rare in the population, the probability of parenta consanguinity is increased.
b. Additional features
i. Autosomal recessive disorders show more uniform expression of the trait than autosomal dominant disorders. (i.e. they don t show variable expressivity).
ii. They commonly show complete penetrance.
iii. They frequently show signs \& symptoms early in life, whereas many autosomal dominant disorders have delayed onset e.g. Huntington disease clinically manifests for the first time during adulthood.
c. Pathogenesis
- Many autosomal recessive disorders are caused by loss of function mutations which result in decreased enzyme proteins. Homozygotes . No normal enzyme . Disease. Heterozygotes .Equal amounts of normal \& defective enzymes.Cells with half the normal amount of the enzyme function normally .No disease.
d. Clinical examples include:-
- Sickle cell anemia
- Thalassemias
- Congenital adrenal hyperplasia
- Cystic fibrosis Wilson disease
- HemochromatosisMendelian disorders associated with enzyme defects:*
- Phenylketonuria
- Galactosemia
- Homocystinuria
- Lysosomal storage diseases
- Alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency
- Glycogen storage disease
* These will be discussed further.
- Mendelian disorders associated with enzyme defects.
- have mutations . decreased amount of a normal enzyme or abnormal enzyme with decreased activity- Metabolic block- Consequences - Disease.
- show autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance because half the normal amount of enzyme is enough for normal function. Hence, heterozygotes (who produce this amount) do not manifest the disease. I.e. the inheritance is autosomal recessive.
- Is illustrated by the following model of a metabolic pathway:- Substrate .

Enzyme 1. Intermediate 1. Enzyme 2.Intermediate 2 .. M1 .. M2 . (Minor pathway products)
Enzyme 3 . Final product If an enzyme of the above pathway is defective, then the consequences may be:
1. Accumulation of the substrate, \&/or one or both of the intermediates, \& the products of the minor pathway depending on the level of the block. These substances may be toxic in high concentrations \& result in tissue damage. This mechanism occurs in the following diseases:
† Lysosomal storage diseases
† Galactosemia
† Phenylketonuria
2. Decreased amount of the final end product.
† This is exemplified by albinism.
3. Failure to inactivate a toxic substrate. E.g. Hereditary alpha -1 antitrypsin deficiency.

Mendelian disorders associated with enzyme defects include most inborn errors of metabolism such as:
i. Lysosomal storage diseases (E.g. Gaucher disease)
ii. Phenylketonuria
iii. Severe combined immunodeficiency disease
iv. Alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency
v. Albinism
vi. Lesch © Nyhan syndrome

In order to illustrate the basic principles of this category, only the first two disorders from the above list are discussed below in moderate depth.
1. Lysosomal storage diseases
- result from lack of any protein essential for the normal function of lysosomes. Lysosomes are intracellular organelles used for degrading a variety of complex substrates. They do so by means
of a variety of enzymes. The following figure compares the normal lysosomal degradation pathway with that of lysosomal storage
disease.Complex substrate

Fig. 6. 4. Normal lysosomal degradation Vs lysosomal storage diseases.

Lysosomal storage diseases can be divided into the following subgroups based on the nature of the accumulated substance:
a. Sphingolipidoses
e.g. Tay-Sachs disease in which there is deficiency of the alpha subunit of the enzyme • hexosaminidase leading to the accumulation of GM2 gangliosides.
b. Sulfatidoses e.g. 1. Gaucher disease e.g. 2. Niemann-Pick disease types A \& B (have deficiency of sphingomyelinase resulting in the accumulation of sphingomyelin).
c. Muopolysacharidoses (MPS)
d. Mucolipidoses (ML)
e. Type 2 glycogenosis (Pompe disease)
f. etc ©

The organs affected in lysosomal storage diseases (i.e. the distribution of the stored material) are determined by the following 2 factors:
i. The site where most of the material to be degraded is found. E.g.1. Brain is rich in gangliosides, hence defective degradation of gangliosides as in Tay-Sachs disease results in the storage of gangliosides within neurons leading to neurologic symptoms. E.g.2. Mucopolysaccharides are widely distributed in the body.

Hence, mucopolysacharidoses (i.e. defects in the degradation of polysaccharides) affect virtually any organ.
ii. The location where most of the degradation normally occurs.

Organs rich in phagocytic cells such as the spleen \& liver are frequently enlarged in several forms of lysosomal storage diseases. This is because cells of the mononuclear phagocytic system are rich in lysosomes \& are involved in the degradation of a variety of substrates.

From among the various types of lysosomal storage diseases listed above, only Gaucher disease is discussed here to illustrate the basic principles of lysosomal storage diseases.

\section*{Gaucher disease}
- is the most common lysosomal storage disorder.
- is a disorder of lipid metabolism caused by mutations in the gene encoding glucocerebrosidase.. Deficiency of glucocerebrosidase. Accumulation of glucocerebroside mainly in the cells of the mononuclear phagocyte system \& sometimes in the central nervous system. Glucocerebrosides are continually formed from the catabolism of glycolipids derived mainly from the cell membranes of old red blood cells \& white blood cells.
- morphologically shows Gaucher cells (distended phagocytic cells with a distinctive wrinkled tissue paper cytoplasmic appearance).
- - has 3 clinical subtypes :

Type I (chronic nonneuronopathic),
Type II ( acute neuronopathic) ,
Type III (Juvenile).
Type I (Chronic non-neuronopathic form) (Adult Gaucher disease):-
- accounts for $99 \%$ of the cases.
- is found mainly in European Jews.
- does not involve the brain.
- shows accumulation of gluccocerebrosides only in the cells of the mononuclear phagocytic system throughout the body.
- Hence, it shows Gaucher cells in the spleen, liver, lymph nodes, \& bone marrow.
- clinically manifests by
i. Splenomegaly.Hypersplenism.Pancytopenia.
ii. Hepatomegaly
iii. Generalized lymphadenopathy
iv. Pathologic fractures \& bone pain due to erosion of the bone.
v. First appearance of sings \& symptoms in adult life.
vi. Progressive disease which is compatible with long life.

Phenylketonuria (PKU)
- is caused by mutation of the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene. Phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency . Failure of conversion of phenylalanine to tyrosine in the liver .High serum concentration of phenylalanine which is neurotoxic .Progressive cerebralmyelination

In addition the minor pathways of phenylalanine metabolism produce phenyl pyruvic acid
(F)phenylketonestht) \& phenyl acetic acid which are excreted via the urine.
- is clinically characterized by:
i. Progressive mental deterioration usually pronounced by age 1.
ii. Seizures.
iii. Hyperactivity \& other neurologic abnormalities.
iv. Decreased pigmentation of hair, eyes, \& skin. (Children are characteristically blond \& blue-eyed).
v. Mousy body odour from phenylacetic acid in urine \& sweat.
- can be successfully treated by a phenylalanine - free diet.
- Screening tests for serum phenylalanine or urinary catabolites are ordinarily performed on the 3rd or 4th day of life . But this is not currently done in Ethiopia.
3. X-linked recessive inheritance

All sex-linked disorders are X-linked. There is no Y-liked inheritance because Y-linked mutations result in infertility. X-linked disorders can be either recessive (almost all) or dominant (rare).

X-linked recessive inheritance:-
- is suspected when several male relatives in the female line of the family are affected.
a. Criteria:-
i. In the mating of a heterozygous carrier female parent \& a normal male parent (the most frequent setting), the sons are hemizygous affected $50 \%$ of the time (i.e. the sons have $50 \%$ chance of being affected) \& the daughters are normal heterozygous carriers $50 \%$ of the time \& normal homozygotes 50\% of the time. See Fig. 3 below.
ii. Affected daughters are produced by matings of heterozygous females with affected males.
iii. No male-to-male (i.e. father-to-son) transmission of the trait (in all sex-linked inheritance). This is because a male contributes his Y chromosome to his son \& does not contribute an X -chromosome to his son. On the other hand, since a male contributes his sole X-chromosome to each daughter, all daughters of a male with an X-linked disorder will inherit the mutant allele. All female offspring of affected males are carriers if the mother is normal.

Fig.6.5. X-linked recessive pattern.
This figure shows an extended pedigree of an X-linked recessive disorder in which the male parents (in both generations) are normal \& the female parents carriers. In contrast to the vertical distribution in dominant traits (parents \& children affected) \& the horizontal distribution in autosomal recessive traits (sibs affected), the pedigree pattern in $\mathrm{X} \bullet$ linked recessive traits tends to be oblique, i.e. the trait manifests in the maternal uncles of affected males \& in male cousins who are descended from the mother s sisters who are carriers.
b. Pathogenesis of X-linked recessive disorders

The genes responsible for X-linked disorders are located on the X-chromosome, \& the clinical risks are different for the 2 sexes.

Since a female has 2 X chromosomes, she may be either homozygous or heterozygous for a mutant gene, \& the mutant allele may demonstrate either dominant or recessive expression.

The homozygous female (i.e. having the mutation in both the X chromosomes) will express the full phenotypic change of the disease

Clinical expression of X-linked recessive disorders in heterozygous females is often variable \& is influenced by the normal random X-chromosome inactivation (i.e. lyonization) (See below). Normally, one of the two X-chromosomes in females is randomly inactivated.

Therefore, in heterozygous females carrying X-linked recessive mutations, some cells have one active normal X chromosome $\&$ other cells have an active abnormal X chromosome containing
the mutant allele. I.e. such females have a variable proportion of cells in which the mutant X chromosome is active. Often the mutant allele is activated in only some of the cells. Therefore, the heterozygous female expresses the disorder partially \& with less severity than hemizygous men. I.e. she usually does not express the full phenotypic change. E.g. G6PD deficiency. Very rarely, the mutant allele may be activated in most cells \& this results in full expression of a heterozygous X-linked recessive condition in the female.

In males, the Y chromosome is not homologous to the X -chromosome. So mutant genes on the X are not paired with alleles on the Y . The male is, therefore, said to be hemizygous (\& not heterozygous) for the X-linked mutant genes. Males have only oner X-chromosome, so they will clinically show the full phenotype of X-linked recessive diseases, regardless of whether the mutation produces a recessive or dominant allele in the female. Thus, the terms X-linked dominant or X-linked recessive refer only to the expression of the mutations in women.
c. Clinical examples of X-linked recessive disorders include:
1. Hemophilia A \& B
2. Chronic granulomatous disease of childhood
3. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency
4. Agammaglobulinemia
5. Wiskott -Aldrich syndrome
6. Diabetes insipidus
7. Lesch-Nyhan syndrome
8. Fragile X syndrome
9. Duchenne muscular dystrophy

X-linked dominant inheritance
- is a rare variant of X-linked inheritance.
- is when heterozygous females \& hemizygous males phenotypically manifest the disorder.
- is caused by dominant disease alleles on the X-chromosome.
- is transmitted by an affected heterozygous female to half her sons \& half her daughters.
- is transmitted by an affected male parent to all his daughters but none of his sons, if the female parent is unaffected.
- is exemplified by vitamin D-resistant rickets.

\section*{Mitochondrial inheritance}
- is mediated by maternally transmitted mitochondrial genes, which are inherited exclusively by maternal transmission.
- is a rare form of inheritance mentioned here just for the sake of completeness.

\section*{VII. Chromosomal disorders (Cytogenetic disorders)}
- are caused by chromosome \& genome mutations ( i.e. abnormal structure \& number of chromosomes respectively).
- are not uncommon. They are found in 50\% of early spontaneous abortuses, in 5\% of stillbirths, \& in $0.5-1 \%$ of live born infants.
- may, therefore, be suspected in the following clinical situations:
- Spontaneous abortion
- Stillbirth
- Abnormal live births
- Infertile couple

The following subtopics will be discussed below:
A. Normal karyotype
- Chromosome identification \& nomenclature
B. Types of chromosomal abnormalities
C. Abnormalities of autosomal chromosomes E.g. Down syndrome
D. Abnormalities of sex chromosomes E.g. 1. Klinefelter syndrome, 2. Turner syndrome

\section*{A. The normal karyotype}

Chromosome classification \& nomenclature:

Karyotype is the chromosome constitution of an individual. The term is also used for a photomicrograph of the chromosomes of an individual arranged in the standard classification (i.e. metaphase chromosomes arranged in order of decreasing length).

Karyotyping means the process of preparing such a photomicrograph. I.e. it is the study of chromosomes. Karyotyping uses many types of techniques of which G-banding is the most common procedure.

G-banding has the following steps:-
- Arrest dividing cells in metaphase by using colchicine.
- Stain the metaphase chromosomes using Giemsa stain, hence thename Gbanding..

The metaphase chromosomes will show alternating dark staining \& lightstaining bands. The dark bands are by convention called G bands, \& the light bands are R bands. About 400-800 dark \& light bands can be seen in a haploid set of chromosomes using G banding.
- Each chromosome can be identified based on its banding pattern \& length. The chromosome pairs are arranged in decreasing order of their length. And the first chromosome in such an arrangement is called chromosome 1, the 2nd chromosome is called chromosome 2, etc •up to chromosome 23 . The banding can also identify breakpoints \& other chromosomal alterations.

Metaphase chromosomes are divided longitudinally into 2 sister chromatids held together at the centromere, which delineates the chromosome into a short arm (p) \& a long arm (q).

Fig. 6.6. A pair of chromosomes.
The position of the centromere is used in the morphologic description of a chromosome:
Metacentric chromosomes have more central centromeres.
Acrocentric chromosomes have a centromere that is very close to one end. E.g. chromosomes 13 \& 21.

In a banded karyotype, each arm of the chromosome is divided into 2 or more regions. The regions are numbered e.g. 1, 2, and 3 from the centromere progressing to the telomere.

Each region is further subdivided into bands \& sub bands which are also similarly numbered.
Thus, Xq22.1 refers to a segment located on the long arm of the X chromosome in region 2 band 2 , sub band 1 . The following figure illustrates this.

Fig. 6.7. Nomenclature of a chromosome showing the division of the long arm (q) of the chromosome into regions $1 \& 2$. Region 2 is further subdivided into bands $1 \& 2$.

Band 2 is further subdivided into sub bands 1 \& 2 . Even though not shown in this figure, the other bands of this q arm \& the p arm are similarly divided \& numbered.

Karyotypes are usually described using a shorthand system of notations. The following order is used to describe karyotypes:
.. First the total number of chromosomes is given.
.. Second the sex chromosome constitution is given.
.. Finally any abnormality is described.
E.g. 1. A normal female karyotype is 46,XX. E.g. 2. A female with trisomy 21 is described as 47,XX,+21.

\section*{B. Types of chromosomal anomalies}
- Chromosomal anomalies may be numerical or structural.
1. Numerical anomalies can result in either aneuploidy or polyploidy.
i. Aneuploidy
- is addition or loss of 1 or rarely 2 chromosomes.
ii. Polyploidy
- is the addition of complete haploid sets of chromosomes.
2. Structural anomalies are rearrangements of genetic material within or between chromosomes. These may be either genetically balanced or unbalanced. In balanced structural anomalies, there is no change in the amount of essential genetic material whereas in the unbalanced ones there is a gain or loss of essential chromosome segments.
1. Numerical anomalies
a. Aneuploidy
- is a chromosome number that is not an exact multiple of 23 (i.e. the normal haploid number). The most common forms of aneuploidy are trisomy \& monosomy. Trisomy is the presence of 3 copies of a particular chromosome instead of the normal 2 copies.
I.e. it is the presence of an extra chromosome. Monosomy is the presence of only one copy of a particular chromosome instead of the normal pair. I.e. it is the absence of a single chromosome.
- is caused most often by an addition or loss of 1 or 2 chromosomes. This change may result from anaphase lag or nondisjunction.
i. Anaphase lag
- During meiosis or mitosis, one chromosome lags behind \& is left out of the cell nucleus.

This results in one normal cell \& one cell with monosomy.
ii. Nondisjunction
- is the failure of chromosomes to separate during meiosis or mitosis. The following figure illustrates meiotic nondisjunction.

Fig.6.8. (A) Normal disjunction of a chromosome pair during meiosis I \& II. (B) In meiosis I nondisjunction, the homologous chromosomes fail to segregate into the 2 daughter cells. (C) In meiosis II nondisjunction, the sister chromatids fail to segregate. The chromosome number in the gametes, which in humans is 23 , is denoted by n . As shown in this figure both (B) \& (C) produce gametes that are disomic or nullisomic for a specific chromosome. And fertilization of such gametes results in trisomic or monosomic zygotes (i.e. aneuploid zygotes). Meiotic nondisjunction is the most common cause of aneuploidy. It is responsible for disorders such as trisomy 21, the most common form of Down syndrome.

Nondisjunction can also occur in a mitotic division of somatic cells after the formation of the zygote. Mitotic nondisjunction is the failure of sister chromatids to segregate at anaphase (like the meiosis II error shown above). If mitotic nondisjunction occurs at an early stage of embryonic development, then clinically significant mosaicism may result. See the following figure.

Fig.6.9. Mitotic nondisjunction at an early stage of development of an embryo.
The mitotic nondisjunction occurred in one of cells \& resulted in a trisomic cell. All the descendants of this trisomic cell will also be trisomic. Also note that most of the cells undergo normal mitosis resulting in normal cells. Therefore, an individual formed from such an embryo will have 2 populations of cells • a trisomic cell population \& a normal cell population. Such an individual is called a mosaic. And the clinical appearance of such an individual depends on the proportion of trisomic cells. Anyway, the clinical feature is less severe than that of an individual in whom all the cells are trisomic.

In general, monosomies \& trisomies of the sex chromosomes are compatible with life \& usually cause phenotypic abnormalities. But monosomies \& trisomies of the autosomal chromosomes are not well tolerated. I.e. monosomies of autosomal chromosomes are lethal to the conceptus. And trisomies of all autosomal chromosomes except chromosomes 13, 18, \& 21 cause abortion or early death. However, trisomies of the autosomal chromosomes, 13, 18, \& 21 permit survival with phenotypic abnormalities.

\section*{b. Polyploidy}
- is a chromosome number that is a multiple greater than 2 of the haploid number. Triploidy is 3 x the haploid number (i.e. 69 chromosomes). Tetraploidy is 4x.
- is rarely compatible with life \& usually results in spontaneous abortion.

\section*{2. Structural anomalies}
- result from breakage of chromosomes followed by loss or rearrangement of genetic material
- are of the following types (See Fig. 9 below):

\section*{i. Deletion}
- is loss of a portion of a chromosome.
- has the following subtypes (See Fig. 9):-
a. Terminal deletions arise from one break. The acentric fragments that are formed are lost at the next cell division. This is denoted by using the prefix $\boldsymbol{\text { ® }}$ del® before the notation for the site of the deletion. E.g. 46, XX, del (18)(p14) or it can also be denoted by a minus sign following the number of the chromosome \& the sign for the chromosomal arm involved. E.g. 46,XX, 5p(which indicates deletion of the short arm of chromosome 5)
b. Interstitial deletions arise from 2 breaks, loss of the interstitial acentric segment \& fusion at the break sites.
c. Ring chromosomes arise from breaks on either side of the centromere \& fusion at the breakpoints on the centric segment. Segments distal to the breaks are lost so that individuals with chromosome rings have deletions from both the long arm \& short arm of the chromosome involved. May be denoted as for example 46,XX, r(15).

\section*{ii. Isochromosome formation}
- results when one arm of a chromosome is lost \& the remaining arm is duplicated, resulting in a chromosome consisting of 2 short arms only or 2 long arms only. The arm on one side of the
centromere is a mirror image of the other. E.g. $\mathrm{i}(\mathrm{X})(\mathrm{q} 10)$ results in monosomy of the genes on the short arm of $X$ \& trisomy of the genes on the long arm of $X$. (See Fig.9)
iii. Inversion
- is reunion of a chromosome broken at 2 points, in which the internal segment is reinserted in an inverted position.
- are compatible with normal development.
iv. Translocation.
- is an exchange of chromosomal segments between 2 non-homologous chromosomes.
- is denoted by a rint followed by the involved chromosomes in numerical order. E.g. the translocation form of Down □ syndrome is designated as $\mathrm{t}(14 \mathrm{q} ; 21 \mathrm{q})$.
- has 2 types (See Fig. 9):
a. Reciprocal (balanced translocation)
- is a break in 2 chromosomes leading to an exchange of chromosomal material between the two chromosomes. Since no genetic material is lost, balanced translocation is often clinically silent. But it can also cause disease as in the $t(9,22)$ which causes chronic myelogenous leukaemia.
b. Robertsonian translocation
- is a variant in which the long arms of 2 acrocentric chromosomes are joined with a common centromere, \& the short arms are lost.

Before going into the discussion of some of the chromosomal disorders, it is good to remember what mosaicism is.

Mosaicism
- is the presence of 2 or more cell lines with different karyotypes in a single individual. In a mosaic individual, a normal diploid cell commonly coexists with an abnormal cell line.

The abnormal cell line may have a numerical or structural anomaly. A specific cell line may be represented in all tissues or may be confined to single or multiple tissues. The expression of the phenotype depends on the proportion \& distribution of the abnormal cell line.
- is caused by mitotic errors in early development (i.e. in the fertilized ovum/embryo).
(See above).
Fig. 6.10. Types of structural anomalies (structural rearrangements) of chromosomes.
C. Cytogenetic disorders involving autosomes
- include:
- Down syndrome
- Edward syndrome
- Patau syndrome
- Chromosome 22q11 deletion syndrome

Down syndrome
- is the most frequent chromosomal disorder.
- is caused by:-
1. Trisomy 21
- accounts for 95\% of cases \& its incidence increases with maternal age.
- is produced usually (i.e. in $95 \%$ of cases of trisomy) by maternal meiotic nondisjunction. When the cause is paternal nondisjunction, there is no relation to paternal age.
2. Translocation
- accounts for $4 \%$ of all cases of Down □ syndrome.
- has no relation to maternal age.
- is caused by paternal meiotic robertsonian translocation between chromosome 21 \& another chromosome. The fertilized ovum will have 3 chromosomes bearing the chromosome 21 material, the functional equivalent of trisomy 21 .
- leads to a familial form of Down □ s syndrome, with a significant risk of the syndrome in subsequent children

\section*{3. Mosaicism}
- accounts for $1 \%$ of cases.
- usually shows a mixture of cells with $46 \& 47$ chromosomes.
- results from mitotic nondisjunction of chromosome 21 during an early stage of embryogenesis.
- has milder symptoms depending on the proportion of the abnormal cells.
- is not influenced by maternal age.

\section*{Down syndrome}
- has the following clinical features:
- Severe mental retardation
- Broad (flat) nasal bridge \& oblique palpebral fissure. Because of these features the old name of this disease is mongolism.
- Epicanthic folds
- Wide-spaced eyes
- Large protruding tongue
- Small low-set ears
- Bruschfield □ spots (small white spots in the periphery of the iris).
- Short broad hands with curvature of the 5th finger, simian crease (a single palmar crease)
- Unusually wide space between the 1 st \& the 2 nd toes
- Congenital heart disease (in about $40 \%$ of the cases).
- A $10 \bullet 20$ fold increased risk of developing acute leukaemia.
- Increased susceptibility to infection
- In patients surviving to middle age, morphologic changes similar to Alzheimer $\square$ disease.
D. Cytogenetic disorders involving sex chromosomes

The following subtopics will be discussed below:
1. General features
2. Klinefelter syndrome
3. Turner syndrome
4. Disorders of sexual differentiation

\section*{General features}

Sex chromosomal disorders have the following general features:
a. They generally induce subtle, chronic problems relating to sexual development \& fertility.
b. They are often difficult to diagnose at birth \& many are first recognized at the time of puberty.
c. The higher the number of the X chromosomes (both males \& females), the higher the likelihood of mental retardation.
d. They are far more common than those related to autosomal aberrations.
e. They are better tolerated than autosomal disorders. I.e. extreme karyotype deviations in the sex chromosomes are compatible with life. This is due to the following 2 factors that are unique to the sex chromosomes:
i. The scant genetic information carried by the Y chromosome \&
ii. The lyonization of the X chromosomes
i. The scant genetic information carried by the Y chromosome:

Most of the Y chromosome appears to be Junk DNAndh i.e. repetitive sequences that are without function. But there are some essential genes on the Y chromosome such as the genes which determine the testes, spermatogenesis, etc • The Y chromosome is both necessary \& sufficient for male development. Regardless of the number of the X chromosomes, the presence of a single Y chromosome leads to the male sex.
ii. The lyonization of the X chromosomes ( X chromosome inactivation)

In normal female somatic cells, there are 2 X chromosomes, but most of the genes on one of the X chromosomes are inactive. The process by which this occurs is called X chromosome inactivation or lyonization or Lyon ⊗ s hypothesis.
a. The X chromosome with most of the genes turned off is called the inactive X chromosome. The other one is called the active X chromosome.
b. If a somatic cell contains more than one X chromosome, all but one are inactivated. E.g.1. In a 47, XXY cell, there is one active \& one inactive X chromosome (the Y chromosome is irrelevant to the process of X inactivation). E.g. 2 in a 49, XXXXX cell, there is one active X chromosome \& 4 inactive chromosomes
c. X inactivation occurs early in embryogenesis among all cells of the bastocyst at about the 16th day of embryonic life.
d. The process of X inactivation is random in any single cell. Either the X chromosome inherited from the mother (called Xm ) or the X chromosome inherited from the father (called Xp ) may be inactivated with equal likelihood.
e. Once X inactivation occurs in an embryonic cell, the same X chromosome remains inactivated in all of the progeny of that cell. Females are mosaics. On average, half of the cells in a female have an inactive Xm \& the other half of the cells have an inactive Xp. However, some tissues (\& some women ) may have substantially more cells with one or the other X chromosome active by chance.
f. X inactivation involves most, but not all, genes on the X chromosome. Some essential genes must be expressed in 2 copies from both X chromosomes for normal growth \& development. For this reason, some essential genes on the X chromosome escape Xinactivation.

So if one of these essential genes is absent (as occurs in Turner syndrome), it results in abnormal growth \& development. Likewise, the presence of an extra X chromosome (as occurs in Klinefelter syndrome) leads to abnormal phenotype.
g. The inactive X-chromosome may be visible in an interphase cell as a condensed mass of chromatin called the Barr body ( X chromatin). The maximum number of Barr bodies seen in a cell is equal to the number of inactivated X chromosomes (i.e. one less than the total number of X chromosomes in the cell). E.g. Normal females $(46, \mathrm{XX})$ will have one Barr body, \& individuals with 3 chromosomes (XXX) will have 2 Barr bodies, \& those with 4 X chromosomes will have 3 , \& so on. Counting the number of Barr bodies in somatic cells (usually in smears of buccal mucosa) is the basis of the sex chromatin test for sex chromatin aneuplody. This test is no longer used in the Western countries because karyotyping is much more accurate.
h. X-chromosome inactivation produces dosage compensation. Females normally have 2 Xchromosomes \& males have only one. And most of the genes on the X chromosome do not have homologues on the Y chromosome. Despite the fact that females have double doses of most X -linked genes in comparison to males, the amount of X - linked products is usually about the same in males \& females. This dosage compensation is produced by X inactivation.
i. X inactivation has the following clinical implications:
1. A female who carries an X -linked recessive mutation on one of her 2 X chromosomes may express the mutant phenotype if most of her cells happen to have inactivated the $X$ chromosome carrying the normal gene.
2. A female carrier of an X-linked recessive disease may not detectable by gene product assays (e.g. by the amount of protein or enzyme activity) if most of her cells happen to inactivate the $X$ chromosome carrying the mutant gene.
3. Although monosomy (i.e. the presence of one instead of the normal 2 copies) for any autosome is lethal early in embryogenesis; monosomy for the X chromosome is relatively common in live born infants \& produces a relatively mild phenotype called Turner syndrome.
4. Trisomy (i.e. the presence of 3 rather than the normal 2 copies) of the sex chromosomes produces a much less severe phenotype than trisomy for any of the autosomes. Trisomy of the sex chromosomes produces phenotypic changes because of the triple dosage of the essential genes on the X chromosomes ( 1 copy of these essential genes on the active X chromosome $\& 2$ copies of the activated escapee essential genes on the inactivated X chromosome). Points 3 \& 4 above illustrate that aneuploidy of the sex chromosomes is better tolerated than the aneuploidy of the autosomes.

\section*{Klinefelter syndrome}
- is a disorder that occurs when there are at least 2 X chromosomes \& 1 or more Y chromosomes.
- is most often characterized by the karyotype 47, XXY. Variants include additional X chromosomes (e.g. XXXY) \& rare mosaic forms. In the typical XXY form, a single Barr body is noted in the buccal smear preparations.
- is caused by parental meiotic nondisjunction \& incidence increases with maternal age.
- is characterized by male hypogonadism \& its secondary effects.
- shows atrophic testes with decreased spermatogenesis which leads to infertility \& decreased testosterone production. In addition, it also shows increased plasma estradiol levels (by unknown mechanism). The ratio of estrogens \& testosterone determines the degree of feminization.
- therefore, shows lack of secondary male sexual characteristics (i.e. no deep voice, no beard, no male distribution of pubic hair).
- also shows tall stature (because fusion of the epiphyses is delayed), \& eunuchoid appearance with gynecomastia.
- is rarely associated with mental retardation, which is usually mild. The extent of retardation increases with increased number of X chromosomes.
- is usually undiagnosed before puberty.

\section*{3. Turner syndrome}
- is a disorder that occurs when there is a complete or partial monosomy of the X chromosome.
- is associated with one of the following 3 types of karyotypic abnormalities:
- 45,X karyotype ( in which no Barr bodies are seen in the buccal smear)
- mosaics (45, X cell plus one or more karyotypically normal or abnormal cell types)
- structural abnormalities of the X chromosomes which result in partial monosomy of the X chromosome. E.g. deletion of one of the arms of the X chromosome.

This karyotypic heterogeneity associated with Turner . s syndrome is responsible for significant variations in phenotype. E.g. 45, XO causes a severe phenotype whereas mosaics may have a normal appearance with only primary amenorrhea.
- is characterized by female hypogonadism \& its secondary effects.
- shows:-
- Replacement of the ovaries by fibrous streaks .
- Decreased estrogen production \& increased pituitary gonadotropins from loss of feedback inhibition.
- Infantile genitalia \& poor breast development \& little pubic hair.
- Short stature (rarely exceeding 150 cm in height), webbed neck, shield-like chest with widely spaced nipples, \& wide carrying angles of the arms.
- Lymphedema of the extremities \& neck.
- Congenital heart disease (especially preductal coarctation of the aorta \& bicuspid aortic valve).

\section*{4. Disorders of sexual differentiation (Sexual ambiguity)}
- are said to be present when genetic sex, gonadal sex, or genital sex of an individual are discordant.

\section*{i. Definitions}

The sex of an individual can be defined on many levels:-

\section*{1. Genetic sex}
- is determined by the presence or absence of a Y chromosome. No matter how many X chromosomes are present, the presence of a single Y chromosome leads to testicular development \& a genetic male. At least one Y chromosome is necessary \& sufficient for male gender to manifest.

\section*{2. Gonadal sex}
- is determined by the presence of ovaries or testes. The gene responsible for the development of the testes is localized to the Y chromosome.

\section*{3. Ductal sex}
- depends on the presence of derivatives of the Mullerian or Wolffian ducts.

\section*{4. Phenotypic or genital sex}
- is based on the appearance of the external genitalia.

Sexual ambiguity is present whenever there is discordance among these various criteria for determining sex.

\section*{ii. True hermaphrodite}
- is very rare.
- has both ovaries \& testicular tissue, with ambiguous external genitalia.
- may result from the fusion of 2 sperms (one X -carrying sperm \& one Y -carrying sperm) with a binucleated ovum.
iii. Pseudohermaphrodite
- shows discordance between the phenotypic sex \& gonadal sex.
- i.e. has gonads of only one sex, but the appearance of the external genitalia does not correspond to the gonads present. Thus, a male pseudohermaphrodite has testicular tissue but female-type genitalia. A female pseudohermaphrodite has a ovaries but male external genitalia (or the external genitalia are not clearly male).

\section*{1. Female pseudohermaphroditism}
- is caused by exposure of the fetus to increased androgenic hormones during the early part of gestation as occurs in congenital adrenal hyperplasia, androgen-secreting ovarian or adrenal tumor in the mother, or hormones administered to the mother during pregnancy.

\section*{2. Male pseudohermaphroditism}
- has a Y chromosome \& only testes but the genital ducts or the external genitalia are either ambiguous or completely female.
- may be caused by tissue resistance to androgens (called testicular feminization), by defects in testosterone synthesis, or by estrogens administered to the mother during pregnancy.
V. Disorders with multifactorial inheritance
- are more common than mendelian disorders.
- result from the combined actions of environmental factors \& 2 or more mutant genes having additive effects (i.e. the greater the number of inherited mutant genes, the more severe the phenotypic expression of the disease). The disease clinically manifests only when the combined influences of the genes \& the environment cross a certain threshold.
- include such common diseases as:-
- Diabetes mellitus,
- Hypertension,
- Ischemic heart disease,
- Gout,
- Schizophrenia,
- Bipolar disorders,
- Neural tube defects,
- Cleft lip/ cleft palate,
- Pyloric stenosis,
- Congenital heart disease, etc -
- are characterized by the following features:-
1. The risk of expressing a multifactorial disorder partly depends on the number of inherited mutant genes.

Hence, if a patient has more severe expression of the disease, then his relatives have a greater risk of expressing the disease (because they have a higher chance inheriting a greater number of the mutant gene). In addition, the greater the number of affected relatives, the higher the risk for other relatives.
2. The risk of recurrence of the disorder is the same for all first degree relatives of the affected individual \& this is in the range of $2-7 \%$. First-degree relatives are parents, siblings, \& offspring. Hence, if parents have had one affected child, then risk that the next child will be affected is between $2 \& 7 \%$. Similarly, there is the same chance that one of the parents will be affected.
3. The concordance rate for identical twins (i.e. the probability that both identical twins will
be affected) is $20 \bullet 40 \%$ but this is much greater than the concordance rate for nonidentical twins.
4. The risk of recurrence of the phenotypic abnormality in subsequent pregnancies depends on the outcome in previous pregnancies. When one child is affected, the chance that the next child will be affected is $7 \%$. When 2 children are affected, then the chance that the next child will be affected increases to $9 \%$.
VII. Single gene disorders with nonclassic inheritance
- are rare \& are briefly mentioned here.
- can be classified into the following categories:
A. Diseases caused by mutations in mitochondrial genes. E.g. Leber hereditary optic neuropathy
B. Diseases associated with genomic imprinting E.g. Prader-Willi syndrome, Angelman syndrome
C. Diseases associated with gonadal mosaicism

Gonadal mosaicism can explain unusual pedigrees seen in some autosomal dominant disorders such as osteogenesis imperfecta in which phenotypically normal parents have more than one affected children. This cannot be explained by new mutations. Instead, it can be explained by gonadal mosaicism
D. Disorders caused by triplet repeat mutations E.g. Fragile X syndrome
- is the second most frequent cause of hereditary mental retardation next to Down syndrome.
- is clinically manifest in both males \& females. In males, it is characterized by bilateral macroorchidism (enlarged testes).
