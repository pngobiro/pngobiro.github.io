                        <p>A wound is any breach in continuity of surface like cuts surgical incisions and others, while an ulcer is a pathological break in the continuity of the surface. Ulcers are local defects on the surface of an organ produced by inflammation (pathological). Pathological implies diseased. This is repaired by regeneration of the parenchyma cells of the organs concerned and growth of the supporting connective tissue ( regeneration). The end result of the repair process will depend largely upon the balance between two factors.</p>
                        <p>The better the repair the more the regeneration

It involves the proliferation of original cells from the margin of injury with migration so as to cover the gap followed by proliferation of migrated cells with subsequent differentiation and maturation so as to reconstitute the original tissue. Some parenchyma cells are short-lived while others have a longer lifespan. To maintain proper structure of tissues the cells have regulatory control of the cell cycle. These include epidermal growth factor, fibroblast growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, endothelial growth factor, and transforming growth factor.</p>

                        <p>There is sufficient loss of tissue so that the edges are separated by a defect for example an ulcer or abscess cavity, large wound. A large bulk of reparative tissue is required and the process takes longer than healing by $1^{\text {st }}$ intention. In such circumstances cleaning and stitching may produce primary union</p>

                            <li>1) If there is wound infection, this has to be overcome first by inflammation response and the debris removed by macrophages.</li>
                            <li>2) Repair starts from the floor of the defect with invasion of a surface by proliferating capillary loops and fibroblasts. This is continued in ever increasing arcades of capillaries and their accompanying fibroblasts. Fibroblastic maturation continues towards the surface until the whole area of tissue is red in colour with a granular surface due to the capillary loops granulation tissues</li>
                            <li>3) The surface epithelial cells at the margins proliferate and grow over the surface of the granulation tissue until the wound is covered.</li>
                            <li>4) The vascular granular tissue mature from the base towards the surface until the entire area is covered into a mass of fibrous tissue at first then becomes pale as the scar tissue becomes a vascular the collagens subsequently contracts, this usually results in a depression or puckering of the surface.</li>
