The cytoplasm contains condensed or fragmented nuclear crenation characteristically unlike necrosis; inflammatory response around apoptosis is absent. Shrinkage of cell with dense cytoplasm and almost normal organelles are features encountered. Convolutions of cell membrane with formation of membrane band near spherical bodies called apoptotic bodies that has compacted organelles are seen. Chromatin condensation around the periphery of nucleus is often observed.
