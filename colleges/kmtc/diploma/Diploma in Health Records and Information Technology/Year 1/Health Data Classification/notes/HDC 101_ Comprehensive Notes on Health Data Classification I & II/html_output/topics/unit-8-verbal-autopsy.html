                        <p><strong>Verbal autopsy</strong> - a method used to ascertain the cause of a death based on an interview with next of kin or other caregivers</p>
                        <p>It uses a standardized questionnaire that elicits information on signs, symptoms, medical history and circumstances preceding death.</p>

                            <li>VA is a primary source of information about causes of death in populations lacking a robust vital registration and medical certification system e.g. Kenya</li>
                            <li>Ideal in settings where deaths occur at home and therefore not medically certified by a clinician</li>
                            <li>It is an essential public health tool for</li>
                            <li>obtaining a reasonable direct estimation of the cause structure of mortality at a community level,</li>
                            <li>Providing an accurate method for attributing causes of death at the individual level.</li>
                            <li>Standardized tools used during VA allow for consistency & cross-comparability of mortality data</li>
                            <li>Allows for assignment of a group level for causes of death corresponding to ICD-11 codes</li>

                            <p>NB: Of all events that are registered in the country, 60% of the births and 70% of the deaths occur at home, which are registered by assistant chiefs</p>

                        <h3>Purpose</h3>
                        <p>The purpose of VA is to describe the causes of death at the community level in situations where no better alternative sources of mortality data exist.</p>
                        <p>VA serves as a limited but essential substitute for medical certification.<br>
                        The quality of information of the diagnoses varies depending on the skills of the interviewer and the memory of the respondents.</p>
