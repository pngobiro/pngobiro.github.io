                        <h3>Foundation</h3>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>ICD-11 has a foundation component providing the overarching repository/database whereby concepts can be drawn into specific classifications or linearization's e,g mortality, morbidity, primary care, research, functioning and disability and quality and safety.</li>
                            <li>Specifically, the foundation component of ICD-11 is a multidimensional collection of all ICD entities, the diseases, disorders, injuries, external causes, signs and symptoms.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Stem Code</h3>
                        <p>They are codes in a particular tabular list that can be used alone. Stem codes may be entities or groupings of high relevance, or clinical entities that should always be described as one entity. An example of a stem code from Chapter 22 Injury, poisoning or certain other consequences of external causes is: NC72.5 Fracture of shaft of femur.</p>
                        <p>Place of occurrence code e.g injury</p>

                        <h3>Extension Code</h3>
                        <p>Can be used optionally to add additional information or details to a stem code</p>
                        <p>Extension codes have been designed to standardise the way additional information is added to stem codes, and the adoption of multi-dimensional coding results in a substantially reduced amount of stem codes.</p>

                        <h3>Pre-coordination</h3>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Pre-coordination refers to stem codes that contain all pertinent information about a clinical concept in a pre-combined fashion.</li>
                            <li>stem codes that contain all pertinent information about a clinical concept in a precombined fashion</li>
                            <li>For example:BD50.40 Abdominal aortic aneurysm with perforation.</li>
                            <li>You can see that the "with perforation" is included in the stem code.</li>
                            <li>This is an example of "pre-coordination" of a clinical concept.</li>
                            <li>Conversely, the opposite of pre-coordination is post-coordination.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Post-Coordination</h3>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Post-coordination or cluster coding refers to the use of multiple codes, that is, stem codes and/or extension codes) together to fully describe a documented clinical concept.</li>
                            <li>Post-coordination requires use of a convention, either a forward slash or ampersand, to show more than one ICD-11 code used together to describe a documented clinical concept.</li>
                            <li>The example shown is a clinical concept/diagnosis recorded as: Duodenal ulcer with acute hemorrhage".</li>
                            <li>Post-coordination is required to fully describe the documented clinical concept. DA63.Z represents "Duodenal ulcer, unspecified" and the forward slash is the convention used to link the other stem code ME24.90 Acute gastrointestinal bleeding, not elsewhere classified.</li>
                            <li>You will remember that this is different from the convention of using an ampersand before an extension code when linking it to a stem code.</li>
                            <li>Requires creating a cluster or cluster coding</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Digital-friendly.</h3>

                            <li>Fully embracing the digital age, ICD-11 is accompanied by a host of online and digital resources.</li>
                            <li>Online resources include browsers of the Foundation Component and various linearizations and a coding tool for the Mortality and Morbidity Statistics linearization (MMS).</li>
                            <li>Downloadable resources include maps between ICD-10 and ICD-11 and the MMS. Application programming interfaces (API) allow programmatic access to the Foundation Component, MMS, and ICD-10.</li>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h3>ICD</h3>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>François Bossier de Lacroix (1706-1777), better known as Sauvages, was first to attempt to classify diseases systematically. Sauvages' comprehensive treatise was published under the title Nosologia methodica.</li>
                            <li>A contemporary of Sauvages was the great methodologist Linnaeus (1707-1778), one of whose treatises was entitled Genera morborum.</li>
                            <li>At the beginning of the 19th century, the classification of disease in most general use was one by William Cullen (1710-1790), of Edinburgh, which was published in 1785 under the title Synopsis nosologiae methodicae.</li>
                            <li>Fortunately for the progress of preventive medicine, the General Register Office of England and Wales, at its inception in 1837, found in William Farr (1807-1883) - its first medical statistician - a man who not only made the best possible use of the imperfect classifications of disease available at the time, but laboured to secure better classifications and international uniformity in their use. Farr found the classification of Cullen in use in the public services of his day. It had not been revised to embody the advances of medical science, nor was it deemed by him to be satisfactory for statistical purposes.</li>
                            <li>The utility of a uniform classification of causes of death was so strongly recognized at the first International Statistical Congress, held in Brussels in 1853, that the Congress requested William Farr and Marc d'Espine, of Geneva, to prepare an internationally applicable, uniform classification of causes of death. At the next congress, in Paris in 1855, Farr and d'Espine submitted two separate lists, which were based on very different principles. Farr's classification was arranged under five groups: epidemic diseases, constitutional (general) diseases, local diseases arranged according to anatomical site, developmental diseases and diseases that are the direct result of violence. d'Espine classified diseases according to their nature (gouty, herpetic, haematic, etc.). The congress adopted a compromise list of 139 rubrics.</li>
                            <li>In 1864, this classification was revised in Paris, on the basis of Farr's model, and was subsequently further revised in 1874, 1880 and 1886.</li>
                            <li>Although this classification was never universally accepted, the general arrangement proposed by Farr, including the principle of classifying diseases by anatomical site, survived as the basis of the International list of causes of death.</li>
                            <li>The International Statistical Institute, the successor to the International Statistical Congress, at its meeting in Vienna in 1891, charged a committee, chaired by Jacques Bertillon (1851-1922), Chief of Statistical Services of the City of Paris, with the preparation of a classification of causes of death. It is of interest to note that Bertillon was the grandson of Achille Guillard, a noted botanist and statistician, who had introduced the resolution requesting Farr and d'Espine to prepare a uniform classification at the first International Statistical Congress in 1853. The report of this committee was presented by Bertillon at the meeting of the International Statistical Institute in Chicago in 1893 and adopted by it. The classification prepared by Bertillon's committee was based on the classification of causes of death used by the City of Paris, which, since its revision in 1885, represented a synthesis of English, German, and Swiss classifications.</li>
                            <li>1893: The first international classification edition, known as the International List of Causes of Death, was adopted by the International Statistical Institute.</li>
                            <li>The Bertillon classification of causes of death, as it was first called, received general approval and was adopted by several countries, as well as by many cities.</li>
                            <li>Bertillon continued to be the guiding force in the promotion of the International list of causes of death, and the revisions of 1900, 1910 and 1920 were carried out under his leadership. As Secretary-General of the International Conference, he sent out the provisional revision for 1920 to more than 500 people, asking for comments. His death in 1922 left the International Conference without a guiding hand.</li>
                            <li>At the 1923 session of the International Statistical Institute, Michel Huber, Bertillon's successor in France, recognized this lack of leadership and introduced a resolution for the International Statistical Institute to renew its stand of 1893 in regard to the International classification of causes of death and to cooperate with other international organizations in preparation for subsequent revisions.</li>
                            <li>Several versions followed but their focus was on the causes of death: International Classification of Causes of Death.</li>
                            <li>The Fifth International Conference for the Revision of the International List of Causes of Death, like the preceding conferences, was convened by the Government of France and was held in Paris in October 1938. The conference approved three lists: a detailed list of 200 titles, an intermediate list of 87 titles and an abridged list of 44 titles. Apart from bringing the lists up to date in accordance with the progress of science, particularly in the chapter on infectious and parasitic diseases, and changes in the chapters on puerperal conditions and on accidents, the conference made as few changes as possible in the contents, number, and even the numbering of the items. A list of causes of stillbirth was also drawn up and approved by the conference. As regards classification of diseases for morbidity statistics, the conference recognized the growing need for a corresponding list of diseases to meet the statistical requirements of widely differing organizations, such as health insurance organizations, hospitals, military medical services, health administrations and similar bodies. The following resolution, therefore, was adopted;
                                <ol>
                                    <li>International Lists of Diseases</li>
                                    <li>Death Certificate and Selection of Causes of Death where more than One Cause is given (Joint Causes)</li>
                                </ol>
                            </li>
                            <li>1948: Creation of ICD. WHO was entrusted with the ICD at its creation and published the 6th version, ICD-6, that incorporated morbidity for the first time.</li>
                            <li>The International Conference for the Seventh Revision of the International Classification of Diseases was held in Paris under the auspices of WHO, in February 1955. In accordance with a recommendation of the WHO Expert Committee on Health Statistics, this revision was limited to essential changes and amendments of errors and inconsistencies.</li>
                            <li>The Eighth Revision Conference convened by WHO met in Geneva, from 6 to 12 July 1965. This revision was more radical than the seventh but left unchanged the basic structure of the classification and the general philosophy of classifying diseases, whenever possible, according to their etiology rather than a particular manifestation. During the years that the seventh and eighth revisions of the ICD were in force, the use of the ICD for indexing hospital medical records increased rapidly and some countries prepared national adaptations that provided the additional detail needed for this application of the ICD.</li>
                            <li>The ICD expansion has continued ever since, with a steady increase in the number of categories for coding non-fatal conditions and other health-related circumstances.</li>
                            <li>The International Conference for the Ninth Revision of the International Classification of Diseases, convened by WHO, met in Geneva from 30 September to 6 October 1975. In the discussions leading up to the conference, it had originally been intended that there should be little change other than updating of the classification.</li>
                            <li>The final proposals presented to and accepted by the Conference retained the basic structure of the ICD, although with much additional detail at the level of the four-digit subcategories, and some optional five-digit subdivisions. For the benefit of users not requiring such detail, care was taken to ensure that the categories at the three-digit level were appropriate.</li>
                            <li>1990: the $10^{\text{th}}$ revision (ICD-10) released and endorsed by the Forty-third World Health Assembly but came in use in May 1994.</li>
                            <li>June 2018: $11^{\text{th}}$ Revision (ICD-11) released. Endorsed by the Member States in the Seventy-second World Health Assembly in May 2019</li>
                            <li>All countries expected to implement ICD-11 by January 2022</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>ICPM</h3>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>The International Classification of Procedures in Medicine (ICPM) was a system of classifying procedure codes published by the World Health Organization from 1978, but never received the same international acceptance as ICD-9. Due to difficulties in the consultation processes, international development of the work effectively stopped in 1989.</li>
                            <li>Only two volumes (Volume I containing 6 chapters and Volume II containing 3 Chapters were published by WHO in 1978.</li>
                            <li>As a result, most nations developed their own standards for coding procedures and interventions incompatible to the ICPM approach. Germany's OPS-301 is based on the Dutch extension of ICPM; the ICPM-DE.</li>
                            <li>Since 2012, the WHO began developing a replacement for ICPM called the International Classification of Health Interventions (ICHI). For those countries who didn't go on to develop their own classification of interventions, the WHO have generated a short list of procedure codes based on ICD-10-AM as an interim measure.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Current development ICD and ICPM</h3>
                        <p>The ICD is originally designed as a health care classification system, providing a system of diagnostic codes for classifying diseases, including nuanced classifications of a wide variety of signs, symptoms, abnormal findings, complaints, social circumstances, and external causes of injury or disease.</p>
                        <p>This system is designed to map health conditions to corresponding generic categories together with specific variations, assigning for these a designated code, up to six characters long. Thus, major categories are designed to include a set of similar diseases. ICD-11 is a major step forward, because it has the necessary terminological and ontological elements for seamless use in digital health.</p>
                        <p>The ICD is revised periodically and is currently in its 11th revision. In June 2018: $11^{\text{th}}$ Revision (ICD-11) released. Endorsed by the Member States in the Seventy-second World Health Assembly in May 2019</p>
                        <p>All countries were expected to implement ICD-11 by January 2022.<br>
                        Kenya officially migrated to ICD 11 use on $1^{\text{st}}$ July2022.</p>
                        <p>The ICPM surgical procedures fascicle was originally created by the United States, based on its adaptations of ICD (called ICDA), which had contained a procedure classification since 1962. ICPM is published separately from the ICD disease classification as a series of supplementary documents called fascicles (bundles or groups of items). Each fascicle contains a classification of modes of laboratory, radiology, surgery, therapy, and other diagnostic procedures. Many countries have adapted and translated the ICPM in parts or as a whole and are using it with amendments since then. The current version was released in 1978.</p>

                        <p>The ICD is a variable-axis classification. The structure of ICD structure was developed of that proposed by William Farr during early days of international discussions. According to him, for all practical, epidemiological purposes, statistical data on diseases should be grouped in the following way:</p>

                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>This contains the Report of the International Conference for the Tenth Revision, the classification itself at the three- and four-character levels, the classification of the morphology of neoplasms, special tabulation lists for mortality and morbidity, definitions, and the nomenclature regulations.</li>
                            <li>This volume has an alphanumeric listing of all codes in the classification, organized into chapters.</li>
                            <li>It contains inclusion and exclusion notes and coding rules.</li>
                            <li>There are 22 chapters in the Tabular List and over 11400 four-character codes.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Most of Volume 1 is taken up with the main classification, composed of the list of three-character categories and the tabular list of inclusions and four-character subcategories.</p>
                        <p>The "core" classification - the list of three-character categories (Volume 1) - is the mandatory level for reporting to the WHO mortality database and for general international comparisons.</p>
                        <p>This core classification also lists chapter and block titles.<br>
                        Volume 1 also contains the following:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Morphology of neoplasms. The classification of morphology of neoplasms may be used, if desired, as an additional code to classify the morphological type for neoplasms which, with a few exceptions, are classified in Chapter II only according to behaviour and site (topography). The morphology codes are the same as those used in the special adaptation of the ICD for oncology (ICD-O) (1).</li>
                            <li>Special tabulation lists. Because the full four-character list of the ICD, and even the threecharacter list, are too long to be presented in every statistical table, most routine statistics use a tabulation list that emphasizes certain single conditions and groups others. The four special lists for the tabulation of mortality are an integral part of the ICD. Lists 1 and 2 are for general mortality and lists 3 and 4 are for infant and child mortality (ages 0-4 years). There is also a special tabulation list for morbidity. These are set out in Volume 1.</li>
                            <li>Definitions. The definitions in Volume 1 have been adopted by the World Health Assembly and are included to facilitate the international comparability of data.</li>
                            <li>Nomenclature regulations. The regulations adopted by the World Health Assembly set out the formal responsibilities of WHO Member States regarding the classification of diseases and causes of death, and the compilation and publication of statistics.</li>

                            <li>The Alphabetical Index consists of three sections, as follows:</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Section I is the index of diseases, syndromes, pathological conditions, injuries, signs, symptoms, problems and other reasons for contact with health services, i.e. the type of information that would be recorded by a physician. It includes all terms classifiable to categories A00-T98 and Z00-Z99 except drugs and other chemical substances giving rise to poisoning or other adverse effects (these are included in Section III).</p>
                        <p>Section II is the index of external causes of injury. The terms included here are not medical diagnoses but descriptions of the circumstances in which the violence occurred (e.g. fire, explosion, fall, assault, collision, submersion). It includes all terms classifiable to V01-Y98, except drugs and chemicals.</p>
                        <p>Section III is the index of drugs and other chemical substances giving rise to poisoning or other adverse effects (referred to in Sections I and II as the Table of drugs and chemicals). For each substance the Table gives the Chapter XIX code for poisoning (T36-T65) and the external cause (Chapter XX) codes for accidental poisoning by and exposure to noxious substances (X40-X49), intentional self-harm (X60-X69), and poisoning, undetermined whether accidental or intentional (Y10-Y19). For drugs, medicaments and biological substances, it also gives the code for these substances causing adverse effects in therapeutic use (Y40-Y59).</p>

                        <h3>Reference classifications</h3>
                        <p>These are the classifications that cover the main parameters of the health system, such as death, disease, functioning, disability, health and health interventions. WHO reference classifications are a product of international agreements.</p>

                        <h3>Derived classifications</h3>
                        <p>Derived classifications are based upon reference classifications. Derived classifications may be prepared by adopting the reference classification structure and classes, providing additional detail beyond that provided by the reference classification, or they may be prepared through rearrangement or aggregation of items from one or more reference classifications. Derived classifications are often tailored for use at the national or international level.</p>

                        <h3>Related classifications</h3>
                        <p>Related classifications are those that partially refer to reference classifications, or that are associated with the reference classification at specific levels of the structure only. Procedures for maintaining, updating and revising statistical classifications of the family encourage the resolution of problems of partial correspondence among related classifications, and offer opportunities for increased harmony over time.</p>

                        <h3>Diagnosis related classifications</h3>
                        <p><strong>Special tabulation lists</strong></p>
                        <p>The special tabulation lists are derived directly from the core classification, for use in data presentation and to facilitate analysis of health status and trends at the international, national and subnational levels. The special tabulation lists recommended for international comparisons and publications are included in Volume 1. There are five such lists, four for mortality and one for morbidity</p>

                        <p><strong>Specialty-based adaptations</strong></p>
                        <p>Specialty-based adaptations usually bring together, in a single, compact volume, the sections or categories of the ICD that are relevant to a particular specialty. The four-character subcategories of the ICD are retained, but more detail is often given by means of fifth-character or sometimes sixthcharacter subdivisions, and there is an Alphabetical index of relevant terms. Other adaptations may give glossary definitions of categories and subcategories within the specialty.</p>

                        <p><strong>Oncology</strong></p>
                        <p>The third edition of the International classification of diseases for oncology (ICD-O-3), published by WHO in 2000, is intended for use in cancer registries, and in pathology and other departments specializing in cancer (1). ICD-O is a dual-axis classification with coding systems for both topography and morphology. For most neoplasms, the topography code uses the same threecharacter and four-character categories used in ICD-10 for malignant neoplasms (categories C00C80). ICD-O thus allows greater specificity of site for non-malignant neoplasms than is possible in ICD-10.</p>

                        <p><strong>Dermatology</strong></p>
                        <p>In 1978, the British Association of Dermatologists published the International coding index for dermatology (5), which was compatible with the ninth revision of the ICD. The association has also published an adaptation of ICD-10 to dermatology, under the auspices of the International League of Dermatological Societies.</p>

                        <p><strong>Dentistry and stomatology</strong></p>
                        <p>The third edition of the Application of the international classification of diseases to dentistry and stomatology (ICD-DA), based on ICD-10, was published by WHO in 1995 (6). It brings together ICD categories for diseases or conditions that occur in, have manifestations in, or have associations with the oral cavity and adjacent structures. It provides greater detail than ICD-10, by means of a fifth digit, but the numbering system is organized so that the relationship between an ICD-DA code and the ICD code from which it is derived is immediately obvious, and so that data from ICD-DA categories can be readily incorporated into ICD categories.</p>

                        <p><strong>Neurology</strong></p>
                        <p>In 1997 WHO published an adaptation of ICD-10 to neurology (ICD-10-NA) (7), which retains the classification and coding systems of ICD-10 but is further subdivided at the fifth-character level and beyond, to allow neurological diseases to be classified with greater precision.</p>

                        <p><strong>Rheumatology and orthopaedics</strong></p>
                        <p>The International League of Associations of Rheumatology is working on a revision of the Application of the international classification of diseases to rheumatology and orthopaedics (ICDR&O), including the International classification of musculoskeletal disorders (ICMSD), to be compatible with ICD-10. The ICD-R&O provides detailed specification of conditions through the use of additional digits, which allow for extra detail while retaining compatibility with ICD-10. The ICMSD is designed to clarify and standardize the use of terms and is supported by a glossary of generic descriptors for groups of conditions, such as the inflammatory polyarthropathies.</p>

                        <p><strong>Paediatrics</strong></p>
                        <p>Under the auspices of the International Pediatric Association, the British Paediatric Association (BPA) has published an application of ICD-10 to paediatrics, which uses a fifth digit to provide greater specificity. This follows similar applications prepared by BPA for ICD-8 and ICD-9.</p>

                        <p><strong>Mental disorders</strong></p>
                        <p>For each category in Chapter V of ICD-10 (Mental and behavioural disorders), The ICD-10 classification of mental and behavioural disorders: clinical descriptions and diagnostic guidelines, published by WHO in 1992, provides a general description and guidelines concerning the diagnosis, as well as comments about differential diagnosis and a listing of synonyms and exclusion terms (8). Where more detail is required, the guidelines give further subdivisions at the fifth- and sixth-digit levels. A second publication relating to Chapter V, The ICD-10 classification of mental and behavioural disorders: diagnostic criteria for research, was published in 1993 (9).</p>

                        <h3>Procedures in medicine</h3>
                        <p>The International classification of procedures in medicine (ICPM) was published in two volumes by WHO in 1978 (12, 13). It includes procedures for medical diagnosis, prevention, therapy, radiology, drugs, and surgical and laboratory procedures. The classification has been adopted by some countries, while others have used it as a basis for developing their own national classifications of surgical operations.</p>

                        <h3>The International classification of functioning, disability and health</h3>
                        <p>The ICF was published by WHO in all six WHO official languages in 2001 (14), after its official endorsement by the 54th World Health Assembly on 22 May 2001. It has subsequently been translated into over 25 languages. The ICF classifies health and health-related states in two parts.</p>

                        <h3>Part 1 classifies functioning and disability.</h3>
                        <p>Part 2 comprises environmental and personal contextual factors. Functioning and disability in Part 1 are described from the perspectives of the body, the individual and society, formulated in two components: (i) body functions and structures, and (ii) activities and participation. Since an individual's functioning and disability occur in a context, the ICF also includes a list of environmental factors.</p>
                        <p>The ICF has superseded the international classification of impairments, disabilities, and handicaps (ICIDH) (15). As a consequence, the old ICIDH terms and definitions have been replaced by the following new ICF terms and definitions:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Functioning is a generic term for body functions, body structures, activities and participation. It denotes the positive aspects of the interaction between an individual (with a health condition) and that individual’s contextual factors (environmental and personal factors).</li>
                            <li>Disability is an umbrella term for impairments, activity limitations and participation restrictions. It denotes the negative aspects of the interaction between an individual (with a health condition) and that individual’s contextual factors (environmental and personal factors).</li>
                            <li>Body functions are the physiological functions of body systems (including psychological functions).</li>
                            <li>Body structures are anatomical parts of the body, such as organs, limbs and their components.</li>
                            <li>Impairments are problems in body function or structure, such as a significant deviation or loss.</li>
                            <li>Activity is the execution of a task or action by an individual.</li>
                            <li>Activity limitations are difficulties an individual may have in executing activities. Participation is involvement in a life situation.</li>
                            <li>Participation restrictions are problems an individual may experience in involvement in life situations.</li>
                            <li>Environmental factors make up the physical, social and attitudinal environment in which people live and conduct their lives. The ICF uses an alphanumeric system in which the letters b, s, d and e are used to denote body functions, body structures, activities and participation, and environmental factors, respectively. These letters are followed by a numeric code that starts with the chapter number (one digit), followed by the second level (two digits), and the third and fourth levels (one digit each). ICF categories are 'nested' so that broader categories are defined to include more detailed subcategories of the parent category. Any individual may have a range of codes at each level. These may be independent or interrelated.</li>
                        </ul>
