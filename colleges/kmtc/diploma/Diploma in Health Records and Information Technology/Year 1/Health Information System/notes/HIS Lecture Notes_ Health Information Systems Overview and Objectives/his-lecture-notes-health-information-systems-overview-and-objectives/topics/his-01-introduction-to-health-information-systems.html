                        <h3>Concept of health information system</h3>
                        <p>Health information system is a system for the collection and processing of data from various sources and using the information for policy making and management of health services. It could be paper based or electronic. To apply this to a nation, a county HIS integrates data from civil/vital registration, censuses, population surveys, facility surveys, individual records, services records and resource records for policy making and efficient management of services. There is a strong feeling that HIS is a key component of any health system. However, currently the data sources are incomplete and fragmented. The challenge is to bring together or integrate all these diverse data sources into one seamless system. Already there is good progress towards this integration by the use of DHIS.</p>

                        <h3>Health information management</h3>
                        <p>It is the practice of maintenance and care of health records by traditional (paper) and electronic means in hospitals, physician's office clinics, health departments, health insurance companies and other facilities that provide health care or maintenance of health records. With the widespread computerization of health records and other information sources, including hospital administration functions and health human resources information, health informatics and health information technology are being increasingly utilized in information management practices in the health care sector.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>In 1972, a committee including representatives from, Ministry of Health, Central Bureau of statistics and the Attorney General chamber was formed.</p>
                        <p>Its task was to design a health Information System for Kenya. A pilot project was designed and tested in three Districts;</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Mombasa representing an urban District</li>
                            <li>Kitui representing rural District</li>
                            <li>Kwale representing peri-urban District</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The pilot survey was completed in 1976 and its suggestions and recommendations were adopted. One of the recommendations was to merge two units that is; Research and Evaluation Unit of the Division of Family Health and that of Vital Statistics Unit of the Division of Communicable Disease control into one entity of HIS.</p>
                        <p>In 1982, another committee of professionals was formed to investigate the accuracy and efficiency of all health data collection forms.</p>
                        <p>The committee suggested a number of changes and as a result all officially approved forms were changed from MED to MOH with a corresponding code number.</p>
                        <p>MED was a reflection of the Dept of Medical of one ministry of health (London) when Kenya was a British Colony.</p>
                        <p>In 1984, the National policy on District Focus for Rural Development was initiated. In response to the new development the ministry of health decentralized its reporting activities by establishing HIS offices in all Districts, where all data from all health facilities within the District are processed.</p>

                            <li>Resource mobilization and allocation. Once data is readily available, it is easy to project the required resources by extrapolating from the past trends with a fairly good accuracy. Rule of the thumb should not be the norm or the practice.</li>
                            <li>Monitoring trends - Disease surveillance is functional and it is thus easy to predict the occurrence of epidemics of diseases.</li>
                            <li>Problem and gap identification - Various departments and institutions becomes part of the system; there is collaboration and co-ordination among various actors.</li>
                            <li>The work and duties of the staff that are involved in the system is appreciated and recognized.</li>
                            <li>Ad-hoc surveys and consultancies are avoided.</li>
                            <li>Decision making and priority service setting.</li>
                            <li>Operational research and training becomes easy and enables quick retrieval of the evidences in practice and use evidence based practices for demonstration.</li>
                            <li>Monitoring and evaluation of projects and programmes will be made easier and alongside working corrective measures or change of strategies will be realized in the initial stages.</li>
                            <li>Donor influence in Health information system is also avoided as in case of reviews.</li>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The approach recommended for strengthening National Health Information System (NHIS) follows a number of principles which have been derived from the assessment of HIS development experiences around the world and WHO past efforts to support such development. These principles relate not only to information system design and use, but also to more effective styles of Technical co-operation.</p>
                        <p>The overall purpose of these principles is to suggest that health information systems development must proceed as an integral part of efforts to strengthen the health care system and that health data be recorded and used firstly, in support of individual care, local health service operation and community action.</p>
                        <p>Placing emphasis on the use of data within the services will help increase the completeness and validity of the data that are selectively reported for supporting decision-making at all levels of the health system and for supporting health system, planning and development including service integration. Therefore:</p>
                        <ol class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Strengthening the Health Information System at the various service levels should be undertaken in support of efforts to develop health services and improve their performance.</li>
                            <li>Any data to be recorded at any service level MUST have an explicitly identified use (for decision or action in terms of case or community management by staff or community members) at all levels. An implication of this principle is that no data should be requested from service levels to be reported to higher levels which do not have an actionable use at the recording level as well as at the receiving levels.</li>
                            <li>Any changes or developments to data recording and reporting should be made only to improve the provision of care at the patient and community level, particularly for those populations most in need. One implication of this principle is that countries, municipalities or regions should not be encouraged to change their information system primarily to provide data for central level and International reporting purposes.</li>
                            <li>Each Health administration must assess its needs for clinical and managerial information based on its mission, goals, priorities, core service responsibilities, levels and functions, models of service delivery, resources and access to information technology. The Health Information System should be designed so as to not exceed the capability of the administration to manage it.</li>
                            <li>Great prudence should be applied when making changes to components of health information Systems that are working fairly well. This applies particularly to reporting systems of specialized services program such as family planning or Tuberculosis control or EPI. Overall revision in health service recording and reporting should rarely be undertaken. Changes in the system should aim to progressively integrate the recording and reporting system at the local service level.</li>
                            <li>Efforts should be made to make better use of existing data at all levels through practical analysis, improved presentation of data and efforts to improve the flow and sharing data across program and services.</li>
                            <li>Practical use of information should be encouraged and supported for database maintenance and report generation. Such computerization should normally employ generic software that is widely available database management systems and spreadsheets. Major computerization efforts should not dominate the selection of indicators and data or the design of records and reports, but support the improvement of data management through the application of these principles.</li>
                            <li>The selection and definition of a manageable data set or set of "Essential health indicators" is recommended as a sound activity for initiating the review and strengthening of health information systems and for devising a practical National Health Service monitoring capability. Core health indicators should be chosen for national, provincial and district use with the following criteria in mind:
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>(a) Useful for action.</strong> - The data needed for the indicator are useful for the person doing the recording with recorded data contributing to necessary action being taken with regard to the case, family, community or district being served.</li>
                                    <li><strong>(b). Relevant for national and program monitoring.</strong>- the indicator can serve to measure progress toward stated national and program goals, objectives, targets, norms and standards. Such indicators focus on priority health problems in the country and the services and resources intended to manage those problems. Promotion and use of the indicator should strengthen routine program management and the health information system in the country.</li>
                                    <li><strong>(c).Valid, consistent, reliable, representative and sensitive.</strong> - the indicators should possess the normal desirable characteristics of health data, example capable of being recorded across the services with the necessary degree of validity, consistency, reliability, representative of all population groups and be sensitive to short term changes in the variable of interest.</li>
                                    <li><strong>(d) Ease of generation and measurement.</strong> - The indicator data should as much as possible result from normal service and surveillance, usually existing within routine records and reports.</li>
                                    <li><strong>(e) Understandable:</strong> - the indicator should deal with a single clear idea which everyone will see as an important measure. Composite indexes should be avoided.</li>
                                    <li><strong>(f) Ethical:</strong> - Data collection, including the choice of the data source, computation of the indicator and its use should not conflict with accepted ethical values.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ol>
