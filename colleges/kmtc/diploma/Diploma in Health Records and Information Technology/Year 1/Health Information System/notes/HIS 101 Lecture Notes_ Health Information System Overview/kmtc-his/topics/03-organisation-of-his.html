                        <p><strong>Tier 1 - (level 1)</strong> which comprises all the community-based health activities, organized around the comprehensive community strategy (CCS). This is a non-facility-based level.</p>
                        <p>Referrals at this level are initiated by community health workers (CHS) in the community units (CU) are linked to primary health care facilities to which majority of the referrals from this level are made.</p>

                        <p><strong>Tier 2; the primary care facilities (Levels 2 & 3)</strong> comprises dispensaries, clinics, health centers and maternity homes. Dispensaries are managed by a small number of staff, a large majority being nurses. Like the community level dispensaries refer to level 3 facilities and in some cases level four. Some dispensaries with larger capacity act as receiving points from other smaller facilities of the same level. Also, at level 3 offers services of inpatient services, mostly maternity. These facilities mainly received from level 1 and 2 facilities.</p>

                        <p><strong>Tier 3 - (level 4 and 5) County Referral health facilities</strong> comprises all levels 4 & 5 facilities operating in and managed by the county. All the county managed facilities from a country referral system, which shares specific services to form a virtual network. The county referral system receives referrals from primary care facilities in its area of responsibility from other country facilities in the country, and from facilities outside the county (horizontal referral) and community units. At this level they offer inpatient and outpatient services and have large laboratories that offer diagnostic services that otherwise would not be available at the primary care facilities. Also in emergency referrals from may come from level 1.</p>

                        <p><strong>Tier 4. The national Health facilities /teaching and referral institutions (level 6)</strong> Includes the facilities that provide specialized healthcare services, such as hospitals, laboratories, blood banks and research institutions. These facilities operate with defined level of autonomy. Also at this level is where there is expertise and services are offered and linkage with local and international universities facilities and staff are maintained.</p>
