                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Before independence, there was no formal structure to collect, collate, analyze and disseminate health information. In 1972, a committee that included representatives from the MoH, WHO, the Central Bureau of Statistics (now KNBS) and the Attorney General Chambers was formed. The task of the HIS committee was to design a HIS for Kenya. A pilot project was designed and tested in 3 locations:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Mombasa urban district</li>
                            <li>Kwale peri-urban district and</li>
                            <li>Kitui rural district.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Pilot project was completed in 1976 and recommendations were given and adopted.</p>
                        <p>One major recommendation was to merge two sections, the Research and Evaluation Section of the Division of Family Health and Vital Health Statistics Section of the Division of Communicable Diseases Control into one entity namely the Health Information System Division.</p>
                        <p>Another recommendation was to develop a system of code numbers for the data collection and reporting forms (the prefix MED to MoH ) to get rid of the colonial connotation that would identify all forms in the Ministry of Health.</p>
                        <p>In 1982, another committee of professionals was formed to investigate on the accuracy and efficiency of all health data collection forms. The committee recommended that the forms were working well. In 1984, the national policy on, "District Focus for Rural Development" (DFRD) was initiated.</p>
                        <p>In response to this new development, the MoH decentralized its reporting activities by establishing HIS offices in all Districts now Counties where health data from all health facilities would be processed and analyzed for use before it is transmitted to the next level (DHRIO).</p>
                        <p>Reforms have taken place within the health sector since in an attempt to ensure highest health standards possible for her citizens for which the HIS continues to play a key role.</p>
                        <p>In 1994, the MOH and other stakeholders in the health sector spearheaded the development of 1st Kenya Health Policy Framework (KHPF 1994-2010).</p>
                        <p>The KHPF outlined areas which required immediate attention including the provision of integrated data collection and reporting tools, improvement of data flow mechanisms, support districts in supportive supervision, provide clear policy guidelines on HIS and improve feedback mechanisms at all levels.</p>
                        <p>In 2003, key reforms were undertaken with the introduction of performance based monitoring in the public sector. Based on the comprehensive health information assessment report (2004), the sector identified core indicators for performance monitoring leading to the revision, integration and harmonization of the minimum data sets (data collection and reporting tools) and core indicators for performance monitoring.</p>
                        <p>One of the strategic objectives of KHSSP II (2005 2010) was to strengthen monitoring and evaluation (Health Information System) in the Health Sector under the clarion call of "reversing the trends". The implementation of the above sector strategic plan was through Annual Operational Plans (AOPs) now Annual Work Plans (AWPs) which were to be monitored through an established framework on set targets.</p>
                        <p>AOPs gave rise to annual performance reviews and annual reports. Prior to 2008, information transmission and data management were manual with minimal automation (Kwale and CLARION models) In 2008, File Transfer Protocol (FTP) which was using the excel spreadsheets was introduced Districts were able to transfer data to the national sever in an easier and more efficient manner.</p>
                        <p>The national level received only district aggregates which could not be disaggregated to show facility specific details, thus making it impossible to do analysis of comparative performance across facilities. They were many worksheets for the master workbook at the national level and because of continuous splitting up of districts to create new districts further complicated the data management process. 22</p>
                        <p>Because of inadequacies of the FTP system, the MoH embarked on a process to acquire a web based database that would facilitate processing of facility level data at all levels. At this time, different soft wares (over 70) were in use in the health sector and an assessment was conducted with a view of coming up with an integrated software. This led to the adoption of the District Health Information System Software (DHIS) in 2010, which was web-based and was to be used for aggregate data management.</p>

                        <p>HIS policies outline a deliberate system of principle to guide decision and achieve HIS outcomes. Patients must be ensured that the health information they share with health care professionals will remain confidential, without such assurance, patients may withhold critical information that could affect the quality safety and outcome of care,</p>

                        <h3>The link between health information services and the user</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Medical education and mentoring</strong> which ranges from the provision of continuous medical education from professionals and special medical education seminars targeted groups of interactive expert</li>
                            <li><strong>Remote patient monitoring</strong> uses devices to remotely collect and send data to monitoring stations for interpretation i.e telehealth application which includes telemetry devices which captures a specific vital sign example blood pressure, glucose, ECG or weight, such services can reduce nurse's visitation,</li>
                            <li><strong>Consumer medical and health information</strong> includes the use of internet for consumer to obtain specialized health information and on -line discussion groups to pride peer to peer support.</li>
                            <li><strong>Direct patient care</strong> such as sharing audio, video and medical data between a patient and a health professional for use in rendering a diagnosis, treatment plan, prescription or advice. This might involve patients located at a remote clinic, a physician, s office or home.</li>
