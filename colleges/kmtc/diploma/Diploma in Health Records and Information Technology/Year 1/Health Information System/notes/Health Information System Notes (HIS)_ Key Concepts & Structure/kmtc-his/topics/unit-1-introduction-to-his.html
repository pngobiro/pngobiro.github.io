                            <li>Software</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>1. Hardware</h3>
                        <p>Hardware includes all physical devices and materials used in information processing. It includes not only machines such as computers and other equipments but also data media i.e all tangible objects which data is recorded from sheets of papers to magnetic disks.</p>
                        <h4>Examples of hardware</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Set of integrated devices that inputs, process and store data and information.</li>
                            <li>Computer peripherals -any external devices that provides input, output for the computer e.g keyboard, mouse for input of data and commands, a video screen of printer for output of information and magnetic or optical disks for storage of data resources</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>2. Software</h3>
                        <p>The concept of software resources includes all sets of information processing instructions. Software is divided into two:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>System software</li>
                            <li>Application software</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>System Software</strong> - Operating programmes which controls and supports the operations of the computer system eg windows 7</p>
                        <p><strong>Application system</strong> - programmes that direct processing for particular use of computers by end users eg Sales analysis program, payroll program and a work processing program. Application software is designed for specific task eg procedures which are operating instructions for the people who will use an information system eg. Instructions for filling out paper form using a software package</p>

                        <h3>3. Networks</h3>
                        <p>Telecommunications networks like the internet, intranet and extranets have become essential to the successful operations of all types of organizations and their computer based systems. A telecommunication network consists of communication processors and other devices interconnected by communication media and controlled by communication software.</p>
                        <p><strong>Network resources</strong> - Communication media eg fiber optic cable, microwave system and communication satellite systems.</p>

                        <h3>Concept of health information system</h3>
                        <p>Health information system is a system for the collection and processing of data from various sources and using the information for policy making and management of health services. It could be paper based or electronic. To apply this to nation, a county HIS integrates data from civil/vital registration, censuses, population surveys, facility surveys, individual records, services records and resource records for policy making and efficient management of services. There is a strong feeling that HIS is a key component of any health system. However, currently the data sources are incomplete and fragmented. The challenge is to bring together or integrate all these diverse data sources into one seamless system. Already there is good progress towards this integration by the use of DHIS</p>

                        <h3>Health information management</h3>
                        <p>It is the practice of maintenance and care of health records by traditional (paper) and electronic means in hospitals, physician's office clinics, health departments, health insurance companies and other facilities that provide health care or maintenance of health records. With the widespread computerized of health records and other information sources, including hospital administration functions and health human resources information, health informatics and health information technology are being increasingly utilized in information management practices in the health care sector.</p>
                        
                        <h3>HOW DATA IS COLLECTED IN HIS</h3>
                        <p>HIS collects data from all possible sources that have bearing on health in a systematic way, process and then turns it into meaningful information ie. is used to plan and manage health services efficiently. eg in outpatient department health centers and dispensaries</p>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Before independence, there was no formal structure to collect, collate analyze and disseminate health information</p>
                        <p>In 1972, a committee including representatives from, Ministry of Health, Central Bureau of statistics and the Attorney General chamber was formed.</p>
                        <p>Its task was to design a health Information System for Kenya. A pilot project was designed and tested in three Districts;</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Mombasa representing an urban District</li>
                            <li>Kitui representing rural District</li>
                            <li>Kwale representing peri-urban District</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The pilot survey was completed in 1976 and its suggestions and recommendations were adopted.</p>
                        <p>One of the recommendations was to merge two units that is; Research and Evaluation Unit of the Division of Family Health and that of Vital Statistics Unit of the Division of Communicable Disease control into one entity of HIS.</p>
                        <p>In 1982, another committee of professionals was formed to investigate the accuracy and efficiency of all health data collection forms.</p>
                        <p>The committee suggested a number of changes and as a result all officially approved forms were changed from MED to MOH with a corresponding code number.</p>
                        <p>MED was a reflection of the Dept of Medical of one ministry of health (London) when Kenya was a British Colony.</p>
                        <p>In 1984, the National policy on District Focus for Rural Development was initiated. In response to the new development the ministry of health decentralized its reporting activities by establishing HIS offices in all Districts, where all data from all health facilities within the District are processed.</p>
                        <p>In response to this new development, the MOH decentralized its reporting activities by establishing HIS offices in all Districts now Counties where health data from all health facilities would be processed and analyzed for use before it is transmitted to the next level (DHRIO).</p>
                        <p>Reforms have taken place within the health sector since in an attempt to ensure highest health standards possible for her citizens for which the HIS continues to play a key role</p>
                        <p>In 1994, the MOH and other stakeholders in the health sector spearheaded the development of 1st Kenya Health Policy Framework (KHPF 1994-2010).</p>
                        <p>The KHPF outlined areas which required immediate attention including the provision of integrated data collection and reporting tools, improvement of data flow mechanisms, support districts in supportive supervision, provide clear policy guidelines on HIS and improve feedback mechanisms at all levels.</p>
                        <p>In 2003, key reforms were undertaken with the introduction of performance-based monitoring in the public sector.</p>
                        <p>Based on the comprehensive health information assessment report (2004), the sector identified core indicators for performance monitoring leading to the revision, integration and harmonization of the minimum data sets (data collection and reporting tools) and core indicators for performance monitoring One of the strategic objectives of KHSSP II (2005-2010) was to strengthen monitoring and evaluation (Health Information System) in the Health Sector under the clarion call of "reversing the trends".</p>
                        <p>The implementation of the above sector strategic plan was through Annual Operational Plans (AOPs) now Annual Work Plans (AWPs) which were to be monitored through an established framework on set targets.</p>
                        <p>AOPs gave rise to annual performance reviews and annual reports.</p>
                        <p>Prior to 2008, information transmission and data management were manual with minimal automation (Kwale and CLARION models)</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>In 2008, File Transfer Protocol (FTP) which was using the excel spreadsheets was introduced - Districts were able to transfer data to the national sever in an easier and more efficient manner.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The national level received only district aggregates which could not be disaggregated to show facility specific details, thus making it impossible to do analysis of comparative performance across facilities</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>They were many worksheets for the master workbook at the national level and because of continuous splitting up of districts to create new districts further complicated the data management process. 22</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Because of inadequacies of the FTP system, the MoH embarked on a process to acquire a webbased database that would facilitate processing of facility level data at all levels.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>At this time, different softwares (over 70) were in use in the health sector and an assessment was conducted with a view of coming up with an integrated software.</li>
                            <li>This led to the adoption of the District Health Information System Software (DHIS) in 2010, which was web-based and was to be used for aggregate data management.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>From FTP to DHIS2</h3>
                        <p>The web based database will able to generate aggregate reports for use at regional and national levels, the system's standard output had to include dashboards generated for use at health facilities to assist them in planning, and initiating the interventions required in management of services at their level.</p>
                        
                        <h3>From FTP to DHIS2</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>At the same time, there existed several lists of health facilities kept by different departments hence need to harmonize and integrate them - gave rise to development of web-based software to manage health facilities called the Master Facility List (MFL)</li>
                            <li>Government in collaboration with stakeholder formulated the HIS Policy (2010-2030) and HMIS strategic plan (2009-2014) to strengthen the national HIS and enable it have sufficient capacity to serve all health stakeholders'information needs.</li>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>✓ The HIS policy is an expressing of the goals priorities and strategies for improving performance in health care sector.</p>
                        <p>✓ It highlights the importance the two ministries of health based on performance measurements as a means of gaining insight on effectiveness and efficiency of health services</p>
                        <p>✓ The application of HIS is also expected to enhance accountability and provide a forum for learning from previous experiences.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Various weaknesses were identified in existing information systems which included:</h3>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Lack of policy and guidelines</li>
                            <li>Inadequate capacities of HIS staffs</li>
                            <li>Unskillled personnel handling data</li>
                            <li>Lack of intergration</li>
                            <li>Many parallel data collections</li>
                            <li>Poor coordinatin</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Overall, the current HIS provides limited information for monitoring health goals and empowering communities and individuals with timely and understandable information on health</p>
                        <p>The development of this policy was as a result of team work and consultative process by the government ministries and agencies development partners or agencies faith based.</p>

                        <h3>The development of this policy was therefore guided by the following specific principles</h3>
                        <ol type="I">
                            <li>The need to establish and maintain simple, easy understandable and compatible information system for tracking the degree of achievement of health sector objectives at all levels</li>
                            <li>The need for readily and accessible data for management and decision making which therefore calls foe the need to collect and disseminateaccurate and timely data.</li>
                            <li>The recognition of compulsory and comprehensive data reporting of health care performance to the public sector, private, community and other providers.</li>
                            <li>The need to promote ethical considerations in matters concerning data security and information disclosure</li>
                            <li>Need to share information among health stake holders</li>
                            <li>Need to establish clear structures in support of the system and accountability for results by well trained motivated personnel.</li>
                            <li>The need to provide linkages with data sources by using appropriate technology</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3>Different systems within the HIS</h3>
                        <ol>
                           <li>In patient health information system</li>

                           <li>Management information system</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h4>1. Outpatient Health information System</h4>
                        <p>This system collects information on preventive, curative, health promotion and rehabilitative services from the following vertical programs such as:</p>
                        <ul>
                           <li>Patient support centre</li>
                           <li>KEPI currently DVI</li>
                           <li>Maternal and Child Health</li>
                           <li>Family planning.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>✓ Each of these vertical programs has its own health information system.<br>✓ Each information system gives different health statistics for example from DVI we can get immunization coverage and the number of mothers who have received tetanus toxoid<br>✓ From lab we can get number of diagnostic investigations<br>✓ From outpatient department we can get morbidity cases and number of attendance per health facility.</p>
                        <p>Several reports are prepared at the outpatient department such as;</p>
                        <ul>
                           <li>MOH705A- Which is under five outpatient morbidity summary sheet</li>
                           <li>MOH 705B- Which is over five years daily outpatient morbidity summary sheet</li>
                           <li>MOH 710- Immunization summary sheet</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>N/B The information that is collected from outpatient HIS including vertical programs can be used for planning and management within the health facility based on a daily or monthly basis</p>

                        <h4>2. In patient Health information System</h4>
                        <p>✓ In the inpatient department we collect information on curative services from all patients on admission and during their stay at the health facility.<br>✓ Upon discharge the health records personnel collects patients records and calculates the following inpatient hospital statistics,</p>
                        <ul>
                           <li>Bed occupancy</li>
                           <li>Patient turn over interval</li>
                           <li>Average Length of Stay</li>
                           <li>Hospital Bed to Hospital population Ratio</li>
                           <li>Vacant Bed Days</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The statistics are used to monitor the operational efficiency of the health facility and may be important for measuring the impact of cost sharing activity in the county</p>

                        <h4>3. Management information system</h4>
                        <p>Like the outpatient HIS, there are a number of management information system, each of this give different health service statistics e.g</p>
                        <p><strong>1. Personnel information system;</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                           <li>Gives the available manpower and how they have been deployed,</li>
                           <li>Date of employment, date of retirement, personal numbers, etc</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>2. Facility information system;</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                           <li>Gives the number of health facilities and the services they are offering e.g Family planning, immunization etc.</li>
                           <li>Tell us how many service delivery points offer health services</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>3.Transport information system;</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                           <li>Gives the number of vehicles and those that are in working condition,</li>
                           <li>Number of vehicles, registration numbers and log books</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Advantages of a functioning health information system:</h4>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Information is readily available when requested or required, avoiding the last minute rushes to look for data.</li>
                            <li>Policy makers and managers of program use the information for the health and developmentplanning and implementation and are sensitized on importance and effective utilization ofInformation.</li>
                            <li>Resource mobilization and allocation. Once data is readily available, it is easy to project therequired resources by extrapolating from the past trends with a fairly good accuracy. Rule of thethumb should not be the norm or the practice.</li>
                            <li>Monitoring trends - Disease surveillance is functional and it is thus easy to predict the occurrenceof epidemics of diseases.</li>
                            <li>Problem and gap identification - Various departments and institutions becomes part of the system;there is collaboration and co-ordination among various actors.</li>
                            <li>The work and duties of the staff that are involved in the system is appreciated and recognized.</li>
                            <li>Ad-hoc surveys and consultancies are avoided.</li>
                            <li>Decision making and priority service setting.</li>
                            <li>Operational research and training becomes easy and enables quick retrieval of the evidences in practice and use evidence based practices for demonstration.</li>
                            <li>Monitoring and evaluation of projects and programs will be made easier and alongside working corrective measures or change of strategies will be realized in the initial stages.</li>
                            <li>Donor influence in Health information system is also avoided as in case of reviews.</li>
                        </ol>

                            <li>Lack of clearly defined functional linkages between the different components of the health system especially with regard to quality standards for health services.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3>Guiding principles:</h3>
                        <p>The approach recommended for strengthening National Health Information System (NHIS) follows number of principles which have been derived from the assessment of HIS development experiences around the world and WHO past efforts to support such development. These principles relate not only to information system design and use, but also to more effective styles of Technical co-operation.</p>
                        <p>The overall purpose of these principles is to suggest that health information systems development must proceed as an integral part of efforts to strengthen the health care system and that health data be recorded and used firstly, in support of individual care, local health service operation and community action.</p>
                        <p>Placing emphasis on the use of data within the services will help increase the completeness and validity of the data that are selectively reported for supporting decision -making at all levels of the health system and for supporting health system, planning and development including service integration. Therefore:-</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Strengthening the Health Information System at the various service levels should be undertaken in support of efforts to develop health services and improve their performance.</li>
                            <li>Any data to be recorded at any service level MUST have an explicitly identified use (for decision or action in terms of case or community management by staff or community members) at all levels. An implication of this principle is that no data should be requested from service levels to be reported to higher levels which do not have an actionable use at the recording level as well as at the receiving levels.</li>
                            <li>Any changes or developments to data recording and reporting should be made only to improve the provision of care at the patient and community level, particularly for those populations most in need. One implication of this principle is that countries, municipalities or regions should not be encouraged to change their information system primarily to provide data for central level and International reporting purposes.</li>
                            <li>Each Health administration must assess its needs for clinical and managerial information based on its mission, goals, priorities, core service responsibilities, levels and functions, models of service delivery, resources and access to information technology. The Health Information System should be designed so as to exceed the capability of the administration to manage it.</li>
                            <li>Great prudence should be applied when making changes to components of health information Systems that are working fairly well. This applies particularly to reporting systems of specialized services program such as family planning or Tuberculosis control or EPI. Overall revision in health service recording and reporting should rarely be undertaken. Changes in the system should aim to progressively integrate the recording and reporting system at the local service level.</li>
                            <li>Efforts should be made to make better use of existing data at all levels through practical analysis, improved presentation of data and efforts to improve the flow and sharing data across program and services.</li>
                            <li>Practical use of information should be encouraged and supported for database maintenance and report generation. Such computerization should normally employ generic software that is widely available database management systems and spreadsheets. Major computerization efforts should not dominate the selection of indicators and data or the design of records and reports, but support the improvement of data management through the application of these principles.</li>
                            <li>The selection and definition of a manageable data set or set of "Essential health indicators" is recommended as a sound activity for initiating the review and strengthening of health information systems and for devising a practical National Health Service monitoring capability. Core health indicators should be chosen for national, provincial and district use with the following criteria in mind:-</li>
                        </ol>
                        <ol type="a" style="margin-left: 20px;">
                            <li>Useful for action. - The data needed for the indicator are useful for the person doing the recording with recorded data contributing to necessary action being taken with regard to the case, family, community or district being served.</li>
                            <li>Relevant for national and program monitoring.- the indicator can serve to measure progress toward stated national and program goals, objectives, targets, norms and standards. Such indicators focus on priority health problems in the country and the services and resources intended to manage those problems. Promotion and use of the indicator should strengthen routine program management and the health information system in the country.</li>
                            <li>Valid, consistent, reliable, representative and sensitive. - the indicators should possess the normal desirable characteristics of health data, example capable of being recorded across the services with the necessary degree of validity, consistency, reliability, representative of all population groups and be sensitive to short term changes in the variable of interest.</li>
                            <li>Ease of generation and measurement. - The indicator data should as much as possible result from normal service and surveillance, usually existing within routine records and reports.</li>
                            <li>Understandable: - the indicator should deal with a single clear idea which everyone will see as an important measure. Composite indexes should be avoided.</li>
                            <li>Ethical: - Data collection, including the choice of the data source, computation of the indicator and its use should not conflict with accepted ethical values.</li>
