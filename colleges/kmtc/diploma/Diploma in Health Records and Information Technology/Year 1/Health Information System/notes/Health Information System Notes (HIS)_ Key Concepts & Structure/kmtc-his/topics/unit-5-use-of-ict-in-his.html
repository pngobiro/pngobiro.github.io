                        <h3>DHIS Browsers</h3>
                        <p>The DHIS 2 is a web-based application and is available in an Internet browser when you have Internet connection.</p>
                        <p>The recommended browsers are:-</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Google Chrome</li>

                        </ul>

                        <h3>Principles of DHIS Reporting</h3>
                        <p>There two types of reports:-</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Standardized -One-click</li>
                            <li>Dynamic-enhanced deep analysis</li>
                            <li>Facilitates users with different levels of experience</li>
                            <li>Facilitates requirements for fixed reports as well as deep analysis</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Online system enables horizontal comparison<br>
                        Feedback reports are available immediately<br>
                        Possible to compare performance across organization unit</p>

                        <h3>Types of Reports</h3>
                        <p><strong>(a) Standardized</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Standard Report</li>
                            <li>Dataset Report</li>
                            <li>Reporting Rate Summaries</li>
                            <li>Report table</li>
                            <li>Resources</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>(b) Dynamic</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Pivot Table</li>
                            <li>Organization Unit Distribution Report</li>
                            <li>Tally sheet</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>DHIS in the Kenyan context</h3>
                        <p>DHIS was introduced in Kenya in 2010 and piloted in Coast in January 2011<br>
                        National Roll out was from May-October 2011<br>
                        Rationale for DHIS adoption in Kenya</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Multiplicity of HIS/M&E systems</li>
                            <li>Inability to authoritatively state level of sector performance</li>
                            <li>Difficulty determining intra-district reporting rates</li>
                            <li>Limited analysis with often conflicting statistics</li>
                            <li>Limited capacity of excel based databases</li>
                            <li>Overall erosion of trust in the existing system</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>DHIS2 supports different facets of the information cycle including:</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Collecting data.</li>
                            <li>Running quality checks.</li>
                            <li>Data access at multiple levels.</li>
                            <li>Reporting.</li>
                            <li>Making graphs and maps and other forms of analysis.</li>
                            <li>Enabling comparison across time (for example, previous months) and space (for example, across facilities and districts).</li>
                            <li>See trends (displaying data in time series to see their min and max levels).</li>

                        <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
                        <p>Paper-based records have been in existence for centuries and their gradual replacement by computer-based records has been slowly underway for over twenty years in western healthcare systems. Computerized information systems have not achieved the same degree of penetration in healthcare as that seen in other sectors such as finance, transport and the manufacturing and retail industries. Further, deployment has varied greatly from country to country and from speciality to specialty and in many cases has revolved around local systems designed for local use. National penetration of EMRs may have reached over 90% in primary care practices in Norway, Sweden and Denmark (2003), but has been limited to 17% of physician office practices in the USA (2001-2003). Those EMR systems that have been implemented however have been used mainly for administrative rather than clinical purposes.</p>
                        <p>Electronic medical record systems lie at the centre of any computerised health information system. Without them other modern technologies such as decision support systems cannot be effectively integrated into routine clinical workflow. The paperless, interoperable, multi-provider, multi-specialty, multi-discipline computerised medical record, which has been a goal for many researchers, healthcare professionals, administrators and politicians for the past 20+ years, is however about to become reality in many western countries.</p>
                        <p>In Kenya, the Division of Health Information Systems (HIS) has recognized the need to improve the use of ICT in health. Under Strategic Objective Five of the HIS Strategic Plan 2009-2014, the HIS aims to strengthen the use and application of information and communication technology, in data management. Tethered to this objective is the need to have standardized and interoperable ICT Applications, including Electronic Medical Records. It is with this objective in mind that the Ministries of Health, through the HIS, embarked on a process of standardization of EMRs in Kenya. Electronic Medical Record (EMR) systems are increasingly being adopted in Kenya to improve medical record management, health program management, and the quality of patient care.</p>
                        
                        <h3>WHAT IS AN EMR?</h3>
                        <p>EMR is an acronym for Electronic Medical Records. This refers to a paperless, digital and computerized system of maintaining patient data, designed to increase the efficiency and reduce documentation errors by streamlining the process. It can also be defined as a longitudinal collection of electronic health information that provides immediate, authorized access to person and population level data to support efficient health services delivery process.</p>

                        <h3>CURRENT SITUATION ON THE USE OF ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORDS IN KENYA TODAY.</h3>
                        <p>Implementing EMR is a complex, expensive investment that has created a demand for Healthcare IT professionals and accounts for a growing segment of the healthcare workforce. Just like any other record keeping, moving patients' records from paper and physical filing systems to computers and their super storage capabilities creates great efficiencies for patients and their health care providers, as well as health payment systems</p>
                        <p>In 2001 the Department of Medicine and Child Health and Paediatrics at Moi University, Eldoret and the department of internal Medicine and Geriatrics at the Indiana University school of Medicine in collaboration with the Moi Teaching and referral Hospital in Eldoret, Kenya, established the academic Model for Prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS (AMPATH). Its medical records in Sub Saharan Africa are the first electronic medical record system for the Comprehensive management of the clinical care of patients infected with HIV. This system is composed of both paper-based and electronic records, has led to uniformity in data collection and facilitated the retrieval of patient data for clinical care and research.</p>
                        <p>Other health facilities in the region both GOK and Private that have implemented the EMR in Kenya include Aga Khan Teaching and Referral Hospital, The Nairobi Hospital, Kisii Level 5 Hospital, MP Shah Hospital, JaramogiOgingaOdinga Teaching and Referral Hospital, Coast Provincial general Hospital, Naivasha District Hospital among others.</p>
                        <p>It has been observed that facilities that have embraced EMR have shown remarkable improvement in revenue collection as every activity is accounted for. It has also tools for stock control and supply chain management. This results in efficient use of resources as health care providers become more accountable and audit trail is possible i.e every action done in the system can be traceable to the real user.</p>
                        <p>Some of the notable challenges with the EMR may include high cost of setting the infrastructure and maintenance of the system, lack of standardization of EMR in Kenya, computer viruses, and literacy level among users. Due to fear, change is considered a threat yet without adequate involvement of the users of the system, the project can never be developed.</p>

                        <h3>ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF USING ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORDS.</h3>
                        <p>By making it easier to use and share information, EMRs can help health care providers do a better job of managing patient care. When fully functional and exchangeable, the benefits of EMRs offer far more than a paper record can. Some of the benefits include the ones discussed below:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Money is saved by using electronic medical records; not just the cost of paper and file folders, but the cost of labor and space, too. In any business, time equals money. The efficiencies created by simply typing a few identifying keystrokes to retrieve a patient's record as opposed to staring at thousands of file folders, filing and refilling them -- saves a doctor's practice or a hospital many thousands of shillings. That's even taking the cost of the electronic system into account.</li>
                            <li>Another benefit is safety. In the past, the way a doctor obtained your health history was by asking you. Each time you visited a new doctor's office, you filled out forms about your history, including previous surgeries, or the drugs you take on a regular basis. If you forgot a piece of information, or if you didn't write it down because it seemed unimportant to you, then your doctor didn't have that piece of your medical puzzle to work with.</li>
                            <li>However, when doctors share records electronically, your new doctor only needs to ask your name, birth date, and possibly another piece of identifying information. She can then pull up your records from their electronic storage space. All of the information he needs to see will be there in full. When it comes time to diagnose you, it might be important to him to learn that you are taking a certain kind of medication, or even an herbal supplement -- any information shared with a previous doctor. Diagnosis and treatment decisions might be altered based on that information, which is far more complete than what you might have written down on paper.</li>
                            <li>In the past, when a doctor closed his practice, retired, moved, or even died, patient records could easily get lost or relocated, making it impossible for patients to get the records they needed to take to a new doctor. Keeping these records electronically, especially in the cases where patients can also gain access to them, means the patient won't be left without the records she may need.</li>
                            <li>EMRs save space. Instead of keeping huge paper files on patients, all records are kept on computer files. Though someone must store these records in computers, this still represents a small percentage of the space required to store physical records.</li>
                            <li>Electronic medical records may save time as well. Though faxing and email assisted one doctor to get information from another doctor or a laboratory, there was generally a wait time. When a doctor has instant access to all of a patient's information, including things like x-rays, lab tests, and information about prescriptions or allergies, he or she is empowered to act right away, thus saving time.</li>
                            <li>Many doctors are often considered to have undecipherable handwriting, and though this is a generalization, unclear writing can lead to mistakes. Typed information is less likely to create misunderstandings.</li>
                            <li>One concern about the use of electronic medical records is that doctors may have a significant learning curve when these programs are first employed. A poor typist may actually take a long time to input information. Doctors often have to be their own medical clerks especially during an office visit, and a doctor distracted by confusing technology may not be as alert to a patient's symptoms or needs.</li>
                            <li>There is no single electronic medical records source or system, so different hospitals and individual clinicians are not all using the same program. This negates the possibility of instant information for all on the medical team, since one program may not mesh with another.</li>
                            <li>Some patients express concern that electronic medical records might be hacked and exploited by others. Misuse of private medical information could create problems for people who have conditions they wish to keep private.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h3>CONCLUSION</h3>
                        <p>Despite these concerns, it appears many doctors and hospitals are now attempting to use electronic medical records. It remains unclear how long it will take for old files with long medical histories to be updated into electronic means. It also seems that employing electronic means to store data still requires some thought so that information and systems are uniform.</p>
                        <p>The Government of Kenya has come up with the national guidelines and standards for the implementation of Electronic Medical Records which will spearhead the growth in the country. Working with the implementing partners, health facilities like Rwambwa Health Centre in Siaya, Awendo Sub-District Hospital in Migori have embraced the EMR and effective and efficient management of health care system has been realized in these facilities.</p>

                        <h3>The importance of GIS in healthcare:</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>GIS helps in visualising data e.g. in surveillance you are able to locate and monitor trends.</li>
                            <li>Helps to identify the areas of greatest health needs to enable decision makers to prioritise resources.</li>
                            <li>Also one may map conditions before and after action or event to see the impact. A SCHMT might map the change in the spread of a disease before and after an epidemic.</li>
                            <li>Modelling enables one to see what if situations in comparison to new features in a location e.g. new road, new market, health facility e.t.c.</li>
                            <li>We can also use different layers of presentation such as geographic, health facility coverage, population etc. and this can aid in visualisation for decision making</li>

                            <li><strong>Qualitative or Categorical variables</strong> cannot be measured numerically. Instead, they are divided into non-numerical categories. Examples of qualitative variables include hair color, occupation, region.
                                <p>Qualitative variables are further divided into 2 categories:</p>
                                <ol type="a">
                                    <li><strong>Nominal variables</strong> are those whose categories are labels or names that don't have an inherent order. For example, Nationality - Ugandan, Kenyan, and Tanzanian.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Ordinal variables</strong> are those whose categories are non-numerical, but still have some order to them. Think of the word "order" to help you remember.For example, Severity of illness-mild, moderate, severe</li>
                                </ol>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Quantitative variable.</strong> Think of the word quantity. Quantitative variables can be measured numerically.
                                <ol type="a">

                        <h3>Definition:</h3>
                        <p>The percent of women of reproductive age who are using (or whose partner is using) a contraceptive method at a particular point in time, almost always reported for women married or in sexual union.</p>
                        <p>Generally, the measure includes all contraceptive methods (modern and traditional), but it may include modern methods only.</p>

                        <h3>Data Requirement(s):</h3>
                        <p>The total number of women of reproductive age, by marital status; and of these, the number that are currently using a contraceptive method</p>

                        <h3>Data Source(s):</h3>
                        <p>Population-based surveys</p>

                        <h3>Purpose:</h3>
                        <p>The CPR provides a measure of population coverage of contraceptive use, taking into account all sources of supply and all contraceptive methods; it is the most widely reported measure of outcome for family planning programs at the population level.</p>
                        <p>Technically speaking, CPR is a ratio, not a rate. (Prevalence is measured by a ratio and incidence by a rate.) For a given year, contraceptive prevalence measures the percentage of women of childbearing age in union who use a form of contraception. To obtain a true contraceptive use rate, the denominator should reflect the population at risk (of pregnancy), i.e., sexually active women who are not infecund, pregnant, or amenhorreic. The numerator should reflect the number of contraceptive users from that population. (Note: We include this point for informational purposes only.) The international population community uses the term "contraceptive prevalence rate" as defined above; thus, this database endorses this practice to assure consistency.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Issue(s):</h3>
                        <p>The convention in reporting contraceptive prevalence is to base this calculation on women married or in sexual union (even though most DHS-type surveys ask questions of contraceptive use to women of reproductive age, regardless of their marital status). In countries with relatively little sexual activity outside marriage for women, basing prevalence estimates on women in sexual union captures the population at risk of pregnancy. However, in countries with the widespread practice of sexual activity outside of marriage or stable sexual unions, a prevalence estimate based on women in union only would ignore a considerable percentage of current users. Thus, researchers and program evaluators generally report percentage of sexually active unmarried women using contraception, if appropriate, in addition to contraceptive prevalence, because method mix is very different for those married versus unmarried (in/not in a stable union).</p>
                        <p>Whereas evaluators may theoretically derive the CPR from service statistics on numbers of current users and estimates of the population at risk, current practice is to rely upon populationbased sample surveys in order to minimize the problems associated with maintaining a running count of current users and with obtaining accurate population estimates. (The problems include incomplete data, double-counting of users who enter the service delivery system at more than one point, purposeful inflation of service statistics, and poor quality of data due to other activities competing for the attention of those recording the information, to name the primary ones.)</p>
                        <p>The DHS and RHS are currently the main sources for obtaining national level estimates of prevalence. ("DHS" is used in this database to mean "DHS-type surveys:" the actual DHS, the RHS surveys conducted with technical support from CDC, and other large-scale national surveys conducted by the countries themselves under other auspices). Evaluators may also use smaller scale and/or more focused surveys to estimate the CPR as long as they use probability sampling methods, the essential ingredient for obtaining scientifically sound estimates. Evaluators may also obtain CPR by adding relevant questions to surveys on other topics (e.g., health program prevalence or coverage surveys), assuming appropriate sampling methods and sample sizes.</p>

                        <p>(Excerpted from: Becker L, Wolf J, Levine R (2006) Measuring commitment to health.Center for Global Development.)</p>
                        <p>A study of public family planning service usage found that use s from the wealthiest quintile outnumbered those from the poorest quintile in 13 of the 20 developing countries examined, and that the contraceptive prevalence rate is significantly higher amongst the wealthiest quintile in all 20 countries. However, the study also found that countries with a higher CPR had less disparity than those in which a smaller percentage used contraceptives, indicating that increasing the CPR could contribute to reducing inequity</p>
