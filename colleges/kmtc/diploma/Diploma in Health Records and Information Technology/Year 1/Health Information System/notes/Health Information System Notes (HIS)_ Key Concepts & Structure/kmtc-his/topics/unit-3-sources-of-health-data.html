                        <h3>Outpatient records</h3>
                        <p>In the outpatient we have information on preventive, curative, health promotion and rehabilitative services. We have information on vertical programs such as</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Patient support centre</li>
                            <li>KEPI currently DVI</li>
                            <li>Maternal and Child Health</li>
                            <li>Family planning.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Each of these vertical programs has its own health information system. Each information system gives different health statistics for example from DVI we can get immunization coverage and the number of mothers who have received tetanus toxic.</p>
                        <p>The information can be used for planning and management of the health facility. Several reports are prepared at the outpatient department such as;</p>

                        <h3>In patient records</h3>
                        <p>In the inpatient department we collect information on curative services from all patients stay in the health facilities. Upon discharge the health records personnel collects patients records and calculates the following hospital statistics, Bed occupancy, ALOS, TOI, VBD etc.</p>
                        <p>The statistics are used to monitor the operational efficiency of the health facility.</p>

                        <h3>Notification of infectious diseases</h3>
                        <p>These are limited to infectious diseases. They are important indicators that show the presence of communicable diseases in the community. It helps to identify the need for control and prevention action.</p>

                        <h3>Registration of births and deaths</h3>
                        <p>The information on births and deaths is a vital element of vital statistics. Health begins at birth and end in death.</p>
                        <p>This information is important in projecting population growth rate and mortality rates.</p>

                        <h3>Surveys</h3>
                        <p>They are periodic methods of collecting health care data using sample population. There are two types;</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Formal surveys; they are sample based surveys. They are scientific in design.</li>
                            <li>Informal surveys; they are like home visits conducted by health workers.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Community based health care projects</h3>
                        <p>They are run by NGO's. Its main aim is to stimulate individuals and local communities to determine their own health care needs. They also initiate interventions.</p>
                        <p>In the CBHCP, people determine their own needs and decide on PHC activities to solve their health problems on a self help basis. Individuals, families and community members should be encouraged to participate in health promotion activities.</p>
                        <p>Data collected from CBHCP may include information about;</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Local people and their distribution</li>

                            <li>Organization of the local health services.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3>Uses of health information from CBHCP</h3>
                        <p>Health information is one of the most essential components of an effective health delivery system. The uses include;</p>
                        <ol>

Alternatively it can be expressed as a number of person-duration expressions when the population is a shifting one and it is desired to express the population size over a period (e.g. persons per day).</p>
                        <p><strong>Stable population:</strong> a population which has constant mortality and fertility rates, and no migration, therefore a fixed age distribution and constant growth rate.</p>

                        <p><strong>Primary data:</strong> it is data that has been collected by the investigator for a certain objective and it's therefore original in character. E.g. population census collected by the Kenya National Bureau of statistics.</p>

                        <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
                        <p>The inability to generate reliable information needed to make decisions based on evidence is a majorobstacle to public health services. Public health decision-making is critically dependent on the timelyavailability of sound data. The role of the Health Information System is to generate, analyze anddisseminate such data. "Nothing exists until it is measured" the physicist Niels Bohr famously stated in1930. The work of John Snow during the Cholera epidemics that ravaged London in the mid 1800s is anearly example of an epidemiological investigation. Snow's groundbreaking work was made possible by theregisters of births and deaths maintained by local authorities in every English parish from the early1800s. Without information on numbers of deaths from cholera and the street address of each victim,Snow's mapping of mortality in relation to the sitting of water pumps would not have been possible.</p>
                        <p>Counting deaths is one component of the health information system, an integrated effort to collect, process,report and use health information and knowledge to influence policy-making, programme action andresearch.</p>
                        <p>The critical elements in Health Information System (HIS) are usually to turn raw data into useful form and extrapolate this through sector indicators. The main components are:-</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Data collection</li>

                            <li>Data reporting</li>
                            <li>Data dissemination and use.</li>

                        <p>In case of multiple deliveries the health worker should initiate a booklet for each child. The health worker is advised to be extra careful while filling the information in the booklet by ensuring that correctinformation is recorded in the appropriate spaces provided. The growth monitoring charts should be marked progressivelyas the child grows. Health workers are advised to share the information pertaining to the child with the mother or caretaker.</p>

                        <h3>GENERAL GUIDELINES FOR FILLING THE SUMMARY FORMS:</h3>
                        <p>(Procedures of completing reporting tools)</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>The first step in completing data reporting forms is to ensure that all the identification particulars are filled in beforecompleting the particular form. These are the names of the province, district, constituency, facility and the period forwhich the report is covering.</li>
                            <li>Specific ages should be reported within the appropriate age classification.</li>
                            <li>In forms where data is disaggregated by sex, the appropriate data should be filled in the correct column or spacesprovided.</li>
                            <li>Care must be taken to separate new or first visits and re-visits or re-attendances.<br>.Note: New or first visit -these are patients/clients who come to your facility for the First time. While Revisit nor Re-attendance- these are patients/clients who make subsequent return visits after the first visit.</li>
                            <li>Where there is a provision to show totals, they MUST be aggregated.</li>
                            <li>While making entries in the forms, accuracy MUST be maintained to avoid errors or transposition of figures.</li>
                            <li>While reporting, completeness MUST be observed. No spaces should be left blank and no dashes. You are insteadencouraged to practice zero reporting.</li>
                            <li>The name of person preparing the report, the date the report is being completed and the commitment signature MUSTbe filled in.</li>
                            <li>Once the reports are completed, they are supposed to leave your facility before the 5th of the following month to theDistrict Health Information System (DHIS).</li>
                            <li>At the district, once all the reports from the health facilities have been received, summaries should be promptly made.</li>
                            <li>The district MUST maintain a checklist of all reports and all facilities and check the reports against the facilities toensure completeness and timeliness.</li>
                            <li>Using a copy of the summaries made, districts MUST analyze and share the information at their level.</li>
                            <li>Districts should submit the summaries to the province or national level on or before 15th of the following month andgive feedback to the health facilities.</li>
                            <li>The province collects all the district reports, make copies (manual or electronic) do the analysis and use theinformation as they make arrangement to transmit the summaries to the national level before 21st of the followingmonth if data flows through the province inform of hard copies.</li>

                            <li>To maintain accuracy in recording data collected through tally sheets, health workers should tally from the registers ondaily basis.</li>
                            <li>The national level data repository (HIS) should acknowledge receipt, process and analyze the data and give feedbackto the lower levels and share the information horizontally and vertically.</li>
                            <li>All levels are encouraged to prepare annual reports that will encompass all activities, outputs and in-puts.</li>
                            <li>For communicable diseases that are for immediate reporting, such should be reported without further delay using theappropriate tools and channels for example using case based investigation forms.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3>How to handle the tally sheets</h3>
                        <p>Tally sheets are working sheets on which data is recorded to facilitate ease of count at the time of making summaries.</p>
                        <p>Proper understanding of the content of each tally sheet is essential. The proper way of making a tally is to slash a zero withforward slash (Killing one zero at ago) for example 0</p>
                        <p>Tallies are normally made immediately a clinician is through with a patient/ client before attending to the next and at the endof the day or early next morning from the register. This depends on circumstances at the facility.</p>
                        
                        <h3>How to handle the Summary sheets</h3>
                        <p>Summary sheets will be completed at the end of the specified period, either from tally sheet or registers or any other sourcedocuments. As the health facility submits the summaries to the next level, a copy mustremain in the health facility.</p>

                        <h3>Summaries:</h3>
                        <p>If the health information system forms are so complicated that those who are to complete them cannot understand them or theforms are not available all the time, data will not be collected properly. Therefore, every effort must be made to simplify formsand to ensure that there is a constant supply of them. Such forms can have a space for some simple on the spot analysis e.g.total numbers or percentage to be calculated.</p>
