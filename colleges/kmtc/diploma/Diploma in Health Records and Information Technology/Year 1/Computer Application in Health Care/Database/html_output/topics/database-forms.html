                        <h3>Introduction</h3>
                        <p>Another way to populate a database is with the use of forms. An Access 2007 form helps you know exactly what data to enter. In this lesson, we'll address the benefits of using forms with a database, and we'll show you how to set up a basic form for your Access 2007 database, as well as how to use the form to populate or edit data in the database. You'll also learn how to enhance a basic form with a drop-down list.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Why use forms?</h3>
                        <p>In real life, a form is piece of paper you fill out so someone can collect and keep track of specific information about you. Only one record—your record—is captured with any given paper form.</p>
                        <img src="../assets/images/2025_11_14_b4e950dbd66c79507867g-42-1.jpg" alt="An example of a paper-based student information form." class="content-image">
                        <p>Access 2007 forms work in a similar way. In previous lessons, you saw that you can populate a database by entering records into the tables themselves. If the database has hundreds of records and many fields to populate for any given record, a table can be overwhelming to a user entering data. An Access form lets you enter data one record at a time, without having to see the entire table.</p>
                        <img src="../assets/images/2025_11_14_b4e950dbd66c79507867g-43-1.jpg" alt="An Access form for entering customer information, showing one record at a time." class="content-image">
                        <p>An Access 2007 form also lets you know exactly what information to enter and can even tell you what that information should look like. Adding certain control components to a form—like a dropdown menu—can dramatically increase the integrity of the data that is held in a database.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Creating a form</h3>
                        <p>Access 2007 has several automatic tools for creating forms. These tools are located in the Forms group on the Create tab in the Ribbon, as seen below:</p>
                        <img src="../assets/images/2025_11_14_b4e950dbd66c79507867g-43-2.jpg" alt="The 'Forms' command group on the Create tab of the Access Ribbon." class="content-image">
                        <p>Access 2007 forms tools include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The <strong>Form</strong> command makes a basic form, showing a single record at a time.</li>
                            <li>The <strong>Split Form</strong> command creates a form showing one record on top and includes the Datasheet view of the entire source table on the bottom.</li>
                            <li>The <strong>Multiple Items</strong> command creates a form that shows all records at once, which looks similar to the source table in Datasheet view.</li>
                            <li>The <strong>Form Wizard</strong> is hidden under the More Forms command. It walks you through the process of creating more customized forms.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h3>Using forms to enter data</h3>
                        <p>Populating a database is easy once you have a basic form in place. Record navigation works the same way for forms as it does for tables. The navigation bar is located in the bottom-left of the object pane. The navigation buttons work the same way as they do for tables.</p>
                        <img src="../assets/images/2025_11_14_b4e950dbd66c79507867g-44-1.jpg" alt="The record navigation bar at the bottom of an Access form." class="content-image">

                        <ol>
                            <li>With the form opened in Design view, select the <strong>Combo Box</strong> command in the Controls group on the Design tab in the Ribbon.</li>

                            <li>Because the middle option ("I will type in the values that I want.") was selected, the wizard asks for the values to be typed into a small table.</li>

                            <li>Next, the wizard asks what to do with the entered values. Select "Store that value in this field:" and choose the appropriate field.</li>

                            <li>Finally, give the combo box a meaningful label, then click Finish. The new drop-down list will appear on the form.</li>

                        <h3>Introduction</h3>
                        <img src="../assets/images/2025_11_14_b4e950dbd66c79507867g-49-1.jpg" alt="Gears and cogs, representing the inner workings and controls of a form." class="content-image">
                        <p>You've already seen how a combo box control can make a form more user friendly. In Access 2007, there are several additional ways you can modify forms to make them easier to use while also increasing the integrity of the database. In this lesson, we'll explain how to use form properties to limit the actions your form users can take. We'll also walk you through hiding fields on a form and adding command buttons to the form.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Setting form properties</h3>
                        <p>Access 2007 allows you to set several form properties. Form properties are options that are set in Design view on the Property Sheet. These options control how the form looks, works, and interacts with the rest of the database.</p>
                        <img src="../assets/images/2025_11_14_b4e950dbd66c79507867g-51-1.jpg" alt="The Property Sheet for a form in Access, showing various properties that can be modified." class="content-image">
                        
                        <h3>Hiding fields on a form</h3>
                        <p>There will be times when a field will not be needed on a form. Access 2007 allows you to hide fields by setting the Visible field property in Design view.</p>
                        <img src="../assets/images/2025_11_14_b4e950dbd66c79507867g-52-2.jpg" alt="Setting the 'Visible' property of a field to 'No' in the Property Sheet to hide it from the form." class="content-image">
                        
                        <h3>Setting field properties</h3>
                        <p>Sometimes it may be necessary to set field properties from the form itself. For example, on the New Orders form, we want to set up the Order Date field to auto-fill with the current date each time an order is entered.</p>
                        <img src="../assets/images/2025_11_14_b4e950dbd66c79507867g-55-1.jpg" alt="The Property Sheet for the Order Date field, where the Default Value can be set." class="content-image">
                        <p>To set a field to auto-fill with the current date, set the <strong>Default Value</strong> property by clicking on the Expression Builder button (...) and entering <strong>Date()</strong>.</p>
                        <img src="../assets/images/2025_11_14_b4e950dbd66c79507867g-56-1.jpg" alt="The Expression Builder dialog box showing the 'Date()' function used to get the current date." class="content-image">

                        <h3>Creating command buttons</h3>
                        <p>Another way to make a form more user friendly is by adding command buttons to the form. Command buttons are a quick way for form users to take a specific action, like saving a record or opening another form.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Click the <strong>Button</strong> command in the Controls group on the Ribbon.</li>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_11_14_b4e950dbd66c79507867g-57-1.jpg" alt="The 'Button' command highlighted in the Controls group." class="content-image">
                            <li>When the Command Button Wizard opens, select the action you want the button to perform from the Categories and Actions lists.</li>

                        <p>A simple way to change the way your form looks is to apply a style with the AutoFormat command, which provides several pre-designed color schemes.</p>
                        <img src="../assets/images/2025_11_14_b4e950dbd66c79507867g-61-1.jpg" alt="The AutoFormat dropdown menu, showing different style options for the form." class="content-image">
