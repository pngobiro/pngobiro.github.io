                        <h3>Hardware:</h3>
                        <p>The physical components of the computer are known as “Hardware”. It refers to the objects that we can actually touch.</p>
                        <p><strong>Ex:</strong> input and output devices, processors, circuits and the cables.</p>

                        <h3>Software:</h3>
                        <p>Software is a program or set of instructions that causes the Hardware to function in a desired way. The basic difference between the Hardware and Software is just the same as that exists between TV and TV studio. Without TV studio (software) from where the programs are telecast, the TV (Hardware) is a dead machine.</p>
                        <p>There are five categories of software. They are:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Operating System</li>
                            <li>Translators</li>

                            <li>Application programs</li>
                            <li>General purpose programs</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3>1. Operating System (OS):</h3>
                        <p>The software that manages the resources of a computer system and schedules its operation is called Operating system. The operating system acts as interface between the hardware and the user programs and facilitates the execution of programs. Generally the OS acts as an interface between the user and the Hardware of the computer. i.e. It is a bridge between the user and the Hardware.</p>
                        <p>The User interface provided by the OS can be character based or graphical.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>CUI</strong> -- Character user Interface</li>
                            <li><strong>GUI</strong> -- Graphical user Interface</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>CUI:</strong> It is operated with keyboard only. Ex: MS-DOS, UNIX</p>
                        <p><strong>Disk Operating System (DOS):</strong> It was developed as early as 1980 by Bill Gates at the age of 19. It is suited for personal computers. Dos is a single user and single task operating system.</p>
                        <p><strong>WINDOWS:</strong> It works with DOS and it supports single user and multitask system. It requires a powerful PC with a minimum RAM of 8 MB.</p>
                        
                        <h3>2. Translators:</h3>
                        <p>Computers can understand instructions only when they are written in their own language the machine language. Therefore, a program written in any other language should be translated into machine language. The software that translates the instructions of different languages is known as translators.</p>
                        <p>There are two types of translators. They are compilers and Interpreters.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>✓ A <strong>Compiler</strong> checks the entire user written program (known as the source program) and if it is error free, produces a complete program in machine language (known as object program). The source program is retained for possible modifications and corrections and the object program is loaded into the computer for execution. If the source program contains errors, the compilers produce a list of errors at the end of the execution of the program. i.e. a compiler translates the whole program before execution.</li>
                            <li>✓ An <strong>Interpreter</strong> does a similar job but in a different style. The interpreter translates one statement at a time and if it is error - free, executes. This continues till the last statement. Thus an interpreter translates or executes the first instruction before it goes to the second, while a compiler translates the whole program before execution.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The major difference between compiler and interpreter is:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Error correction is very much simpler in the case of interpreter as it translates the statements in stages. The compiler produces an error list of the entire program at the end.</li>
                            <li>Interpreter takes more time for the execution of the program compared to compilers as it translates one statement at a time.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3>Programming Languages:</h3>
                        <p>There are three types of programming languages.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Machine Languages:</strong> Computers respond only to machine language. This language is in terms of binary codes (0,1). I.e. all programs should be written with these codes, which are difficult, time consuming and leading to errors while writing the programs. There is no unique standard machine language. Rather there are many machine languages. These are machine dependent. These are referred as the first generation languages.</li>
                            <li><strong>Assembly Languages:</strong> It uses mnemonic codes rather than numeric codes (as in machine languages). Ex. Add or A is used as a symbol for addition. It requires translators to convert into machine language. Like machine language, writing program in assembly language is also time consuming. These are also machine dependent.</li>
                            <li><strong>High Level Languages (HLL):</strong> These are referred as problem oriented languages (POL). These are referred as third generation languages. The advantages of these languages are:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>The high level languages are convenient for writing programs as they can be written without any codes. These languages follow rules like English language.</li>
                                    <li>Because of their English like nature, less time is required to write a program.</li>
                                    <li>They are machine independent. A program written in any HLL can be run on computers of different types without any modifications.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>Several High Level Languages which are in common use:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>FORTRAN : Formula Translation</li>
                                    <li>COBOL: Common Business Oriented Language</li>
                                    <li>BASIC: Beginner's All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code</li>
                                    <li>PROLOG: Programming in Logic</li>
                                    <li>ALGOL: Algorithmic Language</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                        
                        <h3>3. Utility Programs:</h3>
                        <p>These are pre-written programs supplied by the manufacturer for maintaining day to day activities of computer system. Example: copy, sort, mailing, virus scanning software etc.,</p>

                        <h3>4. Application Programs:</h3>
                        <p>These are user written programs to do a specific job which can be changed to meet the individual needs. These programs are written in different languages such as BASIC or C or by using database packages like dBase, Oracle. Example: Payroll, Billing, Railway Reservation etc.</p>
                        
                        <h3>5. General Purpose Packages:</h3>
                        <p>These packages are developed to suit the needs of research workers / scientists in different fields. These packages are categorized as:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>i) Data Analysis</li>
                            <li>ii) Word Processing</li>

                        <p>Computers are classified according to the storage capacity, speed and the purpose for which they are developed. These can be classified into three types:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Analog Computers:</strong> They operate by measuring instead of counting. The name (derived from Greek word analog) denotes that the computer functions by establishing similarities between the two quantities. They are powerful tools for solving differential equations.</li>
                            <li><strong>Digital Computers:</strong> These computers operate by counting. All quantities are expressed as discrete digits or numbers. These are useful for evaluating arithmetic expressions and manipulations of data.</li>
                            <li><strong>Hybrid Computers:</strong> Computers which combine the features of analog and digital computers are known as Hybrid computers.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>A majority of the computers that are in use are digital. These computers were essentially developed for computations. Later, the developments in the computers led to the use of digital computers in variety of applications. Depending on the use of applications, the digital computers are classified into:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Special Purpose Computers:</strong> These are developed with a specific purpose. Some of the areas where these computers are being used are - soil testing, drip irrigation, medical scanning, traffic signals, spacecraft, rocket technology etc.</li>
                            <li><strong>General Purpose Computers:</strong> These are developed to meet the requirements of several areas such as simulation, solving mathematical equations, payroll and personnel database. These computers are available in different sizes and capabilities and are further classified (based on memory, speed, and storage) as follows:
                                <ol type="a">
                                    <li><strong>Super Computers:</strong> These have extremely large storage capacities and computing speeds which are at least 10 times faster than other computers. These are used for large scale numerical problems in scientific and engineering disciplines such as electronics, weather forecasting etc. The first super computer was developed in U.S.A. by CRAY computers. In India the indigenous super computer was developed under the name Param.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Mainframe Computers:</strong> They also have large storage and high computing speed (but relatively lower than the super computers). They are used in applications like weather forecasting, space applications etc., they support a large number of terminals for use by a variety of users simultaneously, but are expensive.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Mini Computers:</strong> It is a medium sized computer with moderate cost, available indigenously and used for large volume applications. It can serve multi-users simultaneously.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Micro Computers:</strong> A microcomputer is the smallest general purpose processing system. Micro computers are also referred as personal computers(PC). These are self-contained units and usually developed for use by one person at a time but can be linked to very large systems. They are cheap, easy to use even at homes and can be read for variety of applications from small to medium range. These are available in three models:

                        <p><strong>Personal Computer:</strong> A personal computer has a Monitor (VDU), a keyboard, Disk Drive (s), printer and CPU. The CPU of PC has a mother board with several chips mounted on a circuit board. The major components of the circuit board are: Microprocessor, RAM and ROM chips and other supporting circuits.</p>
                        <p><strong>Microprocessor:</strong> The Microprocessor chip is like a brain of human being which contains circuits and registers to perform arithmetic, logic and control functions. i.e. it contains ALU and CU. These chips will be able to retrieve data from the input output devices, store, manipulate and process a byte of data at a time. There is an address bus which is built into these chips to determine the storage locations (of RAM) of the data and the instructions of the program.</p>
                        <p>Over the years, different microprocessors were developed and the first in the series is INTEL 8080. The other processors are 8088, 80286, 80386, 80486, Pentium I, II, III and Pentium 4. The Pentium 4 can execute any piece of code that ran on the original 8088, but it does it about 5000 times faster.</p>
                        <p><strong>Clock Speed:</strong> The speed with which the instruction is executed or number of pulses per second is called the clock speed. It is measured in terms of million pulses per second.</p>
                        <p><strong>Note:</strong> The input, output and secondary storage units like floppy drives, keyboard, mouse, etc., are called peripherals.</p>

                        <h3>Drives of the computer:</h3>
                        <p>A computer can have Floppy Disk Drive along with Hard Disk drives in the system. These are referred as follows:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Floppy Disk Drive: <strong>A</strong> or <strong>B</strong></li>
                            <li>Hard Disk: <strong>C</strong></li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3>Booting of the Computer</h3>
                        <p>Booting imply activating the computer for working. Thus, when the computer is switched on, the operating system residing in the floppy or in the hard disk is transferred into the primary memory. After this, the computer is ready to accept the commands at user terminal. If OS does not exist either in floppy drive or in the hard disk drive, non-system or disk error is flashed on the screen. The booting of the computer is carried out with software which resides on ROM chip called BIOS (Basic Input Output System). Thus when a PC with system disk either in Hard-Disk Drive or Floppy Drive is switched on, the screen finally displays one of the following symbols with a blinking cursor at its end:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>a) A: \> This imply that the computer is booted through Floppy drive 'A' and is ready to accept DOS commands. The symbol -&gt; is referred as DOS prompt from where DOS commands can be entered.</li>
                            <li>b) C :|&gt; It imply that the PC is booted through the Hard-Disk Drive 'C'.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Booting is essential whenever the system is locked or switched-off. A PC can be booted through two ways:</p>
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li><strong>Cold Booting:</strong> It is only switching OFF the system and after some time again switching ON.</li>
                            <li><strong>Warm Booting:</strong> It is carried out by pressing the following three keys simultaneously: <strong>Ctrl + Alt + Del</strong>. It is preferable to cold booting as it safeguards the system from sudden power fluctuations resulting out of switching ON and OFF the system.</li>
                        </ol>
