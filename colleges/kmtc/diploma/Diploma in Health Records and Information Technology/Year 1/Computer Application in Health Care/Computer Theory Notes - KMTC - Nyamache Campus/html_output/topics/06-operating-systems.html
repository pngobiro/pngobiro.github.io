                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>MS-DOS is a collection of programs and other files. It is a single user and single programming environment. MS-DOS is designed to provide a method of organizing and using the information stored on disks, application programs, system programs and the computer itself.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Files and File names</h3>
                        <p>A file is a collection of related information. The files should have suitable names for their identification in later use. Rules for naming the files:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>File names should be of one to eight characters in length with an option of one to three character extension</li>
                            <li>File names can include any one of the following characters: A to Z (or a to z ) 0 to 9, $, &, #, @. %, ( ), { }. The characters which are not allowed are: :,; + / * as these have special meaning</li>
                            <li>A period (.) is used to separate the first part of a file name from the extension. (LETTER.TXT etc.,)</li>
                            <li>When a file name includes an extension, it should be referred along with its extension and not only with the first part</li>
                            <li>Reserved devices names are not allowed. (COMMAND.COM, DATE, etc.,)</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3>Types of files in DOS</h3>
                        <p>There are different types of files you can create in your computer, according to the usage. To differentiate each file, the computer will give an extension to identify the different types of files you have created.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Executable Files:</strong> The files with extension of either .COM or .EXE are called executable files. These files are directly executed by typing their names (without the extension) by the computer. A file with .COM extension refers to COMMAND file name and the other with .EXE extension refers EXECUTABLE program file.</li>
                            <li><strong>Batch Files:</strong> the file containing a series of DOS commands, which are executed automatically one at a time in the order entered, is known as the batch file. A batch file has the extension .BAT. If the batch file is given a special name AUTOEXEC.BAT, it is automatically executed when the computer is switched on or during booting.</li>
                            <li><strong>Backup Files:</strong> These are backup files of a file and have extension. These files are such that their contents cannot be altered (edited). These files are created while working with WORDSTAR package for typing a document.</li>
                            <li><strong>System Files:</strong> These are program files developed for system control. They have system extension.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Directory:</strong> which means that they encrypt a collection of files, size, date and time of creation of files? The relation between files, directories and disk is similar to the relation between papers, filing folders and filling cabinets. Just as a cabinet contain papers and other folders, a directory may contain directories also. The main directory of a drive is called Root Directory into which several directories and sub-directories may exist.</p>

                        <h3>Types of DOS commands</h3>
                        <p>There are two types of commands: i) internal and ii) external</p>
                        <h4>Internal DOS commands:</h4>
                        <p>Internal commands are those commands which manage files. They are loaded into the memory of the PC when PC is booted. These are stored in a large file with file name COMMAND.COM, when a PC is booted.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>DIR:</strong> Dir displays continuously the directory of file names, file size, date and time of creation. <code>C:\> dir a:</code> This command displays the list of files and directories from the drive A i.e. the floppy drive. It can be specified with two options:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>i) <code>Dir/p</code>: It pauses the listing of the directory whenever the screen is full. The next screen load of files can be displayed by pressing any key.</li>
                                    <li>ii) <code>Dir/w</code>: displays the files of the directory in a five column format. Only file names and their extensions will be displayed without the date and time of creation. The total number of files and remaining bytes are listed.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>In addition, DIR can also be specified with wildcard characters (such as * or ?) to list files sharing a common element in the file name or extension. Eg: <code>DIR STATS.*</code>: lists all files with STATS and other combinations along with the extensions.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>DEL:</strong> Deletes a specified file. Syntax: <code>DEL {filename}</code>. Example: <code>Del stats</code> deletes the file 'stats'. <code>Del stats.*</code> deletes all extensions of the file 'stats'.</li>
                        </ol>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>A <strong>VIRUS</strong> is a set of instructions (or program) or software prepared to destroy a package and data. A virus kills data and program files. Although the purpose for developing such software is not known, they appear to be basically developed for a check against the piracy of program packages.</p>
                        <h3>Functioning of viruses:</h3>
                        <p>Viruses reside in executable files such as .COM or .EXE. Thus when PC is switched on, the virus enters the RAM through .COM (COMMAND.COM) file and starts destructive work of killing data and program files. Whenever the PC is switched off, they again go back to the executable files.</p>
                        <p>More than 1000 computer viruses have been identified. They are classified as:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>i) File Allocation Table (FAT) based viruses</li>
                            <li>ii) Key board viruses</li>
                            <li>iii) File based viruses</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>VACCINE:</strong> It is software developed for removing the viruses. In DOS version, there are in-built programs to guard against computer viruses. These are anti-virus programs for both DOS and WINDOWS and a memory resident virus-safe program that guards against the introduction of files that may be affected by virus. Some of the anti-virus vaccines are: NASHSOFT, UTSCAN, AVG, AVIRA, MECCAF etc.</p>

                        <h3>Salient features of Windows Operating System:</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li>It converts the plain character based user interface provided by DOS into a Graphical User Interface(GUI) such as pictures, symbols and words on your screen that can be controlled by the mouse.</li>
                            <li>It provides a multitasking capabilities to the PC.</li>
                            <li>It supports long file name rather than the limited 8 characters with extension of three letter file name (8:3) as used by DOS. In Windows file name can have name up to 255 characters long.</li>
                            <li>Windows owes its name to the fact that it runs each program or document or application in its own separate window.</li>
                            <li>Windows have the facility of accessories such as Word pad, Note pad, Calculator and Paint.</li>
                            <li>User can paste portion of one document into another by utilizing more advanced document linking features called Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE), Object Linking and Embedding (OLE).</li>
                            <li>It provides a big facility of plug and play standard. It allows user to simply plug a new board such as a video, audio or network card into the computer without having a set of switches or making other settings.</li>
                            <li>If a program crashes, then it will display fault error message about its crash and you can eliminate the crashed program from the task list without affecting other running applications.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3>Parts of a window screen:</h3>
                        <p><strong>Desktop:</strong> The desktop is the on-screen work area on which Windows, Icons, menus and dialog boxes appear. The Desktop can have several components.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Components of the Desktop:</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Icons:</strong> Icon is a small image that represents a file, folder or program. The text below each icon is the name of the Icon. When we rest the mouse pointer on an icon, a rectangular box appears. This is referred to as Tooltip. It gives a brief description of the Icon. By default, there will be 4-5 icons on the desktop. They are: My Computer, My documents, Internet Explorer, Recycle bin etc.</li>
                            <li><strong>Taskbar</strong></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>My Computer:</strong> This is the icon which represents all the files and folders which can be used in the system. It is used to access the drives, folders and files on the computer. i.e. Floppy drive(A), Local C, D, E, Printer, Control panel etc.</p>
                        <p><strong>My Documents:</strong> This is the default storage location for the files created in the windows.</p>
                        <p><strong>Internet Explorer:</strong> This is an application used to browse the internet.</p>
                        <p><strong>Recycle bin:</strong> This is a folder that stores all the files and folders deleted from windows temporarily, which can be restored again if needed.</p>

                        <h3>Anatomy of a Window:</h3>
                        <p>The window on a desktop is the rectangular area displaying content independently of other areas of the screen. The different parts of a window are the Title bar, Menu bar, the Toolbar, and the min, max and close buttons. These tools are used to manage the window and the components within it.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Title bar:</strong> This is the title of the window, like your name at the top of a piece of paper. The Title bar is also the handle for the window. If you click and hold the mouse button down on the title bar, you can move it around the screen.</li>
                            <li><strong>Minimize:</strong> To have a window take the minimum amount of desktop space possible, click the minimize button. This drops the window into the Task bar like a piece of paper going into a drawer.</li>
                            <li><strong>Maximize:</strong> To have a window take the maximum desktop space, click the maximize button. This stretches the window out.</li>
                            <li><strong>Restore:</strong> A maximized window will cover over all the other windows and icons on the desktop. The Restore button places the window back so that more than one window can display at a time.</li>
                            <li><strong>Close (X):</strong> When done with a window, you can have it taken completely off the desktop by closing it. Use the X button to do this.</li>
                            <li><strong>Menu bar:</strong> The Menu bar displays a list of commands that can be used to perform various tasks. (This will be below the Title bar).</li>
                            <li><strong>Tool bar:</strong> contains a set of buttons for frequently used commands.</li>
                            <li><strong>Scroll Bars:</strong> On the bottom and right edges of a window we find scroll bars. They are used to pan across the information in the window.</li>
                            <li><strong>The Status Bar:</strong> The Status bar appears at the very bottom of the window and provides such information as the cursor position, current page number, etc.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Booting in Windows:</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>When the computer is switched on, the BIOS is activated.</li>
                            <li>The BIOS present in ROM searches for the operating system and drives.</li>
                            <li>If there is no OS, it shows non-system or disk error.</li>
                            <li>If OS is present, then it transfers the OS from ROM to RAM.</li>
                            <li>Then the desktop is displayed on the monitor.</li>
                        </ul>
