\section*{INTRODUCTION TO POST-MORTEM}

A post-mortem examination, also known as an autopsy, is the examination of a body after death. The aim of a post-mortem is to determine the cause of death. Post-mortems are carried out by pathologists. Post-mortems provide useful information about how, when and why someone died. They enable pathologists to obtain a better understanding of how diseases spread. A post-mortem examination will be carried out if it has been requested by a coroner because the cause of death is unknown, or following a sudden, violent or unexpected death. Or a hospital doctor-to find out more about an illness or the cause of death, or to further medical research and understanding. There are two different types of post-mortem.
i. Coroner's post-mortem examination

A coroner is a judicial officer responsible for investigating deaths in certain situations. The main aim of a post-mortem requested by a coroner is to find out how someone died and decide whether an inquest is needed.
ii. Hospital post-mortem examination

These post-mortems are requested by hospital doctors to provide more information about an illness or the cause of death, or to further medical research.
In conclusion after a post- mortem, the pathologist writes a report of the findings. If the postmortem was requested by the coroner, the coroner or coroner's officer will let you know the cause of death determined by the pathologist. If you want a full copy of the pathologist's report, you can request this from the coroner's office, but there may be a fee.
