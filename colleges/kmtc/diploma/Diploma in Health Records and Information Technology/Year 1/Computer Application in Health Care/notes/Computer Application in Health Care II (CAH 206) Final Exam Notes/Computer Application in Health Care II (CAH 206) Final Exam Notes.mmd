\section*{Serial Port}

Even though the communication in PS/2 and USB is serial, technically, the term Serial Port is used to refer the interface that is compliant to RS-232 (Recommended Standard) standard. There are two types of serial ports that are commonly found on a computer: DB25 and DE-9.

\section*{DB-25}

DB-25 is a variant of D-sub connector and is the original port for RS-232 serial communication. They were developed as the main port for serial connections using RS-232 protocol but most of the applications did not require all the pins. Hence, DE-9 was developed for RS-232 based serial communication while DB-25 was rarely used as a serial port and often used as a parallel printer port as a replacement of the Centronics Parallel 36 pin connector.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_14_24230bbcc28ccf493c25g-05.jpg?height=351&width=1261&top_left_y=1864&top_left_x=390)

\section*{DE-9 or RS-232 or COM Port}

DE-9 is the main port for RS-232 serial communication. It is a D-sub connector with E shell and is often miscalled as DB-9. A DE-9 port is also called as a COM port and allows full duplex serial communication between the computer and it's peripheral. Some of the applications of DE-9 port are serial interface with mouse, keyboard, modem, uninterruptible power supplies (UPS) and other external RS-232 compatible devices.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_14_24230bbcc28ccf493c25g-06.jpg?height=243&width=587&top_left_y=281&top_left_x=406)

\section*{Parallel Port or Centronics 36 Pin Port}

Parallel port is an interface between computer and peripheral devices like printers with parallel communication. The Centronics port is a 36 pin port that was developed as an interface for printers and scanners and hence a parallel port is also called as a Centronics port. Before the wide use of USB ports, parallel ports are very common in printers. The Centronics port was later replaced by DB-25 port with parallel interface.

\section*{Audio Ports}

Audio ports are used to connect speakers or other audio output devices with the computer. The audio signals can be either analogue or digital and depending on that the port and its corresponding connector differ.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_14_24230bbcc28ccf493c25g-06.jpg?height=581&width=833&top_left_y=1474&top_left_x=471)

\section*{VGA Port}

VGA port is found in many computers, projectors, video cards and High Definition TVs. It is a D-sub connector consisting of 15 pins in 3 rows. The connector is called as DE-15.

VGA port is the main interface between computers and older CRT monitors. Even the modern LCD and LED monitors support VGA ports but the picture quality is reduced. VGA carries analogue video signals up to a resolution of $648 \times 480$.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_14_24230bbcc28ccf493c25g-07.jpg?height=448&width=787&top_left_y=260&top_left_x=287)

\section*{Digital Video Interface (DVI)}

DVI is a high speed digital interface between a display controller like a computer and a display device like a monitor. It was developed with an aim of transmitting lossless digital video signals and replace the analogue VGA technology.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_14_24230bbcc28ccf493c25g-07.jpg?height=418&width=1554&top_left_y=1076&top_left_x=298)

\section*{Display Port}

Display Port is a digital display interface with optional multiple channel audio and other forms of data. Display Port is developed with an aim of replacing VGA and DVI ports as the main interface between a computer and monitor.

The latest version DisplayPort 1.3 can handle a resolution up to 7680 X 4320.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_14_24230bbcc28ccf493c25g-08.jpg?height=990&width=1316&top_left_y=271&top_left_x=303)

\section*{Component Video}

Component Video is an interface where the video signals are split into more than two channels and the quality of the video signal is better that Composite video.

Like composite video, component video transmits only video signals and two separate connectors must be used for stereo audio. Component video port can transmit both analogue and digital video signals.

The ports of the commonly found Component video use 3 connectors and are color coded as Green, Blue and Red.

\section*{HDMI}

HDMI is an abbreviation of High Definition Media Interface. HDMI is a digital interface to connect High Definition and Ultra High Definition devices like Computer monitors, HDTVs, Blu-Ray players, gaming consoles, High Definition Cameras etc.

HDMI can be used to carry uncompressed video and compressed or uncompressed audio signals. The HDMI port of type $A$ is shown below.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_14_24230bbcc28ccf493c25g-09.jpg?height=541&width=1310&top_left_y=720&top_left_x=303)

\section*{RJ-45}

Ethernet is a networking technology that is used to connect your computer to Internet and communicate with other computers or networking devices.

The interface that is used for computer networking and telecommunications is known as Registered Jack (RJ) and RJ - 45 port in particular is used for Ethernet over cable. RJ-45 connector is an $8 \mathrm{pin}-8$ contact $(8 \mathrm{P}-8 \mathrm{C})$ type modular connector.

The latest Ethernet technology is called Gigabit Ethernet and supports a data transfer rate of over 10 Gigabits per second. The Ethernet or a LAN port with 8P-8C type connector along with the male RJ-45 cable is shown below.

\section*{2. Booting a computer}

\section*{Introduction}

Booting is a start-up sequence that starts the operating system of a computer when it is turned on. A boot sequence is the initial set of operations that the computer performs when it is switched on. Every computer has a boot sequence. The average computer doesn't understand the boot sequence but is important to know for customizing and troubleshooting your computer.

\section*{Boot Loader}

Computers powered by the central processing unit can only execute code found in the systems memory. Modern operating systems and application program code and data are stored on nonvolatile memories or mass storage devices. When a computer is first powered on, it must initially rely only on the code and data stored in nonvolatile portions of the systems memory. At boot time, the operating system is not really loaded and the computer's hardware cannot peform many complex systems actions.

The program that starts the "chain reaction" which ends with the entire operating system being loaded is known as the boot loader (or bootstrap loader). The term creatively came from early designiners imagining that before a computer "runs" it must have it's "boots strapped". The boot loader's only job is to load other software for the operating system to start. Often, multiple-stage boot loaders are used, in which several small programs of increasing complexity sequentially summon one after the other, until the last of them loads the operating system.

\section*{Boot Devices}

The boot device is the device from which the operating system is loaded. A modern PC BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) supports booting from various devices. These include the local hard disk drive, optical drive, floppy drive, a network interface card, and a USB device. Typically, the BIOS will allow the user to configure a boot order. If the boot order is set to:
1. CD Drive
2. Hard Disk Drive
3. Network
then the BIOS will try to boot from the CD drive first, and if that fails then it will try to boot from the hard disk drive, and if that fails then it will try to boot from the network, and if that fails then it won't boot at all.

\section*{Boot Sequence}

There is a standard boot sequence that all personal computers use. First, the CPU runs an instruction in memory for the BIOS. That instruction contains a jump instruction that transfers to the BIOS start-up program. This program runs a power-on self test (POST) to check that devices the computer will rely on are functioning properly. Then, the BIOS goes through the configured boot sequence until it finds a device that is bootable. Once BIOS has
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_14_24230bbcc28ccf493c25g-10.jpg?height=69&width=1538&top_left_y=2612&top_left_x=292)

If the boot device is a hard drive, it will be a master boot record (MBR). The MBR code checks the partition table for an active partition. If one is found, the MBR code loads that partition's boot sector and executes it. The boot sector is often operating system specific, however in most operating systems its main function is to load and execute the operating system kernel, which continues startup. If there is no active partition or the active parition's boot sector is invalid, the MBR may load a secondary boot loader which will select a partition and load its boot boot secotr, which usually loads the corresponding operating system kernel.

\section*{Database Processing}
1. Database

Database is an organized collection of data. It's considered organized because data is stored in categories that are accessible in a logical/particular manner
2. Components of database
i. Files - a file is a large organized data structure that contains related data E.g. Records. A file stores data and programs in the secondary memory
ii. Records - it's any entry of data in a database. It can also be defined as a "group of related data about on item"
iii. Field - a column of similar information /or/ a group of vertically arrange data that contains similar information of the same data type
3. Database system

Database system is comprised of 4 major components namely:-
i. Data - values physically stored in the database
ii. Database Hardware - this are computer hardware on which the database resides E.g. Secondary storage disk, together with associated devices e.g. CPU, channels ect.
iii. Database Software - it contains DBMS which is an application program that assist users to store information in an orderly manner for timely and quick retrieval. It provide all the functions needed to define the Data Structure and the way they are store
iv. Database user - database users are classified into three broad categories namely:-
a. Application program
b. End user
c. Database Administrator
4. Type of databases

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{ Category } & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{ Database package } \\
\hline Desktop Database & \begin{tabular}{l} 
Ms-Access, Dbase, FileMaker Pro, Clipper, FoxPro, Lotus \\
Approach
\end{tabular} \\
\hline Server Database & SQL server, My SQL, Oracle, Ingress, DB2, \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
5. Entity-relationship modeling
a. Entity
- An entity is a thing or an object of significant, either real or imaginary, about which information need to be known and stored
- An entity maybe an object with physical existence E.g. person, house etc. or a conceptual existence E.g. Job, Company, Country etc.
- An entity has partial properties/characteristics/attributes which describe it
b. Attribute
- An attribute is any information that serve to Qualify, Quantify, Identify, Classify, or Express the state of an Entity
- It can also be defined as "Any description of a thing of significance E.g. Text, Number, Picture, Feelings, Smell, and Sound etc."
- Primary Key is an Attribute that is used to uniquely identify an entity/record(identify a row in a table) and is chosen from candidates Key

Student Entity with attributes(Name, Address, Admin. No.)
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_14_24230bbcc28ccf493c25g-37.jpg?height=292&width=1466&top_left_y=1716&top_left_x=336)
6. Relationship among data
- Relationship is "An association among entities". It may also associate an entity with itself
- There are three types of relation namely:-
i. One - to - one relationship e.g. student and admin. No.
ii. One - to - many relationship e.g. student and subject
iii. Many - to - many relationship
7. Database model
- Database model is a "Specific method for describing the structure and processing within a database"
- The three most used models are:-
i. Hierarchical model - establishes a parent-child relationship. The origin of data is called the Root
ii. Relational model - establishes relationship among entities. Data is represented in a simple Row-Column (tabular)format
iii. Network model
8. Features of relationship
i. Each Row/Record in a relation contain data about the same Object/Entity
ii. Each Column/Field contains data about an attribute/property of an Object/Entity
iii. Each Column/Field in a table has a unique Name/Label
iv. The order of the Field/Column in the table is irrelevant
v. All entries in a Field/Column must be of the Same Data Type e.g. Name, date, number etc.
vi. No Row/Record in the table can be identical (no repetition)
9. Ms Access

Ms-Access database consist of a single file that holds the data tables, forms, reports, queries and indexes
10. Components/objects of Ms Access database
i. Tables - a table is a database object that consists of Row/Record and Column/Field used to store data in a database. It's the basic unit of storage
ii. Forms - is a database object used to simplify data entry, viewing, editing and deleting in a database
iii. Reports - are use for viewing and printing of some or all the data in one or more databases
iv. Queries - are use to select information that meet a given criteria in one or more databases. A select query is used to create subsets of data that you can use to answer specific questions
Ms-Access provides a "WIZARDS" that help users design queries
- Ms-Access can create a primary key if no single field have the properties required for it (i.e. should be Unique and not Null)
- Primary key is used to uniquely identify a Record/Row in a table
- Indexing - an index file contains a subset of the data files based on one or more Key Fields
11. Data integrity
- Data integrity is the process of ensuring the correctness and completeness of data in the database.
- This is to ensure validity/validation of data values when the contents of the database are modified so that the integrity of the database is not lost
- Some of the constraints of data integrity are(those that make data have errors):-
i. Validity integrity - ensure data entered matches the Field/column data type
ii. Entity integrity - avoid duplication or omission of data/record by ensuring that no primary key is duplicated or is left Null
iii. Referential integrity - it establishes a parent-child relationship i.e. any change in the parent table must and should be reflected in the child table.
12. Access interface

The look and feel of Ms-Access interface is very similar to many of the other Ms-Office products. I.e. it has

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline Title Bar & Tool Bar & View Bar \\
\hline Tab Bar & Status Bar & Etc. \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
13. Database toolbars

It contains all tools that are needed in access, but are in different Tab in Access 2007 e.g.

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline Font formatting tools & \begin{tabular}{l} 
Importation and exportation of \\
data to/from external database
\end{tabular} & \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l} 
Creation of Tables, Forms, \\
Reports and Queries
\end{tabular} & \begin{tabular}{l} 
Database tools e.g. creation of \\
relationship and analyzing \\
data
\end{tabular} & \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

Items found in tool bar
14. Tables
- They are used to store your data in a database. To create a table, you must $1{ }^{\text {st }}$ create a database that will contain all the database objects namely:-

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline & & \\
\hline & & \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

Database objects
- Table can be created either by using the
i. Table wizard
ii. Design view - used to create the table manually
- Design view has 3 components
i. Field name - they are user defined and depend on the application to be used for
ii. Data type - there are different data type in Access e.g. text, memo, number, date and time, currency, yes/no, ole object and auto-number
iii. Description - use to describe the field
15. Primary key
- A good relational database contains tables where each record/data can be uniquely identified
- One field in the table contains a unique value for each record in the table
- The unique field is called primary key and is always recommended that you define a primary key for every table you create
16. Field properties
- It contains two Tabs that can be used to further define the data type and format. They include:-
i. General Tab - contain most of the information used to define the data type
ii. Lookup Tab - to look up values from another query or table to supply information to supply information to this field
17. Linking tables
- We link tables to create a relationship
- Relationship is the way in which information in one table is related/associated to information in another table
18. Forms
- It's used to provide a friendly interface between users and Access database
- A Form can be used to:-
i. Display and modify data e.g. Add, delete etc.
ii. Accept user inputs - accept certain values
iii. Controlling application flow
iv. Displaying messages e.g. error or warnings
v. For printing information
19. Controls tools
- This are tools designed to help users navigate and utilize a Form e.g. Buttons, Radio buttons, text boxes etc.
- This controls are broken down into three categories namely:-
i. Bound - this are field of data that come from a table or a query and must have a bound control for each field that you display on the Form. Bound control cannot create a calculation
ii. Unbound - contains a label or a text box. Calculation can be created from unbound control
iii. Calculated - are values calculated in the Form e.g. Totals, Subtotals and average
20. Form layout
- All forms must have a Detail section namely:-
i. Form Header - display information that remain the same for every record e.g. Title for the form
ii. Page Header - display information e.g. title or header at the top of every printed page
iii. Page Footer - display information e.g. date or page number at the bottom of every printed page
iv. Form Footer - display information that remain the same for every record e.g. total and sub-total
- You should be able to:-
i. Create a custom form
ii. Modify and edit a form e.g. add or remove controls
iii. Add graphics to a form
iv. Create a sub-form
21. Expression Builder
- Access includes built-in functions similar to the function in Excel.
- One can also use it to develop owns calculation
- To define an expression, ones need to:-
i. Select unbound control(or group of instruction) to select, right click the control then -

Expression builder
ii. Select the properties and click on the expression builder button
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_14_24230bbcc28ccf493c25g-40.jpg?height=80&width=254&top_left_y=1697&top_left_x=1635)
iii. Begin the expression by typing "=" or click the equal sign button
iv. Click the button that represent the calculation that you want to enter or double-click on one of the folders that is contained in the left box of the expression builder box
v. Locate field from table, query, form or report for calculation by doubleclicking on the corresponding folder in the left box
vi. Type any value or constants you would like to include in the expression
22. Querying Data
- A query is a question (or group of instruction) that you ask the database when you want to pull a specific records from the database
- The results/respond is/are set of records that meet the criteria that you set
- A query can also be define as - custom-designed view of data from one or more tables in a database
- In Access, one can query by using:-
i. SQL statement
ii. Query wizard
iii. Designed a query using the design view
- Query can also be used to
i. View data
ii. Insert data
iii. Delete data
iv. Create new table from data retrieved from one or more existing tables
- In SQL view, one need to know how to write queries using the structured query language
- In our class of packages, we will create queries using the design view
23. Common criteria
i. Between value 1 and value 2 - find
ii. In - find
iii. Null - find
iv. Is not null - record
v. Like - match criteria
vi. Not == don't match criteria
24. Wildcard character
- They are used as placeholders for other characters when you don't know exactly what you are looking for, but you know a part of the value or you want to find values that start/end a latter or match a certain pattern. They include:-
i. "*" - match any number of characters e.g. wh*
ii. ? - match any single alphabetical character e.g. b?ll
iii. [] - match any single alphabetical character within the brackets
iv. ! - match any character not in the brackets e.g. b[ae]ll
v. "-" - matches any one of a range of characters e.g. $\mathrm{d}[\mathrm{a}-\mathrm{d}] \mathrm{d}$
vi. \# - matches any single numeric character e.g. 1\#3
25. Sorting (retrieving records)

Sorting is - arranging data/record in order, according to a specific field, either in ascending or descending
26. Reports
- They are the best way to share data with others in a precise and understandable manner
- Reports are very similar to forms, differences being that you can only use a report to print data and not anything else

One can create a report just like a form

\section*{6. Internet and E-mails (Computer Networking)}

\section*{1. Definition}

\section*{$>$ Network}
- It's a set of connected things or people and its' size is determined by the number of items/people connected to it, their locations/area size (space between them), the needs of the users (capabilities/data band) and the available technology e.g. inter-county highways, telephone network etc.

\section*{- Computer network}
- It's formed when two or more computers are connected together to enable communication among them e.g. send messages, share files and programs

\section*{- Internet}
- It's the world biggest computer network (a vast network of networks)
- Internet comprises of the hardware that sent information/data from one place to another and the software that govern (glues) the system together
- Network that form the internet are individually run by different entities namely the: - government agencies, universities, commercial and voluntary organization etc.
- No single organization owns or controls the internet, though there is an internet society (The World Wide Web Consortium - W3C) that set and co-ordinates standards and protocols for the internet.

\section*{2. History of the internet}

\section*{- Stage 1- The beginning}

In 1969, the Defense Advance Research Project Agency (DARPA) of the USA Department of Defense (DoD) built the $1^{\text {st }}$ network known as Advance Research Project Agency Network (ARPANET)
The intention was to built a network that could continue to work even if part of the network were disabled/destroyed
The four sites to be connected were:-

\section*{56 KBps (56000 bits/sec)}

\section*{- Stage 2 - internet start running}

In 1982, the Defense Communication Agency (DCA) and DARPA established a protocol known as Transmission Control Protocol and Internet Protocol
(TCP/IP) as the standard protocol used on the network (ARPANET) and the conversion to TCP/IP on the ARPANET was completed on jun. 1983 and the term "INTERNET" come into use in place of the "Internet Protocol (IP)"
In 1989, ARPANET was split into two networks namely
- MILNET - military network for military department
- ARPANET - for non-DOD sites and the TCP/IP was the accepted protocol running on the network
In 1984, Japan Started JUNET (Japan UNIX Network) and UK started JANET (Joint Academic and Research Network)

\section*{- Stage 3-national science foundation}

In 1986, the DOD assigned the ARPANET project to the National Science Foundation (NSF) and a network connecting five supercomputers centers was established by the NSF to enhance computer and network research capabilities in the USA
The NFS network and other network makes up the largest network of networks; the Internet

\section*{- Stage 4 - the World Wide Web (WWW)}
- Event that began in 1989 and became public in 1992 was the $1^{\text {st }}$ public distribution of the World Wide Web (WWW) client Software on the Internet
- The WWW client software was created by Tim Berners at the Conseil Europeen por la researche Nucleare (CERN) - (European Consul for Nuclear Research) laboratory of particle physic. He propose a hypertext
system enabling scientist studying high-energy physics to share information more efficiently
- The proposal was very important coz it involve a user interface that would be consistent across all platform e.g. UNIX, Macintosh, Windows etc.
- The WWW uses the Internet Protocol http:/ to present information through multimedia format; ie graphics, sound, animation and video
- Internet (WWW) resemble an enormous electronic library; each "Web Site" is comparable to a book; each book as a page(web page) which contains content and links to other pages(Web Page) in the book(Web Site) and also other books (Sites)
- WWW client programs/software include :-

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline Internet explorer & Netscape & Mosaic \\
\hline Mozilla Firefox & Lynx & Charlotte \\
\hline Opera mini & Ect. & \\

\section*{Software download}

One can download and use a program from the internet

\section*{- Finding people and organization}

One can find people (e.g. using face-book) or an organization (e.g. a school) by using the internet

\section*{- Linking to traditional communication media}

With internet, one can access

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline Telephone & Mobile phone & Short Message Service(SMS) \\
\hline Banking & E-mails & Radio/Tv \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\section*{5. Internet connection}

The following elements are required for one to access the internet

\section*{i. Computer}

Maybe
ii. Modem
- A modem is device that form a connection, (via telephone or cable-TV lines), between your computer \& a computer network that provides internet access.
- Modem may be internal or external \& the wires that carry information are plugged into your modem.
- Modems require software that will enable you to control your modem.

\section*{iii. Internet connection}

Internet connection is classified into two methods namely:-
a. Dial-up connection
- It accesses the internet on a per-use basis \& uses a modem.
- It gains internet access when they contact an ISP \& the ISP transfers them to the internet. When finish they disconnect from the ISP. The speed depends on the modem.
- To gain faster dial-up connections, you can install an Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) line, which is a digital tel. line.
- In an ISDN modem, a "terminal adapter" is attached to the computer that connects to the internet. The ISDN lines are expensive way to access internet in a dial-up connection.
- The most inexpensive method of accessing Internet is by using a telephone line, an analog modem and a subscription to an ISP
b. Direct connection

Its Provide continuous, "Always on" access to the internet
It's convenient and fast because of high band-width
Direct connection includes:-
i. Local Area Network(LAN) connection (using a router)
ii. Cable TV (using Network Interface Card(NIC) or cable box)
iii. Digital Subscriber Line(DSL) - by Digital phone lines, a DSL modem and a NIC to attach to the computer
Direct connection are commonly referred to as Broadband connection
c. Factors to consider when selecting a good Internet Service Provider(ISP)
- Internet Service Providers (ISP) are organizations /or/companies that provide individuals and businesses with access to the Internet through Dial-up or Broadband connection.
- When choosing an internet service provider (ISP), one should consider the following factors

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline Ease of use & Support(customer service) & Cost \\
\hline Services offered e.g. E-mail & Trial before buying & Content offered \\
\hline Performance(speed) & Privacy & security \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\section*{iv. Internet software(Web-Browser)}

Communication software is needed to manage your connection to the internet.
Some of the application programs (client software) available include

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline Internet Explorer & Opera Mini & Mozilla Firefox \\
\hline Netscape & & \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
6. Accessing the internet
$>$ Login/sign-in
ISP will provide you with a username and a password
- Getting online
- One has to dial to the ISP and may require a Username and a Password to gain access to the ISP network
- Some OS (Operating System) or Wed browsers may give an option to remember password
7. What makes up the Web(Internet)

Internet is made-up of 3 components namely:-
i. Web site

It's made up of collection of web pages which may include anywhere from a handful up to millions of web pages, published as one interconnected entity e.g. Wikipedia, Google, Nation-media, BBC etc.
ii. Web pages

It's a single page in a website. Ti provides a single screen of information which may contain text, images, animation, sound, video etc.
You can view a web-page via the web-browser software
iii. Links

These are Hypertext or Hypermedia that is used to move from one page to another within a website or to another webpage.
iv. Hypertext
- Hypertext is text like regular text (it can be stored, read, search, edited, etc.) with one exception: - "hypertext" contains within it a connection to other sections/text or documents, /or/
- Hypertext is a structured text that uses logical links (hyperlink) between nodes containing text
v. Hyperlink (Hypertext links/connection)

This are connection that are used to create complex virtual web of connections Hyperlinks are usually underlined and blue in color. When you click it, its color changes to red

\section*{vi. Hypermedia}

It contains not only to other pieces of text, but also to other forms of media i.e. sound, images and movies. Images can be selected to link to sound or documents

\section*{8. How the Web Works}

\section*{- Hypertext transmission protocol (HTTP)}
- This is the protocol that Web-client and servers computers use to communicate with each other (it's the protocol used to exchange or transfer text)
- The web works under the popular client-server model
- All web client and servers must be able to speak HTTP in order to send and receive hypermedia documents e.g.
i. Web servers are often called HTTP servers
ii. Web addresses are automatically prefixed with $\underline{\mathbf{h t t p}}$ :/
- The phrase "World Wide Web-(WWW)" is often used to refer to the collection of network of computers and servers that are speaking HTML language and sharing information using the protocol HTTP

\section*{- Hypertext markup language (HTML)}
- This is the language the web uses to creating and recognizing hypermedia documents
- HTML is widely praised for its ease of use. Documents are usually named with the suffix ".html"

\section*{9. Uniform resource locator (URL)}

URL is the Internet address of a particular Web Page (acts like a tel. number)
- Structure of URL

URL address has two basic parts namely:-
i. A portion specifying the method of file access
- The $1^{\text {st }}$ part that end with "://" tell the type of file that is permitted from the internet
- It tells the server computer which type of file the client computer is requesting
- e.g. http:// stands for "Hypertext Transfer Protocol" and tells the server that the type of file you have requested
ii. A portion specifying the internet location of the file to be accessed
- It specifies the internet address of the machine housing the file and the location of the file at that internet address.
- The rest of the URL address after ".com/" gives the location of the file on the computer
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_14_24230bbcc28ccf493c25g-55.jpg?height=212&width=1580&top_left_y=2113&top_left_x=302)

\section*{10. Surfing/Browsing the internet}

\section*{- Starting up your browser}
- You start up your browser in the same way as any other software e.g. Ms Word, Ms excel. However, you need to be connected to the Internet $1^{\text {st }}$ to access the web page
- Some computers may be configured to automatically connect to the Internet upon opening the web browser
- Web browser menu is the same as that of any other Windows Program

\section*{- Requesting a web page}
- There are several ways of requesting a web page. They includes:-
i. Type a "URL" in the address bar on the web browser and click "GO" or hit "ENTER"
ii. Click "file" menu, select "open page" and key in the URL
iii. Press "Ctrl $+\mathbf{D}$ " at the same time, then type in the URL you want
11. Searching the web (Using Search Engines)
- Search engines allow the users to type keywords that are run against the database on the server computer
- It uses the software "reboot or spiders" to crawl the web and build its database. Web documents are retrieved and indexed
- When you enter a query at the search engine web site, your input is checked against the search engine "keyword" indexes.
- When using the internet, you cannot search the internet live, but you are searching a pre-compile database
- While all search engine are intended to perform the same task, each engine does it differently, which sometime leads to significantly different results
- Factors that influence results include:-
i. Size of the database
ii. Frequency of update
iii. Search capabilities e.g. search speed, design interface, help they offer
- Search engines are best used to locate a specific piece of information, e.g. document, image, program etc. rather than a general subject
- The growth of the number of search engine has led to the creation of "META" search tools, often referred to as "Multi-threaded-search engines". These search engine allow the user to search multiple databases simultaneously, via a single interface
- Example of search engine are:-

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline Google & Mozilla & MSN \\
\hline Yahoo & HotBot & Lycos \\
\hline Dogpiles & Excite & AltaAista \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
12. Common surfing problems
- When using web, common problems includes:-
i. URL not working due to typing errors
ii. Dead links
iii. Slow in loading content
iv. Telecommunication breakdown
- Other problems which are associated with URL error and is given in error code message includes

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline $400-$ bad request & $401-$ unauthorized & $403-$ forbidden \\
\hline $404-$ file not found & $500-$ server error & $503-$ server unavailable \\
\hline Server under construction & Server not responding & Etc. \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
13. Web directories
- This is hierarchical organized Indexes of subjects (files) categories, that allow the web searcher to browse through a list of web sites by subject in search of relevant information
- They are compiled and maintained by humans and may include a search engine for searching their own database.
- Web directories greatly reduce the probability of retrieving results out of context coz it include human intervention
- Web directories are usually smaller than those of the search Engines hence the result list tend to be small as well
- Examples of subject directories includes:-
i. Look smart (www.looksmart.com)
ii. Open directories (www.dmoz.com)
iii. Yahoo (www.yahoo.com)
14. Methods of text indexing
- There are two primary methods of text indexing, namely:-
a. Keyword Indexing
- This is the most common form of text indexing on the web.
- In this method, text are indexed by use of key word or in some case, by phrases
- Unless the author specifies the key-word for the document, it's up to the search engine to determined them by pulling out words that it believes to be of significance e.g. words at the top of the document or those that are repeated more often in throughout the document
- Key word searches find it difficult to distinguish between words that are spelled the same way but mean different things /OR/ words spelled differently but mean the same thing; therefore may results in hits that are completely irrelevant to the query
- It cannot return hits on key-words that mean the same thing but are not actually entered in your query e.g. a query on heart diseases would not return a document that use the word "cardiac" instead of "heart"
b. Concept-base Indexing
- It tries to determine what you mean(unlike key-word indexing), not just what you say
- They do this by checking documents for the dominant theme or concept, which are then indexed.
- They return hits on documents that are about the subject/theme you are exploring, even if the words in the document do not precisely match the word you entered into the query
- Some concept base indexing rely on sophisticated linguistics and artificial intelligence theory e.g. by calculating the frequency with which certain important words appears. The search engine concludes, by statistical analysis, that the pieces are "about" a certain subjects e.g. the word "heart", when used in the medical/health context, would be likely to appear with words such as coronary, artery, lung, stroke, cholesterol, blood, arteriosclerosis etc. if the same word "hearth" appears in a document with other words such as flower, candy, love, passion, valentine etc., a very different context is established and the search engine returns hits on the subject of romance
15. Electronic mails (E-mail)

It's a type of mail that is electronic, whether it's transmitted over the internet or not.
a. E-mail software
- E-mail allows one to compose, send and receive e-mails. The most e-mail software includes: - Microsoft Outlook, Netscape communicator, Eudora etc.
- The e-mails are stored in a separate folders described below

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline Inbox & \begin{tabular}{l} 
Store incoming e-mails. It's also store older emails or easy \\
use
\end{tabular} \\
\hline Outbox/sent & Contain sent messages \\
\hline Draft & Emails that are being worked on and not yet ready to be sent \\
\hline Deleted items & Emails that have been deleted \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\section*{b. Composing an e-mail}
- This is the process of writing an email.
- It's best to write when the internet is not connected(off-line)
- Most header elements in the new e-mail window are
i. To-address of your recipient
ii. Subject - a few words outlining the nature of your message
iii. $\quad \mathbf{C C}$ - copy an email to other recipient
iv. $\mathbf{B C C}$ - copy an email to other recipient without any indication of that action appearing in the main recipient's copy of the message
v. Attachments - to attach a file to your email

\section*{c. Sending, receiving and forwarding an E-mail}
- Once one has finish composing an email, he/she can send it immediately or save it as draft so that he/she can send it later
- Once an email have send an email, the send massage automatically appears in the "sent items/outbox"

\section*{d. Attaching documents to E-mail}
- One can attach a file, document, picture, sound or a movie to an email before sending it.
- All email software provide tools for attaching a document in an email and will send the attached document automatically when the email is sent

\section*{e. Deleting mails}
- One can delete an email message from the Inbox folder when need be and the deleted message is moved automatically to ht Trash/Deleted items

\section*{f. Mail Etiquette}

When writing an email, the following measures should be taken into consideration:-
i. Keep emails short and clear
ii. Avoid forwarding other people massages

\section*{7. Data security}

\section*{1. Definition}
- Data security is the protection of computer hardware, computer software (programs) and data in the computer and communication system against unauthorized modification, destruction, disclosure or transfer whether accidental or intentional

\section*{2. Data control}
- Data control is the measures taken to enforce the security of the programs and data
- In order to protect against data lose, control measures need to be put in place. These controls may be just procedures, software or hardware
- Usually a combinations of all will be required to protect against all possible threats

\section*{3. Various threats to data security.}

\section*{i. Physical damage and theft}
i. Theft
- In an event of computer theft, one will lose data and information stored in it plus computer itself
- In most of the cases, data stored in the computer is by far more expensive that the computer itself.
ii. System crash

This is the total computer failure that occurs when the computer is damaged.
iii. Protection against theft and system crash

One should regularly backup his/her data so that you can restore the information to the point of last back up. Incomplete backup (infrequent, incomplete), may lead to
a. Loss of data stored in the system
b. In the case of computer theft, one will loss the hardware itself

\section*{ii. Viruses}
i. Definition
- This is a hidden self-replicating computer program/software written with ill motives by mischievous individuals with bad intention and spread to other computers by sharing infected files or/and programs
- Viruses are designed to "self replicate" or "clone" themselves, that is, secretly copy themselves from place to place. This process is called infection
ii. Virus detection - we detect a virus when we experience one or more of the following symptoms
- Slow down of computer programs or slow down of the computer general performance
- Unusual and frequent error messages
- Change in file size or replication of computer files
- Loss or modification of data
- System failure

\section*{iii. Protection against viruses}
- Installing Anti-virus software in your computer
- Files should be backup so that it can be restored back in the event of a system failure
- One should avoid using programs of unknown origins
- One should not open an attached file from unknown origin in an email
- Always check for viruses on portable disks when using it to transfer files from one computer to another

\section*{iii. Software Bugs}
* These are errors in computer software that are usually unintentional.
- Running a computer with a bug can lead to serious malfunctioning to the computer and may lead to loss of data

\section*{iv. Trojan horses}
* These are dangerous pieces of computer program that comes intentionally hidden or appears like a software that is well-behave and useful

\section*{v. Software chameleons}
* This type of program is made to look harmless but in the background, it carries out illegal adjustments to your computer.
* E.g. it may be designed to record your secret password or steal a thiny amount of money over a long period of time.

\section*{vi. Software bombs}
* This is programs which cause destruction as soon as you try to execute or run it.

\section*{vii. Logical bombs}
* Works like software bombs but it triggered by some condition such as an attempt to carry out a certain operation such as saving a file.

\section*{viii. Time bombs}
- These are programs triggered by dates or after a certain number of a particular operations has been carried out.(e.g. on $12^{\text {th }}$ dec 1999 live Mellissa)

\section*{ix. Replicators}
- This copies itself onto the disk \&memory (ram) so many times that space is not available for other programs to run thus crippling the computer.

\section*{x. Worms}
- These travel across networks \& are usually designed to cause alteration similar to software chameleons wherever they go.
- They are difficult to detect with antivirus.

\section*{4. Computer crimes}

\section*{i. Hacking}
* This is when an individual gets unauthorized access into the computer system
* Data being transmitted in a network can also be intercepted
- Once an hacker breaks into the system, they can
i. Take a look at the data and information stored in the system
ii. Steal the information
iii. Modify or destroy the information

\section*{- Protection against hacking}
i. Log off or shut down the computer when one is not using it
ii. Choose passwords that are not obvious and keep them confidential and should not be written down anywhere
iii. Change password frequently
iv. Encrypt data before sending them over the network
v. One should also use other methods of authentication e.g. fingerprints, voice recognition, face recognition etc.

\section*{ii. Trespass}

This is when a person is able to connect to your computer through a computer network and is able to control it in some way, e.g. accessing a file or running a program.

\section*{iii. Tracking}

This is when a person can monitor what you are doing on your computer or your current location from a remote computer.

\section*{iv. Tapping}

This is when a person can gain access to information that is being transmitted via communication channel.

\section*{v. Cracking}

This is similar to hacking only that in cracking, one is doing so with the intention of causing damage or self gain

\section*{vi. Sabotage}

This is when a person renders another person's system unusable through a number of activities e.g. denial of service

\section*{vii. Spam}

This is when a person sends unsolicited junk email, called spam, by accessing a list of email address, to thousands of users

\section*{5. Privacy and fraud}
- Privacy is when a person is able to keep his/her secrets without other people knowing them.
- Cracking, trespassing, tracking, tapping and hacking are all a violation of one's privacy and are generally considered an offence/crime/fraud in most countries

\section*{6. Detection and protection of computer crimes}

\section*{One should take the following precautions}

\section*{i. Physical security}
