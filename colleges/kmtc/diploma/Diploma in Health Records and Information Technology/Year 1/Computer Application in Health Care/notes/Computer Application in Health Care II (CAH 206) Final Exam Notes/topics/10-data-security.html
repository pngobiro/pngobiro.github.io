                        <p><strong>Data security</strong> is the protection of computer hardware, computer software (programs) and data in the computer and communication system against unauthorized modification, destruction, disclosure or transfer whether accidental or intentional.</p>
                        <p><strong>Data control</strong> is the measures taken to enforce the security of the programs and data. In order to protect against data lose, control measures need to be put in place. These controls may be just procedures, software or hardware. Usually a combinations of all will be required to protect against all possible threats.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h3>i. Physical damage and theft</h3>
                        <h4>Theft</h4>
                        <p>In an event of computer theft, one will lose data and information stored in it plus computer itself. In most of the cases, data stored in the computer is by far more expensive that the computer itself.</p>
                        <h4>System crash</h4>
                        <p>This is the total computer failure that occurs when the computer is damaged.</p>
                        <h4>Protection against theft and system crash</h4>
                        <p>One should regularly backup his/her data so that you can restore the information to the point of last back up. Incomplete backup (infrequent, incomplete), may lead to loss of data stored in the system. In the case of computer theft, one will loss the hardware itself.</p>

                        <h3>ii. Viruses</h3>
                        <h4>Definition</h4>
                        <p>This is a hidden self-replicating computer program/software written with ill motives by mischievous individuals with bad intention and spread to other computers by sharing infected files or/and programs. Viruses are designed to "self replicate" or "clone" themselves, that is, secretly copy themselves from place to place. This process is called infection.</p>
                        <h4>Virus detection</h4>
                        <p>We detect a virus when we experience one or more of the following symptoms:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Slow down of computer programs or slow down of the computer general performance</li>
                            <li>Unusual and frequent error messages</li>
                            <li>Change in file size or replication of computer files</li>
                            <li>Loss or modification of data</li>
                            <li>System failure</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Protection against viruses</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Installing Anti-virus software in your computer</li>
                            <li>Files should be backup so that it can be restored back in the event of a system failure</li>
                            <li>One should avoid using programs of unknown origins</li>
                            <li>One should not open an attached file from unknown origin in an email</li>
                            <li>Always check for viruses on portable disks when using it to transfer files from one computer to another</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h3>iii. Software Bugs</h3>
                        <p>These are errors in computer software that are usually unintentional. Running a computer with a bug can lead to serious malfunctioning to the computer and may lead to loss of data.</p>
                        
                        <h3>iv. Trojan horses</h3>
                        <p>These are dangerous pieces of computer program that comes intentionally hidden or appears like a software that is well-behave and useful.</p>
                        
                        <h3>v. Software chameleons</h3>
                        <p>This type of program is made to look harmless but in the background, it carries out illegal adjustments to your computer. E.g. it may be designed to record your secret password or steal a tiny amount of money over a long period of time.</p>
                        
                        <h3>vi. Software bombs</h3>
                        <p>This is programs which cause destruction as soon as you try to execute or run it.</p>
                        
                        <h3>vii. Logical bombs</h3>
                        <p>Works like software bombs but it triggered by some condition such as an attempt to carry out a certain operation such as saving a file.</p>
                        
                        <h3>viii. Time bombs</h3>
                        <p>These are programs triggered by dates or after a certain number of a particular operations has been carried out.(e.g. on 12th dec 1999 live Mellissa)</p>
                        
                        <h3>ix. Replicators</h3>
                        <p>This copies itself onto the disk &memory (ram) so many times that space is not available for other programs to run thus crippling the computer.</p>
                        
                        <h3>x. Worms</h3>
                        <p>These travel across networks & are usually designed to cause alteration similar to software chameleons wherever they go. They are difficult to detect with antivirus.</p>

                        <p>This is when an individual gets unauthorized access into the computer system. Data being transmitted in a network can also be intercepted. Once an hacker breaks into the system, they can:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Take a look at the data and information stored in the system</li>

                            <li>Choose passwords that are not obvious and keep them confidential and should not be written down anywhere</li>
                            <li>Change password frequently</li>
                            <li>Encrypt data before sending them over the network</li>
                            <li>One should also use other methods of authentication e.g. fingerprints, voice recognition, face recognition etc.</li>

                        <p>This is when a person is able to connect to your computer through a computer network and is able to control it in some way, e.g. accessing a file or running a program.</p>
                        
                        <h3>iii. Tracking</h3>
                        <p>This is when a person can monitor what you are doing on your computer or your current location from a remote computer.</p>
                        
                        <h3>iv. Tapping</h3>
                        <p>This is when a person can gain access to information that is being transmitted via communication channel.</p>
                        
                        <h3>v. Cracking</h3>
                        <p>This is similar to hacking only that in cracking, one is doing so with the intention of causing damage or self gain.</p>
                        
                        <h3>vi. Sabotage</h3>
