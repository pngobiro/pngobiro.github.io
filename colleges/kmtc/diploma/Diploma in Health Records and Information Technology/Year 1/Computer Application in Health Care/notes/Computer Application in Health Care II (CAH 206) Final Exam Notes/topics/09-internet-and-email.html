                        <p>It's a set of connected things or people and its' size is determined by the number of items/people connected to it, their locations/area size (space between them), the needs of the users (capabilities/data band) and the available technology e.g. inter-county highways, telephone network etc.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Computer network</h3>
                        <p>It's formed when two or more computers are connected together to enable communication among them e.g. send messages, share files and programs.</p>

                        <h3>Internet</h3>
                        <p>It's the world biggest computer network (a vast network of networks). Internet comprises of the hardware that sent information/data from one place to another and the software that govern (glues) the system together. Network that form the internet are individually run by different entities namely the: government agencies, universities, commercial and voluntary organization etc. No single organization owns or controls the internet, though there is an internet society (The World Wide Web Consortium - W3C) that set and co-ordinates standards and protocols for the internet.</p>

                        <h3>Stage 1 - The beginning</h3>
                        <p>In 1969, the Defense Advance Research Project Agency (DARPA) of the USA Department of Defense (DoD) built the 1st network known as Advance Research Project Agency Network (ARPANET). The intention was to built a network that could continue to work even if part of the network were disabled/destroyed. The four sites to be connected were:</p>

                        </figure>

                        <h3>Stage 2 - Internet start running</h3>
                        <p>In 1982, the Defense Communication Agency (DCA) and DARPA established a protocol known as Transmission Control Protocol and Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) as the standard protocol used on the network (ARPANET) and the conversion to TCP/IP on the ARPANET was completed on Jun. 1983 and the term "INTERNET" come into use. In 1989, ARPANET was split into two networks namely MILNET (military network) and ARPANET (for non-DOD sites).</p>

                        <h3>Stage 3 - National Science Foundation</h3>
                        <p>In 1986, the DOD assigned the ARPANET project to the National Science Foundation (NSF) and a network connecting five supercomputers centers was established by the NSF to enhance computer and network research capabilities in the USA. The NSF network and other networks makes up the largest network of networks; the Internet.</p>

                        <h3>Stage 4 - The World Wide Web (WWW)</h3>
                        <p>The 1st public distribution of the World Wide Web (WWW) client Software on the Internet began in 1989 and became public in 1992. The WWW client software was created by Tim Berners at CERN. He proposed a hypertext system enabling scientist studying high-energy physics to share information more efficiently. The WWW uses the Internet Protocol http:/ to present information through multimedia format; ie graphics, sound, animation and video.</p>

                        <p>Internet is made-up of 3 components namely:-</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Web site:</strong> It's made up of collection of web pages.</li>
                            <li><strong>Web pages:</strong> It's a single page in a website. It provides a single screen of information which may contain text, images, animation, sound, video etc.</li>
                            <li><strong>Links:</strong> These are Hypertext or Hypermedia that is used to move from one page to another.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Hypertext transmission protocol (HTTP)</h3>
                        <p>This is the protocol that Web-client and servers computers use to communicate with each other. The web works under the popular client-server model.</p>

                        <h3>Hypertext markup language (HTML)</h3>
                        <p>This is the language the web uses to creating and recognizing hypermedia documents. Documents are usually named with the suffix ".html".</p>

                        <h3>Uniform resource locator (URL)</h3>
                        <p>URL is the Internet address of a particular Web Page. It has two basic parts: a portion specifying the method of file access (e.g., http://) and a portion specifying the internet location of the file.</p>
