\section*{Access 2007}

Access 2007 is the database software in the Microsoft 2007 Office suite that allows you to order, manage, search, and report large amounts of information. This tutorial will show you how to build a database from scratch, including how to set up tables, create and use forms to enhance data integrity, design and run meaningful queries, and produce us eful and attractive reports.

\section*{Understanding Database Concepts}

\section*{WHY DO WE NEED A DATABASE?}

\section*{Introduction}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_14_b4e950dbd66c79507867g-01.jpg?height=538&width=532&top_left_y=940&top_left_x=181)

Once you have determined that an Access database will help you store and manage your data, you will need to learn the parts of a database, how to start using Access, and how to navigate the Access window. In this lesson, we will provide a basic overview of Access, including the parts of a database and common tas ks you can complete using a database.

\section*{Exploring databases}

\section*{Databases in our lives}

Think about all of the information we encounter on a typical day that might be organized by a database. For example, if you go shopping at a department store for a toas ter, the store inventory of products is information that must be stored somewhere, along with the price of each product.

When you make a purchase, the store needs to be able to store the sales information to determine the daily sales total and how to track the decrease in inventory. A database could store this information, and it could also allow the store to quickly determine how many Brand X toasters are in inventory without needing to count inventory on the shelves.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_14_b4e950dbd66c79507867g-02.jpg?height=338&width=386&top_left_y=308&top_left_x=230)

\section*{Product Information:}

Brand $X$ Toaster
Item \# 12546465
Color: Black
Price: $\$ 15.00$
Quantity Instock 100
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_14_b4e950dbd66c79507867g-02.jpg?height=307&width=171&top_left_y=314&top_left_x=1122)

> Item \# $\longrightarrow$ Subtract from Inventory Price $\longrightarrow$ Add to Daily Sales Total

While this information could be managed without a database, it would be easier and more efficient to use one. Databases have an enormous impact in almost every area of our lives.

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|l|l|l|l|}
\hline \multicolumn{8}{|c|}{Department Store Inventory} \\
\hline ID & - & Item \# & Color & Price & In Stock & Barcode & Location \\
\hline & 2 Brand X Toaster & 12546465 & Blk & \$15.00 & 100 & 12211111 & Kitchen \& Hom \\
\hline & 3 & 243456464 & Crm & \$25.00 & 85 & 13419673 & Kitchen \& Hom \\
\hline & 4 & 55664 & Blk & \$150.00 & 150 & 15444779 & Kitchen \& Hom \\
\hline & 5 & 977484152 & Wht & \$66.85 & 50 & 11547547 & Kitchen \& Hom \\
\hline & 6 & 354675678 & Silver & \$15.99 & 235 & 15457867 & Kitchen \& Hom \\

\hline & 8 & 1314645 & Blk & \$300.00 & 12 & 12457878 & Electronics \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\section*{Think about it}

Think about what is going on around you in everyday situations and whether there might be a database at work
- Grocery store: The grocery store is stocked with items. Items must be ordered, shipped, and stocked in the store. The store must pay for the items. When a customer buys items, the cash register retrieves prices and the customer pays for products. Where might databases be involved in this situation?
- Restaurant: Where does the food come from? How does management know when to reorder a product? How are bills paid?
- Traffic lights: Who or what controls when the lights turn red or green?

A database maintains order and structure in our lives. Databases are created using programs such as Micros oft Access 2007, which is a relational database program.

\section*{Getting started with Access}

When you start Access 2007, you will see the Getting Started window.
In the left pane, the template categories-including the featured local templates-are listed, as well as the categories on Office Online. Templates are prebuilt databases focused on a specific task that you can download and use immediately.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_14_b4e950dbd66c79507867g-03.jpg?height=947&width=1451&top_left_y=609&top_left_x=178)

In the example below, the featured templates are selected, and the template options are displayed in the center area of the screen. Featured templates include database template options that are available online, as well as templates that are available as part of the local version of Access.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_14_b4e950dbd66c79507867g-04.jpg?height=900&width=1456&top_left_y=374&top_left_x=184)

\section*{Opening a database}

You have three main options on the Getting Started page. You can open a template database stored locally or online, an existing database, or a blank database.

To view templates included with Access:
- Click Local Templates in the left pane. The center of the screen will change to display icons for the templates.
- Select an icon in the center of the screen. Details about the database template will appear on the right.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_14_b4e950dbd66c79507867g-05.jpg?height=974&width=1460&top_left_y=243&top_left_x=178)

In the left pane of the Getting Started window, you will see a list of categories for the templates available on Office Online. You must have an Internet connection to download these database templates.

The Blank Database command allows you to create a database from scratch.
To open an existing database:
- In the Open Recent Database section, double-click the file name of the database you want to open. It will appear in the window.

\section*{Open Recent Database}

OR
- Click the More link. A dialog box will appear.
- Select the database you want to open.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_14_b4e950dbd66c79507867g-06.jpg?height=982&width=1546&top_left_y=704&top_left_x=178)
- Click Open The database will appear.

\section*{The Access window}

Before you can begin to use a database, you need to become familiar with the Access window.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_14_b4e950dbd66c79507867g-07.jpg?height=603&width=1747&top_left_y=246&top_left_x=178)

\section*{The Ribbon}

Like other software in the Microsoft Office 2007 suite, Access 2007 has a tabbed Ribbon system you use to navigate the database. The Ribbon is organized into tabs. Each tab contains groups of commands you use to perform tasks in Access.

For example, on the Home tab you'll see that there is a Font group that contains font formatting commands such as font type, size, color, and alignment. Unless you use keyboard shortcuts for everything, the Ribbon is how you get work done in Access.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_14_b4e950dbd66c79507867g-07.jpg?height=432&width=1445&top_left_y=1355&top_left_x=184)

\section*{The Quick Access toolbar}

Once you are familiar with Access, you may find that there are commands you use more often than others. To make it easier to use these commands, you can add them to the Quick Access toolbar. By default, the toolbar appears above the Ribbon on the left side of the Access window and includes the Save, Undo, and Redo commands.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_14_b4e950dbd66c79507867g-08.jpg?height=381&width=624&top_left_y=243&top_left_x=184)

\section*{The Micros oft Office button}

The Microsoft Office button is located in the upper-left corner of the Access window and includes key menu options such as New, Save, and Print. From this menu, you can also change your Access Options.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_14_b4e950dbd66c79507867g-08.jpg?height=1226&width=1202&top_left_y=959&top_left_x=184)

\section*{The navigation pane}

The main control center of each Access database is the navigation pane. It shows you what is in the database and makes the information accessible to you. You can choose to close the navigation pane if you need more of the Access window to complete specific tasks.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_14_b4e950dbd66c79507867g-09.jpg?height=918&width=578&top_left_y=243&top_left_x=176)

To open and close the navigation pane:
- Click the Shutter Barbutton on the right side of the navigation pane.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_14_b4e950dbd66c79507867g-09.jpg?height=396&width=980&top_left_y=1393&top_left_x=178)
- The navigation pane appears as a single column when it is collapsed.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_14_b4e950dbd66c79507867g-10.jpg?height=1064&width=440&top_left_y=243&top_left_x=176)

\section*{Parts of a database}

A Micros oft Access database is made up of several components, including tables, forms, queries, and reports. These components are called database objects. One or more of these objects is formed when a database is created, and all of the objects appear in the navigation pane. To make the database easier to navigate, beginner Access users may want to reorder objects in the navigation pane.

To change how objects are ordered in the navigation pane:
- Click the drop-down arrow at the top of the navigation pane to see ordering options.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_14_b4e950dbd66c79507867g-11.jpg?height=1137&width=568&top_left_y=243&top_left_x=181)
- Select a menu option. The navigation pane will appear reordered based on your selection.

If you are new to databases, arranging the objects by type in the navigation pane is usually a good idea. This will group tables, forms, queries, and reports into individual groups in the pane.

To expand or collapse a group:
- Click any downward-pointing double arrow to expand a group so all objects are displayed.
- Click any upward-pointing double arrow to collapse a group and hide all objects.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_14_b4e950dbd66c79507867g-11.jpg?height=323&width=568&top_left_y=1897&top_left_x=178)

\section*{Parts of a database}

A database is made up of several components, or objects. These objects include:
- Tables
- Queries
- Forms
- Reports

We'll look at each of these objects in more detail in later lessons, but you can access them from the navigation pane like you can with tables.

\section*{Tables}

A table is the database object that contains the basic information you want to store. A blue and white icon represents the table in the navigation pane.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_14_b4e950dbd66c79507867g-12.jpg?height=686&width=568&top_left_y=840&top_left_x=178)

In the Customer Info table below, there are columns-or fields-of information, including title and author. Each row is a record containing the information specific to the fields listed.

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|l|l|}
\hline All Access Objects & \multicolumn{5}{|c|}{Books} \\
\hline Tables & & & Book ID & Title & Author \\
\hline ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_14_b4e950dbd66c79507867g-13.jpg?height=47\&width=62\&top_left_y=366\&top_left_x=206) & & $\pm$ & 1 & Quick Tips & Jenny Wu \\

\hline
\end{tabular}

\section*{Queries}

Another database object is called a query. A query allows you to retrieve information from one or more tables based on a set of search conditions you define using the table fields.

For example, if you want to know the name of the books that have sold in Colorado and Kans as, you could create a query that would retrieve information from multiple tables to determine the answer. In this example, you would retrieve information from the Order Info table and Books table. Queries are covered in more detail in later lessons.

\section*{Forms}

A third database object is the form. Forms are an Access tool you can create to make data entry in database tables easier.

Entering data directly into a table can be difficult if there's a lot of information to enter. Similar to an Excel spreadsheet, an Access table is essentially a screen filled with blank rows where you enter records. Forms, however, give you an eas y-to-read interface where you can enter table data. Forms are especially us eful for Access us ers who aren't comfortable working with databases.

\section*{Reports}

The final database object is the report. A report is an effective way to analyze and present data using a specific layout. The text can be formatted in an Access report, just like it can be in Word documents.

\section*{To close an object:}
- Select the tab for the object you want to close. (The highlighted tab is the active tab).
- Right-click the tab, and select Close from the menu.

\section*{Challenge!}

See if you can answer these questions:
- Where is the Ribbon in the Access window?
- Where is the navigation pane located?
- What is the purpose of each of the four objects in an Access database?

Thinking about Database Design

\section*{Introduction}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_14_b4e950dbd66c79507867g-14.jpg?height=377&width=475&top_left_y=1713&top_left_x=211)

The first step in creating a database is to think about why you need it-what is its purpose? Once you know the answer, you can begin designing your own database. Ask yours elf questions like What kinds of information will it store? How will I have to break down this information so it can be stored in my database? How will I use the data once it's in there?

In this lesson, we'll walk you through the steps of database design using a bookstore scenario. You will determine the purpose of the database and plan the tables and fields you will need for a simple bookstore database.

\section*{Designing a database}

\section*{The Ready-2-Read bookstore scenario}

The best way to learn about designing a database is to jump right in to the process. Let's pretend we work for the Ready-2-Read bookstore, and we need to build a database for the store to use. Let's think about what we might need the database to do for us.

The following diagram shows that we have customers and sell books via orders, both in the store and online.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_14_b4e950dbd66c79507867g-15.jpg?height=470&width=706&top_left_y=791&top_left_x=219)

The store needs a way to keep track of these things.

\section*{Determine the purpose of the database}

The first step of designing a database is to determine the purpose of the database. What do we need it to do?

At Ready-2-Read, our customers will place orders for books. At the very least, we will want our database to track the books we sell, the customers we sell them to, and the date of each of the orders.

\section*{Purpose}

Keep track of customers, orders, and books.

The database will also be able to tell us where our customers live when we need to send them books. Additionally, we can use it to track our sales or to make a bestseller list to post in the store.

\section*{Plan database tables}

Once we've established its purpose, we can begin brainstorming about how to break up the information into the tables the database will need to store data. Recall that a table is a collection of records, and each record is broken up into the smallest pieces of needed information, called fields.

Because we're planning a database to track our customers, the books we have, and the orders our customers place, we will need a table for each one of these.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_14_b4e950dbd66c79507867g-16.jpg?height=540&width=798&top_left_y=748&top_left_x=184)

TIP: Keep your database usable to others by giving your tables simple, easy-to-understand names.

\section*{Plan table fields}

Once you know what tables you need, the next step is deciding what fields belong in each table. Remember that fields are the smallest chunk of information in any record.

Let's look at our Ready-2-Read bookstore example again. There will be several fields in our Customers table. We'll obviously want each customer's first name and last name. We'll also need an address if we need to send a customer his order. Email will be necessary if we need to contact the customer if there is an issue with the order.
```
Customers
First Name
Last Name
Street
City
State
Zip Code
Email
```


We will also need several fields in the Books table. Title and Author make sense for books. We'll need a Price for each book Category will help us know what type of books sell the best so we can order more books that fit into this category.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_14_b4e950dbd66c79507867g-17.jpg?height=608&width=440&top_left_y=1095&top_left_x=184)

The Orders table will have fewer fields. We'll need this table to track the Customer who is placing the order, the Book the customer is ordering, and the Date the order is placed.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_14_b4e950dbd66c79507867g-18.jpg?height=600&width=430&top_left_y=246&top_left_x=186)

Don't worry if your plan doesn't include every possible field you may need. Access lets you add fields to tables whenever you need another one!

\section*{Challenge!}

Let's imagine that you want to use a database at your new coffee shop. Plan your database by answering the following questions:
- What would you want to track with your database?
- What databas e tables would you need?
- What fields will be in each database table?

\section*{BUILDING THE DATABASE}

\section*{Setting up Tables and Fields}

\section*{Introduction}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_14_b4e950dbd66c79507867g-19.jpg?height=530&width=535&top_left_y=807&top_left_x=181)

Now that we have a handle on what the database should look like, we need to work on setting up our tables and the fields within these tables.

In this lesson, we'll walk you through the steps of setting up a database in Access 2007. You'll be setting up tables according to the plan for our books tore scenario. You'll also be setting up the fields for each table, including establishing what data types can be entered in a given field.

\section*{Setting up tables and fields}

\section*{Creating a new database with Access}

When you launch Access 2007, you will see the Getting Started window.
In the left pane, the template categories-including the featured local templates-are listed, as well as the categories on Office Online. Templates are prebuilt databases focused on a specific task that you can download and use immediately.

You will als see the New Blank Database option, which allows you to build your own database from scratch.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_14_b4e950dbd66c79507867g-20.jpg?height=844&width=1451&top_left_y=243&top_left_x=178)

When you choose the New Blank Database option at the top of the window, you will be prompted to rename the database from the default name, which is Database1.accdb. Rename the database whatever you want. In the example below, we named the database Ready2Read because it's the name of the store in our scenario.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_14_b4e950dbd66c79507867g-20.jpg?height=1093&width=1449&top_left_y=1355&top_left_x=178)

Click Create to finish naming the database.

\section*{Setting up tables}

The new database opens with one table showing as a default. It also defaults to naming this table Table1 in both the navigation pane and the Table tab its elf. You will want to name your tables bas ed on your database design plan.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_14_b4e950dbd66c79507867g-21.jpg?height=595&width=1451&top_left_y=609&top_left_x=178)

\section*{Naming a table}

To give the table a unique name, you must first click on the Microsoft Office button in the upper-left comer of the application.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_14_b4e950dbd66c79507867g-21.jpg?height=722&width=801&top_left_y=1566&top_left_x=181)

Next, select Save from the menu. The Save As dialog box will appear to let you save the table whatever name you want.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_14_b4e950dbd66c79507867g-22.jpg?height=378&width=798&top_left_y=243&top_left_x=181)

The new table names appear in both the navigation pane and the Table tab its elf, as you can see in the picture below.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_14_b4e950dbd66c79507867g-22.jpg?height=318&width=798&top_left_y=807&top_left_x=181)

TIP: Give your tables logical, easy-to-understand names.

\section*{To rename a table:}

With the table closed, right-click the Table you want to rename in the navigation pane. Select the Rename option that appears in the menu.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_14_b4e950dbd66c79507867g-22.jpg?height=771&width=792&top_left_y=1501&top_left_x=187)

The table name will be highlighted and a curs or will appear, which means you can now type the new name right there. Left-click anywhere outside of the table name to make the change.

\section*{To close a table:}

There are several ways to close an active table. You can right-click the Table tab and choose Close from the menu.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_14_b4e950dbd66c79507867g-23.jpg?height=372&width=411&top_left_y=482&top_left_x=178)

A more common method is to click the $\mathbf{X}$ that appears in the top-right corner of the active database object window.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_14_b4e950dbd66c79507867g-23.jpg?height=231&width=1467&top_left_y=1035&top_left_x=184)

\section*{To open a table:}

To open a table, right-click the Table name of the table you want to open in the navigation pane, then choose Open from the menu.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_14_b4e950dbd66c79507867g-23.jpg?height=603&width=659&top_left_y=1647&top_left_x=184)

A more common method is to double-click the table name in the navigation pane. The selected table will open in the active database object window.

\section*{Adding more tables to the database}

By default, Access 2007 starts out with one table. To add more tables to the database, click the Create tab on the Ribbon
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_14_b4e950dbd66c79507867g-24.jpg?height=705&width=798&top_left_y=477&top_left_x=181)

Next, select Table from the Tables command group. A new table will open in the active database object window. You must name your table using the Save command from Micros oft Office menu.

TIP: You can tell which table you are currently in by seeing which table tab is highlighted.

\section*{Adding fields to a table}

Access 2007 allows you to add fields to tables when you are:
- Working in Datasheet view, which looks like a spreadsheet
- Working in Design view, where you are able to set more controls for your fields

Either way, you need to know how to switch between the two views.

\section*{To switch views:}

Select the Views command group from either the Home tab (seen below) or the Datasheet tab on the Ribbon. Select the view option you want from the menu.

\section*{Adding fields in Datasheet view}

By default, Access 2007 creates one field in each new table: the ID field. This field auto-numbers to give each record in the table a unique number identifier. Recall that records are the rows in a table.

TIP: You may want to rename the ID field with a unique name because the ID field appears automatically in every table you create. While this is not necessary, it may help avoid confusion when setting up table relationships.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_14_b4e950dbd66c79507867g-25.jpg?height=513&width=798&top_left_y=1344&top_left_x=181)

To add more fields to a table in Datasheet view, double-click the Add New Field header.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_14_b4e950dbd66c79507867g-25.jpg?height=313&width=671&top_left_y=1994&top_left_x=178)

The Add New Field text will disappear from the header. Name the field by typing the name directly into the header. Press the Tab key on your keyboard to move to the next field.

\section*{Adding fields in Design view}

In Design view, the field names are along the lefthand column instead of across the top like in Datasheet view, as seen below.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_14_b4e950dbd66c79507867g-26.jpg?height=578&width=1188&top_left_y=482&top_left_x=181)

To add a new field to a table in Design view, click in the cell where you want the new field and type the field name. When you switch back to Datas heet view, your new field appears as its own column, as seen below.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_14_b4e950dbd66c79507867g-26.jpg?height=486&width=1188&top_left_y=1284&top_left_x=181)

In Design view, you have several field property options you can set to ensure data can only be entered in certain formats. Setting these options is a good idea if you want to make sure the data you have in your database is good, strong data.

\section*{Moving fields}

If you want to rearrange the order in which your fields appear in a table, Access 2007 lets you easily move them around. To move a field in Datasheet view, drag and drop the field to the location you want. To do this:
- Click the field header for the field you want to move.
- Move the mouse in the area of the header.
- When the cross with arrows appears, hold down your left mouse button.
- With the left mous e button still held down, move the cursor to where you want the field to
appear.
- Release the mouse button, and the field appears in its new location.

\section*{Deleting fields}

To delete a field in Datasheet view, click the field header, then select Delete from the Field \& Column command group. This is found on the Datasheet tab on the Ribbon.

WARNING: You should not delete any field in a table without first knowing what impact the deletion may have on the rest of the database!

\section*{Setting the data type for a field}

Access 2007 lets you control how data can be entered in each table field within your database. This is done using Data Type. The default data type is text for every field after the ID field, which was set to auto-number. You can change the Data Type setting in two ways:
- From the Data Type \&Formatting command group on the Ribbon
- From the Data Type column in Design view

\section*{To change data type from the Ribbon:}

Click the field header, then select the data type you want from the drop-down menu next to the Date Type command.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_14_b4e950dbd66c79507867g-27.jpg?height=391&width=1191&top_left_y=1488&top_left_x=178)

\section*{To change data type in Design view:}

Click the field name, then press the Tab key on your keyboard. From the drop-down menu under the Data Type column, select the format you want.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_14_b4e950dbd66c79507867g-28.jpg?height=725&width=1196&top_left_y=243&top_left_x=176)

The data type is more noticeable when the database is being populated with records. It will cause data to be formatted for currency, text, number, and date and time just like it does in Micros oft Excel.

\section*{Challenge!}

Open Access 2007 and build your own database. Then do the following:
- Give Table1 a new name.
- Add a new table.
- Add fields to a table.
- Set the data type for a field in a table.
- Open and close the tables.
- Move a field in a table.
- Delete a field in a table.

\section*{Building Table Relationships}

\section*{Introduction}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_14_b4e950dbd66c79507867g-28.jpg?height=272&width=532&top_left_y=1872&top_left_x=181)

By now, you've set up the tables you need for your database and have created fields for the different tables. Relationships provide Access 2007 with the means to bring this information together for you when you need it.

This less on explains how to establish relationships between the tables in an Access 2007 database. You will learn how to read and manipulate the relationship map. You will also learn about primary
and foreign keys, relationship types, and referential integrity.

\section*{Building table relationships}

\section*{To establish a relationship between tables:}
- Click the Relationships command in the Show/Hide group on the Database Tools tab in the Ribbon

NOTE: Tables must be closed in order to establish relationships.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_14_b4e950dbd66c79507867g-29.jpg?height=391&width=1317&top_left_y=758&top_left_x=305)
- When the Show Table dialog box appears:
- Select each table name, then click Add for the tables you want to relate.
o When you're done, close the Show Table dialog box.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_14_b4e950dbd66c79507867g-29.jpg?height=624&width=665&top_left_y=1382&top_left_x=306)
- You should now see a relationship map that contains all of the tables that were selected.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_14_b4e950dbd66c79507867g-30.jpg?height=671&width=1313&top_left_y=246&top_left_x=306)

\section*{To move a table that appears in the relationship map:}
- Place your mouse over the table you want to move.
- Hold down the left mouse button, then drag the table to a new location.
- Release the mouse button to drop the table in its new place.

\section*{Understanding the relationship map}

The relationship map lists all of the tables that were selected to relate, as well as all of the fields that were previously set up for that table. Notice that the first field has a key icon next to it. This is the primary key for the table.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_14_b4e950dbd66c79507867g-30.jpg?height=318&width=1259&top_left_y=1626&top_left_x=189)

\section*{Primary and foreign keys}

A primary key is the first field in each table of the database. You may recall that this field autonumbers by default, so every record in the table has its own unique number to identify it. Access uses this number to quickly pull information together when you run queries or reports, which are covered later.

In the example above, the primary key for the Customers table is Customer ID, the primary key for the Orders table is Order ID, and the primary key for the Books table is Book ID.

A foreign key is a field that is the primary field in its own table but that shows up in another table. If
you look closely at the Orders table, the fields Customer ID and Book ID appear there, as well as in their own respective tables. These fields are the primary key in their own tables, but in the Orders table, they are considered foreign keys.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_14_b4e950dbd66c79507867g-31.jpg?height=327&width=1280&top_left_y=422&top_left_x=181)

\section*{Relating tables}

There are a few ways to establish relationships between tables:
- Using the Edit Relationships command located on the Design tab of the Ribbon
- Using the drag-and-drop method

Both methods give you the same end result, but the drag-and-drop method is much easier and saves you several steps.

\section*{To relate tables with the drag-and-drop method:}
- Select a field name from one table by holding down the left mouse button.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_14_b4e950dbd66c79507867g-31.jpg?height=673&width=1315&top_left_y=1542&top_left_x=306)
- Drag the field name from one table to the other table in the desired relationship.
- Drop the first field name onto the field name you want to relate by releasing the left mouse button.

In the example above, we selected the Book ID field from the Books table and dragged and dropped it on the Book ID field in the Orders table.
- The Edit Relationships dialog box appears.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_14_b4e950dbd66c79507867g-32.jpg?height=690&width=1372&top_left_y=490&top_left_x=333)
- Select the Enforce Referential Integrity option. This option is explained in detail below.
- Click Create.

\section*{Understanding types of relationships}

Access 2007 allows for several different types of relationships. These include:
- One-to-One
- One-to-Many
- Many-to-Many

The relationship type you will come across most frequently-and the one created in our bookstore scenario-is the One-to-Many relationship.

\section*{One-to-Many}

The One-to-Many relationship means data for that field will show up a single time in one table but many times in the related table.

For example, let's look at one of the book titles in our bookstore. The Book ID for the book should appear only once in the Books table because this table lists every title stocked in the store. But it will probably appear many times in the Orders table because we hope it gets ordered by many people many times.

The symbols for the One-to-Many relationship look like this:
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_14_b4e950dbd66c79507867g-33.jpg?height=529&width=1324&top_left_y=241&top_left_x=178)

\section*{Enforcing referential integrity}

In the Edit Relationships dialog box, an option to Enforce Referential Integrity appears.
You should click Enforce Referential Integrity to make sure you never have an order for a book that doesn't appear in the Books table. Selecting this option tells Access to check for these things when someone is working with your data records.

\section*{Editing existing relationships}

Access 2007 allows you to edit relationships that already exist. This can be done using the Edit Relationships command on the Ribbon However, a much simpler way is to simply double-click the link that appears in the relationship map. Either method brings up the Edit Relationships dialog box, where you can change your settings.

\section*{Challenge!}

If you haven't already done so, save the sample Ready2Read database to your computer.
- Open the database, and establish a relationship between the Books table and the Orders table using the drag-and-drop method.
- Establish a relationship between the Customers table and the Orders table using the Edit Relationships command on the Ribbon.
- Edit an established relationship by double-clicking the link.
- Explore the options and settings in the Edit Relationships dialog box.
- Move the tables around in the relationship map.

Access 2007 databases hold the actual data records inside tables. You can add, edit, and delete records directly from these tables. This less on will show you how to work in the tables to add new records, as well as how to edit existing records using commands like copy and paste and find and replace. It will also discuss the dangers involved in deleting records from a table, as well as the importance of setting validation rules and other field properties to ensure data is valid.

\section*{Adding and editing data in tables}

\section*{Adding records to tables}

When you enter records into your table, you are populating the database. In Access 2007, you can do this a few different ways.

\section*{To add records in the new record row:}
- Click the record row with the asterisk that appears at the bottom of the table.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_14_b4e950dbd66c79507867g-35.jpg?height=346&width=1324&top_left_y=243&top_left_x=308)
- Type the data into the appropriate fields.
- Hit Enter or the Tab key to move to the next field.

\section*{To add records with the New Record navigation button:}
- Click the New Record button in the navigation bar. The navigation bar is located in the bottom-left comer of the open object pane.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_14_b4e950dbd66c79507867g-35.jpg?height=304&width=1159&top_left_y=1008&top_left_x=308)
- Type data into the appropriate fields.
- Hit Enter or the Tab key to move to the next field.

\section*{To add records with the New Record command:}
- Click the New Record command in the Records group in the Ribbon.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_14_b4e950dbd66c79507867g-35.jpg?height=319&width=1318&top_left_y=1685&top_left_x=306)
- Type the data into the appropriate fields.
- Hit the Enter or the Tab key to move to the next field.

\section*{Editing records in tables}

Sometimes it is necessary to edit records in the database. Like with every other task in Access 2007, this can be done several different ways.

\section*{To edit a record directly:}
- Scroll through the records, or use the navigation buttons on the navigation bar to find the record to edit.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_14_b4e950dbd66c79507867g-36.jpg?height=288&width=662&top_left_y=477&top_left_x=303)
- Click the cell containing the information that must be edited. A pencil icon appears to indicate edit mode.

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|l|l|l|l|}
\hline $1^{*}$ & 8 Cynthia & Love & 7825 Venice Ct & Topeka & KS & 21117 & topv@email.cc \\
\hline & 9 Jerrod & Smith & 211 St. George & Austin & TX & 21118 & texj@email.co \\
\hline & 10 Cody & Hayes & 65 North St. & Richmond & VA & 21119 & richhi@email.c \\
\hline 0 . & 11 Alleigh & Gibson & 5 West St. & Smithfield & NC & 21110 & alg@email \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
- Type the new information into the field.
- Click outside of the record row to apply the change.

\section*{To edit a record using Find and Replace:}
- Click the Find command in the Find group on the Ribbon.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_14_b4e950dbd66c79507867g-36.jpg?height=397&width=1578&top_left_y=1485&top_left_x=306)
- The Find and Replace dialog box opens.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_14_b4e950dbd66c79507867g-36.jpg?height=448&width=1050&top_left_y=2022&top_left_x=306)
- Tell Access what to find by typing it into the Find What: area.
- Type the replace term in the Replace With: area.
- Tell Access where to look with the Look In: drop-down list. The first choice in the drop-down list is the field you were last in within the table.
- Tell Access what to Match: Any part of the field, the whole field, or just the start of the field.
- Tell Access how to Search: Up finds records above the curs or, Down finds records below the curs or, and All searches all records.
- Click one of the action options:
o Find Next will find the next instance of the word in the table.
- Replace will put the new word into the table, overwriting what is currently there.
- Cancel stops the editing process.

CAUTION: DO NOT use Replace All because it will overwrite every instance of the Find term in the table, which can have a serious impact on your data.

\section*{To copy and paste a record:}
- Select the record you want to copy. Right-click, then select Copy.
- Select the new record row. Right-click and select Paste. The record information appears with a new record ID number.

\section*{To delete a record:}
- Select the record you want to delete, then right-click and select Delete Record.
- A dialog box appears, telling you the action cannot be undone and asking if you are sure you want to delete the record.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_14_b4e950dbd66c79507867g-37.jpg?height=356&width=1036&top_left_y=1474&top_left_x=184)

There may be other records that rely on the record you are trying to delete. DO NOT delete a record without knowing how it will impact the rest of your database.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_14_b4e950dbd66c79507867g-38.jpg?height=855&width=1397&top_left_y=243&top_left_x=184)

When you delete a record, the record number is permanently deleted from the database table. If you delete the last record from a table and then add a new record, your new record numbers will appear to be out of sequence.

\section*{Data validation}

Data validation is an important database concept. It is the process by which Access tests the data that is being entered into the database to make sure it is in an acceptable-or valid-format.

Let's say one of your database users has entered an order date of January 4, 2008, in the month/date/year format as 01/04/2008. Another user has entered an order placed on that same date in the day/month/year format as 04/01/2008. If the database is tracking all sales for the month of J anuary 2008, it may not show both orders as placed in J anuary, even though both were placed on the same date.

Access 2007 allows you to set field properties and data validation rules to force the person entering data to follow a specific format.

\section*{Data types and validation rules}

Data validation begins when data types are set during the process of building tables and fields. For example, if a field data type had been set to Currency and a text value is entered in that table field during data entry, Access will not accept an invalid format and will display a validation error, like the one below.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_14_b4e950dbd66c79507867g-39.jpg?height=327&width=901&top_left_y=243&top_left_x=178)

Data validation is accomplished by setting data validation rules and other field properties for various fields.

\section*{To set data validation rules:}
- In Design view, highlight the field that requires a validation rule.
- In the Field Properties section at the bottom half of the window, set your validation rule using the Expression Builder. The Expression Builder offers common syntax to set up a data validation rule.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_14_b4e950dbd66c79507867g-39.jpg?height=1053&width=1449&top_left_y=1075&top_left_x=307)
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_14_b4e950dbd66c79507867g-40.jpg?height=747&width=1446&top_left_y=243&top_left_x=308)

Validation rules work most easily with numerical fields. Rules for text fields require you to enclose each acceptable value inside its own quotation marks, separating them with $\mathbf{O r}$, as seen above.

\section*{Validation text}

Validation text is a specialized error message you can set to have Access tell the user entering data the specific way you want that person to enter it.

To set the validation text, enter the error message exactly as you want it to appear to users in the row directly beneath the Validation Rule row in the Field Properties section of Design view. For the validation rule we set for Category, you'd set the validation text like this:

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline \multicolumn{3}{|c|}{Field Properties} \\
\hline \multicolumn{3}{|l|}{General Lookup} \\
\hline \multicolumn{2}{|l|}{Field Size 255} & \multirow{14}{*}{} \\
\hline Format & & \\
\hline Input Mask & & \\
\hline Caption & & \\
\hline Default Value & & \\
\hline Validation Rule & ="Fiction" Or "Non-Fiction" Or "Kids" Or "History" Or "Technology" Or "H & \\
\hline Validation Text & Must be Fiction, Non-Fiction, Kids, History, Technology, Home \& Gard & \\
\hline Required & No & \\
\hline Allow Zero Length & Yes & \\
\hline Indexed & No & \\
\hline Unicode Compression & Yes & \\
\hline IME Mode & No Control & \\
\hline IME Sentence Mode & None & \\
\hline Smart Tags & & \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

The image below shows the resulting error message users would see when the Category validation rule has been broken.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_14_b4e950dbd66c79507867g-41.jpg?height=234&width=996&top_left_y=246&top_left_x=184)

\section*{Using field properties to ensure data integrity}

Another way to ensure data integrity is by setting field properties such as Field Size, Format, and Required.
- Field Size can be set to hold a specific number of characters, up to as many as 255 for text fields. If you were using a text field to hold the two-letter state postal abbreviation, the field size could be set to 2 to ensure no one enters a full state name into this field.
- The Format field property can be set to display text or numbers in a standardized way. For example, text can be set to show as all uppercase, and numbers can be set to show scientific numbers, percentages, or decimals.
- Set the Required property to Yes if you want users entering data to be required to enter something in the field. Choose No if users are allowed to leave the field blank.

These are just some ways Access helps you ensure data being entered into your database is valid.

\section*{Challenge!}

If you haven't already done so, save the sample Ready2Read database to your computer.
- Open the database, and add records using the New Record navigation button.
- Add a record using the New Record command in the Ribbon.
- Edit a record using the Find and Replace command.
- Copy and paste a record in one of the tables.
- Set a validation rule and validation text for a field in one of your tables, then break the rule when entering data to read the resulting message.

\section*{Creating and Using Forms}

\section*{Introduction}

Another way to populate a database is with the use of forms. An Access 2007 form helps you know exactly what data to enter. In this lesson, we'll address the benefits of using forms with a database, and we'll show you how to set up a basic form for your Access 2007 database, as well as how to use the form to populate or edit data in the database. You'll als o learn how to enhance a basic form with a drop-down list.

\section*{Creating and using forms}

Why use forms?
In real life, a form is piece of paper you fill out so someone can collect and keep track of specific information about you. Only one record-your record-is captured with any given paper form.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_14_b4e950dbd66c79507867g-42.jpg?height=640&width=931&top_left_y=1271&top_left_x=178)

Access 2007 forms work in a similar way.
In previous lessons, you saw that you can populate a database by entering records into the tables themselves. If the database has hundreds of records and many fields to populate for any given record, a table can be overwhelming to a user entering data. An Access form lets you enter data one record at a time, without having to see the entire table.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_14_b4e950dbd66c79507867g-43.jpg?height=432&width=925&top_left_y=243&top_left_x=184)

An Access 2007 form also lets you know exactly what information to enter and can even tell you what that information should look like. Adding certain control components to a form-like a dropdown menu-can dramatically increase the integrity of the data that is held in a database.

A database owner wants to control the levels of access other database users have to the data; the fewer the amount of people who are interacting with the data, the lower the chances are of the data becoming compromised. Forms are one more way a database owner can limit the actions of other users. Form properties can be set so users can only enter records or just view records.

\section*{Creating a form}

Access 2007 has several automatic tools for creating forms. These tools are located in the Forms group on the Create tab in the Ribbon, as seen below:
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_14_b4e950dbd66c79507867g-43.jpg?height=240&width=1440&top_left_y=1455&top_left_x=184)

Access 2007 forms tools include:
- The Form command makes a basic form, showing a single record at a time.
- The Split Form command creates a form showing one record on top and includes the Datas heet view of the entire source table on the bottom.
- The Multiple Items command creates a form that shows all records at once, which looks similar to the source table in Datas heet view.
- The Form Wizard is hidden under the More Forms command. It walks you through the process of creating more customized forms.

\section*{To create a form using the Form command:}

The basic Form command is the one we suggest because it allows you to see just one record at a time. It also includes all of the fields in your source table for you, and you can modify the layout of the basic form to hide fields or add controls:
- Begin by highlighting the table you want to use as a source table.
- With the source table highlighted, select the Form command from the Forms command group in the Create tab on the Ribbon.
- The new form is created and opens in the object pane.

The newly created form has the same name as the source table by default. You can give the form a new name by saving the form. You will be prompted to give the form a name.

\section*{Using forms to enter data}

Populating a database is easy once you have a basic form in place. Record navigation works the same way for forms as it does for tables. The navigation bar is located in the bottom-left of the object pane. The navigation buttons work the same way as they do for tables. The picture below shows the navigation buttons for a form.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_14_b4e950dbd66c79507867g-44.jpg?height=1087&width=1394&top_left_y=1011&top_left_x=184)

\section*{To add a record using a form:}
- Navigate to a new record, either by using the New Record navigation button or by using the New command in the Records group on the Ribbon
- Add the new data.
- Save the record.

Your data must be entered using an acceptable format. The acceptable formats were established when the field properties were set.

Save by using either the Save command on the Ribbon or by progressing to another record using the New (Blank) Record navigation button. Moving to a new record saves the most recently entered record. However, it may be necessary to refresh the table in Datasheet view to see the newest record.

\section*{To edit records using a form:}

J ust like in a table, database users can edit records from a form using the Find and Replace command. This command works exactly the same way in a form as it does in a table.

\section*{Page 5}

\section*{Creating a drop-down list}

Using a drop-down list on a form can increase the integrity of the data in the database because drop -down lists force form users to select one of the preset options in the list to populate the field. These types of form controls are relatively easy to set up using the Combo Box

\section*{To create a drop-down list using a Combo Box control:}
- With the form opened in Design view, select the Combo Box command in the Controls group on the Design tab in the Ribbon.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_14_b4e950dbd66c79507867g-45.jpg?height=416&width=1576&top_left_y=1452&top_left_x=308)
- Drag and drop the combo box sizing tool to create the combo box where you want it to be on the form.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_14_b4e950dbd66c79507867g-46.jpg?height=750&width=1448&top_left_y=243&top_left_x=306)
- The Combo Box Wizard appears.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_14_b4e950dbd66c79507867g-46.jpg?height=651&width=925&top_left_y=1138&top_left_x=306)
- Choose the desired option from the wizard, and click Next.
- Because the middle option was selected in the example above, the wizard progresses to the next step, which asks for the values to be typed into a small table.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_14_b4e950dbd66c79507867g-47.jpg?height=928&width=1323&top_left_y=243&top_left_x=306)
- Next, the wizard asks what to do with the entered values. Access can either remember the values for later use, or it can populate a field with the entered values. Use the drop-down list to select which field Access should use to store the values.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_14_b4e950dbd66c79507867g-47.jpg?height=657&width=925&top_left_y=1398&top_left_x=306)
- Once the desired option has been selected, click Next.
- Finally, the wizard gives the combo box a generic name, which can be meaningful to you later if there's ever a need to adjust the properties of this or another combo box. If you want, give the combo box a name, then click Finish.

Whatever name is entered will appear as a label on the form. This label can be deleted if you want.
Switch to Form view to see how the combo box works. The Category drop-down list appears on the

Books form, as seen in the image below.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_14_b4e950dbd66c79507867g-48.jpg?height=841&width=1448&top_left_y=333&top_left_x=181)

\section*{Making Forms More Usable with Controls}

\section*{Introduction}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_14_b4e950dbd66c79507867g-49.jpg?height=375&width=532&top_left_y=753&top_left_x=181)

You've already seen how a combo box control can make a form more user friendly. In Access 2007, there are several additional ways you can modify forms to make them easier to use while also increasing the integrity of the database. In this less on, we'll explain how to use form properties to limit the actions your form users can take. We'll also walk you through hiding fields on a form and adding command buttons to the form.

\section*{Page 2}

\section*{Making forms more useable}

You already know that forms can help you increase the integrity of your data by limiting what you see and how you can enter data. You saw that using a drop-down list can make data entry easy. Now it's time to think about the design of your forms from a form user's perspective.

Let's look at the Orders form in our bookstore scenario. The basic form, which was created with the Form command, looks like this:
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_14_b4e950dbd66c79507867g-50.jpg?height=595&width=1448&top_left_y=243&top_left_x=181)

This form is where we would want our user-the store employee-to pair a customer with a book to complete an order. Let's look at the form from the user's point of view.
- The employee would be adding new orders, not editing existing ones, so we'll set form properties to limit this action.
- The user will also never need to enter the Order ID number because this is the number the database assigns each order record to differentiate it from other orders. We'll hide this field.
- The Customer ID field and the Book ID field are not too useful as they are because the employee would have to know each customer's ID number and every Book ID number to be able to enter the data in the format we need. We'll make these fields more useable by creating combo boxes that help users select the correct customer and book.
- Our user will not need to enter the Order Date because we want the database to autopopulate this field in the database using today's date. We'll set field properties to make this happen.

\section*{Page 3}

\section*{Setting form properties}

Access 2007 allows you to set several form properties. Form properties are options that are set in Design view on the Property Sheet, like the one shown below. These options control how the form looks, works, and interacts with the rest of the database.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_14_b4e950dbd66c79507867g-51.jpg?height=1053&width=1457&top_left_y=243&top_left_x=178)

\section*{To set form properties:}
- View the form in Design view.
- Select the Property Sheet command from the Tools group on the Ribbon, as seen above.

Note: The form Property Sheet is als o accessible by right-clicking anywhere on the form in Design view and selecting Properties from the menu.
- When the property sheet opens:
- Make sure Form is selected in the Selection type drop-down list.
- Set the desired form properties.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_14_b4e950dbd66c79507867g-52.jpg?height=790&width=1454&top_left_y=243&top_left_x=178)

Tip: Use the tabs to find the specific property you want to set. Use the help available to you in the bottom-left corner of the Access window to know what each property setting does.

\section*{Page 4}

\section*{Hiding fields on a form}

There will be times when a field will not be needed on a form. Access 2007 allows you to hide fields by setting the Visible field property in Design view.

\section*{To hide a field on a form:}
- In Design view, open the Property Sheet.
- Change the Visible property setting to No, as seen below.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_14_b4e950dbd66c79507867g-52.jpg?height=691&width=1056&top_left_y=1780&top_left_x=307)
- Switch to Form view to verify that the field is hidden.

\section*{Page 5}

\section*{Creating combo boxes}

For the New Orders form in our bookstore example, we created user-friendly drop-down lists using the Combo Box command. These drop-down lists help our users identify a specific customer and specific book using more useful information than the Customer ID and Book ID numbers, as seen below.

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|l|l|l|}
\hline \multicolumn{7}{|c|}{New Orders} \\
\hline \multicolumn{7}{|c|}{Orders} \\
\hline \multirow[t]{18}{*}{9} & & & & & & \\

\hline
\end{tabular}

\section*{Setting field properties}

Sometimes it may be necessary to set field properties from the form itself. For example, on the New Orders form for our bookstore shown below, we want to set up the Order Date field to auto-fill with the current date each time an order is entered. This way, our employees will not have to worry about entering a date on the form because the form will do it for them.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_14_b4e950dbd66c79507867g-54.jpg?height=855&width=1185&top_left_y=246&top_left_x=184}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{To set field properties from a form in Design view:}
\end{figure}
- Highlight the appropriate field on the form.
- Open the Property Sheet.
- Verify that the Field Name appears in the Selection type drop-down list.
- Set the desired field property.

In our example, we want to set the Order Date field to auto-fill with the current date. Refer to the picture below. Notice that we have the Order Date field highlighted on the form itself. On the Property Sheet, we have Order Date showing in the Selection type drop-down list.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_14_b4e950dbd66c79507867g-55.jpg?height=858&width=1194&top_left_y=243&top_left_x=178)

Because we want the Order Date to auto-fill, we must set the default value to always enter the current date.

To set a field to auto-fill with the current date:
- Open the Data tab on the field's Property Sheet.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_14_b4e950dbd66c79507867g-55.jpg?height=953&width=1315&top_left_y=1479&top_left_x=306)
- Set the Default Value property by clicking on the Expression Builder button.
- Use Expression Builder to enter the expression for the current date. It looks like the image below.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_14_b4e950dbd66c79507867g-56.jpg?height=861&width=1177&top_left_y=422&top_left_x=306)

The Expression Builder contains many commonly used expressions for database functions. Explore them by clicking the various files in the lefthand column.

\section*{Page 7}

\section*{Creating command buttons}

Another way to make a form more user friendly is by adding command buttons to the form. Command buttons are a quick way for form users to take a specific action. These command buttons are grouped into categories of actions, including:
- Record Navigation command buttons, which easily allow users to move among the records in your database
- Record Operation command buttons, which let us ers do things like save and print records
- Form Operation command buttons, which let users quickly open or close a form, print the current form, and perform other actions
- Report Operation command buttons, which offer users a quick way to do things such as preview or mail a report

\section*{To add a command button to a form:}
- Click the Button command in the Controls group on the Ribbon.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_14_b4e950dbd66c79507867g-57.jpg?height=216&width=1448&top_left_y=243&top_left_x=306)
- When the Command Button Wizard opens:
- Select the type of command you want from the Categories list.
- Select the specific action you want the command button to perform from the Actions list.
o Click Next.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_14_b4e950dbd66c79507867g-57.jpg?height=616&width=925&top_left_y=780&top_left_x=433)
- In the next wizard step:
o If you want text to appear on the button, enter it in the Text box.
o If you want a picture to appear on the button, select one using the Browse button.
o Click Next.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_14_b4e950dbd66c79507867g-57.jpg?height=611&width=925&top_left_y=1672&top_left_x=433)
- In the next wizard step:
o Give the button a meaningful name. Note: Access will give your button a default name. Renaming it with a more useful name may help later if you have several
buttons on a form and want to change the properties of one.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_14_b4e950dbd66c79507867g-58.jpg?height=610&width=923&top_left_y=336&top_left_x=433)

\section*{Click Finish}

The command button should be operational and appear on the form in Form view.

\section*{Page 8}

\section*{Challenge!}

If you haven't already done so, save the sample Ready2Read database to your computer.
- Open the Orders Form, and change the form properties so it limits users to adding records only.
- Hide the Order ID and Order Date fields.
- Set the Order Date field property to have a Default Value of the current date.
- Create drop-down lists for the Customer ID and Book ID fields, making sure they contain helpful information for users and correctly populate the database with ID numbers.
- Add a command button to the form.

\section*{Making Forms Attractive}

\section*{Introduction}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_14_b4e950dbd66c79507867g-58.jpg?height=383&width=537&top_left_y=2065&top_left_x=184)

Now that you know how to make forms work better, it's time to think about what a form looks like. In this lesson, we'll address the various ways to modify a form layout,
including how to add a logo and apply an Auto Format to the form. We'll also cover using and formatting titles, as well as moving and applying borders to objects.

\section*{Page 2}

\section*{Making forms more attractive}

\section*{Making forms more attractive}

Because others will be using the forms in your database to enter data, you may want to make the forms more vis ually appealing. These types of changes are done to the form in Layout view.

In Layout view, you see the form as it will appear to the user in Form view, so it's us eful for setting the size of controls and other objects on the form, as well as for changing the font, colors, and borders on the form.

\section*{To switch to Layout view:}

There are three ways you can open the form in Layout view.
- Right-click the Form tab or the form name in the object list, then select Layout View from the list.
- Select Layout aView in the Views group on the Ribbon.
- Click the Layout viewicon in the bottom-right corner of the Access 2007 window.

\section*{Page 3}

\section*{Adding a logo}

Access 2007 automatically puts a form icon, like the one below, in the header area of every form you create.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_14_b4e950dbd66c79507867g-59.jpg?height=564&width=1123&top_left_y=1919&top_left_x=184)

One way to customize the look of your forms is to remove the icon and replace it with a logo. This is easy to do using the Logo command.

\section*{To replace the icon with a logo:}
- Delete the form icon.
- Select the Logo command from the Controls group on the Ribbon.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_14_b4e950dbd66c79507867g-60.jpg?height=508&width=1448&top_left_y=617&top_left_x=306)
- Use the Insert Picture dialog box to locate the picture file you want to use as the logo, then click OK The newlogo should appear.

You can move and resize the logo as well. Moving and resizing objects on a form is covered later in this less on.

\section*{Page 4}

\section*{Applying a style with AutoFormat}

Another simple way to dramatically change the way your form looks is to apply a style with the AutoFormat command. You could modify the color for each part of the form on your own, but Access has already combined colors in several attractive styles. These styles are available under the AutoFormat command.

\section*{To apply an AutoFormat:}
- Click the AutoFormat command on the Ribbon.
- Select the desired format. The change will appear when the mouse button is released.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_14_b4e950dbd66c79507867g-61.jpg?height=693&width=1454&top_left_y=243&top_left_x=178)

\section*{Page 5}

\section*{Working with titles}

One of the easiest things to change on the form is the title, which appears in the form header with the icon or logo.

\section*{To change the form title:}
- Click the Title command in the Controls group on the Ribbon.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_14_b4e950dbd66c79507867g-61.jpg?height=611&width=1445&top_left_y=1458&top_left_x=306)
- When the title highlight appears, type the new title, then hit the Enter key on your keyboard.

Note: The title does not affect the name of the form, and vice versa.

\section*{Changing text on the form}

Access, like all Microsoft Office 2007 products, allows you to change the font style, text size, text color, and alignment. It also lets you apply bold, italics, or underline to the text. All of this is done
from the Ribbon, as seen in the diagram below.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_14_b4e950dbd66c79507867g-62.jpg?height=797&width=1709&top_left_y=336&top_left_x=181)

\section*{To modify text:}
- Highlight the text.
- Apply the desired format by doing one or more of the following:
o Select the desired font style from the font face drop-down list.
- Set the size of the text using the font size selection list.
- Choose a color for the text using the font color selector.
- Apply either the bold, italics, or underline s tyle.

Additional text formatting options are available in the Font group. The above list includes the most common text modifications.

\section*{Page 6}

\section*{Working with objects on a form}

Other ways to modify the way a form looks in Access 2007 include resizing and repositioning the objects that appear on the form, and applying borders to objects on the form. All of these tasks are easily done in Layout view.

\section*{To move objects on a form:}
- Highlight the object by clicking it.
- Move the object by dragging and dropping it in a new location.

\section*{To resize objects on a form:}
- Highlight the object by clicking it.
- When the crosshair cursor appears, hold down the left mouse button and drag the edge to the preferred size.
- Release the mouse button to apply the change.

\section*{To apply a border to objects on a form:}
- Highlight the object by clicking it.
- Select a width using the Line Width command.
- Select a style using the Line Style command.
- Select a color using the Line Color command.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_14_b4e950dbd66c79507867g-63.jpg?height=653&width=1451&top_left_y=746&top_left_x=180)

\section*{Page 7}

\section*{Challenge!}

If you haven't already done so, save the sample Ready2Read database to your computer.
- Open the Orders Form in Layout view and change the form by:
o Adding a picture using the Logo command
- Giving the form a new title
- Modifying some text on the form
- Applying one of the AutoFormat options
o Moving or resizing an object on the form
o Applying a border to an object on the form

\section*{Analyzing and Reporting Data}

\section*{Sorting Records}

\section*{Introduction}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_14_b4e950dbd66c79507867g-64.jpg?height=617&width=484&top_left_y=243&top_left_x=178)

Once a database is populated, it's time to think about how to look at-or analyze-the data. One basic way to analyze data is to sort it. Sorting data is easy with Access 2007. In this lesson, we'll show you how to sort text-based and numerical data using common sorting commands, as well as how to clear sorts.

Page 2

\section*{Sorting records}

Watch the video! ( $3: 34 \mathrm{~min}$ )
Download the example to work along with the video.

\section*{Sorting records}

Sorting is probably the simplest way to look at data because it keeps similar things together. In our books tore database, for example, we could sort our data a few ways:
- We could sort orders based on the order date.
- We could sort customers by the state in which they live or by their zip codes.
- We could sort our books by author, category, or price.

Access 2007 allows you to sort the records in your database tables based on a field or value that is either text-like an author's last name-or numerical-like a customer's zip code or a book's price. Depending on the type of value, Access offers different sorting options.

\section*{Page 3}

\section*{Sorting on text values}

When Access 2007 sorts on a text value, it offers the two options described in the table below:

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline Sort Option & Also Called & Description \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline A to $Z$ & Ascending & Values closest to $A$ are displayed first \\
\hline$Z$ to $A$ & Descending & Values closest to $Z$ are displayed first \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

To sort based on a text value:
- Click the drop-down arrow at the top of the field you want to sort.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_14_b4e950dbd66c79507867g-65.jpg?height=676&width=627&top_left_y=688&top_left_x=303)
- When the menu appears, select either the Sort A to Z or the Sort Z to A option.
o With A to Z, the records will be sorted based on the chosen field's value with the value closest to A at the top of the table, as seen below.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_14_b4e950dbd66c79507867g-65.jpg?height=792&width=1329&top_left_y=1591&top_left_x=425)
o With Z to A, the records will be sorted the using the chosen field's value with the value
closest to Z at the top of the table．
The sort command section in the Sort group on the Ribbon is another way to begin a sort．

\section*{Page 4}

\section*{Sorting on numerical values}

Access 2007 also offers two options when sorting based on a numerical value．These options are described in the table below：

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline Sort Option & Also Called & Description \\
\hline Smallest to Largest & Ascending & Values closest to 1 are displayed first \\
\hline Largest to Smallest & Descending & \begin{tabular}{l} 
Values farthest from 1 are displayed \\
first
\end{tabular} \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

To sort based on a numerical value：
－Click the drop－down arrow at the top of the field you want to sort．

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline \multicolumn{3}{|c|}{y－Price－Add New Fieh－} \\

Another us eful way to look at-or analyze-the data in a database is by filtering it. Filtering groups your data together based on one or more criteria for a given field, then displays only the records that contain those specified values and criteria. Filtering data is easy with Access 2007. In this lesson, we'll show you how to filter records using common filter commands. You'll als o learn how to use the toggle button to switch between filtered and unfiltered results, as well as how to perform advanced filters and save the filtered results.

\section*{Filtering records}

When you tell Access 2007 to filter your records, you are asking it to:
- Search all of the records in one table
- Find every record in that table that meets the criteria you set
- Display the results for you in the table by hiding records that do not meet the criteria

You can filter data using what Microsoft calls the Filter by Field and Filter by Selection methods. Additionally, Access 2007 can perform an Advanced Filter, which is essentially a small query that is run on only one table. These options are described in the table below.

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline Method & Description \\
\hline Filter by Field & \begin{tabular}{l} 
Lists all of the values that have been entered in a specified \\
field so you can choose which value or values you want \\
Access to find
\end{tabular} \\
\hline Filter by Selection & Offers the ability to search records based on the value that \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline & \begin{tabular}{l}
is currently selected in a table; you can ask it to find records that: \\
- Equal the value \\
- Do not equal the value \\
- Contain the value \\
- Do not contain the value
\end{tabular} \\
\hline Advanced Filter & Narrows filtered results further by performing additional filters or sorts \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Page 3}
\end{table}

\section*{Filtering by field}

When you Filter by Field, Access 2007 finds all of the values that have been entered in the specified field. Access lists all of these values for you so you can choose which value or values you want Access to find for you within that field. Once you choose which value to filter by, Access returns the results to you as a subset of records in the table.

\section*{To use the Filter by Field feature:}
- Highlight the column for the field you want to use as a filter. In the example below, we are filtering using the State field.
- In the Sort \& Filter group on the Ribbon, click the Filter command (it looks like a funnel).
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_14_b4e950dbd66c79507867g-69.jpg?height=841&width=1454&top_left_y=1466&top_left_x=306)
- When the dialog box appears, select the value you want to use as the filter value:
o Checking Select All will return every record in the table. However, clicking this option when all values are checked will clear the selections.
o Checking Blank will find only records in which the field is empty.
o Check as many of the values as you want to see returned in your results.
- Click OK
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_14_b4e950dbd66c79507867g-70.jpg?height=1047&width=1451&top_left_y=425&top_left_x=181)

The results will appear in the table. In the example above, the results are showing all records for customers living in North Carolina (NC). Notice that all other records are hidden from view but that the table name is still Customers.

\section*{To toggle between filtered and unfiltered results:}

As with most actions in Access, you can toggle between your filtered results and unfiltered tables in a variety of ways:
- Use the label that appears in the navigation bar, as seen above
- Use the Toggle Filter button on the Ribbon

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_14_b4e950dbd66c79507867g-70.jpg?height=239&width=1704&top_left_y=2084&top_left_x=308}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Page 4}
\end{figure}

\section*{Filtering by selection}

When you Filter by Selection, Access 2007 returns the results to you as a subset of records in the table. It assumes that your current selection is what you want to use as your filter value, or criteria.

\section*{To use the Filter by Selection feature:}
- Place your curs or in the cell that contains the value you want to use as your filter value.
- Click the Selection command in the Sort \& Filter group on the Ribbon.
- When the list appears, choose one of the options:
o Equals will return all records that have exactly the same value as your selected value. In the example below, this option would return records for the City of Raleigh only.
- Does Not Equal will return every record that does not have the same value as your selected value. In the example below, this option would return all records except for the ones with Raleigh as a city.
o Contains will return every value that has your selected value somewhere in it. In the example below, choosing Contains would return records with a City value of Raleigh, Caraleigh, or Raleighville.
- Does Not Contain will not return records with the selected value anywhere within the search field. In the example below, clicking Does Not Contain would return all records except for records that have Raleigh in the city name-Raleigh, North Raleigh, and Raleighville, for example, would not show up in the results.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_14_b4e950dbd66c79507867g-71.jpg?height=662&width=1717&top_left_y=1282&top_left_x=178)

\section*{Sorting or filtering the filtered results}

Access 2007 lets you narrow the filtered results further by applying another level of sorting or filtering. To do this:
- In the table showing your filtered results, select the field or value you want to use as the basis for a deeper sort or filter.
- Apply the additional filter or sort.

Another way to do this is to use the Advanced Filter command.

\section*{Page 5}

\section*{Using advanced filters}

An Advanced Filter is similar to a multilevel sort in Micros oft Excel. An Advanced Filter can help you further narrow your records. This is like running a miniature query on only one table. It uses a screen that's similar to the query design screen, and it can even save your results as a query so you can use them again later.

\section*{To apply an Advanced Filter:}
o Click the Advanced command in the Sort \& Filter group on the Ribbon.
- From the menu that opens, select the Advanced Filter/ Sort option.
- The design screen will open so you can set up your filter criteria and/or sorting order for the various fields in the table.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_14_b4e950dbd66c79507867g-72.jpg?height=1031&width=1584&top_left_y=981&top_left_x=428)
o To sort or filter another field, drag the field name from the table at the top of the screen to the design portion of the screen in the bottom half of the window. Then:
- To sort the new field:
- Click in the Sort cell for the field.
- Choose the sort option you want to use from the drop-down list that appears.
- To filter the new field:
- Click in the Criteria cell for the field.
- Enter your criteria by directly typing it into the cell. Access will put
quotation marks around your criteria, showing that it is searching for that exact value.

Important: Access will perform the sorts left to right, according to the way they are displayed on the Advanced Filter design screen. Once all of the sorts are complete, Access will perform filter functions. Similar to sorts, Access filters from left to right based on the order displayed on the Advanced Filter design s creen.

To view the results, click the Toggle Filter button on the Ribbon.
Your filtered results will appear in a new table. You can save the advanced filter so you can run it again later if you want.

\section*{To save the Advanced Filter:}
- Right-click the Advanced Filter design tab.
- Select Save.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_14_b4e950dbd66c79507867g-73.jpg?height=744&width=1446&top_left_y=1070&top_left_x=308)
- If the Save as Query dialog box comes up, you must give the advanced filter a name. This dialog box will only appear the first time you save.

Access 2007 saves Advanced Filters as queries because they are simple queries run on only one table.

\section*{Page 6}

If you haven't already done so, save the sample Ready2Read database to your computer.
- Use the Filter by Field method to filter the Customers table to find all cus tomers from NC.
- Use the Filter by Selection method to filter the Customers table, looking for all NC customers NOT in Raleigh.
Hint: Use the Does Not Equal option.
- Practice toggling between the filtered results and the unfiltered tables.

\section*{Using Queries to Make Data Meaningful- Part 1}

\section*{Introduction}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_14_b4e950dbd66c79507867g-74.jpg?height=304&width=408&top_left_y=1065&top_left_x=246)

The real power of an Access 2007 database lies in its ability to pull data for quick analysis, which is what happens when you run a query. Queries allow you to retrieve information from one or more tables based on a set of search conditions you define. Access 2007 will display your results in their own table, which you can then further analyze and manipulate. In this lesson, we'll explain how to plan a query using a three-question planning process. You'll also learn how to use the Query Design command to run a query, as well as how to modify the query to hide fields or other information in your query results. Finally, you'll learn how to save the query for later use.

\section*{Page 2}

\section*{Using queries: Part 1}

\section*{Using queries}

Queries retrieve information from one or more tables based on a set of search conditions you set up and then combine that information in a way that's easy for you to analyze. If you've used an Advanced Filter in Access 2007, then you've already run a basic query on only one table. If you want
to pull data from more than one table, though, you'll need to use either the Query Design command or the Query Wizard.

Before using the Access 2007 query tools, it's important to plan out the query using a logical process. Otherwise, you may not get the results you expect.

\section*{Page 3}

\section*{Planning a query}

There are three questions you need to answer when planning a query:
- What do you want the results to look like? Identify every bit of information-or field-you want included in the results.
- Where is the information stored in the database? List which tables-and/or queries-hold the information you want to see.
- What conditions do you want the data to meet? This helps determine how to set the criteria so Access can search the records properly.

\section*{Planning: Which customers ordered technology books?}

Let's think about this process for our bookstore database scenario. We have a new technology series coming out soon, and we want to send coupons to customers who have ordered technology books from us in the past. A query can help us answer the question, Which customers have ordered technology books from us already? Let's use the three-question process to plan this query.
- What fields do we want to see in the results? We need a list of customer names and addresses in order to mail the coupons to our customers, so we'll need the results to show the categories below:

> First Name
> Last Name
> Street
> City
> State
> Zip Code
- In which tables is the information stored? For this query, we'll need:
o The Customers table to get customers' names and addresses
- The Books table to know which books are technology books
o The Orders table to know which customers ordered those books
- What is the condition we want the data to meet? We want Access to look for only the books where the book's category is technology.

\section*{Using the Query Design command}

Once you've planned out your query, you can build and run it using Access 2007's query tools.

\section*{To build a query using the Query Design command:}
- Select the Query Design command from the Create tab on the Ribbon.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_14_b4e950dbd66c79507867g-76.jpg?height=328&width=1445&top_left_y=1404&top_left_x=306)
- Use the Show Table dialog box to select which tables and/or queries to include in the query. Our plan called for all three tables.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_14_b4e950dbd66c79507867g-77.jpg?height=844&width=1706&top_left_y=243&top_left_x=306)
- Drag and drop the fields you want to see in your results to the bottom portion of the query design screen.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_14_b4e950dbd66c79507867g-77.jpg?height=1177&width=1651&top_left_y=1279&top_left_x=306)
- Enter the condition in the Criteria row for the condition field. For our query, we typed Technology in the cell labeled Criteria for the Category field. As seen above, Access 2007 puts quotation marks around the term to show that it is looking for exactly that term within the designated field.
- Once the condition is set, click Run! in the Results group on the Ribbon.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_14_b4e950dbd66c79507867g-78.jpg?height=456&width=1727&top_left_y=558&top_left_x=306)
- View your results to determine if they match your desired results.

\section*{Page 5}

\section*{Hiding fields or other information in the results}

Sometimes the results of a query will include information that is seemingly unnecessary to you. Access 2007 allows you to easily hide these fields.

\section*{To hide part of the query result:}
- In the query design window, des elect the Show option by clicking it.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_14_b4e950dbd66c79507867g-79.jpg?height=1129&width=1584&top_left_y=243&top_left_x=306)
- When you run your results, the field you chose will be hidden, as seen below.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_14_b4e950dbd66c79507867g-79.jpg?height=527&width=1576&top_left_y=1517&top_left_x=306)

\section*{Page 6}

\section*{Saving the query}

Sometimes you will not need to save your results or your query design, and other times you may want to keep it to run again later or to modify it slightly. Saving a query is easy to do.

\section*{To save a query:}
- Right-click the Query tab.
- When the Save As dialog box opens, give your query a meaningful name.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_14_b4e950dbd66c79507867g-80.jpg?height=486&width=1574&top_left_y=482&top_left_x=308)
- Click OK
- The query will now be listed in the object list on the left side of the Access window.

\section*{Page 7}

If you haven't already done so, save the sample Ready2Read database to your computer.
- Plan a query to find out which customers order a certain category of books.
- Use the Query Design command to set up the query.

You already know how to plan and run a basic query. This les son will show you how to run a query that includes a Totals function to group and count the records in the results. It will also deal with ways to further sort and filter via your query design to further refine your results.

\section*{Page 2}

\section*{Using queries: Part 2}

Watch the video! ( $4: 45 \mathrm{~min}$ )
Download the example to work along with the video.

\section*{Using totals in a query}

Sometimes you may want to see your query results grouped or counted in some way. Access 2007 offers several options to make these functions possible. Perhaps the easiest of these is the Totals command, whose optional functions are similar to the functions used in Microsoft Excel. These functions include:
- Sum, which is used to add a column of numbers
- Average, which is used to find the average of a column of numbers
- Maximum, which returns the highest value in a field
- Minimum, which returns the lowest value in a field
- Count, which is used to count the number of same values in a query

One of the most useful totals functions to use in queries is the Count function.

\section*{Page 3}

\section*{Using Count and Group By functions in a query}

When you use the Totals command in a query, Access will automatically group every field by the values in each field. This means it will look for repeating values and group like values together so they appear as one record rather than as many records. This is called the Group By function.

Let's use our books tore database as an example. If we run a query to see the information for every book that has been ordered, we'd get a list that looks like this:

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|l|l|l|}
\hline \multicolumn{7}{|r|}{\begin{tabular}{l}

\section*{Sorting and filtering query results}

Once you have the results looking how you want them, you can sort and filter them to further narrow your results. This can be done using the methods of sorting and filtering covered in earlier lessons, or by applying a sort and filter in the query design its elf.

\section*{To sort via the query design:}
- Click the Sort row for the field you want to sort. A drop-down list will appear.

\begin{tabular}{r|l|}
\cline { 2 - 2 } Field: & Book ID \\
Table: & Orders \\
Total: & Count \\
Sort: & \\
Show: & Ascending \\
Criteria: & Descending \\
or: & (not sorted) \\
\cline { 2 - 2 } &
\end{tabular}
- Choose one of the options:
o Ascending will show the results sorted with the lowest numerical value or the text value closest to A first.
- Descending will show the results with the highest numerical value or the text value farthest from A first.
o (not sorted) will keep your records grouped but will not sort them.
- Click Run! to see the results.

\section*{To filter via the query design:}
- Click the Criteria row in the query design.
- Add your filter criteria by typing the value in the cell, as in the example below:

\section*{Using Reports to Make Data Meaningful to Others}

\section*{Introduction}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_14_b4e950dbd66c79507867g-85.jpg?height=364&width=529&top_left_y=2008&top_left_x=184)

Now that you know how to use queries to analyze the data in a database, it's time to find out how to create a report that will make the data meaningful to someone else. In this lesson, we'll show you how to create a report using the Report command, as well as how
to use grouping options and query limits to make the report easier to read and how to identify several report formatting and layout options that can be set in Layout view. Finally, you'll learn how to use Print Preview and save the report.

\section*{Page 2}

\section*{Using reports to make data meaningful to others}

As you know, queries make the data in a database meaningful to you Sometimes, though, you need to share that data with someone else. A report is an effective way to present your data using an attractive layout. The text can be formatted in an Access report similar to how it can be done in Word documents.

Access 2007 offers tools that allow you to create and format a report. The Report Wizard walks you through the steps of creating a report. The Report command, however, is much easier to use, and all of the formatting options are still available to you in Layout view once the report is created. With these tools, you can create a report based on a table or query.

\section*{Page 3}

\section*{Creating a report based on a table}

One of the easiest ways to create a report is by using a table as the source of the report. For example, in our books tore scenario we have a table that lists all of the books in our inventory. We want to create a Book Price List report that lists all of the details for each book in our store's inventory. The Report command makes this incredibly easy because it automatically includes every field in the source table in the report.

\section*{To create a report based on a table using the Report command:}
- Choose the table you want to use as the source of your report. To do this, you can either open the table or highlight the table name in the navigation pane. In our example, we used the open Books table to create the report.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_14_b4e950dbd66c79507867g-86.jpg?height=453&width=1706&top_left_y=1805&top_left_x=308)
- Select the Report command on the Create tab on the Ribbon, as seen above.
- The report is automatically generated and includes every field in the table in order of their appearance in the table. This can be seen in the example below, which was created from the table above.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_14_b4e950dbd66c79507867g-87.jpg?height=879&width=1589&top_left_y=241&top_left_x=176)

The layout and formatting of the report can be manipulated in Layout view.

\section*{Page 4}

\section*{Creating a report based on a query}

Access 2007 can also create a report using a query as the source. The process for creating a report based on a query is identical to the process for creating a report based on a table, which was outlined on the previous page. And just like when making a report from a table, every field and record that appears in the query results will appear on the report.

It's possible to limit the number of records in a report, but only if the report was based on a query. The limit is set in the query its elf, using the query design screen.

\section*{To limit the number of records in a report:}
- Open the query in Design view.
- Use the Return option in the Query Setup command group to set the number of records you want to see in the query results and in the final report.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_14_b4e950dbd66c79507867g-88.jpg?height=525&width=1708&top_left_y=243&top_left_x=306)
- Click Run! to make sure the query results look like you want the report to look.
- Create the report using the Report command on the Create tab.
- Format the report as desired.

\section*{Page 5}

\section*{Grouping items on a report}

Grouping items on a report can make it much more readable. Access 2007 offers a quick and easy way to add grouping to a report.

\section*{To add grouping to a report:}
- With the report open, select the Group \& Sort command from the Grouping \& Totals command group on the Format tab on the Ribbon.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_14_b4e950dbd66c79507867g-88.jpg?height=492&width=1578&top_left_y=1563&top_left_x=306)
- This opens a Group, Sort, and Total dialog box in the lower portion of the window.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_14_b4e950dbd66c79507867g-89.jpg?height=1142&width=1597&top_left_y=241&top_left_x=298)
- In the Group, Sort, and Total dialog box, select Add a group.
- Select the field you want to group by from the drop-down list. We chose to group our list by Category.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_14_b4e950dbd66c79507867g-89.jpg?height=573&width=1592&top_left_y=1604&top_left_x=295)
- When you release the mouse button, the report will now appear with items grouped. Our report is grouped on Category now, as seen below.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_14_b4e950dbd66c79507867g-90.jpg?height=1137&width=1582&top_left_y=243&top_left_x=178)

The Group, Sort, and Total dialog box will remain open until you close it.

\section*{Formatting a report in Layout view}

Access 2007 opens the created report in Layout view so you can easily make modifications. In Layout view, you can change the look of your report in many different ways, including:
- Deleting columns and other report elements
- Moving and resizing columns
- Adding a logo
- Changing the title and other text on the report headings
- Applying a report style with AutoFormat
- Modifying the page layout

\section*{To delete a column or other report element}
- Highlight the element by clicking it.
- Hit the Delete button on your keyboard.

\section*{To move a column or other report element:}
- Highlight the element by clicking it.
- Drag and drop the element to a new location on the report.

\section*{To resize a column or other report element:}
- Highlight the element by clicking it.
- Drag and drop the edge of the element to the new size on the report.

\section*{To add a logo to the report:}
- Click the Logo command on the Format tab on the Ribbon.

- When the highlight appears, type the new title.

\section*{To modify text in report headings:}

If you don't like the standard font face and size Access used to create your report, you can modify them using common Microsoft Office text formatting commands. You can modify the size, font face, font color, alignment, and much more. They all work basically the same way.
- Highlight the text you want to change.
- Select the formatting option you want from the lists that appear when you click a command.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_14_b4e950dbd66c79507867g-92.jpg?height=359&width=1574&top_left_y=1357&top_left_x=308)
- The change appears when you release the mouse button.

\section*{To apply an AutoFormat style:}

Like with forms, Access 2007 offers a variety of report styles in the AutoFormat command. To apply a style:
- Click the AutoFormat command on the Ribbon.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_14_b4e950dbd66c79507867g-93.jpg?height=744&width=1584&top_left_y=243&top_left_x=306)
- Select a format from the drop-down list. The change is applied instantly.

\section*{To change the page layout:}

When a report is created, it opens in Layout view, like the one in the picture below. The dotted lines are showing where the edge of the page will be in Report view.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_14_b4e950dbd66c79507867g-93.jpg?height=717&width=1579&top_left_y=1360&top_left_x=181)

\section*{To change the page layout options:}
- Switch to Print Preview using the Views command on the Ribbon.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_14_b4e950dbd66c79507867g-94.jpg?height=649&width=1056&top_left_y=243&top_left_x=308)

\section*{Saving a report}

When you have created and modified a report and try to close it, Access 2007 will prompt you to name and save the report. If you do not need this report again, you do not need to save it. However, if you think you may want to publish it again, it is best to save.

\section*{To save a report:}
- Right-click the Report tab.
- Choose Save from the list that appears.
- When the Save As dialog box opens, give the report a name.
