                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The planning of a health record department, whether for a new hospital or relocation within an existing hospital, should develop from the interaction of three people: the health record officer, the facility's planning coordinator and the architect.</p>
                        
                        <h4>The six phases</h4>
                        <p>The six phases determined by the architects which they believe should be observed when designing a new hospital department are as follows:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Definition phase</li>
                            <li>Brief phase</li>
                            <li>Department phase</li>
                            <li>Total facility phase</li>
                            <li>Process phase</li>
                            <li>Department design</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h4>DEFINITION PHASE</h4>
                        <p>When preparing for this first phase in the planning of a health record department, there are five major points to be considered. These are:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>location of the department</li>
                            <li>space requirements for records, personnel and for equipment</li>
                            <li>functional design and logical placement of key work areas</li>
                            <li>system of communication</li>
                            <li>system to be used to transport health records</li>
                        </ol>
                        
                        <h5>1. Location</h5>
                        <p>When determining location consideration must be given to the need for the department to be centrally located, adjacent to the Admission Office, the Accident and Emergency Department (A&E), and the Outpatient Department (OPD).</p>

                        <h5>2. Space</h5>
                        <p>When planning for space requirements for records, personnel and equipment, the health record administrator must consider factors like catchment population, hospital services proposed, number of beds, and projected number of discharges.</p>
                        
                        <h5>3. Functional design and logistical placement of key work areas</h5>
                        <p>When considering functional design and layout, a key consideration is work flow. Desks should be arranged so that paper moves in a straight line. The use of a movement diagram can assist with determining that furniture and equipment are placed effectively.</p>

                        <h5>4. System of communication</h5>
                        <p>During the definition stage, consideration must be given to the communication system to be used within the department and between the health record department and other departments or areas, such as telephones, intercoms, or computer terminals.</p>

                        <h5>5. Transport</h5>
                        <p>Consideration must be given to how the health records are to be transported both within the MRD and to other areas, such as using trolleys, a dumb waiter, or a pneumatic tube system.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h4>What is a form?</h4>
                        <p>It is a piece of paper or a card with a format, arrangement of questions or blank spaces for data entry.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Basic principles to consider while designing and developing forms</h4>
                        <p>A well designed form is appropriate to the work in which it is used for, permits easy entry, conveys information, clear instructions and it efficient to use.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Questions to ask before designing a form include:</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>What's the general purpose of the form?</li>
                            <li>Is the form really necessary?</li>
                            <li>What information is to be provided?</li>
                            <li>How is the form going to be filled?</li>
                            <li>Who will be users of the form?</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Technical specialties in form designing</h4>
                        <p>It is more of measurements used in designing forms to enhance standardization. Printers allow 5 mm before they start printing. Allow 20 mm margin for holes to be punched or the form to be bound. Spacing for handwriting should generally allow for characters to be 1 cm.</p>

                        <h4>Pretesting of medical/health records forms</h4>
                        <p>It is a way of measuring effectiveness of a given new/revised form or data collection tool before putting it in use. A pre-test is the use of a form on a trial basis in a small pilot study to determine how well the form/tool works or serves the purpose designed for.</p>

                        <p>Very often "document reproduction" is interpreted as "photocopying," but this is only one method.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Photocopying:</strong> Manufacturers are now supplying new models of photocopying machines at ever increasing rates.</li>
                            <li><strong>Spirit and wax stencil reproduction:</strong> This is a very special yet versatile method of reproduction from which up to 300 copies can be produced from a well-prepared master sheet.</li>
                            <li><strong>Other means of document reproduction:</strong> Other means include offset litho and typeset plates.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Before equipment for document reproduction is bought the following points should be considered: kind of documents, number of copies required, speed, quality, and cost.</p>
                        
                        <h4>CONTROL PROCEDURES FOR MEDICAL FORMS</h4>
                        <p>There should be strict control of all forms and records routine to prevent wasteful duplication in inefficient procedures. Obsolete and redundant forms should be removed from circulation and unsatisfactory forms amended where necessary. The records officer should maintain a list of all the forms with a similar function to be kept together to periodically examine, combine, simplify or eliminate the forms if necessary.</p>

                        </ul>

                        <h4>Procedures in ensuring quality assurance in health records.</h4>
                        <p>The health records department may carry out its evaluation of the services rendered to the patients through the Health Records Committee. The committee should see that the health records are complete and should meet regularly.</p>
                        
                        <h5>The functions of the health records committee are;-</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>To recommend to the Senior Medical committee in the format of the health record.</li>
                            <li>To recommend policies for maintenance of the health record.</li>
                            <li>To ensure that proper filing, indexing, storage and availability of patients' records.</li>
                            <li>To advice and guide the Health Records officer, Medical staff and administration of the institution on the release of information from the records.</li>
                            <li>To ensure that the SOPs in the HRD is followed correctly</li>

                        <h4>The medical Audit</h4>
                        <p>This is an "objective method for applying a yardstick to the quality of professional performance'. It is a method of evaluating quality of medical care given to the patient and it is used as a tool of management to enable the administrator and the medical staff to uncover inefficient service and try to raise the standards of care in health care institutions.</p>
