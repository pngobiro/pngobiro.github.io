                        <p>Many countries now have a number of computerized applications as part of a Health Information system in the health care facility. The aim of health care authorities around the world is for the development of an automated service that will increase the efficient retrieval of information for patient care, statistics, research and teaching. Systems are designed to integrate data collection, processing, reporting, and the use of information for improving the effectiveness and efficiency of the health service through better management at all levels.</p>
                        <p>An important point to remember, however, is that the use of a fully computerized system may improve the efficiency of a Medical Record Department, but ONLY where the basic manual procedures are already in place.</p>
                        <p>Medical record procedures commonly computerized in many countries include the admission, transfer and discharge/death (ATD) system; disease and procedure index; and an automated record tracking system.</p>

                            <li><strong>Patient Identification:</strong> An essential step is to ensure that all patients are uniquely identified at all times. Some form of Unique Patient Identifier is essential.</li>
                            <li><strong>Documentation standards:</strong> For the exchange of information.</li>
                            <li><strong>Provider Signatures:</strong> Incorporation of provider signatures.</li>
                            <li><strong>Education and Training:</strong> For all staff - medical, nursing, administration, and clerical.</li>

                            <li><strong>Information Flow:</strong> An existing policy on information flow should be reviewed and revised to incorporate electronic data entry.</li>

                        <h4>Factors to be considered when developing an EHR Implementation Plan</h4>
                        <p>A sound implementation plan can mean the difference between success and failure. There are many factors to be considered when developing a plan for implementation for example:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>What computer systems does the institution currently have?</li>
                            <li>What form will the implementation take? Will it be phased in? How?</li>
                            <li>How will past data be integrated and old data retained?</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h4>Development of a Comprehensive Implementation Plan</h4>
                        <p>When the form of implementation has been determined, the Steering Committee and implementation team need to ensure that the institution/government is ready to move forward. The next steps would be to:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Select the best system to meet the needs of the institution government</li>
                            <li>Determine that the required technological infrastructure is in place</li>
                            <li>Determine what clinical data capture and data retrieval is required</li>
                            <li>Ensure that important policies and procedures are clearly documented</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Timeline for Implementation</h4>
                        <p>The timeline for implementation will vary from institution to institution. The plan should contain steps such as review of the current system, establishment of a steering committee, preparation of goals and strategies, policy review, and appointing an implementation team.</p>
                        
                        <h5>1. Preparing the Site</h5>
                        <p>The sites for implementation need to be prepared. Before the system can "go live", the technological infrastructure needs to be in place with data entry facilities in all point-of-care areas.</p>

                        <h5>2. Pre-test the System</h5>
                        <p>When the site has been prepared and all users trained, it is time to install and pre-test the system at a point-of-care area in conditions that closely reflect actual situations.</p>
                        
                        <h4>System Start-up</h4>
                        <p>The day selected to "go live" should be on a weekend or a day when there are few patients expected. It is important that on the day all staff is available and ready with support personnel available to provide assistance as needed. When all pre-requisites have been addressed, a detailed implementation plan in place, the site ready, all users and support staff trained and ready, and the system pre-tested, the next step is implementation.</p>
                        <p>It is now time to 'go live'!</p>

                        <p>The principal benefits identified for the introduction of an electronic health record system are supporting patient care and improving the quality of that care. Accurate and timely health information, which is accessible when needed by both providers/users and consumers has great advantages for the healthcare of all individuals and would enhance the health and welfare of the community. It will also enhance the productivity of healthcare providers in the delivery of care, and be a strong support to clinical and health service research.</p>
                        <p>Implementation of EHRs has been said to revolutionise how we collect, store, and use health information. Patients are expected to become more involved in healthcare decisions when electronic systems provide them with easily accessible and accurate information about their health problems and care.</p>
