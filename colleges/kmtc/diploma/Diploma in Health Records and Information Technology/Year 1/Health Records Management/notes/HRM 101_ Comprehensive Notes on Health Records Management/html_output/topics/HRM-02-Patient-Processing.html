                            <li><strong>Out-Patient Records:</strong> This includes all the cards that are used in the Out-Patient Departments, for example the Casualty Wards, Ante-Natal Wards, Immunization cards and any other card that may be used in the outpatient departments.</li>
                            <li><strong>Diagnostic Records:</strong> These include notes on Radiography, Pathology, Electrocardiography and other investigations that are usually initiated by report forms.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h4>VALUES AND USES OF HEALTH RECORDS</h4>

                            <li><strong>Research:</strong> Accurate recording of observation in the health records will lead to accurate information required for research.</li>
                            <li><strong>Teaching:</strong> Health records can be used as an educational tool or instrument.</li>
                            <li><strong>Administration:</strong> Complete health records mean increased and efficient services to the public, avoiding vexations, litigations and fair settlement of claims.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>1. RECEPTION OF PATIENTS/CLIENTS</h4>
                        <p>Reception is the art of greeting and welcoming. The right person should be selected for this work, because he is the one who will interview the patient. He or she should have ease, assurance of manner and a pleasant appearance. It requires cool efficiency, the ability to convey confidants, patients and compassion- a very demanding combination of qualities.</p>
                        
                        <h4>2. REGISTRATION OF PATIENTS</h4>
                        <p>Is the completion of a documentation of personal and health data before a patient is treated. Registration falls into two procedures - that for out-patients and the consultative clinics the registration should be carried out before the patients attends the clinic. The environment should be conducive and the patients should be interviewed individually and in privacy. The patient should only be given one unit number.</p>

                        <h4>3. INITIATION OF PATIENTS RECORD</h4>
                        <p>The identification details that are taken during the registration time is used to create the patient's file. The registration details are:- patient's full names, date of birth, hospital number given, address, occupation, marital status, religion, name of next of kin, address of next of kin. Many hospitals have formed formal systems of pre-registration- this is sending the patient a simple form to be completed. The master index cards should also be created during the time that the record is being created and filed immediately.</p>

                        <p><strong>Definition:</strong> The Patient Master Index is the alphabetical key to the numerically file case records.</p>
                        <p><strong>Importance:</strong> This is a very important index in the case where a patient has lost his attendance cards.</p>
                        <p>The Master Index card is created when the patient is being registered.</p>

                        <h5>Filing Techniques used in filing Master Index Cards</h5>
                        <p><strong>(a) Sorting:</strong> The most important step in filing is sorting-which means putting the cards into good order before being filed. This can be done using a sort-file or pigeon holes.</p>
                        <p><strong>(b) Filing:</strong> This requires a lot of concentration. It easy to file in a card when the files in front and behind have been checked.</p>
                        <p><strong>(c) Checking:</strong> It is obvious that mistakes do occur when one is filing the cards and therefore constant checking of file cards is required.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>An appointment system is a systematic way of giving a specific date, time and venue of the clinic to an individual patient/client.</p>

                        <h4>Purpose of Scheduling and Follow up</h4>
                        <ol>
                            <li>To reduce patients' waiting time.</li>
                            <li>To provide an even spread of work over the whole clinic session.</li>
                            <li>To allow the hospital to prepare for each and every patient in advance.</li>
                            <li>To provide special clinic arrangements.</li>
                            <li>To allow for distance and known transport difficulties.</li>
                            <li>To provide for teaching arrangements.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h4>Type of appointment systems</h4>
                        <p>There are 3 types:-</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Centralized:</strong> All appointments for the various clinics are made in one central place.</li>
                            <li><strong>Decentralized:</strong> This is an appointment system which is carried on in different clinics.</li>
                            <li><strong>Combined:</strong> Some hospitals have the two systems combined. Return appointments being made in the various clinics and new bookings being done in the central area.</li>
                        </ol>
                        
                        <h4>Clinic Preparation</h4>
                        <p>Two days prior to the clinic all the clinic lists should be sent to the appropriate sections: - one to the clinic, one to the filing area, another to the consultant in charge of the clinical area. All the records and documents should be pulled out, all the pathological reports inserted in the correct files and kept in the pigeon holes for the clinic receptionist to come and collect.</p>

                        <h4>Queuing theory</h4>
                        <p>Queuing theory deals with one of the most unpleasant experiences of life and that's waiting. The aim of all investigations in queuing theory is to get the main performance measures of the system which are the probabilistic properties of the following random variables: number of customers/clients in the system, number of waiting customers, utilization of the server/s, consultants, response time of a customer, waiting time of a customer, idle time of the server/consultant, busy time of a server/consultant.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h4>ADMISSION PROCEDURES</h4>
                        <p>Patients/clients should be supplied with a booklet containing information about the hospital before they are admitted. Admissions can come from different sources:- (i) Accident and Emergency department (ii) Outpatient clinic (iii) Other hospitals (iv) In-patient waiting list.</p>

                        <h4>DISCHARGE PROCEDURES</h4>
                        <p>Admissions and discharge registers should be maintained in all health institutions. The register should provide for full name of the patient, date of birth, admission date, discharge date, diagnosis and the length of stay at the hospital.</p>

                        <h5>Editing and Auditing of the Health Record</h5>
                        <p><strong>What is editing of the Health Record?</strong> Is a process of arranging of all the forms inside the unit folder in a prescribed manner. Editing is mostly done by wards clerks and can be either be done chronologically or in order of speciality.</p>
                        <p><strong>What is a medical audit?</strong> The Medical Audit has been defined as an "objective method for applying a yardstick to the quality of professional performance." When we do auditing, it means the auditing team is evaluating the quality of medical care given to patients.</p>

                        <h4>Accident and Emergency Records Procedure</h4>
                        <p>After a patient has been seen at the health centre he may be having some ailment which needs immediate and urgent attention. A register must be maintained at the Accident and Emergency department. The same legal requirements that are applicable to other health records as far as retention is concerned still apply in accident and emergency records.</p>
                        
                        <h4>WAITING LIST FOR IN-PATIENT AND DAY CASE TREATMENT</h4>
                        <p>A waiting list is an index of all patients waiting admission to hospital or waiting treatment on a day case basis. The main function of the waiting list is to be able to make full use of the available beds in a health institution.</p>
