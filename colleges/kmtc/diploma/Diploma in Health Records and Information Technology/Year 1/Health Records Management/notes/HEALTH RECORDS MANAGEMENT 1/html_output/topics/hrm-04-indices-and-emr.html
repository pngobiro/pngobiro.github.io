                        <p>The students should be able to understand and define various health records indices.</p>
                        <p>A health record index is a selected listing of patient's health information representing more comprehensive health records of the patients. It includes:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Master patient index</li>
                            <li>Operational index</li>
                            <li>Waiting list index</li>
                            <li>Physician index</li>
                        </ul>

                        <span class="heading-icon"></span>
                        <span class="heading-text">Master Patient Index (MPI)</span>
                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>This is defined as the alphabetical key to the numerically filed case records. It should be used to establish whether a patient has previously attended the hospital or group of hospitals, if a group index is in operation. This is the section of the medical records department where most concentrated activities take place.</p>
                        <p>In large hospital with 700 beds and say 200,000 outpatient attendance a year as consultative clinics, there are likely to be as many as 300 / 400 references made each day and about 25,000 new cards created annually. These means the index should be accessible to any those people with a legitimate need to consult it, access must be fast and facts on the card must be clearly displayed.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Filing equipment for master patient index card</h3>
                        <p>Equipment chosen should meet the essential criteria for a master index i.e. access must be fast and clear display of facts. There are other factors that should be considered when making a choice of the equipment to be used e.g.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The quantities of records involved</li>
                            <li>Frequency of access</li>
                            <li>Space available for installation</li>
                            <li>Money available</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>i) Cards</h4>
                        <p>This forms the basic record document for master indexes. A card used for this permanent record must therefore be of good quality for endurance but not too thick as to make the index expand too fast. Cards will be bundled many times when the index is being consulted and therefore be carefully be guillotined to avoid fraying. It is good practice to have cards feint ruled to keep handwriting neat. It also helps to leave sufficient space for subsequent change of address.</p>

                        <h4>ii) Filing drawer</h4>
                        <p>Here the cards would be blind .that is one behind the other in an upright position. It is good practice to have drawers constructed specifically for the purpose of a master index since the master index will be continually expanding forward and therefore planning to provide sufficient drawer space is necessary to hold cards that may be created over a long period e.g. 80-90 years. In most medical records, department have run into space problems simply of not planning ahead even as far as 5 years.</p>

                        <h4>iv) Strip index</h4>
                        <p>As the name suggests it consists of a series of this wooden strips coated with paper on which the data required for the index are typed or handwritten. The strips are so narrow that any typing can provide satisfactory reading. Strips are usually filed on metal panels with a fixed of metal down their edges which holds the strips in place. These panels are then hung on a central revolving spindle so that they fan out like the leaves on an open book. They can be wall mounted on a modified version in a book form. While the strip index provide excellent visibility as a master index, it has serious Limitations in that it cannot handle more than 2,000 new cards created in a year. It is simple to operate but with expansion the panels become foil and bulky too soon as new cards are added onto the index. Within no time and due to constant handling strip lose their elasticity and drop out of panels. The disadvantage is that there is limited space allowed for writing details on the strip usually measuring "1/4"by 8 and these leaves no space for change of address. The strip index is however ideal for the record of patients in a ward or hospital.</p>

                        <h4>v) Elevator files</h4>
                        <p>Cards are stored in trays which are accommodated in racks centrally fixed so that the tray with the required cards can be brought to eye level with the press of a button in an alphabetical display panel.</p>

                        <h4>vi) Circular carousel</h4>
                        <p>This consist of shelves on suspended files rotating on a fixed spindle which may be fixed on a wall which can be rotated to bring the files that are needed to the front.</p>

                        <h4>vii) Computer</h4>
                        <p>The master patient index is presented as a computer view on the monitor. The keyboard is used to alphabetically identify they required name(s). The method allows many to access the master patient index at a time.</p>

                        <p>The following procedure will be of assistance in patient master index and filings</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Write the name of the patient placing surname first followed by middle name and others in full and filed in strict alphabetical sequence</li>
                            <li>Arrange the card in an alphabetical order like words in a dictionary following letter by letter to the end of the name</li>
                            <li>There should be only one card given to a patient if a unit system is used</li>
                            <li>Compound or hyphenated names are filed as one word</li>
                            <li>Name withy religious titles such as brother, pastor are filed last or the title disregarded</li>
                            <li>The legal name of a married woman is the one considered for filing. In this order a husband's surname (Mr.) is placed in parenthesis i.e. []</li>
                            <li>Only one person should be assigned the responsibility for filing the master index cards and is in charge of other personnel's</li>
                            <li>The card should be checked periodically for misfiling</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3>Diagnosis indexing</h3>
                        <p><strong>Definition:</strong> A diagnostic index is the process of bringing together all details of patients suffering from the same disease in an index card.</p>
                        <p>The primary purpose of this index is to provide access for study purposes of clinical date contained in the hospital medical records such that if a researcher wishes to study any particular disease at the case folder numbers of the cases he wishes to study can be obtained from index and case records extracted from the library for his study. It also serves as a means for the production of statistics pertaining to the incidence of various diseases and injuries and any other factor about the patient that is recorded. A diagnostic index is a standard feature of medical record system of most hospitals in the world particularly in reaching the hospitals and those hospitals where many clinicians and other professionals are engaged in research.</p>
                        <p><strong>Equipment used in disease (diagnostic) index:</strong> Disease index can be created on vertical index cards filed in drawers, visible edged cards filed in pockets, margins punched cards, or slotted punched cards. The choice of equipment to be used depends on the volume of records to be dealt with and the amount of information to be recorded.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Operational index</h3>
                        <p>Besides the diagnostic index the health records department has to maintain an operational index. Operational procedure need to be coded just on diagnostic according to ICD of classification of procedures in medicine. Equipment used to maintain operational index are the same as those used for diagnostic index.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Waiting list</h3>
                        <p><strong>Definition:</strong> This is an index of patient waiting for an admission in the hospital or patients waiting for treatment on a day case. Most of the waiting list records are initiated at outpatient clinic. Some other patients may come from another hospital and be put in a waiting list in another different hospital. There are four ways on how messages can be conveyed to the waiting list:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Card:</strong> The card is created for a patient who is to be put on a waiting list. This card will be filed and forms part of the waiting list.</li>
                            <li><strong>List:</strong> The nurse or a doctor may send a list of patients to be included in the waiting list to the Health Records department for action.</li>
                            <li><strong>Letters:</strong> A consultant in one hospital may wish to include his patients on the list in another hospital. The information contained on the waiting list letter includes Address, Title, Name of the patient, Telephone number, Holiday's days, Diagnosis, and Operation to be carried out.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Functions of a waiting list</h4>
                        <p>The waiting list must be organized so that inquiries may be answered from individual waiting to know when they are supposed to be admitted in the health institution. Individual consultant who would like to know how many patients are on their waiting list should be furnished with some information. The main function of this list is to be able to make full use of the available beds in a health institution.</p>
                        <h4>Types of waiting list</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Centralized waiting list:</strong> In this way the waiting list is held in one office and contain names of all patient awaiting admissions for all consultants in the hospital.</li>
                            <li><strong>Decentralized waiting list:</strong> This would be maintained in several places possibly by each consultant's secretary or by individual wards or departments.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <span class="heading-text">Electronic Medical Record (EMR) System</span>
                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Electronic medical records about patient care that are kept on a computer rather than on paper, the tradition medium for patient histories. Those records can include extensive information about patient's general health, current and past illness and medical conditions diagnostic results and treatment and medication prescribed. Often electronic medical records also include an application for prescribing and ordering medication.</p>
                        <p>Medical records ensure that patients receive the best medical care possible and that they are kept safe during treatment. Traditional paper mean of medical record keeping can be burdensome to maintain and track causing electronic medical records to come into safer. Knowing what electronic medical records are and how they work can help a medical clinic or hospital determine i.e. the implementation of an electronic system would be beneficial.</p>

                        <h3>Creation</h3>
                        <p>Electronic medical records most commonly are created on computers. The computer is set up with some type of records software and a technician enters data into the fields in the software to save it into the system. Most types of medical record software have the ability to search for particular data such as patients’ last name or insurance number. This will help to retrieve data very quickly. EMR also can be created by sophisticated medical devices such as machines e.g. that monitor the heart it sends data to a server during a stress test. Due to advances in the technology, they even can be created through application on cellular phones.</p>

                        <h3>Authentication</h3>
                        <p>As with tradition medical records, technicians still need to verify that the information contained in electronic medical records is accurate. EMR must be unaltered and be authenticated in order for them to be accepted for use.</p>

                        <h3>Benefits</h3>
                        <p>EMR greatly reduces the amount of space needed for record storage. They also decrease the amount of time that a must be spent physically retrieving files. They can be transmitted over a long distances in a matter of seconds, can be more legible than handwritten records. Lastly electronic records speed up billing and inquiry processes which means the hospital is able to serve more people and provide better services. EMR alleviate some administrative burden for medical officers because they eliminate the need for documents to be billed and filed. This saves medical professionals time, which can be better spent with patients.</p>

                        <h3>Concerns</h3>
                        <p>EMR are prone to data entry errors. They also are sensitive to data corruption if an electronic record is lost and there is no paper record, there may be no way to retrieve the data. EMR keeping also means that those who create and use the records must be comfortable with the related technology. Cost may rise for the hospital due to their training requirements, the purchase of necessary equipments and technology support.</p>

                        <h3>Features</h3>
                        <p>Medical professionals can enter new patients into their electronic records system easily, as well as change and update pre-existing records. Records can be deleted when patients are no longer a part of that doctor's office, they can be faked to specialty providers for medical collaboration and copies can be printed for patients to take home.</p>

                        <h3>Advantages of EMR</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li>The data tends to be more accurate. Electronic records eliminates the possibility of mistakes as a result of misleading a doctors hand writing</li>
                            <li>They are easily accessible to all care providers and more than one care providers at s time</li>
                            <li>They are easy to store and take up less space than paper records</li>
                            <li>They are easily portable form one doctor's office to another</li>
                            <li>Their use can lead to cost saving since keeping electronic records is more efficient than retaining paper records.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3>Disadvantages</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li>The possibility of incompatibility of computer system among various health care providers can lead to difficulty in sharing the data</li>
                            <li>Privacy and security cab be an is sue, if someone hacks into the system, thousands of patients records can be compromised.</li>
                            <li>When a computer crashes makes records inaccessible</li>
                            <li>The cost of implementing an electronic records system can be expensive</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3>Obstacles</h3>
                        <p>Cost remains a major deterrent to the implementation of electronic medical records, especially in small practices. The initial outlay for these systems can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars, something many physicians are not willing to spend. Doctor's reluctance to accept the new systems has also slowed their adoption in the United States, according to a journal of American Medical Association</p>
