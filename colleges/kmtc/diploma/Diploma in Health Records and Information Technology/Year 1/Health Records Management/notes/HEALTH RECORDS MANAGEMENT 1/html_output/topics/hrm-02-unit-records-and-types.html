                        <h3>Initiation of the unit system</h3>
                        <p>This is whereby it is necessary to assign a unit number to every patient attending for the first time. A six digit range of number is normally used ranging from 1 to 999,999. When the old patient attend or is admitted at the first time his old notes are filed at the back of his new unit folder under the new unit number. Only the old records of patient who present themselves after the appointment days are brought in this way, the other remaining in the old file under their original identification number. A tracer card should be replaced where old record was indicating the new unit number</p>

                        <h3>Prevention of duplication</h3>
                        <p>Duplication in the use of unit number is prevented through the following;-</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Either by not giving the same number to two patients</li>
                            <li>Not giving the same patient more than one number. In addition the patient should be asked whether he has attended the hospital previously during registration. Whether the patients says yes or no across checking can be done through the patient master index to ascertain this.</li>
                            <li>Records are contained in one case folder</li>
                            <li>Has six digits</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>The unit number register</h3>
                        <p>The importance of unit system is appreciated if the unit number register is maintained. The unit number register have the following information:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Full names of the patient</li>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h3>A. The folder</h3>
                        <p>When selecting a folder the following should be considered:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Strength of manila</li>
                            <li>Method of fastening in documents</li>
                            <li>Clarity of numbering</li>
                            <li>Cost of the folder</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The folder should be made of tough manila with a gusset and single or double fold inside through which are threaded metal or plastic prongs with which the loose sheets may be fastened into the folder</p>

                        <h3>B. The front sheet or identification sheet</h3>
                        <p>This is the area where the patient social details are transcribed from the preregistration form. Space should be provided to record several changes or address and change of a doctor. A section for listing consultants whose clinics the patient has attended or wards. The facts should be readily visible to the doctor who is in charge of the patient. The information should be complete and accurate for easy in follow up.</p>

                        <h3>C. Clinical history sheet</h3>
                        <h4>i) Consultants/ Clinical history sheet</h4>
                        <p>Each consultant has his individual history on which he only will write. A patient attending three different clinics will have three separate history sheet though they will be filled next to each other. The consultants can also use continuous history sheets. The advantage is it's easy to identify by using different coloured stamp/ clinic stamp.</p>
                        <h4>ii) Continuous history sheet</h4>
                        <p>This is the sheet whereby every doctor writes as he sees the patient</p>

                        <h3>D. Continuation sheet</h3>
                        <p>Continuation sheet is similar to the history sheet but without any special printed identification of Consultant or clinician which enables them to be used by all consultants</p>

                        <h3>E. Prescription chart</h3>
                        <p>This makes formal provision for the doctor to prescribe drugs for inpatient. The form must be taken back to the case folder from the pharmacy so that the doctor treating the patient can see the previous medication that has been prescribed</p>

                        <h3>F. Surgical operation sheet</h3>
                        <p>This sheet contains sections in which the names of all the surgeons and anaesthetics taking part in the operation are to be recorded and special remarks about drainage, blood loss, special recovery treatment etc.</p>

                        <h3>G. Anaesthetic record</h3>
                        <p>This form contains considerable amount of detail filled in by the anaesthetist during the operation and immediate post-operative period</p>

                        <h3>H. Temperature, Pulse and Respiration (TPR) chart</h3>
                        <p>There are usual two versions of this chart</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>B.D-twice daily chart for the recording of the routine observations urine and stool details are usually recorded at the foot of the TPR chart. A separate chart is often used for four hourly recording for more seriously ill patients. This is frequently printed on coloured paper or in coloured ink for it to be noticed</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>I. Report mounting sheets</h3>
                        <p>This is where forms which are filled in the folder are usually mounted on a report mount sheet. They vary in designs and method of gumming. They are gummed on the edge and stacked on the mount sheet. The forms are filed one above the other, but approximately one quarter inch or one third inch of the lower edge left visible so that the date and type of report can immediately be seen. In this way, a dozen or more reports will be filed on one mount sheet</p>

                        <h3>J. Consent form</h3>
                        <p>This is written consent which is obtained for all operative procedures, sterilization procedures, post mortem examination. It is obtained from the patient's relative or parent (if the child is under years) it is mounted on the mount sheet</p>

                        <h3>K. Report forms</h3>
                        <p>These are investigation report forms e.g. laboratory, radiology results etc. They are fastened into patient notes</p>

                        <h3>L. Clinical photographs</h3>
                        <p>They are taken usually when the patient has an unusually interesting condition e.g. in plastic surgery, patient pass through several stages of treatment, the photograph is taken in intervals to record the progress. They are filed in the case folder</p>

                        <h3>M. In-patient summary</h3>
                        <p>This is the record which is done after the patient has been discharged from the hospital. It is done by the registrar or consultant to dictate a summary of the salient points of the patients progress while an inpatient, operations done or other treatment. A copy of this summary is often used as the hospital's full report to the general practitioner. This forms the document on which diagnostic coding is carried out</p>

                        <h3>N. Correspondence</h3>
                        <p>Copies or originals of the communications from general practitioner to hospital doctors and from hospital to general to general practitioner must be returned including copies of discharge note</p>

                        <h3>Types of health records</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Case record (patient record)</strong><br>These are records initiated for the patients who get admitted into the wards or who continuously attend the various consultants clinic. The information contained in the case records can be expressed verbally, graphically, diagrammatically or in tabular form. This depends on the person who is taking the information</li>
                            <li><strong>Outpatient record</strong><br>This includes all the cards that are used in the outpatient department e.g. casualty card, acute natal cards or any other card may be used in the outpatient department</li>
                            <li><strong>Diagnostic records</strong><br>This included notes on radiography, pathology, electrocardiography and any other investigations that are usually initiated by report forms. The forms is 6 "x 4"in size and are available in all the consultation rooms both in the outpatient and inpatient department. They are in different colours for quick identification</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>VALUES AND USES OF HEALTH RECORDS</h3>
                        <p>Health records have various uses:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Treatment</strong><br>Health record is the value in the present and future treatment of the patient. The individual record is a reminder to the physician surgeon, clinician etc. It contains what has been observed by the others. It provides or should provide the whole previous hospital record of the patient, so that every fact that may be important is permanently available for reference at any time</li>
                            <li><strong>Planning</strong><br>Health statistics and information from the health record will definitely be very useful in the planning of health services. The statistics should be very accurate and disseminated promptly to the user</li>
                            <li><strong>Research</strong><br>Accurate recording observation in the health records will lead to accurate information required for research. The methods of filing and retrieving the records should be systematic and simple</li>
                            <li><strong>Teaching</strong><br>Health records can be used as an educational tool or instrument. When the quality of health records is high, the task of the students is simplified and conversely, when the quality is poor the student's task is made more difficult and his progress thereby impended</li>
                            <li><strong>Administration</strong><br>Complete health record means increased and efficient service to the public avoiding vexation, litigation and fair settlement of claims and capacity enquiries about the hospital work. For the record to be useful for the above purpose it should be designed for the purposes for which it is to be used. The record should meet both the clinicians and the record personnel requirement. The record should be complete i.e. analyzed quantitatively by the records officer and qualitatively by the clinician</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3>QUALITIES OF A HEALTH RECORDS & INFORMATION OFFICER</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Integrity</strong> - Honest, morally upright</li>
