                        <p>The student should be able to;-</p>

                        <p><strong>Appointment system</strong> is a system is a systematic way of giving a specific date, time and venue of the clinic to an individual patient/ client.</p>

                        <h3>CONCEPTS OF SCHEDULING</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Patients should be distributed evenly to various clinics depending on the number that the consultants will be able to see.</li>
                            <li>The staff meaning the clinics should ensure that they are in time so that the patients are not kept waiting for long before they are seen</li>
                            <li>Overloading of clinics should be avoided</li>
                            <li>There should be a laid down policy on how to schedule current cases</li>
                            <li>Staff working in the appointment area should be familiar with the layout of the hospital so that they can give proper direction to the patients/ clients.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3>PURPOSE OF SCHEDULING AND FOLLOWUP</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>To reduce patients' waiting time</li>
                            <li>To provide an even spread of work over the whole clinic session. An appointment provides for even spread of work among the medical staff running the clinic.</li>
                            <li>To allow the hospital to prepare each and every patient in advance so that delay for registration at the time of the clinic is or can be reduced.</li>
                            <li>To provide special clinic arrangements, for example recording of social history, weighing of patients, removal of plaster, pathological and radiological examinations.</li>
                            <li>To allow for distance and known transport difficulties. Allowance should be made by health record staff for such factors as the distance a patient has to travel, train and arrival and departure times, rural transport difficulties, availability of local ambulance to the health care facility. All these can consistently ease burden of attending the hospital.</li>
                            <li>To provide for teaching arrangements. A consultant may wish to select an interesting case to present to the medical students. This is simplified if an appointment system is well organized in the health institution.</li>
                        </ul>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h3>TYPES OF APPOINTMENT SYSTEMS</h3>
                        <h4>A. CENTRALIZED</h4>
                        <p>This means that all appointments for the various clinics are made in one central place. (Same work being done in one area)</p>
                        <h5>ADVANTAGES</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The master index card will be near the area for quick reference</li>
                            <li>Control of staff, stationery and equipment by the health records & Information Officer is easy.</li>
                            <li>Each of the appointment clerks becomes familiar with the working systems of the various consultants.</li>
                            <li>All inquiries concerning appointments are referred to one place.</li>
                            <li>Urgent cases are channeled quickly to the respective clinics.</li>
                            <li>When one clerk is sick or goes on leave, the other clerk continuous with the work since they are all familiar with the work.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>B. DECENTRALIZED</h4>
                        <p>This is an appointment system which is carried on different clinics.</p>
                        <h5>ADVANTAGES</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The clerk dealing with the appointments becomes familiar with the patients and knows them by name.</li>
                            <li>The consultant of the clinic in charge of the clinic will know the number of patients on his list without having to walk or ring the central area.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h5>DISADVANTAGES</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The master index is far from the appointment area.</li>
                            <li>Control of available resources is difficult</li>
                            <li>When the clerk who mans the clinic becomes sick or is on leave, the work come to a stand still</li>
                            <li>Enquiries concerning appointments are directed to different places</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>C. COMBINED</h4>
                        <p>Some of the hospital has the two systems combined. Return appointments being made in the various clinics and new bookings being done in the central area. Therefore it is the duty of health records/information officer to look at these systems critically to decide on which suits his/her hospital or health institution.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h3>SOURCES OF REQUEST FOR APPOINTMENTS</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Patients telephoning personally to make appointments</li>
                            <li>Physicians on private practice wanting to book appointments for their patients through telephone or writing.</li>
                            <li>Letters from health institution given to patients to come and book their own appointments</li>
                            <li>Patients already discharged from the hospital making return appointment</li>
                            <li>Patients referred from other clinics or from one clinic to another.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>EQUIPMENTS USED TO RECORDS APPOINTMENTS</h3>
                        <p>-The choice of the equipment used will depend on whether the appointment is being made centrally or de-centrally.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Loose leaf binder:</strong> Books vary in size and it is recommended that they be in loose leaf form to facilitate additions and removal of the sheets. The type used depends on local circumstances.</li>
                            <li><strong>Visible edge sheets:</strong> Sheets are cut out and by the use of cardex, these sheets are fixed on the cardex and the information written on them can easily be seen when the cardex is open.</li>
                            <li><strong>Diaries:</strong> Books that are bound can be used to write all the appointments for one consultant. The disadvantage is that one keeps cancelling the list making the diary to become untidy. Another disadvantage is that one cannot photocopy the diary direct. He has to write out other list from the diary.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>Most of the waiting list records are initiated at the out patient clinics. Some other patients may come from another hospital and be put in the waiting list for another different hospital, where there are more beds or facilities. There are four ways in which information can be conveyed to the waiting list.</p>

                        <p>Two types of information must be contained on a waiting list records</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Social data</li>
                            <li>Medical data</li>
                        </ol>
                        <h4>SOCIAL DATA</h4>
                        <p>This include;- Patients title, Name, Address, Telephone number, And where possible such details has holiday dates & minimum noticed required for admission.</p>
                        <h4>MEDICAL DATA</h4>
                        <p>This will include;- Diagnosis/operation to be carried out prior of admission e.g. routine, agent, soon and indications as to whether the operation will be carried out by the consultant or register. Some institution will indicate how long the patient may be expected to stay in hospital.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h3>CHECKS TO BE MADE ON THE WAITING LIST.</h3>
                        <p>The facts recorded in the waiting list must be correct;</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>The names of all patients for whom admission are planned must appear in it,</li>
                            <li>Names of all patients who no longer need admission must not appear on it.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <h4>a) Checking for completeness.</h4>
                        <p>-The methods by which patient names may reach the waiting list have already been described. It's possible however that a particular name may be missed, the doctor may think he ask the nurse or the receptionist to make a card but may not have done so.</p>
                        <h4>b) Checking for Accuracy</h4>
                        <p>-Where a hospital has a large waiting list of more than 1000 waiting for admission, some of these patients will wait for a long time. It is important to be certain that the patients at the list are still in need of treatment and have not moved from the area or had the operation carried out a another hospital.</p>
                        <h4>c) Checking for duplication</h4>
                        <p>-The admission forms of routine and emergency admission should be checked against alphabetical file. In this way the card of a patient who has been in the routine waiting list for the repair of hernia will be removed.</p>
                        <h4>d) Checking for Deaths</h4>
