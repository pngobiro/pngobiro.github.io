                        <h3>Causes of Death</h3>
                        <p>In 1967, the Twentieth World Health Assembly defined the causes of death to be entered on the medical certificate of cause of death as "all those diseases, morbid conditions or injuries which either resulted in or contributed to death and the circumstances of the accident or violence which produced any such injuries". The purpose of the definition is to ensure that all the relevant information is recorded. The definition does not include symptoms and modes of dying, such as heart failure or respiratory failure.</p>
                        <h3>Underlying Cause of Death</h3>
                        <p>The underlying cause of death has been defined as "(a) the disease or injury which initiated the train of morbid events leading directly to death, or (b) the circumstances of the accident or violence which produced the fatal injury". From the standpoint of prevention, it is necessary to break the chain of events at some point, and the most effective public health objective is to prevent the precipitating cause from operating.</p>

                        <p>When more than one cause of death is recorded, the first step is to determine the originating antecedent cause from the lowest used line in Part I of the certificate. This is done by applying the General Principle or Selection Rules 1, 2, and 3.</p>
                        
                        <h3>General Principle</h3>
                        <p>When more than one condition is entered on the certificate, the condition entered alone on the lowest used line of Part I should be selected only if it could have given rise to all the conditions entered above it.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Selection Rules</h3>
                        <p><strong>Rule 1.</strong> If the General Principle does not apply and there is a reported sequence terminating in the condition first entered on the certificate, select the originating cause of this sequence. If there is more than one sequence terminating in the condition mentioned first, select the originating cause of the first-mentioned sequence.</p>
                        <p><strong>Rule 2.</strong> If there is no reported sequence terminating in the condition first entered on the certificate, select this first-mentioned condition.</p>
                        <p><strong>Rule 3.</strong> If the condition selected by the General Principle or by Rule 1 or Rule 2 is obviously a direct consequence of another reported condition, whether in Part I or Part II, select this primary condition.</p>

                        <p><strong>Rule D. Specificity:</strong> If the selected cause is general and a more precise term is reported, prefer the more informative term.</p>
