                        <h3>The Ninth Revision</h3>
                        <p>The International Conference for the Ninth Revision of the International Classification of Diseases, convened by WHO, met in Geneva from 30 September to 6 October 1975. In the discussions leading up to the conference, it had originally been intended that there should be little change other than updating of the classification. This was mainly because of the expense of adapting data-processing systems each time the classification was revised.</p>
                        <p>There had been an enormous growth of interest in the ICD and ways had to be found of responding to this, partly by modifying the classification itself and partly by introducing special coding provisions. A number of representations were made by specialist bodies which had become interested in using the ICD for their own statistics. Some subject areas in the classification were regarded as inappropriately arranged and there was considerable pressure for more detail and for adaptation of the classification to make it more relevant for the evaluation of medical care, by classifying conditions to the chapters concerned with the part of the body affected rather than to those dealing with the underlying generalized disease.</p>
                        <p>The final proposals presented to and accepted by the Conference retained the basic structure of the ICD, although with much additional detail at the level of the four-digit subcategories, and some optional five-digit subdivisions. For the benefit of users not requiring such detail, care was taken to ensure that the categories at the three-digit level were appropriate.</p>
                        <p>For the benefit of users wishing to produce statistics and indexes oriented towards medical care, the Ninth Revision included an optional alternative method of classifying diagnostic statements, including information about both an underlying general disease and a manifestation in a particular organ or site. This system became known as the dagger and asterisk system and is retained in the Tenth Revision.</p>

                        <h3>Preparations for the Tenth Revision</h3>
                        <p>Even before the Conference for the Ninth Revision, WHO had been preparing for the Tenth Revision. It had been realized that the great expansion in the use of the ICD necessitated a thorough rethinking of its structure and an effort to devise a stable and flexible classification, which should not require fundamental revision for many years to come. The WHO Collaborating Centres for Classification of Diseases were consequently called upon to experiment with models of alternative structures for ICD-10.</p>
                        <p>It had also become clear that the established ten-year interval between revisions was too short. The Director-General of WHO therefore wrote to the Member States and obtained their agreement to postpone until 1989 the Tenth Revision Conference, which was originally scheduled for 1985 and to delay the introduction of the Tenth Revision which would have been due in 1989. This allowed time for the evaluation of ICD-9, for example through meetings organized by some of the WHO Regional Offices and through a survey organized at headquarters.</p>

                        <p>ICD-10 comprises three volumes:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li><strong>Volume 1: Main Classifications</strong> - Contains the core tabular list of inclusions and subcategories.</li>
                            <li><strong>Volume 2: Guidance for Users</strong> - Provides instructions on how to use the ICD, including rules for mortality and morbidity coding, statistical presentation guidelines, and the history of ICD development.</li>
                            <li><strong>Volume 3: Alphabetical Index</strong> - An alphabetical index to the classification, divided into three sections:
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Section I:</strong> Index of diseases and injuries (Chapters I-XIX and XXI).</li>
                                    <li><strong>Section II:</strong> Index of external causes of morbidity and mortality (Chapter XX).</li>
                                    <li><strong>Section III:</strong> Table of Drugs and Chemicals.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Structure of the Alphabetical Index (Volume 3)</h3>
                        <p>The Index contains "lead terms", positioned to the far left of the column, with other words ("modifiers" or "qualifiers") at different levels of indentation under them. In Section I, these indented modifiers or qualifiers are usually varieties, sites or circumstances that affect coding; in Section II they indicate different types of accident or occurrence, vehicles involved, etc. Modifiers that do not affect coding appear in parentheses after the condition.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Chapters</h3>
                        <p>The classification is divided into 21 chapters. The first character of the ICD code is a letter, and each letter is associated with a particular chapter, except for the letter D (used in Chapters II and III) and the letter H (used in Chapters VII and VIII). Four chapters (I, II, XIX, XX) use more than one letter.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Blocks of categories</h3>
                        <p>The chapters are subdivided into homogeneous "blocks" of three-character categories. For example, in Chapter I, the block titles reflect two axes of classification: mode of transmission and broad group of infecting organisms.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Three-character categories</h3>
                        <p>Within each block, some of the three-character categories are for single conditions (selected because of their frequency, severity or susceptibility to public health intervention), while others are for groups of diseases with some common characteristic. There is usually provision for "other" and "unspecified" conditions.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Four-character subcategories</h3>
                        <p>Most three-character categories are subdivided by a fourth numeric character after a decimal point, allowing up to ten subcategories. These are used to identify different sites, varieties, or individual diseases. Where a three-character category is not subdivided, it is recommended that the letter "X" be used to fill the fourth position for data-processing consistency.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Supplementary subdivisions (Fifth character or beyond)</h3>
                        <p>These are usually subclassifications along a different axis from the fourth character. They are found in:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Chapter XIII - subdivisions by anatomical site</li>
                            <li>Chapter XIX - subdivisions for open/closed fractures and internal injuries</li>
                            <li>Chapter XX - subdivisions for the type of activity at the time of the event.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h3>The unused "U" codes</h3>
                        <p>Codes U00-U49 are for the provisional assignment of new diseases of uncertain etiology. Codes U50-U99 may be used in research.</p>
