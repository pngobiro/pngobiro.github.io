                        <h3>3.1. Sources of epidemiological data</h3>
                        <p>Epidemiologists use primary and secondary data sources to calculate rates and conduct studies.</p>
                        <h4>Primary data:</h4>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>This is the original data collected for a specific purpose by or for an investigator</li>
                            <li>For example, an epidemiologist may collect primary data by interviewing people who became ill after eating at a restaurant in order to identify which specific foods were consumed.</li>
                            <li>Collecting primary data is expensive and time-consuming, and it usually is undertaken only when secondary data is not available.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Secondary data</h4>
                        <p>This is data collected for another purpose by other individuals or organizations.</p>
                        <p>Examples of sources of secondary data that are commonly used in epidemiological studies include:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Birth and death certificates,</li>
                            <li>Population census records,</li>
                            <li>Patient medical records,</li>
                            <li>Disease registers,</li>
                            <li>Insurance claim forms and billing records,</li>
                            <li>Public health department case reports,</li>
                            <li>Surveys of individuals and households.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>3.2. Morbidity measurements</h3>
                        <h4>Incidence</h4>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Are counts of new cases</li>
                            <li>Incidence risk is a measure of disease occurrence over a defined period of time. It is a proportion, therefore takes values from 0 to 1 (0% to 100%).</li>
                            <li>Incidence rate takes into account the time an individual is at risk of disease. It is not a proportion since it defines the number of cases per animal or farm time at risk.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Prevalence</h4>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Are counts of new and old cases of a disease that are present in a particular population at a given time</li>
                            <li>It is derived by comparing the number of people found to have the condition with the total number of people studied, and is usually expressed as a fraction (i.e. the number of cases per 10,000 or 100,000 people)</li>
                            <li>The following are types of prevalence:
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Point prevalence</strong> is the proportion of a population that has the characteristic at a specific point in time.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Period prevalence</strong> is the proportion of a population that has the characteristic at any point during a given time period of interest. "Past 12 months" is a commonly used period.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Lifetime prevalence</strong> is the proportion of a population who, at some point in life has ever had the characteristic.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>

                            <li><strong>Crude death rate</strong> is the number of deaths (from all causes) per 1000 estimated midyear population in a given place</li>
                            <li><strong>Case fatality rate</strong> - indicates killing power of a disease (e.g. number of death due to a specific disease divide by total number of same cases expressed in percentage)</li>
                            <li><strong>Specific death rate</strong> is number of death in a group during the year per 1000 midyear population. This can be Age Specific Death Rate or Disease Specific Death Rate</li>
                            <li><strong>Survival rate</strong> - proportion of survivors in a group studied and followed in a period of time. It shows the efficiency of treatment.</li>
                            <li><strong>Infant mortality rate</strong> - number of infants dying in a year per 1000 live births in a given geographical area</li>
                            <li><strong>Child mortality rate</strong> - number of deaths of children 1-4 years per 1000 population of the same age in a given year and in a given geographical area</li>
                            <li><strong>Neonatal mortality rate</strong> - number of infants dying within 4 weeks or up-to 28 days of life per 1000 live births in a year and in a geographical area</li>
                            <li><strong>Early neonatal mortality rate</strong> - number of infants dying within the first 7 days of life per 1000 live births in a year and in a geographical area</li>
                            <li><strong>Perinatal mortality rate</strong> - number of still births/late foetal death (after 28 weeks of gestation) plus deaths within 1st week of life in a year within a geographical area per 1000 births (live and still)</li>
                            <li><strong>Maternal mortality rate</strong> - number of death of women (while pregnant or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy) from any cause related to pregnancy or child bearing and child birth per 100,000 live birth in a given year</li>
                            <li><strong>Still birth</strong> - death of fetus after completing 28 weeks and till the time of birth</li>

                            <li>Also called observational studies</li>
                            <li>In this type of epidemiology, the disease distribution in a community is described in terms of Time, Place and Person</li>
                            <li>Is used when little is known about the issue or disease and relies on pre-existing data</li>
                            <li>Its purposes are:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Provides a systematic approach for dissecting a health problem into its component parts.</li>

                                    <li>Enables generation of testable hypotheses regarding the etiology, exposure mode, control measure effectiveness, and other aspects of the health problem.</li>
                                    <li>Helps validate the eventual incrimination of causes or risk factors.</li>

                            <li>Starts with no hypothesis regarding cause-effect relationship, and ends with development of possible hypothesis regarding cause and effect relationship but does not confirm or reject such hypothesis</li>
                            <li>The procedure in descriptive epidemiology includes:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Define the population to be studied</li>

                                    <li>Develop measurements of the disease</li>
                                    <li>Compare results with known indices</li>
                                    <li>Formulate an etiological hypothesis</li>

                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Case report</strong> - this is a detailed report of the symptoms, signs, diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of an individual patient. They may contain a demographic profile of the patient, but usually describe an unusual or new occurrence.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Case control</strong> - is designed to help determine if an exposure is associated with an outcome (i.e., disease or condition of interest). A case-control study is always retrospective because it starts with an outcome then traces back to investigate exposures.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Case series</strong> - Patients with a particular condition or disease are sampled. It gathers experience of patients with similar disease</li>
                                    <li><strong>Cross sectional</strong> - It is also called prevalence study. Information is collected from a population in a point of time. For example, prevalence of respiratory conditions among furniture makers</li>
                                    <li><strong>Ecological</strong> - the incidence of a disease in one geographical area is compared to that of another area. For example, Cancer mortality in areas with hazardous waste site as compared to areas without waste sites</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>

                                            <li><strong>Randomized controlled trials (RCT)</strong> - uses patients as units of study, mostly for assessing a new therapy</li>
                                            <li><strong>Field trials</strong> - uses healthy individuals as units of study, mostly for assessing preventive agents like vaccines</li>
                                            <li><strong>Community trials</strong> - uses communities as units of study for assessing community based interventions like health status in villages with a training program versus in those without</li>

                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                           <li>Risk is the proportion of individuals in a population (initially free of disease) who develop the disease within a specified time interval.</li>
                           <li>Incidence risk is expressed as a percentage (or if small as per 1000 persons)</li>

                           <li>Measure of the frequency with which an event occurs in a defined population over a specified period of time.</li>
                           <li>Are useful for comparing disease frequency in different locations, at different times, or among different groups of persons with potentially different sized populations; that is, a rate is a measure of risk.</li>
                           <li>Describes how quickly disease occurs in a population, for example, 70 new cases of breast cancer per 1,000 women per year.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Ratio</h4>

                           <li>It is calculated by dividing one interval- or ratio-scale variable by the other</li>
                           <li>A ratio can describe the male-to-female ratio of participants in a study, or the ratio of controls to cases (e.g., two controls per case).</li>
                           <li>As an analytic tool, ratios can be calculated for occurrence of illness, injury, or death between two groups</li>

                           <li>Describes what fraction of clinic patients tested positive for HIV, or what percentage of the population is younger than 25 years of age.</li>
                           <li>A proportion may be expressed as a decimal, a fraction, or a percentage.</li>
                           <li>Are used as descriptive measures. For example, one could calculate the proportion of persons enrolled in a study among all those eligible ("participation rate") OR the proportion of children in a village vaccinated against measles.</li>
                           <li>Describe the amount of disease that can be attributed to a particular exposure. For example, 90% of the lung cancer cases that occur are attributable to cigarette smoking.</li>

                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Reliability in statistics is the overall consistency of a measure. It is the degree to which the result of a measurement can be depended on to be accurate. OR the degree to which research method produces stable and consistent results</li>
                            <li>A measure is said to have a high reliability if it produces similar results under consistent conditions OR a specific measure is considered to be reliable if its application on the same object in number of times produces the same results.</li>
                            <li>The following are types of reliability:
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Test-retest reliability</strong> - measures the consistency of results when you repeat the same test on the same sample at a different point in time. You can improve test reliability through:
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>When designing a questionnaire, formulate questions, statements and tasks in a way that won't be influenced by the mood or concentration of participants.</li>
                                            <li>When planning your method of data collection, try to minimize the influence of external factors, and make sure all samples are tested under the same conditions.</li>
                                            <li>Take in to account any change that is likely to occur during the assessment</li>
                                        </ul>

                                    <li><strong>Interrater reliability (also called inter-observer reliability) measures</strong> - the degree of agreement between different people observing or assessing the same thing. It is used when data is collected by researchers assigning ratings, scores or categories to one or more variables. It can be improved by:
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Clearly define your variables and the methods that will be used to measure them.</li>
                                            <li>Develop detailed objective and criteria on how the variables will be rated, counted or categorized.</li>
                                            <li>If multiple researchers are involved, ensure that they all have exactly the same information and training.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                    </li>
                                    <li><strong>Parallel forms reliability measures</strong> - the correlation between two equivalent versions of a test. You use it when you have two different assessment tools or sets of questions designed to measure the same thing. It can be improved by:
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Ensuring that all questions or test items are based on the same theory and formulated to measure the same thing.</li>

                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                           <li>Variation means that when we measure something over-and-over again, we get a different result, and therefore, we cannot predict the outcome of any future observation.</li>
                           <li>This is the extent to which data in a statistical distribution or data set differ from each other</li>
                           <li>There are four measures of variability:
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Range</strong>- the difference between the lowest and highest values.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Interquartile range</strong> - is a measure of variability, based on dividing a data set into quartiles. Quartiles divide a rank-ordered data set into four equal parts. The values that divide each part are called the first, second, and third quartiles; and they are denoted by Q1, Q2, and Q3, respectively. The interquartile range is equal to Q3 minus Ql.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Variance</strong> - measures how far a set of numbers are spread out from their average value</li>
                                    <li><strong>Standard deviation</strong> - Measures exact distances from the mean. It is calculated by getting the square root of the variance</li>
                                </ul>
                           </li>

                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                           <li>This is a situation in which the effect or association between an exposure and outcome is distorted by the presence of another variable.</li>
                           <li>Positive confounding (when the observed association is biased away from the null)</li>
                           <li>Negative confounding (when the observed association is biased toward the null)</li>
                           <li>Test bias refers to the differential validity of test scores for groups (e.g., age, education, culture, race, sex).</li>
                           <li>Bias is a systematic error in the measurement process that influences scores for identified groups</li>

                        <h3>2.10. Validity</h3>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Validity is the extent to which an instrument, such as a survey or test, measures what it is intended to measure (also known as internal validity).</li>
                            <li>This is important if the results of a study are to be meaningful and relevant to the wider population.</li>
                            <li>There are four main types of validity:
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Construct validity</strong> - The extent to which the instrument specifically measures what it is intended to measure, and avoids measuring other things. For example, a measure of intelligence should only assess factors relevant to intelligence and not, for instance, whether someone is a hard worker. Does the test measure the concept that it's intended to measure?</li>
                                    <li><strong>Content validity</strong> - Describes whether an instrument is systematically and comprehensively representative of the characteristics it is measuring. For example, a questionnaire aiming to score anxiety should include questions aimed at a broad range of features of anxiety. Is the test fully representative of what it aims to measure?</li>
                                    <li><strong>Face validity</strong> - The degree to which a test is subjectively thought to measure what it intends to measure. In other words, does it "look like" it will measure what it should do. The subjective opinion for face validity can come from experts, from those administering the instrument, or from those using the instrument. Does the content of the test appear to be suitable to its aims?</li>
                                    <li><strong>Criterion validity</strong> - Involves comparing the instrument in question with another criterion which is taken to be representative of the measure. This can take the form of:
                                        <ul>
                                            <li><strong>Concurrent validity</strong> (where the instrument results are correlated with those of an established gold standard)</li>
                                            <li><strong>Predictive validity</strong> (where the instrument results are correlated with future outcomes, whether they be measured by the same instrument or a different one). Do the results correspond to a different test of the same thing?</li>
                                        </ul>
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
