\section*{HEALTH DATA CLASSIFICATION I}

\section*{UNIT 1: INTRODUCTION TO ICD, ICD- 11, ICPM, ICHI AND THE STRUCTURE OF CLASSIFICATION:}

\section*{Definition of ICD and ICPM}

Classification is a method of grouping items scientifically according to purpose, and codifying them with numerical (or alpha-numerical) identifiers according to certain principles.

\section*{Definition of ICD (International Classification of Diseases)}

It is WHO's standard diagnostic tool for epidemiology, health management and medical /Clinical purposes.

It refers to a standardized coding of death certificates and for hospital and outpatient medical records of fatal diseases.

\section*{Definition of ICPM (International Classification of procedures in Medicine)}

Is a system of classifying procedure codes being developed by the World Health Organization (WHO).

\section*{What is ICD-11?}
- It is the 11th version of the international classification of disease standard which is an automated system in which a software assigns the ICD codes for the diseases and procedures documented in the medical records

\section*{Terms used in ICD-11}
- Users of ICD-11 will come across several terms that they should be familiar with and know how to use / apply them in their coding practice.
- ICD-11 browser
- ICD-11 coding tool
- ICD-11 reference guide
- Stem codes
- Extension Codes
- Precoordination
- Postcoordination
- Cluster coding
- The term "Due to"
- Instructional terms such as: "associated with"; "code also', "add detail"; "has causing condition"; "has manifestation"
- Flexible search
- Abbreviation NOS (not otherwise specified)
- ICD foundation components
- Residual Codes
- 'Use additional code, if desired'
- use of Terms "And" and "Or"
- Parent-child relationship
- Ancestry tree
- Multiple parenting
- ICD content model
- Inclusions
- Exclusions
- Abbreviation NEC (not elsewhere classified)
- Sanctioning rules
- Tabular list
- Chapters and section of ICD11
- Codes for special purposes
- A description
- Alphanumeric
- Laterality

\section*{Foundation}
- ICD-11 has a foundation component providing the overarching repository/database whereby concepts can be drawn into specific classifications or linearization's e,g mortality, morbidity, primary care, research, functioning and disability and quality and safety.
- Specifically, the foundation component of ICD-11 is a multidimensional collection of all ICD entities, the diseases, disorders, injuries, external causes, signs and symptoms.

\section*{Stem Code}

They are codes in a particular tabular list that can be used alone. Stem codes may be entities or groupings of high relevance, or clinical entities that should always be described as one entity. An example of a stem code from Chapter 22 Injury, poisoning or certain other consequences of external causes is: NC72.5 Fracture of shaft of femur.

Place of occurrence code e.g injury

\section*{Extension Code}

Can be used optionally to add additional information or details to a stem code

Extension codes have been designed to standardise the way additional information is added to stem codes, and the adoption of multi-dimensional coding results in a substantially reduced amount of stem codes.

\section*{Pre-coordination}
- Pre-coordination refers to stem codes that contain all pertinent information about a clinical concept in a pre-combined fashion.
- stem codes that contain all pertinent information about a clinical concept in a precombined fashion
- For example:BD50.40 Abdominal aortic aneurysm with perforation.
- You can see that the "with perforation" is included in the stem code.
- This is an example of "pre-coordination" of a clinical concept.
- Conversely, the opposite of pre-coordination is post-coordination.

\section*{Post-Coordination}
- Post-coordination or cluster coding refers to the use of multiple codes, that is, stem codes and/or extension codes) together to fully describe a documented clinical concept.
- Post-coordination requires use of a convention, either a forward slash or ampersand, to show more than one ICD-11 code used together to describe a documented clinical concept.
- The example shown is a clinical concept/diagnosis recorded as: Duodenal ulcer with acute hemorrhage".
- Post-coordination is required to fully describe the documented clinical concept. DA63.Z represents "Duodenal ulcer, unspecified" and the forward slash is the convention used to link the other stem code ME24.90 Acute gastrointestinal bleeding, not elsewhere classified.
- You will remember that this is different from the convention of using an ampersand before an extension code when linking it to a stem code.
- Requires creating a cluster or cluster coding

\section*{Digital-friendly.}
- Fully embracing the digital age, ICD-11 is accompanied by a host of online and digital resources.
- Online resources include browsers of the Foundation Component and various linearizations and a coding tool for the Mortality and Morbidity Statistics linearization (MMS).
- Downloadable resources include maps between ICD-10 and ICD-11 and the MMS. Application programming interfaces (API) allow programmatic access to the Foundation Component, MMS, and ICD-10.
- There is also an online maintenance platform for collaborators in the update process.

\section*{The ICD-11 browser}

Current beta draft is the development tool for ICD-11
Not only a search tool, but also the mechanism to add proposals and comments after registering

Registered users are able to:
- Comment on the content
- Submit proposals for change
- Read comments and proposals from others
- Access PDF or Word versions of the classification

\section*{URLs}

URIs are identifiers
- They are unique worldwide

They look like web site URLs
* http://id.who.int/icd/entity/127637236

Clear, familiar format
They are used as:
- identifiers for ICD-11 entities
- endpoint of the web services

\section*{ICD-11 Coding tool}

This tool works by searching all ICD-11 terms and is essentially the ICD-11 index
Has links to the browser so the user can confirm location is correct for term being searched
Generates and dynamically updates two different outputs
- Word list
- Matched entities

\section*{ICD-11 reference guide}
- an instruction manual for life's task

Summary of key terms

\section*{Foundation}

ICD-11 has a foundation component providing the overarching repository/database whereby concepts can be drawn into specific classifications or linearization

\section*{Stem Code}

They are codes in a particular tabular list that can be used alone. Stem codes may be entities or groupings of high relevance, or clinical entities that should always be described as one entity.

\section*{Extension Code}

Extension codes have been designed to standardise the way additional information is added to stem codes, and the adoption of multi-dimensional coding results in a substantially reduced amount of stem codes.

\section*{Pre-coordination}

Pre-coordination refers to stem codes that contain all pertinent information about a clinical concept in a pre-combined fashion.

\section*{Post-coordination}

Post-coordination or cluster coding refers to the use of multiple codes, that is, stem codes and/or extension codes) together to fully describe a documented clinical concept.

\section*{Types of Classification}

A classification of diseases is a system of categories to which morbid entities are assigned according to established criteria.

Examples of criteria for classification:
- Aetiology (cause), e.g., bacteria
- Anatomical (site), e.g., fracture of femur, carcinoma of stomach
- Age of onset, e.g., neonatal jaundice, infantile colic
- Change in normal physiology, e.g., anaemia, renal failure
- Signs and symptoms, e.g., jaundice
- Prognosis, e.g., benign or malignant tumour

\section*{Principles of classification of diseases}
- A statistical classification of diseases must be confined to a limited number of mutually exclusive categories.
- The categories have to be chosen to facilitate the statistical study of disease phenomena.
- A specific disease entity that is of particular public health importance or that occurs frequently should have its own category.
- Every disease or morbid condition must have a well-defined place in the list of categories.
- A statistical classification of diseases should retain the ability both to identify specific disease entities and to allow statistical presentation of data for broader groups, to enable useful and understandable information to be obtained.

\section*{Historical Development of ICD and ICPM}

\section*{ICD}
- François Bossier de Lacroix (1706-1777), better known as Sauvages, was first to attempt to classify diseases systematically. Sauvages' comprehensive treatise was published under the title Nosologia methodica.
- A contemporary of Sauvages was the great methodologist Linnaeus (1707-1778), one of whose treatises was entitled Genera morborum.
- At the beginning of the 19th century, the classification of disease in most general use was one by William Cullen (1710-1790), of Edinburgh, which was published in 1785 under the title Synopsis nosologiae methodicae.
- Fortunately for the progress of preventive medicine, the General Register Office of England and Wales, at its inception in 1837, found in William Farr (1807-1883) - its first medical statistician - a man who not only made the best possible use of the imperfect classifications of disease available at the time, but laboured to secure better classifications and international uniformity in their use. Farr found the classification of Cullen in use in the public services of his day. It had not been revised to embody the advances of medical science, nor was it deemed by him to be satisfactory for statistical purposes.
- The utility of a uniform classification of causes of death was so strongly recognized at the first International Statistical Congress, held in Brussels in 1853, that the Congress requested William Farr and Marc d'Espine, of Geneva, to prepare an internationally applicable, uniform classification of causes of death. At the next congress, in Paris in 1855, Farr and d'Espine submitted two separate lists, which were based on very different principles. Farr's classification was arranged under five groups: epidemic diseases, constitutional (general) diseases, local diseases arranged according to anatomical site, developmental diseases and diseases that are the direct result of violence. d'Espine classified diseases according to their nature (gouty, herpetic, haematic, etc.). The congress adopted a compromise list of 139 rubrics.
- In 1864, this classification was revised in Paris, on the basis of Farr's model, and was subsequently further revised in 1874, 1880 and 1886.
- Although this classification was never universally accepted, the general arrangement proposed by Farr, including the principle of classifying diseases by anatomical site, survived as the basis of the International list of causes of death.
- The International Statistical Institute, the successor to the International Statistical Congress, at its meeting in Vienna in 1891, charged a committee, chaired by Jacques Bertillon (18511922), Chief of Statistical Services of the City of Paris, with the preparation of a classification of causes of death. It is of interest to note that Bertillon was the grandson of Achille Guillard, a noted botanist and statistician, who had introduced the resolution requesting Farr and d'Espine to prepare a uniform classification at the first International Statistical Congress in 1853. The report of this committee was presented by Bertillon at the meeting of the International Statistical Institute in Chicago in 1893 and adopted by it. The classification prepared by Bertillon's committee was based on the classification of causes of death used by the City of Paris, which, since its revision in 1885, represented a synthesis of English, German, and Swiss classifications.
- 1893: The first international classification edition, known as the International List of Causes of Death, was adopted by the International Statistical Institute.
- The Bertillon classification of causes of death, as it was first called, received general approval and was adopted by several countries, as well as by many cities.
- Bertillon continued to be the guiding force in the promotion of the International list of causes of death, and the revisions of 1900, 1910 and 1920 were carried out under his leadership. As Secretary-General of the International Conference, he sent out the provisional revision for 1920 to more than 500 people, asking for comments. His death in 1922 left the International Conference without a guiding hand.
- At the 1923 session of the International Statistical Institute, Michel Huber, Bertillon's successor in France, recognized this lack of leadership and introduced a resolution for the International Statistical Institute to renew its stand of 1893 in regard to the International classification of causes of death and to cooperate with other international organizations in preparation for subsequent revisions.
- Several versions followed but their focus was on the causes of death: International Classification of Causes of Death.
- The Fifth International Conference for the Revision of the International List of Causes of Death, like the preceding conferences, was convened by the Government of France and was held in Paris in October 1938. The conference approved three lists: a detailed list of 200 titles, an intermediate list of 87 titles and an abridged list of 44 titles. Apart from bringing the lists up to date in accordance with the progress of science, particularly in the chapter on infectious and parasitic diseases, and changes in the chapters on puerperal conditions and on accidents, the conference made as few changes as possible in the contents, number, and even the numbering of the items. A list of causes of stillbirth was also drawn up and approved by the conference. As regards classification of diseases for morbidity statistics, the conference recognized the growing need for a corresponding list of diseases to meet the statistical requirements of widely differing organizations, such as health insurance organizations,
hospitals, military medical services, health administrations and similar bodies. The following resolution, therefore, was adopted;
1. International Lists of Diseases
2. Death Certificate and Selection of Causes of Death where more than One Cause is given (Joint Causes)
- 1948: Creation of ICD. WHO was entrusted with the ICD at its creation and published the 6th version, ICD-6, that incorporated morbidity for the first time.
- The International Conference for the Seventh Revision of the International Classification of Diseases was held in Paris under the auspices of WHO, in February 1955. In accordance with a recommendation of the WHO Expert Committee on Health Statistics, this revision was limited to essential changes and amendments of errors and inconsistencies.
- The Eighth Revision Conference convened by WHO met in Geneva, from 6 to 12 July 1965. This revision was more radical than the seventh but left unchanged the basic structure of the classification and the general philosophy of classifying diseases, whenever possible, according to their etiology rather than a particular manifestation. During the years that the seventh and eighth revisions of the ICD were in force, the use of the ICD for indexing hospital medical records increased rapidly and some countries prepared national adaptations that provided the additional detail needed for this application of the ICD.
- The ICD expansion has continued ever since, with a steady increase in the number of categories for coding non-fatal conditions and other health-related circumstances.
- The International Conference for the Ninth Revision of the International Classification of Diseases, convened by WHO, met in Geneva from 30 September to 6 October 1975. In the discussions leading up to the conference, it had originally been intended that there should be little change other than updating of the classification.
- The final proposals presented to and accepted by the Conference retained the basic structure of the ICD, although with much additional detail at the level of the four-digit subcategories, and some optional five-digit subdivisions. For the benefit of users not requiring such detail, care was taken to ensure that the categories at the three-digit level were appropriate.
- 1990: the $10{ }^{\text {th }}$ revision (ICD-10) released and endorsed by the Forty-third World Health Assembly but came in use in May 1994.
- June 2018: 11 ${ }^{\text {th }}$ Revision (ICD-11) released. Endorsed by the Member States in the Seventy-second World Health Assembly in May 2019
- All countries expected to implement ICD-11 by January 2022

\section*{ICPM}
- The International Classification of Procedures in Medicine (ICPM) was a system of classifying procedure codes published by the World Health Organization from 1978, but never received the same international acceptance as ICD-9. Due to difficulties in the consultation processes, international development of the work effectively stopped in 1989.
- Only two volumes (Volume I containing 6 chapters and Volume II containing 3 Chapters were published by WHO in 1978.
- As a result, most nations developed their own standards for coding procedures and interventions incompatible to the ICPM approach. Germany's OPS-301 is based on the Dutch extension of ICPM; the ICPM-DE.
- Since 2012, the WHO began developing a replacement for ICPM called the International Classification of Health Interventions (ICHI). For those countries who didn't go on to develop their own classification of interventions, the WHO have generated a short list of procedure codes based on ICD-10-AM as an interim measure.

\section*{Current development ICD and ICPM}

The ICD is originally designed as a health care classification system, providing a system of diagnostic codes for classifying diseases, including nuanced classifications of a wide variety of signs, symptoms, abnormal findings, complaints, social circumstances, and external causes of injury or disease.

This system is designed to map health conditions to corresponding generic categories together with specific variations, assigning for these a designated code, up to six characters long. Thus, major categories are designed to include a set of similar diseases. ICD-11 is a major step forward, because it has the necessary terminological and ontological elements for seamless use in digital health.

The ICD is revised periodically and is currently in its 11th revision.In June 2018: $\mathbf{1 1}^{\text {th }}$ Revision (ICD-11) released. Endorsed by the Member States in the Seventy-second World Health Assembly in May 2019

All countries were expected to implement ICD-11 by January 2022.
Kenya officially migrated to ICD 11 use on $1^{\text {st }}$ July2022.

The ICPM surgical procedures fascicle was originally created by the United States, based on its adaptations of ICD (called ICDA), which had contained a procedure classification since 1962. ICPM is published separately from the ICD disease classification as a series of supplementary documents called fascicles (bundles or groups of items). Each fascicle contains a classification of modes of laboratory, radiology, surgery, therapy, and other diagnostic procedures. Many countries have adapted and translated the ICPM in parts or as a whole and are using it with amendments since then. The current version was released in 1978.

\section*{General Arrangement of ICD and ICPM Operations and their Application}

The ICD is a variable-axis classification. The structure of ICD structure was developed of that proposed by William Farr during early days of international discussions. According to him, for all practical, epidemiological purposes, statistical data on diseases should be grouped in the following way:
- Communicable diseases
- General diseases that affect the whole body
- Local diseases arranged by site
- Developmental diseases
- Injuries and external causes

\section*{Structure of ICD $\mathbf{1 0}$ Volumes}

\section*{Volume I- Tabular List}
- This contains the Report of the International Conference for the Tenth Revision, the classification itself at the three- and four-character levels, the classification of the morphology of neoplasms, special tabulation lists for mortality and morbidity, definitions, and the nomenclature regulations.
- This volume has an alphanumeric listing of all codes in the classification, organized into chapters.
- It contains inclusion and exclusion notes and coding rules.
- There are 22 chapters in the Tabular List and over 11400 four-character codes.

Most of Volume 1 is taken up with the main classification, composed of the list of three-character categories and the tabular list of inclusions and four-character subcategories.

The "core" classification - the list of three-character categories (Volume 1) - is the mandatory level for reporting to the WHO mortality database and for general international comparisons.

This core classification also lists chapter and block titles.
Volume 1 also contains the following:
- Morphology of neoplasms. The classification of morphology of neoplasms may be used, if desired, as an additional code to classify the morphological type for neoplasms which, with a few exceptions, are classified in Chapter II only according to behaviour and site (topography). The morphology codes are the same as those used in the special adaptation of the ICD for oncology (ICD-O) (1).
- Special tabulation lists. Because the full four-character list of the ICD, and even the threecharacter list, are too long to be presented in every statistical table, most routine statistics use a tabulation list that emphasizes certain single conditions and groups others. The four special lists for the tabulation of mortality are an integral part of the ICD. Lists 1 and 2 are for general mortality and lists 3 and 4 are for infant and child mortality (ages 0-4 years). There is also a special tabulation list for morbidity. These are set out in Volume 1.
- Definitions. The definitions in Volume 1 have been adopted by the World Health Assembly and are included to facilitate the international comparability of data.
- Nomenclature regulations. The regulations adopted by the World Health Assembly set out the formal responsibilities of WHO Member States regarding the classification of diseases and causes of death, and the compilation and publication of statistics.

\section*{General overview of Volume One}
- Refer to Chapter number NOT codes associated with it
- Some chapters use multiple code letter - Chapter II (contains letters C and D)
- Some code letters are split between chapters - Chapters VII and VIII (share the letter H)

Most Chapters are associated with specific body systems
Examples:
- Chapter XI - Diseases of the digestive system
- Chapter X - Diseases of the respiratory system

There are also special disease chapters to capture types of diseases which might affect either the whole body or many different sites

Examples:
- Chapter II - Neoplasms
- Chapter XV - Pregnancy, Childbirth and the Puerperium

Chapters for external factors such as:
- why a person was injured, how it happened
- contact with the health services not necessarily relating to ill-health

Examples:
- Chapter XX - External causes of morbidity \& mortality
- Chapter XXI - Factors influencing health status \& contact with health services

\section*{Volume II- Instruction Manual}

It contains an introduction to the classification and instructions on how to use the classification to code:
- Medical certificate of cause of death
- Hospital medical records and
- Other forms of health information

It specifically contains
- guidelines for certification and rules for mortality coding (i.e. causes of death)
- guidelines for recording and coding for morbidity data (e.g. hospital statistics)

\section*{Volume III}

An alphabetical list of the diseases and conditions which have codes in the Tabular List
There are more entries in the Index than there are in the Tabular List because some diseases have more than one name and some diseases are grouped under one code.

It consists of:
- Introduction i.e General arrangement of the index \& conventions used in the index
- The Alphabetical Index consists of three sections, as follows:

Section I is the index of diseases, syndromes, pathological conditions, injuries, signs, symptoms, problems and other reasons for contact with health services, i.e. the type of information that would be recorded by a physician. It includes all terms classifiable to categories A00-T98 and Z00-Z99 except drugs and other chemical substances giving rise to poisoning or other adverse effects (these are included in Section III).

Section II is the index of external causes of injury. The terms included here are not medical diagnoses but descriptions of the circumstances in which the violence occurred (e.g. fire, explosion, fall, assault, collision, submersion). It includes all terms classifiable to V01-Y98, except drugs and chemicals.

Section III is the index of drugs and other chemical substances giving rise to poisoning or other adverse effects (referred to in Sections I and II as the Table of drugs and chemicals). For each substance the Table gives the Chapter XIX code for poisoning (T36-T65) and the external cause (Chapter XX) codes for accidental poisoning by and exposure to noxious substances (X40-X49), intentional self-harm (X60-X69), and poisoning, undetermined whether accidental or intentional (Y10-Y19). For drugs, medicaments and biological substances, it also gives the code for these substances causing adverse effects in therapeutic use (Y40-Y59).

\section*{Structure of ICD 11}
- Has 26 chapters - Very similar to ICD-10 for the most part in overall structure
- one chapter for special use
- one chapter for traditional medicine;

✓ Module 1
✓ Module 2
- one section on functioning assessment
- one section extension codes
- Special tabulation lists (for analysis only, e.g. infections by agent)
- Special views
- Reference Guide = all information (formerly Volume 2)
- Coding tool or API (or print index).
- Four alphanumeric characters before the decimal point and up to three-character addition codes after the decimal

\section*{- 7 new chapters}

Format of New chapters include:
✓ Chapter 3 - Diseases of the Blood and Blood-forming Organs
✓ Chapter 4 - Disorders of the Immune System
✓ Chapter 6: Conditions of mental, behavioral and neurodevelopmental disorders.
✓ Chapter 7 - Sleep-Wake Disorders
✓ Chapter 17: Conditions related to Sexual Health
✓ Chapter 26 - Traditional Medicine
✓ X - Extension Codes
- ICD-11 : Alphanumeric codes: from 1A00 to ZZ9Z.ZZ
- An alphanumeric code with a letter in the second position and number in the third character position to differentiate from the codes of ICD-10
- Alphanumeric listing of diseases and disease groups

→ Grouping with specific purpose
- Add detail: Extension code and/or stem code
- Codes starting with an ' X ' indicate an extension code (more on extension codes later in the presentation)
- Hierarchy
- Chapters
- Groups of categories (blocks)
- character categories
- character subcategories
- character subdivisions
```
- O2 Neoplasms
    - Neoplasms of brain or central nervous system
        - zaOO primary neoplasms of brain
            Z ZAO.O Gliomas of brain
                2A00.00 Glioblastoma of brain
                2A00.OY Other specified gliomas of brain
                ZAOO.OZ Gliomas of brain. unspecified
```

- The letters ' $O$ ' and ' $I$ ' have been omitted to prevent confusion with the numbers ' 0 ' and ' 1 '.

Examples: GB60.0 Acute kidney failure, stage 1 3A71.Z Anaemia of chronic disease, unspecified

\section*{Structure of ICPM}
- The international Classification of Procedures in Medicine has a structure similar to that of the international classification of Diseases.
- Each volume contains a tabular list and an alphabetical index.
- The complete series of categories for the nine chapters are numbered from 1-100 to 9-823, the first digit denoting the chapter number. The classifications is significant at the three digit level; the fourth digit provides for greater detail and precision. Optional $5^{\text {th }}$ digit sub divisions are provided for in some categories.

\section*{Chapters of ICPM}

The ICPM has 2 Volumes and 9 Chapters.

\section*{Volume I}

It contains tabular list and Aphabetical index
Tabular list contains 6 Chapters namely;
1. Procedures for Medical Diagnosis
2. Laboratory Procedures
4. Preventive Procedures
5. Surgical Procedures
8. Other Therapeutic Procedures
9. Ancillary Procedures

\section*{Volume II}

Just like Volume I, it contains tabular list and alphabetical index.
The Tabular list contains 3 chapters namely;
3. Radiology and Certain Other Applications of Physics in Medicine

6 And 7. Drugs, Medicaments and Biological Agents

\section*{Application of ICD}

In practice, the ICD has become the international standard diagnostic classification for all general epidemiological and many health-management purposes.

These include analysis of the general health situation of population groups and monitoring of the incidence and prevalence of diseases and other health problems in relation to other variables, such as the characteristics and circumstances of the individuals affected.

\section*{Primary Arrangements of ICD}

The Index contains "lead terms", positioned to the far left of the column, with other words ("modifiers" or "qualifiers") at different levels of indentation under them.

In Section I, these indented modifiers or qualifiers are usually varieties, sites or circumstances that affect coding; in Section II they indicate different types of accident or occurrence, vehicles involved, etc.

Modifiers that do not affect coding appear in parentheses after the condition.

\section*{Main reasons for a new revision from ICD-10 to ICD-11}
- Need for scientific update, incorporating more definitions and 41,000 more codes than the previous version.
- Need for structural change to electronic format due to the introduction of electronic documentation in all areas of the health sector and in all work environments
- Convenience of connection with other terminological systems - Family of International Classifications.
- Imposition to improve the reproducibility of important clinical details of the conditions, thus obtaining better usability - more clinical details with less training.
- Enhanced user guidance. The enhancement in user orientation was based on pilot implementation projects.
- Need to capture more information, especially for morbidity purposes.
- ICD-10 is outdated both clinically and from a classification perspective

\section*{Differences between ICD 10 and ICD 11}

An alphanumeric code with a letter in the second position and number in the third character position to differentiate from the codes of ICD-10. The inclusion of a forced number at the third character position prevents spelling 'undesirable words'. A letter in the second character position allows for clear distinction between a code from ICD-11 and one from ICD-10. \\
Alphanumeric codes cover the range from 1A00.00 to ZZ9Z.ZZ. Codes starting with an ' X ' indicate an extension code (see Extension code chapter). The letters 'O' and 'I' are omitted to prevent confusion with the numbers ' 0 ' and ' 1 '.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline & The first character of a code is a letter and does not relate to the chapter number. The letter may have been the same for two short chapters (e.g. Chapter VII (H00-H5) and Chapter VIII (H60-H95), or two letters may have been used for one long chapter (e.g. Chapter XIX (S00T98)). & The first character of the code always relates to the chapter. A first character of 1-9 is used for chapters 01 through 09 and for chapters 10 through 26, the first character is a letter. The code range of a single chapter always has the same character in the first position. For example, 1A00 is a code in chapter 01, and BA00 is a code in chapter 11. \\
\hline & Residual category identified by numeric character . 8 and unspecified category identified by numeric character .9. & The terminal letter ' Y ' is reserved for the residual category 'other specified' and the terminal letter ' $Z$ ' is reserved for the residual category 'unspecified'. \\
\hline & Code cluster concept does not exist in ICD-10. & ICD-11 supports postcoordination and the linking codes within a code cluster. \\
\hline \multirow[t]{2}{*}{Terminology} & a range of expressions are used to describe a causal relationship between conditions in a code title & The preferred term is 'due to' for categories where two conditions are mentioned and causal sequence exists.

\hline & & - For morbidity, the definition of main diagnosis has changed to be 'the reason for admission, after assessment at the end of the stay’.

\section*{Summary of What's New in ICD 11}

\section*{New Concepts:}
- Foundation: Everything in ICD
- Entity: Each element in the foundation
- Linearization: also known as a Classification
- Stem code: Category (includes former 'dagger' codes)
- Extension code: Additional information
- Linearization parents: Classification hierarchy, Chapter, Block, Category

\section*{Content Model}
- ICD-11 categories have a short and a long definition
- All ICD-11 categories include separate information on anatomy, aetiology, and other aspects
- These can be accessed through searches, or when browsing in the tabular list

\section*{New Coding Scheme}
- The chapter numbering: now arabic numbers, not roman numerals
- The coding scheme for categories: now minimum 4 characters, 2 levels of subcategories
- Asterisk codes become Clinical forms or Extension codes
- Additional sub-classifications become Extension codes

\section*{Terminology}
- ICD-10 had a range of expressions to describe a causal relationship between conditions in a code title.
- In ICD 11, the preferred term is "due to"
- ICD-11 had a range of expressions indicating the coincidence of two conditions in a code title (e.g. "in" or "with")
- In ICD-11, the preferred term is "associated with".

Concepts of the "family" of disease and health related classification

\section*{The WHO Family of International Classifications in Health (WHOFIC)}

WHO-FIC has been created to-:
- provide a common framework,
- report
- compile
- compare health information at the national and international level.
- standardization and integration of health data

The reference family classification include;
- ICD: International Classification of Diseases, now $11{ }^{\text {th }}$ revision (ICD 11)
- ICHI: International Classification of Health Interventions
- ICF: International Classification of Functioning and Disability

\end{figure}

\section*{Reference classifications}

These are the classifications that cover the main parameters of the health system, such as death, disease, functioning, disability, health and health interventions. WHO reference classifications are a product of international agreements.

\section*{Derived classifications}

Derived classifications are based upon reference classifications. Derived classifications may be prepared by adopting the reference classification structure and classes, providing additional detail beyond that provided by the reference classification, or they may be prepared through rearrangement or aggregation of items from one or more reference classifications. Derived classifications are often tailored for use at the national or international level.

\section*{Related classifications}

Related classifications are those that partially refer to reference classifications, or that are associated with the reference classification at specific levels of the structure only. Procedures for maintaining, updating and revising statistical classifications of the family encourage the resolution of problems of partial correspondence among related classifications, and offer opportunities for increased harmony over time.

\section*{Diagnosis related classifications}

\section*{Special tabulation lists}

The special tabulation lists are derived directly from the core classification, for use in data presentation and to facilitate analysis of health status and trends at the international, national and subnational levels. The special tabulation lists recommended for international comparisons and publications are included in Volume 1. There are five such lists, four for mortality and one for morbidity

\section*{Specialty-based adaptations}

Specialty-based adaptations usually bring together, in a single, compact volume, the sections or categories of the ICD that are relevant to a particular specialty. The four-character subcategories of the ICD are retained, but more detail is often given by means of fifth-character or sometimes sixthcharacter subdivisions, and there is an Alphabetical index of relevant terms. Other adaptations may give glossary definitions of categories and subcategories within the specialty.

\section*{Oncology}

The third edition of the International classification of diseases for oncology (ICD-O-3), published by WHO in 2000, is intended for use in cancer registries, and in pathology and other departments specializing in cancer (1). ICD-O is a dual-axis classification with coding systems for both topography and morphology. For most neoplasms, the topography code uses the same threecharacter and four-character categories used in ICD-10 for malignant neoplasms (categories C00C80). ICD-O thus allows greater specificity of site for non-malignant neoplasms than is possible in ICD-10.

\section*{Dermatology}

In 1978, the British Association of Dermatologists published the International coding index for dermatology (5), which was compatible with the ninth revision of the ICD. The association has also published an adaptation of ICD-10 to dermatology, under the auspices of the International League of Dermatological Societies.

\section*{Dentistry and stomatology}

The third edition of the Application of the international classification of diseases to dentistry and stomatology (ICD-DA), based on ICD-10, was published by WHO in 1995 (6). It brings together ICD categories for diseases or conditions that occur in, have manifestations in, or have associations with the oral cavity and adjacent structures. It provides greater detail than ICD-10, by means of a fifth digit, but the numbering system is organized so that the relationship between an ICD-DA code and the ICD code from which it is derived is immediately obvious, and so that data from ICD-DA categories can be readily incorporated into ICD categories.

\section*{Neurology}

In 1997 WHO published an adaptation of ICD-10 to neurology (ICD-10-NA) (7), which retains the classification and coding systems of ICD-10 but is further subdivided at the fifth-character level and beyond, to allow neurological diseases to be classified with greater precision.

\section*{Rheumatology and orthopaedics}

The International League of Associations of Rheumatology is working on a revision of the Application of the international classification of diseases to rheumatology and orthopaedics (ICDR\&O), including the International classification of musculoskeletal disorders (ICMSD), to be compatible with ICD-10. The ICD-R\&O provides detailed specification of conditions through the use of additional digits, which allow for extra detail while retaining compatibility with ICD-10. The ICMSD is designed to clarify and standardize the use of terms and is supported by a glossary of generic descriptors for groups of conditions, such as the inflammatory polyarthropathies.

\section*{Paediatrics}

Under the auspices of the International Pediatric Association, the British Paediatric Association (BPA) has published an application of ICD-10 to paediatrics, which uses a fifth digit to provide greater specificity. This follows similar applications prepared by BPA for ICD-8 and ICD-9.

\section*{Mental disorders}

For each category in Chapter V of ICD-10 (Mental and behavioural disorders), The ICD-10 classification of mental and behavioural disorders: clinical descriptions and diagnostic guidelines, published by WHO in 1992, provides a general description and guidelines concerning the diagnosis, as well as comments about differential diagnosis and a listing of synonyms and exclusion terms (8). Where more detail is required, the guidelines give further subdivisions at the fifth- and sixth-digit levels. A second publication relating to Chapter V, The ICD-10 classification of mental and behavioural disorders: diagnostic criteria for research, was published in 1993 (9).

\section*{Non-diagnostic classifications}

\section*{Procedures in medicine}

The International classification of procedures in medicine (ICPM) was published in two volumes by WHO in 1978 (12, 13). It includes procedures for medical diagnosis, prevention, therapy, radiology, drugs, and surgical and laboratory procedures. The classification has been adopted by some countries, while others have used it as a basis for developing their own national classifications of surgical operations.

\section*{The International classification of functioning, disability and health}

The ICF was published by WHO in all six WHO official languages in 2001 (14), after its official endorsement by the 54th World Health Assembly on 22 May 2001. It has subsequently been translated into over 25 languages. The ICF classifies health and health-related states in two parts.

\section*{Part 1 classifies functioning and disability.}

Part 2 comprises environmental and personal contextual factors. Functioning and disability in Part 1 are described from the perspectives of the body, the individual and society, formulated in two components: (i) body functions and structures, and (ii) activities and participation. Since an individual's functioning and disability occur in a context, the ICF also includes a list of environmental factors.

The ICF has superseded the international classification of impairments, disabilities, and handicaps (ICIDH) (15). As a consequence, the old ICIDH terms and definitions have been replaced by the following new ICF terms and definitions:

Functioning is a generic term for body functions, body structures, activities and participation. It denotes the positive aspects of the interaction between an individual (with a health condition) and that individual’s contextual factors (environmental and personal factors).

Disability is an umbrella term for impairments, activity limitations and participation restrictions. It denotes the negative aspects of the interaction between an individual (with a health condition) and that individual’s contextual factors (environmental and personal factors).

Body functions are the physiological functions of body systems (including psychological functions).

Body structures are anatomical parts of the body, such as organs, limbs and their components.
Impairments are problems in body function or structure, such as a significant deviation or loss.
Activity is the execution of a task or action by an individual.
Activity limitations are difficulties an individual may have in executing activities. Participation is involvement in a life situation.

Participation restrictions are problems an individual may experience in involvement in life situations.

Environmental factors make up the physical, social and attitudinal environment in which people live and conduct their lives. The ICF uses an alphanumeric system in which the letters b, s, d and e are used to denote body functions, body structures, activities and participation, and environmental factors, respectively. These letters are followed by a numeric code that starts with the chapter number (one digit), followed by the second level (two digits), and the third and fourth levels (one digit each). ICF categories are 'nested' so that broader categories are defined to include more detailed subcategories of the parent category. Any individual may have a range of codes at each level. These may be independent or interrelated.

\section*{Advantages of ICD 11}
- Improved usability
- Reduced training time and cost
- Clinicians can search for diagnosis using natural or preferred terminology, which then relates this to the correct technical code
- Up to date scientific content
- Enable coding of all clinical detail
- The Coding Tool to be embedded into the local EHR and IT systems
- Linkage to relevant other classifications and terminologies
- Full multilingual support on translation and output

\section*{UNIT 2: PURPOSE OF DISEASE CLASSIFICATION}

\section*{Purpose of Disease Classification}
- To permit the systematic recording, analysis, interpretation and comparison of mortality and morbidity data collected in different countries or areas and at different times.
- To translate diagnoses of conditions and other health problems from words into an alphanumeric code, which permits easy storage, retrieval and analysis.

\section*{Importance of Classification of Diseases}
- It provides a common language for reporting and monitoring diseases. This allows the world to compare and share data in a consistent and standard way - between hospitals, regions and countries and over periods of time.
- It facilitates the collection, storage and retrieval of data for analysis and evidence-based decision-making.
- It allows systematic recording, analysis and interpretation of mortality and morbidity data.
- It allows standard comparison of data between hospitals, counties, regions, countries and globally
- It allows comparisons of morbidity and mortality in the same location across different time periods.

\section*{Uses of Diseases Classification}
- Epidemiological studies (Comparisons, Case definitions, Measure burdens of disease)
- Clinical research
- Health services planning and management
- Assessing the effectiveness of care
- Resource allocations

\section*{Conventions of ICD 10}

Conventions are certain abbreviations, punctuations, symbols and instructional terms which must be clearly understood and used universally

Must be understood for ensuring accuracy and uniformity of the codes

\section*{Inclusion Terms}

Inclusion terms refer to other important diagnostic terms or synonyms that are given in addition to the term provided

The diagnostic terms appears in notes ("Includes") at chapter, block, and category levels .e.g
International Nomenclature of Diseases (IND) defines and recommends a single name for each morbid condition or diagnosis

This means each name is applicable to only disease that is self-descriptive and based on the cause

\section*{J01 Acute sinusitis}

\section*{Includes: abscess \}}

\section*{empyema \}}
infection \}acute, of sinus (accessory)(nasal)
inflammation \}
suppuration \}
Use additional code (B95-B97), if desired, to identify infectious agent.
Excludes: sinusitis, chronic or NOS (J32.-)

\section*{J01.0 Acute maxillary sinusitis}

Acute antritis

\section*{J01.1 Acute frontal sinusitis}

\section*{J01.2 Acute ethmoidal sinusitis}

\section*{Exclusion Terms}

These are certain categories containing lists of conditions preceded by the word "Excludes"
These terms are to be coded elsewhere, not within this category as the code may suggest.

\section*{J01 Acute sinusitis}

\section*{Includes: abscess \}}
empyema \}
infection \}acute, of sinus (accessory)(nasal)
inflammation \}
suppuration \}
Use additional code (B95-B97), if desired, to identify infectious agent.
Excludes: sinusitis, chronic or NOS (J32.-)
J01.0 Acute maxillary sinusitis
Acute antritis
J01.1 Acute frontal sinusitis
J01.2 Acute ethmoidal sinusitis

\section*{Abbreviations}

\section*{NOS - Not Otherwise Specified}

When a diagnosis is single term that has no modifiers, it is said to be unspecified or not otherwise specified (NOS). The code assignment is that which follows the lead term.
e.g for a diagnosis of "anemia," the lead term for the condition is matched to the lead term "anemia" in the alphabetical index and code D64.9 is assigned for this condition

\section*{NEC - Not Elsewhere Classified}

The phrase "not elsewhere classified" (NEC) is used with ill-defined terms as a warning that the specified forms of the condition are classified differently.

The codes given for such terms should be used only if more precise information is not available.
e.g. K73 Chronic hepatitis, not elsewhere classified

\section*{V- Code -}

Assignment of a numeric code used for visits to health care professional for purposes other than for sickness e.g physicals, immunizations, pregnancies. Was used in ICD 9 for supplementary classification of factors influencing health status and contact with health services

\section*{M- Code-}

The morphology code for neoplasms is identical to that in the Systematized nomenclature of medicine (SNOMED) (2), which was derived from the 1968 edition of the Manual of tumor nomenclature and coding (MOTNAC) (3) and the Systematized nomenclature of pathology (SNOP) (4).

The morphology code has five digits; the first four digits identify the histological type and the fifth the behavior of the neoplasm (malignant, in situ, benign, etc.). The ICD-O morphology code also appear in Volume 1 of ICD-10 and are added to the relevant entries in Volume 3, the Alphabetical Index. Tables are available for the conversion of the ICD-O third edition codes to ICD-10.

\section*{E- Code}

It is used when a patient presents to a healthcare provider with an injury.

\section*{Symbols used in ICD-10}
- ICD uses the dagger to represent the primary code or underlying disease and is marked (" † ")
- The asterisk (*) represent the manifestation of the disease and is an optional code for the manifestation.
- In mortality coding, the asterisk convention and code are not used at all
- However, even though the dagger code is used, the code should be reported without the dagger
- There are 83 special asterisk categories in the classification, which are listed in the beginning of each relevant chapter.
- The Instruction Manual (volume 2 - page 26) provides a list of asterisks that should never be used alone.

\section*{Example}

A deceased who had tuberculosis and an abscess in the spine.
- In this case, tuberculosis (lead term), abscess (essential modifier), and spine (essential modifier) are shown as:

Tuberculosis, tubercular, tuberculous (caseous) (degeneration) (gangrene) (necrosis) A16.9
- with pneumoconiosis (any condition in J60-J64) J65
- abdomen (lymph gland) A18.3† K93.0*
- abscess NEC (respiratory) A16.9
- - bone A18.0 † M90.0*
- - - hip A18.0 † M01.1*
- - - knee A18.0 † M01.1*
- - - sacrum A18.0 † M49.0*
- - - specified site NEC A18.0 † M90.0*
- - - spine A18.0† M49.0*

\section*{Cross - References ("SEE" AND "SEE ALSO")}

Found in the Alphabetical Index
Used to avoid needless repetition of terms and should be followed carefully.
Example:

For the entry "Atheromatosis-see Arteriosclerosis," the word "see" is used here to refer the coder to the term "arteriosclerosis."

In the case of "Atheroma, atheromatous (see also Arteriosclerosis) I70.9," the phrase "see also" calls for the coder to refer to arteriosclerosis because the statement being coded contains other information that is not found indented under the term to which "see also" is attached.

\section*{Parentheses "()"}

Used in Tabular List to include additional words that may follow the diagnostic term without affecting the code number.

Examples:
Gonorrhea (acute) (chronic) A54.9
Hypertension (primary) (essential) I10
The words in parentheses do not affect the code.

\section*{Square Brackets"[ ]"}

Used to enclose synonyms, alternative words, or
A77 Spotted Fever [tick-borne rickettsioses]
B02 Zoster [herpes zoster]
Square brackets are also used to refer to previous notes or stated set of fourth character subdivisions.

\section*{Colon ":"}

Used when words that precede a listing in inclusion and exclusion terms are incomplete terms for the assignment of the rubric.

Example in the Tabular List:
A08.4 viral intestinal Infection, unspecified
Viral:

\section*{Enteritis NOS}

\section*{Gastroenteritis NOS}

\section*{Gastroenteropathy NOS}

In this example, enteritis by itself is incomplete, unless used by the term "viral."

\section*{Brace "\}"}

Used in listings of inclusion and exclusion terms to indicate that neither the words that precede those terms nor the words after them are complete terms.

Example:
A15.0 Tuberculosis of lung, confirmed by sputum microscopy with or without culture
Tuberculosis:
$\left.\begin{array}{l}\text { Bronchiectasis } \\ \text { Fibrosis of lung } \\ \text { Pneumonia }\end{array}\right\}$ Confirmed by sputum microscopy with or without culture
Pneumothorax

\section*{The use of "AND"}

In ICD, "and" is used for situation to denote that both conditions mentioned can be classified in the same way; or can be classified in another way as mentioned after the word "or."

Example:
A18.4 Tuberculosis of skin and subcutaneous tissue
In this case, "tuberculosis of skin" and "tuberculosis of subcutaneous tissue" can be classified either as a case of tuberculosis of skin or tuberculosis of subcutaneous tissue.

\section*{The Point Dash ".-"}

Point dash ".-" denotes the fourth character.

This is to show that a range of fourth characters are available and should be used.
These fourth characters may be identified either in a note in the index or in the relevant category in the Tabular List.

\section*{Code structure for ICD 11}
- The chapter numbering:

Arabic numbers not roman numerals
- The coding scheme for categories:
- minimum 4 characters, max 6 characters (i.e. 2 levels of subcategories
- Always a letter in the second position to distinguish from the codes of ICD-10
- Not using l,I (L,i); 0,O (Zero, o)
- Forced number at the 3rd character (prevent undesirable words)
- First character of the code always relates to the chapter number. 1-Z

\section*{Blocks and Categories of the ICD 10}

\section*{Blocks}

The ICD-10 is divided into chapters, based on diseases of body systems, special diseases or external factors.

The Chapters are further divided into blocks which group together categories having some common factor.

Blocks are divided into categories represented by three-character codes, and these in turn may be subdivided into codes with specific fourth characters.

Each chapter is divided into blocks of related conditions
Blocks are divided into three character categories
- first character is an alpha (A_Z)
- followed by 2 or 3 numeric characters

Example:
A37 - A is the Alpha A to Z and 37 is the Numeric Character (Two digits)

\section*{Three-character categories}

Within each block, some of the three-character categories are for single conditions, selected because of their frequency, severity or susceptibility to public health intervention, while others are for groups of diseases with some common characteristic.

There is usually provision for "other" conditions to be classified, allowing many different but rarer conditions, as well as "unspecified" conditions, to be included.

Three-character categories are further sub-divided into sub-categories to enable coding of a disease or condition more specifically

A37.1 - first character A to Z
- followed by 2 digits
- then a point
- lastly another digit(Referred to as fourth Character)

\section*{Four-character subcategories}

Although not mandatory for reporting at the international level, most of the three-character categories are subdivided by means of a fourth, numeric character after a decimal point, allowing up to ten subcategories.
Where a three-character category is not subdivided, it is recommended that the letter " X " be used to fill the fourth position so that the codes are of a standard length for data-processing.
The four-character subcategories are used in whatever way is most appropriate, identifying, for example, different sites or varieties if the three character category is for a single disease, or individual diseases if the three character category is for a group of conditions.
The fourth character .8 is generally used for "other" conditions belonging to the three-character category, and .9 is mostly used to convey the same meaning as the three-character category title, without adding any additional information.
When the same fourth-character subdivisions apply to a range of three-character categories, they are listed once only, at the start of the range. A note at each of the relevant categories indicates where the details are to be found. For example, categories O03-O06, for different types of abortion, have common fourth characters relating to associated complications (see Volume 1).
Supplementary subdivisions for use at the fifth or subsequent character level
37 \| P a g e

The fifth and subsequent character levels are usually sub classifications along a different axis from the fourth character. They are found in:

Chapter XIII - subdivisions by anatomical site
Chapter XIX - subdivisions to indicate open and closed fractures as well as intracranial, intrathoracic and intra-abdominal injuries with and without open wound
Chapter XX - subdivisions to indicate the type of activity being undertaken at the time of the event.

\section*{CHAPTER XVIII Symptoms, signs and abnormal clinical and laboratory findings, not elsewhere classified (R00-R99)}

This chapter includes symptoms, signs, abnormal results of clinical or other investigative procedures, and ill-defined conditions regarding which no diagnosis classifiable elsewhere is recorded.

Signs and symptoms that point rather definitely to a given diagnosis have been assigned to a category in other chapters of the classification. In general, categories in this chapter include the less well-defined conditions and symptoms that, without the necessary study of the case to establish a final diagnosis, point perhaps equally to two or more diseases or to two or more systems of the body. Practically all categories in the chapter could be designated 'not otherwise specified', 'unknown etiology' or 'transient'. The Alphabetical index should be consulted to determine which symptoms and signs are to be allocated here and which to other chapters. The residual subcategories, numbered .8 , are generally provided for other relevant symptoms that cannot be allocated elsewhere in the classification.

\section*{This chapter contains the following blocks:}

R00-R09 Symptoms and signs involving the circulatory and respiratory systems
R10-R19 Symptoms and signs involving the digestive system and abdomen

R95-R99 Ill-defined and unknown causes of mortality

\section*{CHAPTER XIX- Injury, poisoning and certain other consequences of external causes (S00-T98)}

The chapter uses the S-section for coding different types of injuries related to single body regions and the T-section to cover injuries to multiple or unspecified body regions as well as poisoning and certain other consequences of external causes.
Where multiple sites of injury are specified in the titles, the word "with" indicates involvement of both sites, and the word "and" indicates involvement of either or both sites.

The principle of multiple coding of injuries should be followed wherever possible. Combination categories for multiple injuries are provided for use when there is insufficient detail as to the nature of the individual conditions, or for primary tabulation purposes when it is more convenient to record a single code; otherwise, the component injuries should be coded separately. Reference should also be made to the morbidity or mortality coding rules and guidelines in Volume 2.
It contains 21 blocks namely;
S00-S09 Injuries to the head
Three character Categories examples

T90-T98 Sequelae of injuries, of poisoning and of other consequences of external causes

\section*{CHAPTER XX- External causes of morbidity and mortality (V01-Y98)}

This chapter, which in previous revisions of ICD constituted a supplementary classification, permits the classification of environmental events and circumstances as the cause of injury, poisoning and other adverse effects. Where a code from this section is applicable, it is intended that it shall be used in addition to a code from another chapter of the Classification indicating the nature of the condition.

Most often, the condition will be classifiable to Chapter XIX, Injury, poisoning and certain other consequences of external causes (S00-T98). Causes of death should preferably be tabulated according to both Chapter XIX and Chapter XX, but if only one code is tabulated then the code from Chapter XX should be used in preference. Other conditions that may be stated to be due to external causes are classified in Chapters I to XVIII. For these conditions, codes from Chapter XX should be used to provide additional information for multiple-condition analysis only.
It also contains Place of occurrence code
This is the fourth-character subdivisions are for use with categories W00-Y34 except Y06.- and Y07.- to identify the place of occurrence of the external cause where relevant:

It contains Activity code
This is the sub classification that is provided for optional use in a supplementary character position with categories V01-Y34 to indicate the activity of the injured person at the time the event occurred. This sub classification should not be confused with, or be used instead of, the recommended fourthcharacter subdivisions provided to indicate the place of occurrence of events classifiable to W00Y34.
It chapter contains 8 blocks namely;

\section*{V01-X59 Accidents}

\section*{CHAPTER XXI - Factors influencing health status and contact with health services (Z00-Z99)}

Categories Z00-Z99 are provided for occasions when circumstances other than a disease, injury or external cause classifiable to categories A00-Y89 are recorded as 'diagnoses' or 'problems'. This can arise in two main ways:
(a) When a person who may or may not be sick encounters the health services for some specific purpose, such as to receive limited care or service for a current condition, to donate an organ or tissue, to receive prophylactic vaccination or to discuss a problem which is in itself not a disease or injury.
(b) When some circumstance or problem is present which influences the person's health status but is not in itself a current illness or injury. Such factors may be elicited during population surveys, when the person may or may not be currently sick, or be recorded as an additional factor to be borne in mind when the person is receiving care for some illness or injury.

\section*{UNIT 4: CODING AND INDEXING MORBIDITY DATA AND RELATED RULES}

\section*{Coding}

\section*{Description}
- It is the translating of narrative descriptions of diseases, injuries and procedures into numeric codes
- The coding process involves assigning numbers to disease and procedural terms
- The principal source of coded information is the medical record. The medical record lists final diagnosis and operations and is completed by the attending doctor
- A code number for each disease and operation is recorded in the system by the medical records assistant

\section*{What to Code}
- Main condition or primary diagnosis
- Other or secondary conditions
- Procedures, operations and interventions
- External Causes of Injury (circumstances and specific sites of injury)

\section*{Examples of lead terms and modifiers}

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline Lead Term & Modifiers & \\
\hline Malaria & Plasmodium falciparum , Vivax & (type of condition) \\
\hline Fracture & Spine (site of the condition) & \\
\hline Gonorrhea & Acute, Chronic (Nature of & condition) \\
\hline Infection & Upper (site) respiratory (system & involved) \\
\hline Otitis & Acute (stage of condition) media & (location) \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\section*{Definition of terms}

Morbidity usually relates to a single episode of health care. An episode of health care may be defined as:
- A period of inpatient care,
or
- Contact (or a series of contacts in a specific time period) with a health care practitioner in relation to the same condition or its immediate consequences

Morbidity Coding is the assignment of diagnoses written in a medical record or other source document at the end of an episode of care, to the ICD standard

\section*{Description of terms}

\section*{Main condition}

For morbidity classification, the definition of main condition has been revised to:
- 'The one condition that is determined to be the reason for encounter or admission, established at the end of the episode of health care'.
- The definition of main condition relates to describing an episode of hospital-based care
- The main condition recorded should be accepted for coding and reporting
- unless it is obvious that the health care practitioner did not follow the guidelines for recording diagnostic information for morbidity data analysis
- Whenever possible, a record with an obviously inconsistent or incorrectly recorded main condition should be returned to the health care practitioner for clarification.
- If clarification of potential erroneous documentation is not possible,
- one of the morbidity coding rules for reselection of main condition can be applied by the clinical coder and
- the main condition reselected for reporting purposes.

\section*{Multiple conditions contributing to need for admission}
* Where an episode of health care concerns more than one condition contributing to the need for admission
- (e.g. congestive heart failure and pneumonia;
- acute cerebral haemorrhage and hip fracture
- multiple injuries - concussion, rib fracture, right femur fracture after MVA;
- or influenza A and Type 1 diabetic ketoacidosis),
- the health care practitioner should record/identify the main condition to be the one condition that is seemed to be most clinically significant reason for admission.

\section*{Other conditions}
- In addition to the main condition, documentation should also list separately all other conditions or problems dealt with during the episode of healthcare.

Other conditions are defined as: 'those conditions that coexist or develop during the episode of health care and affect the management of the patient'.
* Conditions related to an earlier episode that have no bearing on the current episode should not be recorded as other conditions.

\section*{Introduction on use of reference guide}

\section*{Link to Updates to ICD-11}

ICD-11 are available at:
https://icd.who.int/en

\section*{Morbidity Coding Responsibility}
- The clinician documents the diagnoses
- The coder translates the clinical documentation into code(s)
- The responsibility for accurate documentation rests with the treating clinician and the responsibility for accurate codes rest with the coder
- When coding a morbidity, case notes or discharge summary is used
- The coder should therefore consult with the certifier
- Do not use the case notes for mortality coding

NOTE: Coding rules for morbidity and mortality are different

\section*{Morbidity coding}

\section*{Introduction}
- ICD-11 allows for the classification of clinical concepts, to provide systematic and standardized recording, analysis, interpretation and comparison of morbidity data
- While some statistical reporting is conducted within a research context, it is also applied to inform health care system and public health care agency decision making, resource allocation, casemix, patient safety and quality of care, as well as primary care and research.
- To standardize production of morbidity data, ICD-11 has morbidity and sanctioning rules used in data collection, coding and classification.

The rules are for international reporting and analyzing purposes but are also recommended for standard national use.

\section*{Introduction to coding tool}
- The Coding Tool works by searching as the user continues typing in the search box
- Coding Tool generates (and dynamically updates) two different outputs as the search continues
- On the left side the Coding Tool shows a list of words.
- If you are in the middle of a word the system will try to guess the word that you are typing.
- Flexible search feature is used in cases where the Coding Tool's regular search do not return any results.

\section*{Sources of morbidity Data}
- Outpatient \& Maternal and child health services
- Occupational medical records
- In patient medical records
- Cancer and chronic disease registry records
- Institutional medical records (schools, colleges)
- Health surveys
- Cohort follow-ups in HDSS

\section*{Coder guidelines for selecting 'Main condition' and 'Other Conditions' for coding purposes Morbidity Coding Rule MB1: Several conditions recorded as 'main condition'}
- If several different conditions (that cannot be classified to a single stem code) are recorded as the 'main condition', and other details on the record point to one of them being the 'main condition' (one condition determined to be the reason for admission established at the end of the episode of care), select that condition; otherwise, select the condition first recorded.
- If there is the desire to also report other discharge diagnosis types i.e. main resource condition or initial reason for encounter or admission, then the applicable extension code(s) from Section X Extension codes, should be assigned to indicate the different types of discharge diagnosis that are reported.

\section*{Morbidity Coding Rule MB1: Example 1}
- A patient who has a history of Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) was admitted for a biopsy of the prostate. Patient was evaluated for COPD. Biopsy was performed and the final diagnosis from pathology results was benign prostatic hypertrophy.
- Main condition as per the patient discharge summary:

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), hypertrophy of prostate.

\section*{Answer}

Main condition: GA90 Hyperplasia of prostate

\section*{Other condition(s):}

CA22.Z Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, unspecified
In this example, one condition was determined to be the reason for admission, established at the end of the episode of care. That is, benign prostatic hypertrophy.

COPD is coded as an 'other condition', as the physician documented that it had affected the management of the patient

\section*{Example 2}
* A patient is admitted to the hospital with pneumonia and congestive heart failure.
- Main condition as per the patient discharge summary: Pneumonia and congestive heart failure.

\section*{Answer}

Main condition: CA40.Z Pneumonia, organism unspecified
Other condition(s): BD10.Z Congestive heart failure, unspecified
In this example, two conditions have been recorded as the main condition and querying the health care practitioner is not possible. There are no other details on the record that point to one of the conditions as being the main condition.

In this instance, the coder should assign a code for the first listed condition, that is, pneumonia. Congestive heart failure is coded as the 'other condition'.

\section*{Morbidity Coding Rule MB2: Condition recorded as 'main condition' is presenting symptom of diagnosed, treated condition}

If a symptom or sign or a problem is recorded as the 'main condition', and this is obviously the presenting sign, symptom or problem of a diagnosed condition recorded elsewhere and care was given for the latter, reselect the diagnosed condition as the 'main condition'.

\section*{Morbidity Coding Rule MB2: Example 3}
- The patient presents to hospital with abdominal pain. Investigations reveal acute appendicitis with localised peritonitis and the patient undergoes an appendicectomy.
* Main condition as per the patient discharge summary: Abdominal pain
* Other condition(s) as per the patient discharge summary: Acute appendicitis with localised peritonitis

\section*{Answer}

\section*{Main condition:}

\section*{DB10.01 Acute appendicitis with localised peritonitis}

In this example, the symptom 'abdominal pain' was recorded as the main condition, however it was determined to be caused by the appendicitis.

Therefore, the coder should reselect and code acute appendicitis with localised peritonitis as the 'main condition'.

\section*{Morbidity Coding Rule MB3}
- Signs and symptoms recorded as 'main condition' with alternative conditions recorded as the cause
- Where a symptom or sign is recorded as the 'main condition' with documentation that it may be due to either one condition or another, select the symptom or sign as the 'main condition'.

\section*{Morbidity Coding Rule MB3: Example 4}

A patient is admitted to the hospital with a headache.
* Main condition as per the patient discharge summary:

Headache due to tension or acute sinusitis.

\section*{Answer}

Main condition: MB6Y Other specified symptoms or signs involving the nervous system
In this example, the symptom 'headache' is recorded as the main condition, with two possible causes. Therefore, the coder should code headache as the 'main condition'.

\section*{Other morbidity coding guidelines}

\section*{Additional guidance on morbidity coding is given in the ICD-11 User Guide.}

\section*{Morbidity coding exercises}
1.A patient was admitted with complaints of fever, chills, severe headache and stiff neck.
-Following investigation, a diagnosis of staphylococcal meningitis was confirmed. While in hospital the patient developed pneumonia. Two conditions have been recorded as the main condition and querying the health care practitioner was not possible.
-Identify:
(i)Main condition
(ii)Other condition
2.A patient admitted to hospital at $\mathbf{3 5}$ weeks' gestation with spontaneous premature rupture of membranes (ROM). Patient is not having any contractions. Examination reveals the baby is in breech presentation; therefore, immediate delivery by caesarean section was undertaken.

\section*{Main condition as per the patient discharge summary:}

Preterm ROM with breech presentation requiring caesarean.
Identify:
(i)Main condition
(ii)Other condition
3. The patient presents to the hospital with a complaint of haematuria. Investigations reveal a papilloma in the posterior wall of the bladder as the cause of the haematuria. The papilloma was excised by diathermy.

Identify:
(i)Main condition

\section*{Coder use of extension codes}

Extension codes should never be used alone and must always be linked to a stem code. One or more extension codes can be linked when coding a specific condition. Extension codes are provided for use as supplementary or additional codes when it is desired to identify more detail in entities classified elsewhere.

\section*{There are two main types of Extension codes:}

Type 1 extension codes allow the user to add detail to a stem code. The category refers to the same diagnosis with or without the Type I extension code. These extension codes provide important additional information, such as whether a condition is acute or chronic - and where it is located.

Type 2 extension codes represent diagnosis code descriptors. The meaning of the code refers to the same condition, but the use of type 2 - diagnosis code descriptor extension code alters its interpretation.

\section*{HEALTH DATA CLASSIFICATION II}

\section*{UNIT 1: INTERNATIONAL FORM OF MEDICAL CERTIFICATE OF CAUSE OF DEATH CLASSIFICATION}

\section*{Description}

What is Medical Certification of Cause of Death (MCCoD)-
MCCoD is the assignment of a cause of death by an authorised medically trained clinician who fully understands the clinical sequelae of disease or injury that led to death.

MCCoD provides a cause of death statement: cause-of-death statement consists of the wording written in the format used on a death certificate to indicate the cause(s) of death and other significant conditions that contributed to death.

\section*{Definition of terms}

\section*{What is cause of death?}

Cause of death refers to all those diseases, morbid conditions or injuries which either resulted in or contributed to death and circumstances surrounding them.

Causes of death is defined as "all those diseases, morbid conditions or injuries which eitherresulted in or contributed to death and the circumstances of the accident or violence which produced any such injuries".

Definition of cause of death does not include symptoms, Signs and modes of dying such as cardiorespiratory arrest and respiratory failure.

Several underlying causes can be attributed to death but only one underlying cause should be identified and written in the death certificate.

Selection of the underlying cause of death is based on the principles of preventing the primary or underlying cause of death had there been effective preventive programs.

Certification of cause of death refers to assignment of a cause of death by an authorisedmedically trained clinician who fully understands the clinical sequence of conditions.

Death certificate is an official legal document and vital record signed by an authorised Registrarof Births and Deaths that includes cause of death and deceased person's demographics as later entered in an official register of death

The immediate cause of death is the final disease, injury, or complication that directly caused death.

The antecedent or intermediary cause of death is the condition(s) that led to or precipitated the immediate cause of death but occurs at the time between underlying cause of death and immediate cause of death.

The underlying cause of death is the disease or injury (or poisoning) that initiated the chain of events that led directly and inevitably to death.

Underlying Cause of death can also be defined as;
The disease or injury which initiated the train of morbid events leading directly to death, or The circumstances of the accident or violence which produced the fatal injury".

\section*{Sequence}

The term "sequence" refers to two or more conditions entered on successive lines of Part I, each condition being anacceptable cause of the one entered on the line above it.

Example 1: I (a) Bleeding of oesophageal varices
Portal hypertension
Liver cirrhosis
Hepatitis B
If there is more than one cause of death in a line of the certificate, it is possible to have more than one reportedsequence. In the example below, four sequences are reported:

Example 2: I Coma
(
a)
(b) Myocardial infarction and cerebrovascular accident
(c) Atherosclerosis Hypertension

The sequences are:

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline Atherosclerosis & (leading to) myocardial infarction & (leading to) coma; \\
\hline Atherosclerosis & (leading to) cerebrovascular accident & (leading to) coma; \\
\hline Hypertension & (leading to) myocardial infarction & (leading to) coma; \\
\hline Hypertension & (leading to) cerebrovascular accident & (leading to) coma; \\

\section*{Importance of death certification (D1)}

To enable the deceased family to register death (process death certification) for the purposeof giving the information about the death.

To establish death or absence of life from a person
To establish the cause(s) of death
To process the burial arrangement of the deceased.
To guide and direct health programs through causes of death analysis to establish the prevention measures to overcome death.

\section*{Terms related to mortality}

MMR- Maternal mortality rate $=$ Maternal deaths (direct and indirect) $\times \mathrm{k}$
Live births
A maternal death is the death of a woman while pregnant or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy, irrespective of the duration and the site of the pregnancy, from any cause related to or aggravated by the pregnancy or its management, but not from accidental or incidental causes

Still births- A baby who dies after 28 weeks of pregnancy, but before or during birth,

\section*{Selecting the Underlying Cause of Deaths}

\section*{Find the Starting Point (Steps Sp1 to Sp8)}

\section*{Definition of Starting point}

The starting point is the condition or event that started the sequence of acceptable causal relationships ending with the terminal cause of death. In a correctly completed certificate, the condition reported on the lowest used line in Part 1 is the starting point of the sequence

To identify the starting point, follow the eight steps specified in this section. The steps are named SP1 to SP8 (Starting point rule 1 to Starting point rule 8). Each step contains one selection rule. At each step, there is a description of the selection rule itself and an instruction on what to do next. For some of the rules, there are also bullet points with more detailed instructions.

\section*{Step SP1 - Single cause on certificate}

If there is only one condition reported on the certificate, in either Part 1 or Part 2, this is the starting point and it is also the underlying cause. Next, go to Step M4. If there are two or more conditions on the certificate, go to Step SP2.

\section*{Step SP2 - Only one line used in Part 1}

If the certifier has used only one line in Part 1 but entered two or more conditions on this line, then the first-mentioned condition is the tentative starting point. Next, go to Step SP6.

Step SP3 - More than one line used in Part 1, first cause on lowest line explains all entries above
If there are conditions reported on more than one line in Part 1, check whether all of the conditions reported on the line(s) above the lowest used line in Part 1 can be caused by the first condition on the lowest used line. If all conditions on the line(s) above the lowest used line in Part 1 can be caused by the first condition on the lowest used line, then this condition is tentatively - the starting point. Next, go to Step SP6

Step SP4 - First cause on lowest used line does not explain all entries above, but a sequence ends with the terminal condition

If there is only one sequence ending with the terminal condition, find the starting point of this sequence. This is the new tentative starting point. Next, go to Step SP6.

If there are two or more sequences of conditions or events ending with the terminal condition, identify the first-mentioned sequence as described in Section 4.1.3, and find the starting point of this first-mentioned sequence. Next, go to Step SP6

If there is no sequence ending with the terminal condition, go to Step SP5
Step SP5 - No sequence in Part 1
If there is no sequence ending with the terminal condition, then the terminal condition is also the tentative starting point. Next, go to Step SP6

\section*{Step SP6 - Obvious cause}

Now check whether the tentative starting point you selected in Steps SP1 to SP5 obviously was caused by another condition on the certificate. If the tentative starting point is in Part 1, then this other condition must be either on the same line, further down in Part 1, or in Part 2. If the tentative starting point is in Part 2, this other condition must also be in Part 2. Next, check whether there is another condition mentioned on the same line or further down on the certificate as the new tentative starting point you just identified that obviously caused this new tentative starting point. Continue looking for a new tentative starting point until you find a starting point that is not obviously caused by a condition reported on the same line or further down on the certificate. Then go to Step SP7

\section*{Step SP7 - Ill-defined conditions}

Now check whether the tentative starting point is listed in the table of ill-defined conditions (see Annex 7.3, List of ill-defined conditions).

If it is, the tentative starting point is considered ill-defined. Then do as follows: If there are other conditions reported on the certificate, check whether they are all ill-defined. If all other conditions are ill-defined, go to Step M1

If there is at least one condition that is not ill-defined, then disregard the ill-defined condition.
Go to Step SP1 and select another starting point, as if the ill-defined condition had not been mentioned on the certificate.

If the tentative starting point is not ill-defined, go to Step SP8

\section*{Step SP8 - Conditions unlikely to cause death}

Next, check whether the tentative starting point is listed in the table of conditions unlikely to cause death (see Annex 7.4, List of conditions unlikely to cause death). If it is, do as follows.

If there are other conditions reported on the certificate, check whether they are all ill-defined or unlikely to cause death. If they are all ill-defined or unlikely to cause death, go to Step M1.

If there are other conditions reported that are not ill-defined or unlikely to cause death, first check whether the death was caused by a reaction to treatment of the condition unlikely to cause
death that you selected as the tentative starting point. If it was, then select the reaction to treatment as the starting point. Next, go to Step M1.

If the death was not caused by a reaction to treatment of the condition unlikely to cause death, check whether the condition was the cause of another condition that is not on the list of conditions unlikely to cause death and that is not ill-defined. If it was, then the condition unlikely to cause death is still the tentative starting point. Next, go to Step M1.

If there was no reaction to treatment and no complication of the condition unlikely to cause death, then disregard the condition unlikely to cause death. Go to Step SP1 and select another starting point, as if the condition unlikely to cause death had not been mentioned on the certificate

\section*{Description of Modification}

Special coding instructions on specific sequences and ICD categories may have the effect that a condition other than the starting point is selected as the underlying cause of death for use in the statistics. In such cases, the code for underlying cause often expresses a combination of the starting point with another reported condition, or a complication or consequence of the starting point that is of particular importance to public health. The procedure by which the ICD code for the starting point is replaced by another code is called modification

\section*{Check for modifications of the starting point}

\section*{Step M1 - Special instructions}

Check whether special coding instructions apply to the tentative underlying cause. If a special coding instruction applies, assign a new tentative underlying cause according to the instruction. Next, check whether any special instructions apply to this new tentative underlying cause. That is, reapply Step M1. Repeat until you have found a tentative underlying cause that is not affected by any further special coding instruction. Next, go to Step M2.

\section*{Step M2 - Specificity}

If the tentative underlying cause describes a condition in general terms and a term that provides more precise information about the site or nature of this condition is reported on the certificate, this more informative term is the new tentative underlying cause. Next, check whether this new tentative underlying cause can be specified even further by other terms on the death certificate. That is, reapply Step M2. Repeat until you have found a tentative underlying cause that cannot be specified further

Step M3 - Recheck Steps SP6, M1 and M2

If, at this point, the tentative underlying cause is not the same as the starting point you selected using Steps SP1 to SP8, then go back to Step SP6. Repeat the procedures described in Steps SP6, M1 and M2
- Do not go back to Step SP6 if the cause selected in Step M1 or M2 is correctly reported as due to another condition, except when this condition is ill-defined.
- Also, do not go back to Step SP6 if the tentative underlying cause is a reaction to treatment of a condition unlikely to cause death, as selected in Step SP8.

Step M4 - Instructions on medical procedures, poisoning, main injury and maternal deaths
Finally, apply the following instructions to the underlying cause you have arrived at:
- If the underlying cause you arrived at by applying Steps SP1 to SP8 and Steps M1 to M3 is surgery or another type of medical procedure, apply the instructions in Section 4.2.9, Special instructions on surgery and other medical procedures (Step M4).
- If the underlying cause you arrived at by applying the selection and modification rules in Steps SP1 to SP8 and Steps M1 to M3 is an injury or poisoning (a code in S00-T98), code the external cause of the injury or poisoning as the underlying cause of death.
- If the underlying cause is in Chapter XX, External causes of morbidity and mortality, also select a main injury. See the instructions in Section 4.2.6, Special instructions on main injury in deaths from external causes (Step M4).
- If the starting point you selected by applying Steps SP1 to SP8 and Steps M1 to M3 is poisoning, and more than one toxic substance is reported on the certificate, apply the instructions in Section 4.2.7, Special instructions on poisoning by drugs, medicaments and biological substances (Step M4), to identify the most important drug involved.
- If the decedent is a woman, and pregnancy, childbirth or puerperium is reported on the certificate, determine whether to code the underlying cause to Chapter XV, Pregnancy, childbirth and the puerperium, according to the instructions in Section 4.2.8, Special instructions on maternal mortality (Step M4). When you have found a cause of death that is not further changed in either Step SP6 or Steps M1 to M3, you have arrived at the underlying cause of death.

\section*{Steps of completing medical certificate}

Part I: Immediate cause- always recorded at line I (a). This may be the onlycondition recorded if there are no other conditions in the sequence

Other conditions leading to I (a) are entered in sequence on lines (b), (c) and (d)with the underlying cause on lowest line

Part II: used to record all other significant or contributory diseases or conditionsthat were present at the time of death but which was not part of the sequence in Part I

Duration: Interval between onset of the condition and the date of death is recordedon the right hand side of the certificate

MUST be entered for all conditions especially part I
Interval is established by the clinician
Either minutes, hours, days, weeks, months or years
If unknown or cannot be determined, write "unknown"

\section*{Importance of COD statistics}

✓ Reliable cause-specific mortality statistics is required on a regular basis by Administrators, Policy makers, Planners, Researchers and other Professionals for:

✓ Evidence-based decision-making with regard to resource allocation,
✓ Monitoring of indicators,
✓ Identifying the priorities for programs and other related activities in the area of Public Health

Social proposes: Legal document for burial; processing insurance; processing inheritance and settlements.

\section*{Statistical purposes:}
- Assessment of general health status of the population
- Explaining levels, trends and differentials in mortality.
- Identifying emerging diseases and their impact.
- Monitor the impact of public health programmes.
- Guide resource allocation and prioritization of interventions.
- Identify and contribute to epidemiological, sociomedical and biomedical research priorities
- Others e.g. update national database.

\section*{Sources Of Death Data}

The main source of mortality data is the:
Medical certificate of cause of death (D1)

Other sources include:

Civil registration data from the community (D2)
verbal Autopsy

\section*{Role of HRIO in death certification}
- Issuing of Burial permit
- Translating the underlying cause of death into code(s)
- Dispatching the filled medical certificate cause of death to the civil registrar of persons office.
- Storage of duplicate D1 Upper part(burial permit)

\section*{Challenges of data on causes of death}
- Missing date of death
- Wrong spelling
- Use of suspected or possible
- Writing many condition on the same line
- Writing two unrelated disease condition one line
- Writing mode of dying
- Adding notes, that will crowd the certificate
- Typing mistake

\section*{UNIT 2: MORTALITY CODING RULES AND GUIDELINE FOR CODING SPECIAL CONDITIONS MORTALITY CODING RULES}

\section*{Definitions}

Mortality coding involves two components:
The correct assignment of ICD codes to the conditions reported on death certificates of cause of death (COD),

The correct application of mortality coding rules when selecting the underlying cause of death (UCOD).

In ICD terminology, 'underlying' cause of death is the disease or injury that initiated the sequence of events that led directly to death.

Mortality Coding is done using ICD-11 coding standards. This could be done either via:
High breed system of coding in which a trained coder applies the ICD-11 coding standards.
Or
Automated system in which a software assigns the ICD codes for the diseases and procedures documented in the medical records.

\section*{Mortality Coding Rules}

\section*{General Principle:}

When more than one condition is entered on the certificate, select the condition entered alone on the lowest used line of Part I only if it could have given rise to all the conditions entered above it.

\section*{Example 1: (a) Malaria}

Select malaria (1F4Z)

\section*{Example 2: (a) Abscess of lung}
(b) Lobar pneumonia

Select lobar pneumonia (CA40.Z)

\section*{Example 3: (a) Hepatic failure}
(b) Bile duct obstruction
(c) Carcinoma of head of pancreas

Select carcinoma of head of pancreas (2C10.Z\&XA1412)

\section*{Example 4: (a) Cerebral haemorrhage}
(b) Hypertension
(c) Chronic pyelonephritis
(d) Bladder outlet obstruction

\section*{(e) Prostatic adenoma}

Select prostatic adenoma (2F34)

\section*{Rule 1:}

If the General Principle does not apply and there is a reported sequence terminating in the condition first entered on the certificate, select the originating cause of this sequence. If there is more than one sequence terminating in the condition mentioned first, select the originating cause of the first-mentioned sequence.

Example of rule 1
a) Bronchopneumonia
(b) Cerebral infarction and hypertensive heart disease
the physician certified that there are two reported sequences terminating in the condition first entered on the certificate;
certifier has broken the rule by giving two conditions therefore the General Principle does not apply.

The originating cause of the first-mentioned sequence is selected.
Rule 1 is used to select cerebral infarction (8B11.5Z)

\section*{Rule 2:}

If there is no reported sequence terminating in the condition first entered on the certificate, select the first-mentioned condition.
1. Rheumatic and atherosclerotic heart disease

The General Principle and Rule 1 do not apply, why?
Select rheumatic heart disease (BC20.1). There is no reported sequence, both conditions are on the same line

Pernicious anaemia and gangrene of foot
Atherosclerosis
Select pernicious anaemia (3A01.30). There is no reported sequence terminating in the first entered condition.
3. Fibrocystic disease of the pancreas

Bronchitis and bronchiectasis
Select fibrocystic disease of the pancreas (CA25.Z). There is no reported sequence.

\section*{Rule 3:}

If the condition selected by the General Principle or by Rule 1 or Rule 2 is obviously a direct consequence of another reported condition, whether in Part I or Part II, select this primary condition.

Example
I Kaposi's sarcoma
II HIV Disease
Select HIV disease resulting in Kaposi's sarcoma (1C62.3)

I Tuberculosis
II HIV disease
Select HIV disease resulting in mycobacterial infection (1C60.Z)

\section*{GUIDELINE FOR CODING SPECIAL CONDITIONS}

\section*{Mortality Coding Procedure}

Specific chapters relate to disease burden and also preventable causes of death
They include:
- Infectious \& parasitic diseases - priority diseases
- Maternal \& perinatal conditions - preventable
- Neoplasms (tumors) - on the rise \& requires early diagnosis
- External causes (Injuries/poisoning/accidents) - preventable
- Specific diseases such as hypertension - preventable/NCDs

\section*{Infectious and parasitic diseases}

Includes certain conditions caused by pathogenic organisms or microorganisms, such as bacteria, viruses, parasites or fungi.

If causative agent is known it should be recorded, if unknown, write "cause unknown"
Include the site of infection, if known e.g. urinary tract

\section*{Maternal and perinatal deaths}

Perinatal: from 28 completed weeks of gestation including 7 days after birth
Maternal: Pregnancy to 42 days after termination
Pregnancy: Death during pregnancy or within 42 days of the termination of a pregnancy, even if the direct cause of death is not related to the pregnancy or to childbirth should be coded under
'Chapter 18 Pregnancy, childbirth or the puerperium' 'The fact the woman was pregnant should be recorded in the medical certificate of cause of death e.g, Entry on Part II of the certificate reading "Pregnant, period of gestation 26 weeks"

Perinatal deaths: Used for conditions which initially arise in the perinatal period (from 28 completed weeks of gestation up to, and including 7th day after birth)

Includes maternal conditions which may have affected the baby e.g. trauma occurring at birth
Registration of death of a fetus is filled on the birth registration form (B1); the birth notification form serves as a burial permit

Conditions to be coded under ''Chapter 19 Certain conditions originating in the perinatal period"

\section*{Example}

A male new born of spontaneous delivery in poor condition (Apgar score of 2 ) dying 3 hours after delivery. The pregnancy was normal up to the eighth month, when the mother started to present with vaginal hemorrhage, not seeking assistance during the first 24 hours. She was then taken to the hospital where she was admitted with pre-shock. The diagnosis made was abruptio placentae. The baby was born cyanotic with signs of anoxia.

\section*{Death certificate}

I a) ANOXIA 3 HOURS
b) ABRUPTIO PLACENTAE 2 DAYS
c) $\_\_\_\_$
d) $\_\_\_\_$
II $\_\_\_\_$
NB: Codes in (Chapter 18 Pregnancy, childbirth or the puerperium) take precedence over body system chapters i.e. If a condition that is normally coded to another chapter occurs in a pregnant patient or is exacerbated by pregnancy, use a code from Chapter 18

\section*{Neoplasms(tumors)}

Use ICD 11 to identifying the correct set of codes
Record the following:
- behavior (malignant, benign, in situ)
- anatomical site
- primary or secondary (if known), even if the primary site was removed long before death
- morphology (histology or cell type if known)
e.g. malignant adenocarcinoma of breast (primary site) with secondaries to lung
If a diagnosis does not specify if a site is primary or secondary, assume primary

NB: Neoplasms- if a diagnosis does not specify if a site is primary or secondary, assume primary

\section*{Injuries poisoning and accidents}
- Underlying cause $=$ external cause (i.e. resulted directly or indirectly from environmental events or circumstances that caused injury/poisoning/other adverse effects)
- Be as descriptive as possible e.g. "motor traffic accident" is not sufficiently accurate; "multiple fractures, in a pedestrian hit by motor car on road pavement" is both clear and accurate

Must include:
- Nature of injury ( e.g. fracture, laceration)
- Circumstance/mechanism/external cause ( e.g. motor vehicle crash involving a driver or passenger or fall from ladder or hanging or gunshot wounds)
- Place of injury and specific site of injury - where the injured person was when the injury event started
- Activity (e.g. burns while cooking)

External causes of injury (Chapter 23)
- 23 External causes of morbidity or mortality
- Unintentional causes
- Intentional self-harm
- Assault
- Undetermined intent
- Exposure to extreme forces of nature
- Maltreatment
- Legal intervention
- Armed conflict
- Causes of healthcare related harm or injury PL2Y Other specified external causes of morbidity or mortality PL2Z External causes of morbidity or mortality, unspecified

\section*{Guidelines on recording of injuries, poisoning and external cause of death}

The circumstances of death from e.g;
Accident
Suicide External cause of death.
Homicide
When death occurs as a consequence of injury or violence, the external cause should be listed as the underlying cause.

Recording the underlying cause of death

\section*{Causes of death}

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline Immediate cause of death & A). ACUTE HEMORRHAGE & HOURS \\
\hline Antecedent cause & B). RUPTURE OF THE SPLEEN & HOURS \\
\hline Underlying cause & C). HIT BY A MOTORCYCLE WHILE CROSSING THE ROAD & 1 DAY \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
N.B: External/Underlying cause of death can be prevented

The external cause should be described in as much detail as possible; e.g.
"Motor traffic accident" is not sufficiently correct. However,
"Pedestrian hit by a motor car" is both clear and accurate.
In a case of suicide, entering "suicide" is insufficient. The method of suicide should be entered. For example "suicidal death by hanging" is a clear description.

Cause of death information should be cross referenced against free text narrative against the injury.

Detailed information describing the injury.
The narrative data using key words should provide detailed problem definition to inform prevention
e.g. key words such as fall, suicide, pedestrians.
N.B: The prevention should address the underlying causes of death, e.g.
it is easy to control the underlying cause of death; Motor vehicle accidents, suicide and homicide cases but we may not control the immediate cause of death.

\section*{Hypertension}

It is important to state whether hypertension was essential or secondary to some other disease condition.

\section*{Standards and reporting requirements related for maternal mortality Maternal death}

A maternal death is the death of a woman while pregnant or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy, irrespective of the duration and the site of the pregnancy, from any cause related to or aggravated by the pregnancy or its management, but not from accidental or incidental causes.

\section*{Late maternal death}

A late maternal death is the death of a woman from direct or indirect obstetric causes more than 42 days but less than one year after termination of pregnancy.

Pregnancy-related death (Death occurring during pregnancy, childbirth and puerperium)
A pregnancy-related death (death occurring during pregnancy, childbirth and puerperium) is the death of a woman while pregnant or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy, irrespective of the cause of death (obstetric and non-obstetric)

\section*{Maternal deaths should be subdivided into two groups.}
1. Direct obstetric deaths: those resulting from obstetric complications of the pregnant state (pregnancy, labour and puerperium), from interventions, omissions or incorrect treatment, or from a chain of events resulting from any of the above.
2. Indirect obstetric deaths: those resulting from previous existing disease or disease that developed during pregnancy and that was not due to direct obstetric causes, but that was aggravated by physiologic effects of pregnancy.

In order to improve the quality of maternal mortality data and provide alternative methods of collecting data on deaths during pregnancy or related to it, as well as to encourage the recording of deaths from obstetric causes occurring more than 42 days following termination of pregnancy, the Forty-third World Health Assembly in 1990 adopted the recommendation that countries consider the inclusion on death certificates of questions regarding current pregnancy and pregnancy within one year preceding death.

\section*{International reporting}

For the purpose of the international reporting of maternal mortality, only those maternal deaths occurring before the end of the 42-day reference period should be included in the calculation of the various ratios and rates, although the recording of later deaths is useful for national analytical purposes.

\section*{Published maternal mortality rates}

Published maternal mortality rates should always specify the numerator (number of recorded maternal deaths), which can be given as:
- the number of recorded direct obstetric deaths; or
- the number of recorded obstetric deaths (direct plus indirect).

Note that when calculating maternal mortality rates, cases not coded to Chapter 18 - Pregnancy, childbirth or the puerperium (J codes) should be included.

\section*{Denominators for maternal mortality}

The denominator used for calculating maternal mortality should be specified as either the number of live births or the number of total births (live births plus fetal deaths). Where both denominators are available, a calculation should be published for each.

\section*{Ratios and rates}

Results should be expressed as a ratio of the numerator to the denominator, multiplied by k (where k may be 1000 , 10000 or 100000 , as preferred and indicated by the country). Maternal mortality ratios and rates can thus be expressed as follows;

Maternal mortality rate =
Maternal deaths (direct and indirect) $\times \mathrm{k}$
Live births

Direct obstetric mortality ratio=
Direct obstetric death only $\times \mathrm{k}$
Live births

Ratio for death occurring during pregnancy, childbirth and puerperium =
Deaths occurring during pregnancy, childbirth and puerperium $\times \mathrm{k}$
Live births

\section*{UNIT 3. LEGAL AND ETHICAL ISSUES IN BIRTHS AND DEATHS}

\section*{Definitions of Terms}

Ethics is as a method, procedure, or perspective for deciding how to act and for analyzing complex problems and issues.

\section*{The death certificate -}

A legal document needed:
- To proceed with burial or cremation of the body
- To execute the deceased person's will
- By police or the pathologist to access the body
- By clinician or hospital to report details of the death to national authorities (MOH, CRD and KNBS)
- To enter details of death and circumstances into a database for reporting of national morbidity and mortality statistics.

\section*{Death registration process}
- Notification - an appropriate authority (assistant chief or health worker) fills aform confirming the death event
- Medical certification - clinician completes the certificate of cause of death
- Clinical coding - coder translates the diagnosis into alphanumeric as per theICD guidelines
- Civil Registration - civil registrar legally registers the death at the civilregistration office
- Civil Certification - civil registrar issues the legal death certificate

\section*{Laws of Kenya related to certificate of deaths \\ The Data Protection Act (No. 24 of 2019)}

The Act recognizes certain rights of Data Subjects and imposes certain duties on Data Controllers/ Processors

Data Controllers/Processors who process data beyond a certain threshold will need to register with the Data Protection Commission

Calls for developing sector specific guidelines (sec. 74)

\section*{Section 46 - Health data}
(1) Personal data relating to the health of a data subject may only be processed-
(a) by or under the responsibility of a health care provider; or
(b) by a person subject to the obligation of professional secrecy under any law.
(2) The condition under subsection (1) is met if the processing -
(a) is necessary for reasons of public interest in the area of public health; or
(b) is carried out by another person who in the circumstances owes a duty of confidentiality under any law.

\section*{Births and deaths Act - CAP. 149, Sec 18 (1-4)}
"18: Certificates of cause of death
In the case of the death occurring in Kenya of any person who has been attended during his last illness by a medical practitioner, that practitioner shall sign a certificate stating to the best of his knowledge and belief the cause of death.

Every such certificate of cause of death shall be forwarded forthwith by the medical practitioner by whom it is signed to the registrar, and the medical practitioner, on signing a certificate as aforesaid, shall give in the prescribed form to some person required by this Act to give information concerning the death notice in writing of the signing of the certificate.

Where an inquest is held on the body of any deceased person, a medical certificate of the cause of death need not be forwarded to the registrar, but the magistrate holding the inquest shall send to the registrar a copy of his finding, which shall be sufficient.

Every medical practitioner who refuses or fails without reasonable excuse to comply with any of the provisions of this section shall be guilty of an offence and liable to a fine not exceeding two hundred shillings."

\section*{Who certifiers the cause of death?}

Responsibility of a medical practitioner or any other person authorized by law.
In the event that a patient dies in a hospital or medical facility, it is the statutory duty of the clinician who has attended in the last illness to issue the medical certificate of cause of death (D1)

If a person dies at home, the register of death (D2) is completed by the assistant chief

\section*{Ethical principles in use of health data}

Usually applied to human-subject research protocols
Applicable when clinical and public health data about an individual is collected and stored
Three fundamental principles established in the Belmont Report (18th April 1979), Helsinki Declaration (2013), and Nuremburg Code (1947):
- Respect for persons
- Beneficence
- Justice

\section*{Respect for persons Seeks to:}
- protect the autonomy of all people
- treat people with courtesy and respect
- allow for informed consent
- Disclosure of intent
- Individuals are capable of providing consent
- Individuals are not coerced into giving their consent

\section*{Beneficence seeks to:}
- "Do no harm."
- Maximize benefits for the population
- Minimize the risks to the individual person

\section*{Justice;}

Aims to ensures that procedures are fairly and equally administered

\section*{Application of ethical principles????????????????}

\section*{Legal issues, privacy and confidentiality}
- Legal requirements regarding death certification include who is qualified to certify a death, time period within which certification must be made, etc.
- Certifiers and coders should observe confidentiality, ethics and honesty about the cause of death
- the patient's right to privacy and the confidentiality of the information contained within the certificates should be maintained at all times
- this duty is to the family of the deceased person
- The physical medical record is the property of the hospital and the information in the medical record is private and confidential

\section*{The disclosure is permissible only when}
- expressed or implied consent of the patient
- when there is order of court
- when the clinician or hospital interest cannot otherwise be safeguarded
- when there exists higher duty (i.e. Public interest issue)

Adherence to relevant laws and regulations e.g. do not reveal the details of a certificate of cause of death to a third party unless:
◯ are legally required to do so
◯ have obtained prior consent from the next of kin of the deceased
Information in the certificate of cause of death can be used for research purposes, as long as the deceased is not identified by name or other means

\section*{UNIT 4: VERBAL AUTOPSY(VA)}

\section*{Overview of community cause of death}

Assistant chiefs just do lay reporting of death and are not competent in establishing the correct cause of death

From the prescribed causes of death on Form D2, the assistant chiefs tick one of the causes of death among many provided on the form

The symptoms and modes of dying such as headache, vomiting given on form D2 are not considered as causes of death for ICD 11

\section*{Definitions and terms}

Verbal autopsy - a method used to ascertain the cause of a death based on an interview with next of kin or other caregivers

It uses a standardized questionnaire that elicits information on signs, symptoms, medical history and circumstances preceding death.

\section*{Importance}
i. VA is a primary source of information about causes of death in populations lacking a robust vital registration and medical certification system e.g. Kenya
ii. Ideal in settings where deaths occur at home and therefore not medically certified by a clinician
iii. It is an essential public health tool for
iv. obtaining a reasonable direct estimation of the cause structure of mortality at a community level,
v. Providing an accurate method for attributing causes of death at the individual level.
vi. Standardized tools used during VA allow for consistency \& cross-comparability of mortality data
vii. Allows for assignment of a group level for causes of death corresponding to ICD-11 codes

NB: Of all events that are registered in the country, $60 \%$ of the births and $70 \%$ of the deaths occur at home, which are registered by assistant chiefs

\section*{Purpose}

The purpose of VA is to describe the causes of death at the community level in situations where no better alternative sources of mortality data exist.

VA serves as a limited but essential substitute for medical certification.
The quality of information of the diagnoses varies depending on the skills of the interviewer and the memory of the respondents.

\section*{Requirements- Personnel required for verbal autopsy}
i. VA interviewer
ii. VA Supervisor
iii. Data manager
iv. Software developer
v. Field coordinator
vi. Any other depending on implementation

\section*{Procedures}

VA is a two-step procedure:
- an interview carried out with family members/caregivers of the deceased using a structured questionnaire to elicit signs and symptoms and other pertinent information
- Assignment of a probable underlying cause of death. Methods include;
a) physician review of VA data
b) ICD certification, coding, and tabulation
c) computerised algorithms for population fractions

\end{figure}

\section*{Assigning cause of death in verbal autopsy}

A completed verbal autopsy questionnaire contain information on diseases, signs and symptoms, the age and sex of the deceased as well as his or her history and medical reports (if available).

This information is used to assign the causes that led to death. It can be done through;
Assigning diseases from signs and symptoms
The use of a standard set of diagnostic criteria ensures that the results of evaluation and selection are determined in a standard fashion by staff involved in this step. This could be a physician or any other person who has been medically trained.

Diagnostic criteria (algorithms)
They describe which combination of symptoms, duration and severity may lead to a specific diagnosis.

\section*{Timing schedule for the VA}

✓ Consider social cultural aspects
✓ Memory of the respondents / Recall period

\section*{Scheduling VA}

✓ VA supervisors and Interviewers can contact the family of the deceased to schedule appropriate date for conducting VA.

✓ Normally this period is 30 days after the death to give room for grieving period.

\section*{Conducting VA}

In the scheduled date for VA the interviewer as trained follows key steps in VA
✓ Determines key/appropriate respondent
✓ Introduces themselves and explains the VA interview process
✓ Obtains consent to proceed with the interview

✓ Conducts the interview
✓ Thanks respondent
✓ Submits the data

\section*{Data analysis and reporting}

VA and COD data are normally in CSV format which can be analysed by various statistical softwares like STATA, R

It is recommended to prepare data quality protocol that highlights various indicators to monitor during data quality checks

The protocol needs to highlight allowable values and invalid values
Develop an error resolution protocol that highlights steps/stages required to resolve data errors

\section*{Sample verbal Autopsy Questionnaire}

Sample VA questionnaire 1: death of a child aged under four weeks
determine causes of early neonatal deaths, late neonatal deaths, perinatal deaths and stillbirths to determine causes of those perinatal events and deaths.

Sample VA questionnaire 2: death of a child aged four weeks to 14 years
designed to ascertain the major causes of post-neonatal child mortality (i.e. starting from the fourth week of life), as well as causes of death that may be seen through 14 years.

Sample VA questionnaire 3: death of a person aged 15 years and above
designed to identify all major causes of death among adolescents and adults (i.e. starting at age $15)$, including deaths related to pregnancy and childbirth.
