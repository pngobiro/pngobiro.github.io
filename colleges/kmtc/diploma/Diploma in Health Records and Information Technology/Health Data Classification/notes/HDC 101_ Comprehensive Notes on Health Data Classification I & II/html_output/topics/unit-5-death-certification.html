                        <p>MCCoD is the assignment of a cause of death by an authorised medically trained clinician who fully understands the clinical sequelae of disease or injury that led to death.</p>
                        <p>MCCoD provides a cause of death statement: cause-of-death statement consists of the wording written in the format used on a death certificate to indicate the cause(s) of death and other significant conditions that contributed to death.</p>

                        <h3>What is cause of death?</h3>
                        <p>Cause of death refers to all those diseases, morbid conditions or injuries which either resulted in or contributed to death and circumstances surrounding them.</p>
                        <p>Causes of death is defined as "all those diseases, morbid conditions or injuries which eitherresulted in or contributed to death and the circumstances of the accident or violence which produced any such injuries".</p>
                        <p>Definition of cause of death does not include symptoms, Signs and modes of dying such as cardiorespiratory arrest and respiratory failure.</p>
                        <p>Several underlying causes can be attributed to death but only one underlying cause should be identified and written in the death certificate.</p>
                        <p>Selection of the underlying cause of death is based on the principles of preventing the primary or underlying cause of death had there been effective preventive programs.</p>
                        <p><strong>Certification of cause of death</strong> refers to assignment of a cause of death by an authorisedmedically trained clinician who fully understands the clinical sequence of conditions.</p>
                        <p><strong>Death certificate</strong> is an official legal document and vital record signed by an authorised Registrarof Births and Deaths that includes cause of death and deceased person's demographics as later entered in an official register of death</p>
                        <p>The <strong>immediate cause of death</strong> is the final disease, injury, or complication that directly caused death.</p>
                        <p>The <strong>antecedent or intermediary cause of death</strong> is the condition(s) that led to or precipitated the immediate cause of death but occurs at the time between underlying cause of death and immediate cause of death.</p>
                        <p>The <strong>underlying cause of death</strong> is the disease or injury (or poisoning) that initiated the chain of events that led directly and inevitably to death.</p>
                        <p>Underlying Cause of death can also be defined as;<br>
                        The disease or injury which initiated the train of morbid events leading directly to death, or The circumstances of the accident or violence which produced the fatal injury".</p>

                        <h3>Sequence</h3>
                        <p>The term "sequence" refers to two or more conditions entered on successive lines of Part I, each condition being anacceptable cause of the one entered on the line above it.</p>
                        <p><strong>Example 1:</strong><br>
                        I (a) Bleeding of oesophageal varices<br>
                        Portal hypertension<br>
                        Liver cirrhosis<br>
                        Hepatitis B</p>
                        <p>If there is more than one cause of death in a line of the certificate, it is possible to have more than one reportedsequence. In the example below, four sequences are reported:</p>
                        <p><strong>Example 2:</strong><br>
                        I Coma<br>
                        (a)<br>
                        (b) Myocardial infarction and cerebrovascular accident<br>
                        (c) Atherosclerosis Hypertension</p>

                        <h3>Find the Starting Point (Steps Sp1 to Sp8)</h3>
                        <p><strong>Definition of Starting point</strong><br>
                        The starting point is the condition or event that started the sequence of acceptable causal relationships ending with the terminal cause of death. In a correctly completed certificate, the condition reported on the lowest used line in Part 1 is the starting point of the sequence</p>
                        <p>To identify the starting point, follow the eight steps specified in this section. The steps are named SP1 to SP8 (Starting point rule 1 to Starting point rule 8). Each step contains one selection rule. At each step, there is a description of the selection rule itself and an instruction on what to do next. For some of the rules, there are also bullet points with more detailed instructions.</p>

                        <p><strong>Step SP1 - Single cause on certificate</strong><br>
                        If there is only one condition reported on the certificate, in either Part 1 or Part 2, this is the starting point and it is also the underlying cause. Next, go to Step M4. If there are two or more conditions on the certificate, go to Step SP2.</p>

                        <p><strong>Step SP2 - Only one line used in Part 1</strong><br>
                        If the certifier has used only one line in Part 1 but entered two or more conditions on this line, then the first-mentioned condition is the tentative starting point. Next, go to Step SP6.</p>

                        <p><strong>Step SP3 - More than one line used in Part 1, first cause on lowest line explains all entries above</strong><br>
                        If there are conditions reported on more than one line in Part 1, check whether all of the conditions reported on the line(s) above the lowest used line in Part 1 can be caused by the first condition on the lowest used line. If all conditions on the line(s) above the lowest used line in Part 1 can be caused by the first condition on the lowest used line, then this condition is tentatively - the starting point. Next, go to Step SP6</p>

                        <p><strong>Step SP4 - First cause on lowest used line does not explain all entries above, but a sequence ends with the terminal condition</strong><br>
                        If there is only one sequence ending with the terminal condition, find the starting point of this sequence. This is the new tentative starting point. Next, go to Step SP6.<br>
                        If there are two or more sequences of conditions or events ending with the terminal condition, identify the first-mentioned sequence as described in Section 4.1.3, and find the starting point of this first-mentioned sequence. Next, go to Step SP6<br>
                        If there is no sequence ending with the terminal condition, go to Step SP5</p>

                        <p><strong>Step SP5 - No sequence in Part 1</strong><br>
                        If there is no sequence ending with the terminal condition, then the terminal condition is also the tentative starting point. Next, go to Step SP6</p>

                        <p><strong>Step SP6 - Obvious cause</strong><br>
                        Now check whether the tentative starting point you selected in Steps SP1 to SP5 obviously was caused by another condition on the certificate. If the tentative starting point is in Part 1, then this other condition must be either on the same line, further down in Part 1, or in Part 2. If the tentative starting point is in Part 2, this other condition must also be in Part 2. Next, check whether there is another condition mentioned on the same line or further down on the certificate as the new tentative starting point you just identified that obviously caused this new tentative starting point. Continue looking for a new tentative starting point until you find a starting point that is not obviously caused by a condition reported on the same line or further down on the certificate. Then go to Step SP7</p>

                        <p><strong>Step SP7 - Ill-defined conditions</strong><br>
                        Now check whether the tentative starting point is listed in the table of ill-defined conditions (see Annex 7.3, List of ill-defined conditions).<br>
                        If it is, the tentative starting point is considered ill-defined. Then do as follows: If there are other conditions reported on the certificate, check whether they are all ill-defined. If all other conditions are ill-defined, go to Step M1<br>
                        If there is at least one condition that is not ill-defined, then disregard the ill-defined condition.<br>
                        Go to Step SP1 and select another starting point, as if the ill-defined condition had not been mentioned on the certificate.<br>
                        If the tentative starting point is not ill-defined, go to Step SP8</p>

                        <p><strong>Step SP8 - Conditions unlikely to cause death</strong><br>
                        Next, check whether the tentative starting point is listed in the table of conditions unlikely to cause death (see Annex 7.4, List of conditions unlikely to cause death). If it is, do as follows.<br>
                        If there are other conditions reported on the certificate, check whether they are all ill-defined or unlikely to cause death. If they are all ill-defined or unlikely to cause death, go to Step M1.<br>
                        If there are other conditions reported that are not ill-defined or unlikely to cause death, first check whether the death was caused by a reaction to treatment of the condition unlikely to cause death that you selected as the tentative starting point. If it was, then select the reaction to treatment as the starting point. Next, go to Step M1.<br>
                        If the death was not caused by a reaction to treatment of the condition unlikely to cause death, check whether the condition was the cause of another condition that is not on the list of conditions unlikely to cause death and that is not ill-defined. If it was, then the condition unlikely to cause death is still the tentative starting point. Next, go to Step M1.<br>
                        If there was no reaction to treatment and no complication of the condition unlikely to cause death, then disregard the condition unlikely to cause death. Go to Step SP1 and select another starting point, as if the condition unlikely to cause death had not been mentioned on the certificate</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Description of Modification</h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Special coding instructions on specific sequences and ICD categories may have the effect that a condition other than the starting point is selected as the underlying cause of death for use in the statistics. In such cases, the code for underlying cause often expresses a combination of the starting point with another reported condition, or a complication or consequence of the starting point that is of particular importance to public health. The procedure by which the ICD code for the starting point is replaced by another code is called modification</p>

                        <h3>Check for modifications of the starting point</h3>

                        <p><strong>Step M1 - Special instructions</strong><br>
                        Check whether special coding instructions apply to the tentative underlying cause. If a special coding instruction applies, assign a new tentative underlying cause according to the instruction. Next, check whether any special instructions apply to this new tentative underlying cause. That is, reapply Step M1. Repeat until you have found a tentative underlying cause that is not affected by any further special coding instruction. Next, go to Step M2.</p>

                        <p><strong>Step M2 - Specificity</strong><br>
                        If the tentative underlying cause describes a condition in general terms and a term that provides more precise information about the site or nature of this condition is reported on the certificate, this more informative term is the new tentative underlying cause. Next, check whether this new tentative underlying cause can be specified even further by other terms on the death certificate. That is, reapply Step M2. Repeat until you have found a tentative underlying cause that cannot be specified further</p>

                        <p><strong>Step M3 - Recheck Steps SP6, M1 and M2</strong><br>
                        If, at this point, the tentative underlying cause is not the same as the starting point you selected using Steps SP1 to SP8, then go back to Step SP6. Repeat the procedures described in Steps SP6, M1 and M2</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Do not go back to Step SP6 if the cause selected in Step M1 or M2 is correctly reported as due to another condition, except when this condition is ill-defined.</li>
                            <li>Also, do not go back to Step SP6 if the tentative underlying cause is a reaction to treatment of a condition unlikely to cause death, as selected in Step SP8.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p><strong>Step M4 - Instructions on medical procedures, poisoning, main injury and maternal deaths</strong><br>
                        Finally, apply the following instructions to the underlying cause you have arrived at:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>If the underlying cause you arrived at by applying Steps SP1 to SP8 and Steps M1 to M3 is surgery or another type of medical procedure, apply the instructions in Section 4.2.9, Special instructions on surgery and other medical procedures (Step M4).</li>
                            <li>If the underlying cause you arrived at by applying the selection and modification rules in Steps SP1 to SP8 and Steps M1 to M3 is an injury or poisoning (a code in S00-T98), code the external cause of the injury or poisoning as the underlying cause of death.</li>
                            <li>If the underlying cause is in Chapter XX, External causes of morbidity and mortality, also select a main injury. See the instructions in Section 4.2.6, Special instructions on main injury in deaths from external causes (Step M4).</li>
                            <li>If the starting point you selected by applying Steps SP1 to SP8 and Steps M1 to M3 is poisoning, and more than one toxic substance is reported on the certificate, apply the instructions in Section 4.2.7, Special instructions on poisoning by drugs, medicaments and biological substances (Step M4), to identify the most important drug involved.</li>
                            <li>If the decedent is a woman, and pregnancy, childbirth or puerperium is reported on the certificate, determine whether to code the underlying cause to Chapter XV, Pregnancy, childbirth and the puerperium, according to the instructions in Section 4.2.8, Special instructions on maternal mortality (Step M4). When you have found a cause of death that is not further changed in either Step SP6 or Steps M1 to M3, you have arrived at the underlying cause of death.</li>
