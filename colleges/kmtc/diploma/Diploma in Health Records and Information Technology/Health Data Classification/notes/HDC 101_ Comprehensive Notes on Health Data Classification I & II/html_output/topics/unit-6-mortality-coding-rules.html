                        <h3>Definitions</h3>
                        <p>Mortality coding involves two components:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>The correct assignment of ICD codes to the conditions reported on death certificates of cause of death (COD),</li>
                            <li>The correct application of mortality coding rules when selecting the underlying cause of death (UCOD).</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>In ICD terminology, 'underlying' cause of death is the disease or injury that initiated the sequence of events that led directly to death.</p>
                        <p>Mortality Coding is done using ICD-11 coding standards. This could be done either via:<br>
                        High breed system of coding in which a trained coder applies the ICD-11 coding standards.<br>
                        Or<br>
                        Automated system in which a software assigns the ICD codes for the diseases and procedures documented in the medical records.</p>

                        <h3>General Principle:</h3>
                        <p>When more than one condition is entered on the certificate, select the condition entered alone on the lowest used line of Part I only if it could have given rise to all the conditions entered above it.</p>

                            Select malaria (1F4Z)</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>Example 2:</strong> (a) Abscess of lung<br>
                            (b) Lobar pneumonia<br>
                            Select lobar pneumonia (CA40.Z)</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>Example 3:</strong> (a) Hepatic failure<br>
                            (b) Bile duct obstruction<br>
                            (c) Carcinoma of head of pancreas<br>
                            Select carcinoma of head of pancreas (2C10.Z&XA1412)</p>

                            (b) Hypertension<br>
                            (c) Chronic pyelonephritis<br>
                            (d) Bladder outlet obstruction<br>
                            (e) Prostatic adenoma<br>
                            Select prostatic adenoma (2F34)</p>
                        </div>

                        <h3>Rule 1:</h3>
                        <p>If the General Principle does not apply and there is a reported sequence terminating in the condition first entered on the certificate, select the originating cause of this sequence. If there is more than one sequence terminating in the condition mentioned first, select the originating cause of the first-mentioned sequence.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Example of rule 1</strong><br>
                        a) Bronchopneumonia<br>
                        (b) Cerebral infarction and hypertensive heart disease<br>
                        the physician certified that there are two reported sequences terminating in the condition first entered on the certificate;<br>
                        certifier has broken the rule by giving two conditions therefore the General Principle does not apply.</p>
                        <p>The originating cause of the first-mentioned sequence is selected.<br>
                        Rule 1 is used to select cerebral infarction (8B11.5Z)</p>

                        <h3>Rule 2:</h3>
                        <p>If there is no reported sequence terminating in the condition first entered on the certificate, select the first-mentioned condition.</p>
                        <ol class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Rheumatic and atherosclerotic heart disease<br>
                            The General Principle and Rule 1 do not apply, why?<br>
                            Select rheumatic heart disease (BC20.1). There is no reported sequence, both conditions are on the same line</li>
                            <li>Pernicious anaemia and gangrene of foot<br>
                            Atherosclerosis<br>
                            Select pernicious anaemia (3A01.30). There is no reported sequence terminating in the first entered condition.</li>
                            <li>Fibrocystic disease of the pancreas<br>
                            Bronchitis and bronchiectasis<br>
                            Select fibrocystic disease of the pancreas (CA25.Z). There is no reported sequence.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3>Rule 3:</h3>
                        <p>If the condition selected by the General Principle or by Rule 1 or Rule 2 is obviously a direct consequence of another reported condition, whether in Part I or Part II, select this primary condition.</p>
                        <p><strong>Example</strong><br>
                        I Kaposi's sarcoma<br>
                        II HIV Disease<br>

                        <h3>Mortality Coding Procedure</h3>
                        <p>Specific chapters relate to disease burden and also preventable causes of death<br>
                        They include:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Infectious & parasitic diseases - priority diseases</li>
                            <li>Maternal & perinatal conditions - preventable</li>
                            <li>Neoplasms (tumors) - on the rise & requires early diagnosis</li>
                            <li>External causes (Injuries/poisoning/accidents) - preventable</li>
                            <li>Specific diseases such as hypertension - preventable/NCDs</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Infectious and parasitic diseases</h3>
                        <p>Includes certain conditions caused by pathogenic organisms or microorganisms, such as bacteria, viruses, parasites or fungi.</p>
                        <p>If causative agent is known it should be recorded, if unknown, write "cause unknown"<br>
                        Include the site of infection, if known e.g. urinary tract</p>

                        <h3>Maternal and perinatal deaths</h3>
                        <p>Perinatal: from 28 completed weeks of gestation including 7 days after birth<br>
                        Maternal: Pregnancy to 42 days after termination<br>
                        Pregnancy: Death during pregnancy or within 42 days of the termination of a pregnancy, even if the direct cause of death is not related to the pregnancy or to childbirth should be coded under<br>
                        'Chapter 18 Pregnancy, childbirth or the puerperium' 'The fact the woman was pregnant should be recorded in the medical certificate of cause of death e.g, Entry on Part II of the certificate reading "Pregnant, period of gestation 26 weeks"</p>
                        <p>Perinatal deaths: Used for conditions which initially arise in the perinatal period (from 28 completed weeks of gestation up to, and including 7th day after birth)</p>
                        <p>Includes maternal conditions which may have affected the baby e.g. trauma occurring at birth<br>
                        Registration of death of a fetus is filled on the birth registration form (B1); the birth notification form serves as a burial permit</p>
                        <p>Conditions to be coded under ''Chapter 19 Certain conditions originating in the perinatal period"</p>

                        <h4>Example</h4>
                        <p>A male new born of spontaneous delivery in poor condition (Apgar score of 2 ) dying 3 hours after delivery. The pregnancy was normal up to the eighth month, when the mother started to present with vaginal hemorrhage, not seeking assistance during the first 24 hours. She was then taken to the hospital where she was admitted with pre-shock. The diagnosis made was abruptio placentae. The baby was born cyanotic with signs of anoxia.</p>
                        <p><strong>Death certificate</strong></p>
                        <p>I a) ANOXIA 3 HOURS<br>
                        b) ABRUPTIO PLACENTAE 2 DAYS<br>
                        c) ____<br>
                        d) ____<br>
                        II ____<br>
                        NB: Codes in (Chapter 18 Pregnancy, childbirth or the puerperium) take precedence over body system chapters i.e. If a condition that is normally coded to another chapter occurs in a pregnant patient or is exacerbated by pregnancy, use a code from Chapter 18</p>

                        <h3>Neoplasms(tumors)</h3>
                        <p>Use ICD 11 to identifying the correct set of codes<br>
                        Record the following:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>behavior (malignant, benign, in situ)</li>
                            <li>anatomical site</li>
                            <li>primary or secondary (if known), even if the primary site was removed long before death</li>
                            <li>morphology (histology or cell type if known)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>e.g. malignant adenocarcinoma of breast (primary site) with secondaries to lung<br>
                        If a diagnosis does not specify if a site is primary or secondary, assume primary</p>

                        <p>N.B: External/Underlying cause of death can be prevented</p>
                        <p>The external cause should be described in as much detail as possible; e.g.<br>
                        "Motor traffic accident" is not sufficiently correct. However,<br>
                        "Pedestrian hit by a motor car" is both clear and accurate.<br>
                        In a case of suicide, entering "suicide" is insufficient. The method of suicide should be entered. For example "suicidal death by hanging" is a clear description.</p>
                        <p>Cause of death information should be cross referenced against free text narrative against the injury.</p>
                        <p>Detailed information describing the injury.<br>
                        The narrative data using key words should provide detailed problem definition to inform prevention<br>
                        e.g. key words such as fall, suicide, pedestrians.<br>
                        N.B: The prevention should address the underlying causes of death, e.g.<br>
                        it is easy to control the underlying cause of death; Motor vehicle accidents, suicide and homicide cases but we may not control the immediate cause of death.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Standards and reporting requirements related for maternal mortality</h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h3>Maternal death</h3>
                        <p>A maternal death is the death of a woman while pregnant or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy, irrespective of the duration and the site of the pregnancy, from any cause related to or aggravated by the pregnancy or its management, but not from accidental or incidental causes.</p>

                        <h3>Late maternal death</h3>
                        <p>A late maternal death is the death of a woman from direct or indirect obstetric causes more than 42 days but less than one year after termination of pregnancy.</p>
                        <p>Pregnancy-related death (Death occurring during pregnancy, childbirth and puerperium)<br>
                        A pregnancy-related death (death occurring during pregnancy, childbirth and puerperium) is the death of a woman while pregnant or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy, irrespective of the cause of death (obstetric and non-obstetric)</p>

                        <h3>Maternal deaths should be subdivided into two groups.</h3>
                        <ol class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Direct obstetric deaths: those resulting from obstetric complications of the pregnant state (pregnancy, labour and puerperium), from interventions, omissions or incorrect treatment, or from a chain of events resulting from any of the above.</li>
                            <li>Indirect obstetric deaths: those resulting from previous existing disease or disease that developed during pregnancy and that was not due to direct obstetric causes, but that was aggravated by physiologic effects of pregnancy.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>In order to improve the quality of maternal mortality data and provide alternative methods of collecting data on deaths during pregnancy or related to it, as well as to encourage the recording of deaths from obstetric causes occurring more than 42 days following termination of pregnancy, the Forty-third World Health Assembly in 1990 adopted the recommendation that countries consider the inclusion on death certificates of questions regarding current pregnancy and pregnancy within one year preceding death.</p>

                        <h3>International reporting</h3>
                        <p>For the purpose of the international reporting of maternal mortality, only those maternal deaths occurring before the end of the 42-day reference period should be included in the calculation of the various ratios and rates, although the recording of later deaths is useful for national analytical purposes.</p>

                        <h3>Published maternal mortality rates</h3>
                        <p>Published maternal mortality rates should always specify the numerator (number of recorded maternal deaths), which can be given as:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>the number of recorded direct obstetric deaths; or</li>
                            <li>the number of recorded obstetric deaths (direct plus indirect).</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Note that when calculating maternal mortality rates, cases not coded to Chapter 18 - Pregnancy, childbirth or the puerperium (J codes) should be included.</p>

                        <h3>Denominators for maternal mortality</h3>
                        <p>The denominator used for calculating maternal mortality should be specified as either the number of live births or the number of total births (live births plus fetal deaths). Where both denominators are available, a calculation should be published for each.</p>

                        <h3>Ratios and rates</h3>
                        <p>Results should be expressed as a ratio of the numerator to the denominator, multiplied by k (where k may be 1000 , 10000 or 100000 , as preferred and indicated by the country). Maternal mortality ratios and rates can thus be expressed as follows;</p>
                        
                        <div class="equation-block">
                            <p>Maternal mortality rate =<br>
                            $\frac{\text{Maternal deaths (direct and indirect)} \times \mathrm{k}}{\text{Live births}}$</p>

                            <p>Direct obstetric mortality ratio=<br>
                            $\frac{\text{Direct obstetric death only} \times \mathrm{k}}{\text{Live births}}$</p>

                            <p>Ratio for death occurring during pregnancy, childbirth and puerperium =<br>
                            $\frac{\text{Deaths occurring during pregnancy, childbirth and puerperium} \times \mathrm{k}}{\text{Live births}}$</p>
