                        <p>Fertility relates to the number of live births a woman has actually had. Fertile means that a woman is or was a mother.</p>
                        <p>The physiological ability to bear children on the other hand is known as fecundity. Fecund is thus the opposite of sterile. It is thought that the maximum number of children an average woman can theoretically produce is about 15 if she starts child bearing as soon as possible after menarche, which occurs around ages 1214 and continues until menopause in her middle or late forties.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Some women are for various reasons unable to bear any children, while the greatest number ever officially recorded is 69 by a woman living near Moscow during the $18^{\text{th}}$ Century (16 pairs of twins, 7 sets of triplets and 4 sets of quadruplets). The highest recorded average for any populations is about 10 births per woman among the HUTTERITES.</p>
                        
                        <p>There are broadly two ways of approaching the study of fertility period and cohort. The essential quality of period fertility analysis is that it looks at fertility cross sectional i.e. at births occurring during a specified period of time- normally one year cohort analysis on the other hand looks at fertility longitudinally i.e. at all births occurring to a specific group of women normally all those born or married during a reproductive history. In this study, we shall consider period analysis only because it is more frequently used.</p>
                        
                        <p>The measures of period fertility are as follows: -</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="content-subheading">(i) Child Woman Ratio</h3>
                        <p>This can be defined as</p>
                        <p>C/W Ratio = Children Aged 0-4<br>
                        Woman aged 15-44/9</p>
                        
                        <p>The usefulness of ratio arises from the fact that it requires only information on the age and sex structure of the population. No data on birth are needed at all. This makes it particularly useful when using census data.</p>
                        
                        <p>Obviously it is an extremely crude measure but broadly if fertility is high, the child/woman ratio will be high while if fertility is low, the ratio will be low. It is however, quite sensitive to the level of infant mortality. So if it is dangerous to use the ratio to compare populations, with substantially different levels of infant and child mortality or where under reporting of young children is a problem.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="content-subheading">(ii) Crude Birth Rate</h3>
                        <p>This is the simplest and most frequently used as a measure of fertility. It is defined as: -</p>
                        <p>CBR = $\frac{\text{Birth in year}}{\text{Population at Midyear}} \times 1000$</p>
                        
                        <p>It is always expressed per 1000 population. The reasons it is a "crude" rate is that it includes all ages and both sexes in the denominator.</p>
                        <p>No attempt is made to relate the births to the women at risk of having those births because of this it is strictly not a measure of fertility at all.</p>
                        <p>The range of CBR is from 10-50. A major problem is that it is affected very greatly by the composition of the population as regards age, sex and other characteristics. Thus it can be very misleading if it is used to compare different populations or the same population at different times because it may vary greatly in their composition. There are though 3 reasons why it is a useful measure:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>It is easy to understand.</li>
                            <li>It requires few data and it is easy to calculate - all that is required is the total number of births and the total population.</li>
                            <li>It is possible to subtract the crude death rate from the crude birth rate to get the crude rate of natural increase, which along with the crude net migration rate can estimate, the present population. This refers to demographic equation.</li>

                        <p>This is a fertility rate rather than a birth rate because it expresses the births relative to the No. of women of the reproductive age. Sometimes the denominator includes women aged 45-49. Sometimes it doesn't. This is important because compiling a 15-44 GFR with 15-49 GFR could be misleading.<br>
                        E.g. the Bangladesh 1974 ages 15-44.</p>
                        
                        <p>GFR of age 15 - 44/9</p>
                        
                        <p>GFR = $\frac{\text{No. of Births during the year}}{\text{Women aged 15-44/9 at midyear}} \times 1000$</p>
                        
                        <p>GFR of age 15-49 = 3253480 × 1000 / 13224700 = 246.02/1000</p>
                        
                        <p>Using the same data you now calculate the GFR 15-44 and GFR 15-49. The possible value is roughly 50-300. Note that more data are required to calculate the GFR than CBR. One has to know the age and sex composition of the population. The main advantage of GFR over CBR is that it substantially controls for age and sex structure by relating the births to roughly the women at risk of having them, but it does not control entirely for age structure since there may be substantial variations between populations within the reproductive age range. For example in one there may be a relatively large number of girls aged 15-19 while in another there may be only a few. Because births are not spread evenly over the reproductive age range, comparisons using the GFR can be misleading. To overcome this it is necessary to move to a substantially more sophisticated level and consider fertility for each age group.</p>

                        <p>ASFR can be graphed in figure 1. It shows features such as rapid rise into a peak in the early or mid 20s and a gradual decline to very low levels after age 40. It is conventional to include any births occurring to girls aged below 15 in the 15-19 age groups on the grounds that their ages are being underestimated. Similarly births of women over 49 years are usually added into the 45-49 group. The effects of these are usually negligible since there are very few births in these ages. The great inconvenience of Age Specific Fertility Rate (ASFR) is that they are not a single number but a set of 7 (seven). This makes comparisons complex and tedious but fortunately it is possible to overcome this by using the Total Fertility Ratio (TFR).</p>

                        <p>It is probably the measure of fertility that is most widely used by demographers. It is calculated by adding up the ASFRs. Each ASFR usually relates to 5 years. It is therefore necessary to multiply the 5 -year rate by five. The TFR is almost always expressed per one (1) woman where as ASFRs are often expressed per 1000 women. If that is the case then it is necessary to divide by 1000.</p>

                        <p>Three points to note when computing TFR are: -</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>If single year ASFR are used then there is no need to multiply by 5. The 5 are used because the age interval is 5.</li>
                            <li>It makes no difference if you multiply the ASFRs by 5 and then add them or the other way round except that it is easier to add them first.</li>
                            <li>It is perfectly acceptable to include the ASFR for the age 10-14 or 50-54 or omit 45-49. However, they are so small that they make very little difference to the final figure.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <p>The great value of the TFR is that it is single figure measure that is independent of age structure. The GFR only partially controls for age structure and the CBR doesn't do that at all. One problem with TFR however, is that it requires a lot of data - births by age of month and women by age group which is usually only available where there are high quality registration and census systems.<br>
                        Another problem is its interpretation. Formally, the TFR can be thought of as the number of children a woman would have if: -</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>She survived to age 50.</li>
                            <li>Throughout her reproductive life she experienced exact ASFR for the year in question.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>To understand this considers a group of women in Bangladesh aged 15. While they are 15-19 they have an ASFR of 200.4 then 337.4 while they are 20-24 and 13.5 from 45-49. If they all survived to age 50 they will have had an average 7.08 children each.</p>
