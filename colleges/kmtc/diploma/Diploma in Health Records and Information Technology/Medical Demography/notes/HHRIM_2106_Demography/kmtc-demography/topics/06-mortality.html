                        <p>The acceleration of population growth in the developing countries of the world has not been due to a change in the birth rates; but to the great reduction in death rate following improvements life in the developing countries, the rate of natural increase was most unlikely to have been more, and may indeed have been much less than that of the more developed countries.</p>
                        <p>There is still considerable scope for reduction in death rates in the developing countries. If this should occur unaccompanied by any fall in birth rates; the populations of these countries would grow at even faster rates than at present. In short, there is no hope of any reduction in the rates of population growth until the fall in birth rates is faster than that of the rates of death. In any case, the population will go on increasing until or unless the Crude Birth Rate (CBR) = Crude Death Rate (CDR) when the natural increase becomes zero.</p>

                        <p>To study mortality, it is necessary to use comparative measures or indices of mortality for periods and areas under consideration. The basic measures are essentially rates of incidence relating to the number of death to a unit of population, commonly 1,000, in a particular interval of time. The interval is invariably one year, to avoid the complicated effect of seasonal mortality variations on comparability of rates.</p>

                        <p>This is the simplest measure, indicating the number of deaths in a particular year per 1,000 of the population.</p>
                        
                        <p>Formula: - CDR = $\frac{\text{D}}{\text{P}} \times 1,000$</p>

                            <li>Where D = Deaths in a year</li>
                            <li>P = population at mid- year</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <p>The mid- year population is used, ideally, as the best available approximate of the average number of people exposed to death, or "at risk", during the year. The term "crude" is used simply, since no allowance is made for often considerable differences between populations in those aspects of composition in particular age and rates increase with age from late childhood, and that at nearly all ages mortality is higher for males than females. Consequently, age and sex structure plays an important role in influencing crude death rates, regardless of factors like living standards and health programmes. This is why care has to be taken in interpreting international difference in crude death rates. There are some less developed countries (e.g. Costa Rica, Guyana, Jamaica, Malaysia, Sri Lanka) which have lower crude death rates (about 5-7 per 1,000), countries of North America and North Western Europe ( about 9-12 per 1,000). Clearly, this is due to much younger age structures in less developed countries, resulting from their high fertility in the immediate past.</p>

                        <p>A more critical appreciation of mortality level can be derived from a table of mortality desegregated by age and sex. An age and sex specific death rate is the number of deaths during the year of persons of a given age and sex per 1,000 people of that age group and sex category.</p>
                        
                        <p>Formula: A and SSDR = $\frac{\text{D (A\&S)}}{\text{P (A\&S)}} \times 1,000$</p>

                            <li>D (A&S) = Deaths of a given age and sex in a year</li>
                            <li>P (A&S) = population of a given age and sex in the middle of the year.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <p>It is conventional to use five year or ten year age groups, as a compromise between unnecessarily detailed and tediously compiled larger age groups. However, because of the importance of infant mortality, separate rates are usually calculated for the under one and 1-4 age groups.</p>
                        
                        <p>Examples of age and sex- specific death rates are given in the following table and figures for a developed and a less developed country. Although levels of mortality differ between England and Wales, and Mauritius, the overall pattern of mortality by age and sex is very similar. Mortality rates fall from high levels in the first one year of life to a minimum in 5-14 age group and then rise in successive age groups, although the mortality level in the first one year is not exceeded until old age. The lower mortality rate for females is found in all the England and Wales age groups and almost all in Mauritius. Traditional explanations include the greater exposure of men, in general to warfare, occupational and recreational hazards and to occupational stress. The excess male mortality at infant and even fetal stages suggests that biological difference is the decisive factor.</p>

                        <p>Sets of age - and sex specific rates represent refined measures of mortality, but they are cumbersome and difficult to assimilate. It is desirable, therefore to have a summary measure which epitomizes a whole set of rates but which avoids the crudity of the crude death rate. Demographers have used their technical skills to produce several measures and two of the most widely used will now be discussed to illustrate the procedure known as standardization. By this procedure, death rates are adjusted or standardized for the age and sex composition of the population. Standardization can be regarded as a means of holding age and sex constant.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>A legitimate desire is often felt for a single mortality rate, summing up the rates to be made between one rate and another. For this purpose, standardized death rate is generally used. This is a hypothetical figure which indicates what the crude death rate would be if the population being studied had the same age and sex composition as a population (any real or assumed population). You will find that while comparing rates between different geographical areas, different hospitals, population or experimental groups; there are other factors which should be considered in assessing the reliability of a crude death rate e.g. many diseases, age specific death rates are higher for infants and very old people and low for children and young adults as already shown. Therefore, if one population has a high proportion of very old and very young persons, the crude death rate will usually be higher than that of a population consisting of mainly children and young adults.</p>

                        <p>The crude death rate for country A is 132.1/100,000, and that of the immigrants is 65.7/100,000, although at every age group, age specific death rates were higher for immigrants than for country A. These results are explained by the relatively small number of people aged over 45 in country A, which gives much weight to the crude death rate. Here then is an example of crude death rate being a sample of misleading index of comparing the levels of death in these two populations. Death rates vary with many social conditions, age and many others. To make a single figure index of reliable we must take account of the different population structures. This is what we have called a "standardized death rate". There are two common methods of deriving standardized rates, known as direct and indirect standardization.</p>

                        <p>In order to get over the problem of different population structure of the two populations to be compared, we choose a standard comparison. This we call the standard. The population to be standardized we call it the index population. We then apply the age (or characteristics) specific rates of the index population to the standard population. This gives us the number of cases for each age group that we would expect if the index population rates applied in the standard population. Adding these cases over the age groups and dividing by the number of persons in the standard population gives the standardized death rate for the index population. In detail the steps involved in calculating the direct standardized death rate for the index population.</p>

                        <p>Whatever considerations are made in the choice of a standard population for application of the direct method, the final decision as to which population is used must be to some extent arbitrary. However, provided the standard population is in some sense appropriate for the problem at hand, the precise structure of the population is unlikely to affect the results of comparisons of an index population to a market extent. For example, if the problem is to compare several occupational groups in England and Wales an appropriate standard might be the adult population of Kenya. On the other hand, there is no good reason why the adult population of Kenya should be chosen as a standard if the problem is to compare several occupational groups in England and Wales an appropriate standard might be the adult population of Kenya. On the other hand, there is no good reason why the adult population of Kenya should be chosen as a standard if the problem is to make international comparisons, various suggestions have been made for the choice of standard populations and these are shown in the following table. These standards vary from an African country with a low proportion of old people through an intermediate world population to a European population with a high proportion of old people.</p>

                        <p>The expected cases are obtained by multiplying the age specific rates by the number of persons in the immigrants (index) population e.g. (74.0 x 26,000) divide by 100,000 = 19.2.</p>
                        
                        <p>The standard rates are the age specific rates for country A. The total expected cases are arrived at by adding 19.2+1.8+24.1+37.5+43.5=126.1, and hence the standard mortality ratio<br>
                        (SMR) is $\frac{140}{126.1} = 1.11 \text{ or } 111\%$</p>
                        
                        <p>Where 140 are the actual or observed total number of deaths in the immigrants population.</p>
                        
                        <p>The indirectly standardized rate for the immigrants is then obtained by multiplying the crude rate of the standard population by the standard mortality ratio that is 132.1 x 1.11 = 146.6 per 1,000. The indirect standardized rate for country A remains 132.1 for purposes of comparison, because we chose country A's rates as the standard.</p>

                            <li>The method is simple to understand and apply</li>
                            <li>If it is necessary to compare one index population with another index population, it is possible to simply take the ratio of the two comparative mortality indices, to obtained comparative mortality index</li>

                        <p>The ratio of the two SMR obtained through indirect standardization does not simplify to any meaningful expression. Indeed in extreme situations the ratio of the two Standardized Mortality Rates (SMRs) could yield a totally misleading comparison of the incidence/mortality in the two index population.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="content-subheading">Advantages of the indirect method:</h3>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>It can be shown that assuming the index rates are small as indeed they are in most studies of mortality and incidence the standard error of indexing the indirectly standardized rates is less than the directly standardized rate. Thus, if the sample sizes in the index population are small, there may be an important gain in precision if the indirect method is used rather than the direct method.</li>
                            <li>In many situations, it may be impossible to apply the direct method because the distribution of cases or deaths in the index population is unknown. The indirect method does not require this information.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <p>In summary, the indirect method is preferred because of its consistency provided the sample sizes in the index population are small.</p>
