                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h3>Fertility and Fecundity</h3>
                        <p>Fertility relates to the number of live births a woman has actually had. Fertile means that a woman is or was a mother.</p>
                        <p>The physiological ability to bear children on the other hand is known as fecundity. Fecund is thus the opposite of sterile. It is thought that the maximum number of children an average woman can theoretically produce is about 15 if she starts child bearing as soon as possible after menarche, which occurs around ages 12-14 and continues until menopause in her middle or late forties.</p>

                        <h4>Child Woman Ratio</h4>
                        <p>This can be defined as:</p>
                        <p class="equation">$$ \text{C/W Ratio} = \frac{\text{Children Aged 0-4}}{\text{Woman aged 15-44/9}} $$</p>
                        <p>The usefulness of ratio arises from the fact that it requires only information on the age and sex structure of the population. No data on birth are needed at all. This makes it particularly useful when using census data.</p>
                        <p>Obviously it is an extremely crude measure but broadly if fertility is high, the child/woman ratio will be high while if fertility is low, the ratio will be low. It is however, quite sensitive to the level of infant mortality. So if it is dangerous to use the ratio to compare populations, with substantially different levels of infant and child mortality or where under reporting of young children is a problem.</p>

                        <h4>Crude Birth Rate</h4>
                        <p>The crude birth rate (CBR or b) in a population during a given year is defined as the total number of births (B) divided by the midyear population (P). It is normally expressed per thousand population, so we have $b=1000*(B/P)$.</p>
                        <p>This is the simplest and most frequently used as a measure of fertility. It is defined as: -</p>
                        <p class="equation">$$ \text{CBR} = \frac{\text{Birth in year}}{\text{Population at Midyear}} \times 1000 $$</p>
                        <p>It is always expressed per 1000 population. The reasons it is a "crude" rate is that it includes all ages and both sexes in the denominator.</p>
                        <p>No attempt is made to relate the births to the women at risk of having those births because of this it is strictly not a measure of fertility at all.</p>
                        <p>The range of CBR is from 10-50. A major problem is that it is affected very greatly by the composition of the population as regards age, sex and other characteristics. Thus it can be very misleading if it is used to compare different populations or the same population at different times because it may vary greatly in their composition. There are though 3 reasons why it is a useful measure: -</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>It is easy to understand</li>
                            <li>It requires few data and it is easy to calculate - all that is required is the total number of births and the total population.</li>
                            <li>It is possible to subtract the crude death rate from the crude birth rate to get the crude rate of natural increase, which along with the crude net migration rate can estimate, the present population. This refers to demographic equation.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>General Fertility Rate (GFR)</h4>
                        <p>This is a fertility rate rather than a birth rate because it expresses the births relative to the No. of women of the reproductive age. Sometimes the denominator includes women aged 45-49. Sometimes it doesn't. This is important because compiling a 15-44 GFR with 15-49 GFR could be misleading.</p>
                        <p>GFR of age 15-44/9</p>
                        <p class="equation">$$ \text{GFR} = \frac{\text{No. of Births during the year}}{\text{Women aged 15-44/9 at midyear}} \times 1000 $$</p>
                        <p>Example: GFR of age 15-49 = $3,253,480 \times 1000 / 13,224,700 = 246.02 / 1000$</p>
                        <p>The possible value is roughly 50-300. Note that more data are required to calculate the GFR than CBR. One has to know the age and sex composition of the population. The main advantage of GFR over CBR is that it substantially controls for age and sex structure by relating the births to roughly the women at risk of having them, but it does not control entirely for age structure since there may be substantial variations between populations within the reproductive age range.</p>

                        <h4>Age-specific fertility rate (ASFR)</h4>
                        <p>The age-specific fertility rate (ASFR) for women of age group i in a population during a given year is defined as the total number of births to women age i during the year (Bi) divided by the total (midyear) number of women age i (Wi). Expressed per thousand, we have</p>
                        <p class="equation">$$ \text{ASFRI} = 1000 * (\text{Bi} / \text{Wi}) $$</p>

                        <h4>Total Fertility Rate (TFR)</h4>
                        <p>It is probably the measure of fertility that is most widely used by demographers. It is calculated by adding up the ASFRs. Each ASFR usually relates to 5 years. It is therefore necessary to multiply the 5 -year rate by five. The TFR is almost always expressed per one (1) woman where as ASFRs are often expressed per 1000 women. If that is the case then it is necessary to divide by 1000.</p>
                        <p class="equation">$$ \text{TFR} = \frac{\text{Sum of ASFR} \times 5}{1000} \text{ or } \frac{\sum \text{ASFR} \times 5}{1000} $$</p>
                        <p>Example Bangladesh 1974:<br>
                        TFR = $((200.4+337.3+310.9+261.5+197.0+95.4+13.5) \times 5) / 1000 = 7.08$</p>
                        <p>The great value of the TFR is that it is single figure measure that is independent of age structure. Formally, the TFR can be thought of as the number of children a woman would have if:</p>

                            <li>Throughout her reproductive life she experienced exact ASFR for the year in question.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>This is the simplest measure, indicating the number of deaths in a particular year per 1,000 of the population.</p>

                        <img src="../assets/images/2025_11_18_320387c6f9beb9aaa5c8g-64-1.jpg" alt="Standardization icon" class="content-image" style="max-width: 100px;">
                        <p>A legitimate desire is often felt for a single mortality rate, summing up the rates to be made between one rate and another. For this purpose, standardized death rate is generally used. This is a hypothetical figure which indicates what the crude death rate would be if the population being studied had the same age and sex composition as a population (any real or assumed population).</p>
                        <p>There are two common methods of deriving standardized rates, known as direct and indirect standardization.</p>

                        <h3>Direct Method of the Standardization</h3>
                        <p>In order to get over the problem of different population structure of the two populations to be compared, we choose a standard comparison. This we call the standard. The population to be standardized we call it the index population. We then apply the age (or characteristics) specific rates of the index population to the standard population.</p>
                        <p><strong>Steps:</strong></p>
                        <ol class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Define the standard population</li>
                            <li>Apply the Age Specific Death Rates for the index population to the numbers in each age group of the standard population to obtain the deaths we would expect in the population if the index rates applied.</li>
                            <li>Add these expected deaths over the age groups to obtain the total number of the expected deaths.</li>
                            <li>The crude rate obtained by dividing the total expected deaths by the total in the standard population; gives the standardized death rate for the index population.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3>Indirect standardization</h3>
                        <p>The direct method of standardization uses the population of each age group as the standard. The indirect method of standardization uses the age specific rates as the standard. In detail, the procedure is as follows:</p>

                            <li>Define the standard age specific mortality rates.</li>
                            <li>Apply the standard age specific rates to the index population to get the expected deaths in each age group.</li>
                            <li>Add the expected deaths of all the age groups to get the sum of the expected deaths. Divide the total observed deaths (real) by the total of the expected deaths to get the standardized mortality ratio</li>
                            <li>Multiply the standardized mortality ratio by the crude death rate of the standard population.</li>
