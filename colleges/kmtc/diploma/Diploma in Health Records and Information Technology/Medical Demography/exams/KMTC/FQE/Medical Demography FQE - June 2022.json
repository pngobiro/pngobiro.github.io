        { "id": "d", "text": "Age structure", "isCorrect": false }
      ],
      "explanation": "Formal demography focuses on the study of population size, growth, and structure (including age distribution). Population density refers to the number of people per unit area and is more related to geographic distribution rather than formal demographic analysis.",

        { "id": "d", "text": "Individual social data facilities", "isCorrect": false }
      ],
      "explanation": "Administrative records typically include educational data (schools, teachers, pupils) and facilities data. The option 'Data on personnel and harmful' contains a typographical error and does not represent a standard administrative record category.",

      ],
      "explanation": "The 5-10 age cohort (ages 5-9) is preferred because children in this age group are typically in school and more likely to accurately report their ages compared to younger children (0-4).",

      ],
      "explanation": "Whipple's index uses ages 23-62 as the denominator because these ages are less likely to be affected by age misreporting compared to very young or very old ages.",
      "hint": "It spans about 40 years starting from early 20s."
