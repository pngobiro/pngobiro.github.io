                We must admit that this is a dream come true. It is a truly
                daring act to resolve to pursue this mission. We are sure that
                the energy and enthusiasm currently burning in us at this point
                of consolidating our efforts to bring up the department of
                health records and information will not expire any soon. Surely,
                there is no better time than now.

                This curriculum was developed to steer professionalism among the
                health records and information students through instilling
                knowledge and skills required in the present, dynamic world
                today. It is also geared towards reengineering and sharing vast
                experience in the field of health records and Information
                management.

                Albert Einstein asserted that "Education is what you learn after
                you have forgotten everything you learnt in school" It is our
                hope that this guide will help in meeting all expectations of
                diverse, potential and future employers through sufficient
                exposure of the students to different orientations in health
                records and information management.
