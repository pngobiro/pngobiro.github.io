                        <h3 class="section-heading">a) Exudation</h3>
                        <p>These are changes in the formed elements of blood. In early stages there is slowing and stasis of blood stream due to increased vasodilatation. It causes the central stream of cells widening and peripheral plasma zone become narrower because of loss of plasma by exudation. This is called margination. As a result of redistribution of the nuetrophils, the central column comes close to the vessel wall leading to pavementing. Rolling and adhesion of neutrophils over the endothelial cells lining the blood vessel wall occur together with emigration where Leucocytes and red blood cells
                        escape through gaps between the endothelial cells. Cells also migrate into the extracellular space through a process of chemotaxis</p>

                            <li>1) <strong>Catarrhal inflammation</strong> - is a surface inflammation that is greatly associated by the secretion of the clear mucus</li>
                            <li>2) <strong>Exudative inflammation</strong>- It presents with a variety of inflammations. These are as follows:-
                                <ul>
                                    <li>i) Serous inflammation where there is excessive clear watery secretion and variable protein is produced without fibrin e.g. burns and pleural effusion. The serous fluid does not impede healing</li>
                                    <li>ii) Fibrinous exudation where there is fibrin deposition on the surface. Most often the fibrin deposit impedes resolution and adhesion may follow. A good example is in pneumonia with pleurisy</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>3) <strong>Pyogenic inflammation-suppurative</strong> It is an inflammation where there is production of pus and is caused by Pyogenic organisms mainly bacteria for instance appendicular abscess</li>
                            <li>4) <strong>Haemorrhagic inflammation.</strong> In this inflammation it is so severe that the blood vessels rapture presenting an important feature of haemorrhage for example in severe influenza pneumonia.</li>
