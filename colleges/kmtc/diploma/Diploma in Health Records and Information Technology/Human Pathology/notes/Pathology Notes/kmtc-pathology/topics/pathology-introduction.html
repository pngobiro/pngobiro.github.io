                        <p>Pathology is derived from two Greek words -pathos meaning suffering and logos meaning study. This implies that pathology is the scientific study of structure and function of the body in disease. It consists of the abnormalities that occur in normal anatomy and physiology owing to disease, whereas the study of disordered function is called pathophysiology.</p>

                        <p>The understanding of pathology is essential for all clinicians and medical practitioners including specialists since unless they know the causes, and understand the language spoken by the pathologist in the form of laboratory reports, they will not be able to institute appropriate treatment or suggest preventive measures to the patients.</p>

                        <p>For any student of medicine, the discipline of pathology forms a vital bridge between initial learning phase of preclinical sciences and the final phase of clinical subjects as stated by ( Mohan 2010). He further quotes the eminent founder of modern medicine Sir William Osler and summarizes the function of pathology by saying "your practice of medicine will be as good as your understanding of pathology. Once one masters pathology then by extension one would have mastered medicine."</p>

                        <p>Pathology is derived from a Greek word,</p>

                        <p>Pathology has evolved over the years as a distinct discipline from anatomy medicine and surgery. It evolved from religious beliefs and magic to rational approach (Hippocrates firmly believed in study of patients symptoms in the methods of diagnosis. End of medieval period was marked by backward steps in medicine with re introduction of supernatural concepts where dissection of human body was strictly forbidden as that will mean hurting the soul (Mohan, 2010).</p>

                        <p>The medieval period was followed by revival of learning (Renaissance). There was emphasis of philosophical and rational attitudes again. Morbid anatomy gained root by Car F. Von Rokitansky a German pathologist who performed over 30,000 autopsies (Mohan, 2010).</p>

                        <p>Up to the middle of the $19^{\text {th }}$ century correlation of clinical manifestations of disease with gross pathological findings at autopsy became the major method of study of disease. Pathology started developing as a diagnostic discipline with the evolution of cellular pathology which was closely linked to technology, advancements in machinery and improvement in microscope. The strides made in the latter half of $20^{\text {th }}$ century have made it possible to study diseases at molecular level and provide an evidence based and objective diagnosis which enabled the physician to institute appropriate therapy. This advance is in the field of molecular biology and diagnosis, treatment of genetic disorders, immunology and in cancer.</p>

                        <p>Initially disease was thought to be due to religious curse or evil spirit ( evil eyes) Hippocrates introduced a rational way of looking at disease and ethical concepts in the practice of medicine.</p>

                        <p>Generally in pathology, the patient is the person affected by disease while lesions are the characteristic changes in tissues and cells produced by disease in an individual or experimental animal. Morphological changes or pathological changes consist of examination of diseased tissues which can be seen microscopically or macroscopically. The factors responsible for the lesions is the aetiology and pathogenesis of disease is the mechanisms by which disease is produced.</p>
