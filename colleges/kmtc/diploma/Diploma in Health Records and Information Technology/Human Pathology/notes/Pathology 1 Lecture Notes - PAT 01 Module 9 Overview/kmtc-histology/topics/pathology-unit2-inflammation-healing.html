                        <p>a) Transient vasoconstriction of arterials.</p>

                            <li>This is an inconstant finding and in mild injury it disappears within $3-5$ seconds but in severe injury such as burns, it may last several minutes.</li>
                            <li>The mechanism is unknown; it may be neurogenic due to axonal reflex.</li>

                            <li>Which firstly involves arterials and then results in opening of new micro-vascular beds in the area. Mediators include prostaglandins and nitric oxide.</li>
                            <li>The blood flow thus will increase in injured and the volume of blood there will be 10 fold the normal level, this called active hyperaemia, which is the hallmark of the early haemodynamic changes in acute inflammation and it is the cause of hotness and redness which is observed clinically in acute inflammation.</li>
                            <li>This stage of increased blood flow will last for $10-15$ minutes and is caused by chemical mediators such as histamine and serotonin (5-HT); these are liberated from the tissues during their damage.</li>

                        <p>Phagocytosis is enhanced if the material to be phagocytosed is coated with certain plasma proteins called opsonins. These opsonins promote the adhesion between the particulate material and the phagocyte s cell membrane. The three major opsonins are:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>The Fc fragment of the immunoglobulin, components of the complement system</li>

                        <h3>2). Engulfment:</h3>
                        <p>During engulfment, extension of the cytoplasm (pseudopods) flow around the object to be engulfed, eventually resulting in complete enclosure of the particle within the phagosome created by the cytoplasmic membrane of the phagocytic cell.</p>
                        <p>As a result of fusion between the phagosome and lysosome, a phagolysosome is formed and the engulfed particle is exposed to the degradative lysosomal enzymes.</p>

                        <h3>3) Killing or degradation:</h3>
                        <p>The ultimate step in phagocytosis of bacteria is killing and degradation. There are two forms of bacterial killing</p>
                        <p>a). Oxygen-independent mechanism: This is mediated by some of the constituents of the primary and secondary granules of polymorphonuclear leukocytes. These include:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Bactericidal permeability increasing protein (BPI)</li>
                            <li>Lysozymes</li>
                            <li>Lactoferrin</li>
                            <li>Major basic protein</li>
                            <li>Defenses</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>It is probable that bacterial killing by lysosomal enzymes is inefficient and relatively unimportant compared with the oxygen dependent mechanisms. The lysosomal enzymes are, however, essential for the degradation of dead organisms within phagosomes.</p>

                        <p>b) Oxygen-dependent mechanism: There are two types of oxygen- dependent killing mechanisms</p>
                        <p>i) Non-myeloperoxidase dependent</p>
                        <p>The oxygen - dependent killing of microorganisms is due to formation of reactive oxygen species such as hydrogen peroxide ($H_{2}O_{2}$), super oxide ($O_{2}$) and hydroxyl ion ($HO-$) and possibly single oxygen ($1O_{2}$). These species have single unpaired electrons in their outer orbits that react with molecules in cell membrane or nucleus to cause damages. The destructive effects of $H_{2}O_{2}$ in the body are gauged by the action of the glutathione peroxidase and catalase.</p>
                        
                        <p>ii) Myeloperoxidase dependent</p>
                        <p>The bactericidal activity of $H_{2}O_{2}$ involves the lysosomal enzyme myeloperoxidase, which in the presence of halide ions converts $H_{2}O_{2}$ to hypochlorous acid ($HOCl$). This $H_{2}O_{2}$ - halide myeloperoxidase system is the most efficient bactericidal system in neutrophils. A similar mechanism is also effective against fungi, viruses, protozoa and helminths.</p>

                        <p>Like the vascular events, the cellular events (i.e. the adhesion, the transmigration, the chemotaxis, & the phagocytosis) are initiated or activated by chemical mediators.</p>

                        <p>There are different morphologic types of acute inflammation:</p>

                        <h3>1) Serous inflammation</h3>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>This is characterized by an outpouring of a thin fluid that is derived from either the blood serum or secretion of mesothelial cells lining the peritoneal, pleural, and pericardial cavities.</li>
                            <li>It resolves without reactions</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>2) Fibrinous inflammation</h3>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>More severe injuries result in greater vascular permeability that ultimately leads to exudation of larger molecules such as fibrinogens through the vascular barrier.</li>
                            <li>Fibrinous exudate is characteristic of inflammation in serous body cavities such as the pericardium (butter and bread appearance) and pleura.</li>
                            <li>Course of fibrinous inflammation include:
                                <ol type="i">
                                    <li>Resolution by fibrinolysis</li>
                                    <li>Scar formation between perietal and visceral surfaces i.e. the exudates get organized</li>
                                    <li>Fibrous strand formation that bridges the pericardial space.</li>

                            <li>This type of inflammation is characterized by the production of a large amount of pus.</li>
                            <li>Pus is a thick creamy liquid, yellowish or blood stained in colour and composed of :

                                    <li>a) Abscess formation: An abscess is a circumscribed accumulation of pus in a living tissue. It is encapsulated by a so-called pyogenic membrane, which consists of layers of fibrin, inflammatory cells and granulation tissue.</li>
                                    <li>b) Acute diffuse (phlegmonous) inflammation: This is characterized by diffuse spread of the exudate through tissue spaces. It is caused by virulent bacteria (eg. streptococci) without either localization or marked pus formation. Example: Cellulitis (in palmar spaces).</li>

                        <h3>4) Catarrhal inflammation</h3>
                        <p>This is a mild and superficial inflammation of the mucous membrane. It is commonly seen in the upper respiratory tract following viral infections where mucous secreting glands are present in large numbers, eg. Rhinitis.</p>

                        <h3>5) Pseudomembranous inflammation</h3>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>The basic elements of pseudomembranous inflammation are extensive confluent necrosis of the surface epithelium of an inflamed mucosa and severe acute inflammation of the underlying tissues. The fibrinogens in the inflamed tissue coagulate within the necrotic epithelium. And the fibrinogen, the necrotic epithelium, the neutrophilic polymorphs, red blood cells, bacteria and tissue debris form a false (pseudo) membrane which forms a white or colored layer over the surface of inflamed mucosa.</li>
                            <li>Pseudomembranous inflammation is exemplified by Dipthetric infection of the pharynx or larynx and Clostridium difficille infection in the large bowel following certain antibiotic use.</li>

                        <h3>A. Beneficial effects</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Dilution of toxins: The concentration of chemical and bacterial toxins at the site of inflammation is reduced by dilution in the exudate and its removal from the site by the flow of exudates from the venules through the tissue to the lymphatics.</li>
                            <li>Protective antibodies: Exudation results in the presence of plasma proteins including antibodies at the site of inflammation. Thus, antibodies directed against the causative organisms will react and promote microbial destruction by phagocytosis or complement-mediated cell lysis.</li>
                            <li>Fibrin formation: This prevents bacterial spread and enhances phagocytosis by leukocytes.</li>
                            <li>Plasma mediator systems provisions: The complement, coagulation, fibrinolytic, & kinin systems are provided to the area of injury by the process of inflammation.</li>
                            <li>Cell nutrition: The flow of inflammatory exudates brings with it glucose, oxygen and other nutrients to meet the metabolic requirements of the greatly increased number of cells. It also removes their solute waste products via lymphatic channels.</li>
                            <li>Promotion of immunity: Micro-organisms and their toxins are carried by the exudates, either free or in phagocytes, along the lymphaics to local lymph nodes where they stimulate an immune response with the generation of antibodies and cellular immune mechanisms of defense.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3>B. Harmful effects</h3>

                            <li>Tissue destruction Inflammation may result in tissue necrosis and the tissue necrosis may, in turn, incite inflammation.</li>
                            <li>Swelling: The swelling caused by inflammation may have serious mechanical effects at certain locations. Examples include acute epiglottitis with interference in breathing; Acute meningitis and encephalitis with effects of increased intracranial pressure.</li>
                            <li>Inappropriate response: The inflammatory seen in hypersensitivity reactions is inappropriate (i.e. exaggerated).</li>

                            <li>Monocytes and Macrophages are the prima Dona (primary cells) in chronic inflammation. Macrophages arise from the common precursor cells in the bone marrow, which give rise to blood monocytes.

                        <h3>Classification of chronic inflammation:</h3>
                        <p>Chronic inflammation can be classified into the following two types based on histologic features:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Nonspecific chronic inflammation: This involves a diffuse accumulation of macrophages and lymphocytes at site of injury that is usually productive with new fibrous tissue formations. E.g. Chronic cholecystitis.</li>
                            <li>Specific inflammation (granulomatous inflammation):
                                <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                    <li><strong>Definition:</strong> Granulomatous inflammation is characterized by the presence of granuloma. A granuloma is a microscopic aggregate of epithelioid cells. Epithelioid cell is an activated macrophage, with a modified epithelial cell-like appearance (hence the name epithelioid). The epitheloid cells can fuse with each other & form multinucleated giant cells. So, even though, a granuloma is basically a collection of epithelioid cells, it also usually contains multinucleated giant cell & is usually surrounded by a cuff of lymphocytes and occasional plasma cells.</li>
                                    <li>There are two types of giant cells:
                                        <ol type="a">
                                            <li>Foreign body-type giant cells which have irregularly scattered nuclei in presence of indigestible materials.</li>
                                            <li>Langhans giant cells in which the nuclei are arranged peripherally in a horse -shoe pattern which is seen typically in tuberculosis, sarcoidosis etc •</li>
                                        </ol>
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Giant cells are formed by fusion of macrophages perhaps by a concerted attempt of two or more cells to engulf a single particle.</p>

                        <h4>Pathogenesis:</h4>
                        <p>There are two types of granulomas, which differ in their pathogenesis:</p>
                        <p>A. Foreign body granuloma: These granulomas are initiated by inert foreign bodies such as talc, sutures (nonabsorbable), fibers, etc that are large enough to preclude phagocytosis by a single macrophage and do not incite an immune response.</p>
                        <p>B. Immune granulomas: Antigen presenting cells (macrophages) engulf a poorly soluble inciting agent. Then, the macrophage processes and presents part of the antigen (in association with MHC type2 molecules) to CD4+T helper 1 cells which become activated. The activated CD4+ T-cells produce cytokines (IL-2 and interferon gamma). The IL-2 activates other CD4+T helper cells and perpetuates the response while IFN-. is important in transforming macrophages into epitheloid cells and multinucleated giant cells. The cytokines have been implicated not only in the formation but also in the maintenance of granuloma.</p>
                        <p>Macrophage inhibitory factor helps to localize activated macrophages and epitheloid cells.</p>

                        <h4>Causes:</h4>
                        <p>Major causes of granulomatious inflammation include:</p>
                        <ol type="a">

                        <p><strong>Leucocytosis</strong> is also a common feature of inflammation, especially in bacterial infections. Its usual count is 15,000 to 20,000 cells/mm3. Most bacterial infections induce neutrophilia. Some viral infections such as infectious mononucleosis, & mumps cause lymphocytosis. Parasitic infestations & allergic reactions such as bronchial asthma & hay fever induce eosinophilia.</p>

                                    <li>Regeneration, the replacement of lost tissue by tissues similar in type and</li>
                                    <li>Repair (healing by scaring), the replacement of lost tissue by granulation tissue which matures to form scar tissue. Healing by fibrosis is inevitable when the surrounding specialized cells do not possess the capacity to proliferate.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Whether healing takes place by regeneration or by repair (scarring) is determined partly by the type of cells in the damaged organ & partly by the destruction or the intactness of the stromal frame work of the organ. Hence, it is important to know the types of cells in the body.</p>

                        <h3>Types of cells</h3>
                        <p>Based on their proliferative capacity there are three types of cells:</p>
                        
                        <h4>1. Labile cells</h4>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>These are cells which have a continuous turn over by programmed division of stem cells. They are found in the surface epithelium of the gastrointestinal treat, urinary tract or the skin. The cells of lymphoid and haemopoietic systems are further examples of labile cells.</li>
                            <li>The chances of regeneration are excellent.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>2. Stable cells</h4>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Tissues which have such type of cells have normally a much lower level of replication and there are few stem cells. However, the cells of such tissues can undergo rapid division in response to injury. For example, mesenchymal cells such as smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts, osteoblasts and endothelial cells are stable cells which can proliferate. Liver, endocrine glands and renal tubular epithelium has also such type of cells which can regenerate.</li>
                            <li>Their chances of regeneration are good.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>3. Permanent cells</h4>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>These are non-dividing cells. If lost, permanent cells cannot be replaced, because they don not have the capacity to proliferate. For example: adult neurons, striated muscle cells, and cells of the lens.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>a. Healing by regeneration</h4>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Definition: Regeneration (generare=bring to life) is the renewal of a lost tissue in which the lost cells are replaced by identical ones.</li>
                            <li>Regeneration involves two processes:
                                <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                    <li>Proliferation of surviving cells to replace lost tissue</li>
                                    <li>Migration of surviving cells into the vacant space.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>The capacity of a tissue for regeneration depends on its:
                                <ol type="i">
                                    <li>proliferative ability,</li>
                                    <li>degree of damage to stromal framework and</li>
                                    <li>On the type and severity of the damage.</li>
                                </ol>
                            </li>
                            <li>Tissues formed of labile and stable cells can regenerate provided that stromal framework are intact.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>b. Repair (Healing by connective tissue)</h4>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Definition: - Repair is the orderly process by which lost tissue is eventually replaced by a scar.</li>
                            <li>A wound in which only the lining epithelium is affected heals exclusively by regeneration. In contrast, wounds that extend through the basement membrane to the connective tissue, for example, the dermis in the skin or the sub-mucosa in the gastrointestinal tract, lead to the formation of granulation tissue and eventual scarring.</li>
                            <li>Tissues containing terminally differentiated (permanent) cells such as neurons and skeletal muscle cells can not heal by regeneration. Rather the lost permanent cells are replaced by formation of granulation tissue.</li>
                            <li>In granulation-tissue formation, three phases may be observed:
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Phase of inflammation: At this phase, inflammatory exudate containing polymorphs is seen in the area of tissue injury. In addition, there is platelet aggregation and fibrin deposition.</li>
                                    <li>Phase of demolition: The dead cells liberate their autolytic enzymes, and other enzymes (proteolytic) come from disintegrating polymorphs. There is an associated macrophage infiltration. These cells ingest particulate matter, either digesting or removing it.</li>
                                    <li>Ingrowths of granulation tissue This is characterized by proliferation of fibroblasts and ingrowths of new blood vessels into the area of injury, with a variable number of inflammatory cells.</li>
                                </ol>
                            </li>
                            <li>Fibroblasts actively synthesize and secrete extra-cellular matrix components, including fibronectin, proteoglycans, and collagen types I and III. The fibronectin and proteoglycans form the scaffolding for rebuilding of the matrix. Fibronectin binds to fibrin and acts as a chemotactic factor for the recruitment of more fibroblasts and macrophages. The synthesis of collagen by fibroblasts begins within 24 hours of the injury although its deposition in the tissue is not apparent until 4 days. By day 5, collagen type III is the predominant matrix protein being produced; but by day 7 to 8, type I is prominent, and it eventually becomes the major collagen of mature scar tissue. This type I collagen is responsible for providing the tensile strength of the matrix in a scar.</li>
                            <li>Coincident with fibroblast proliferation there is angiogenesis (neovascularization), a proliferation and formation of new small blood vessels. Vascular proliferation starts 48 to 72 hours after injury and lasts for several days.</li>
                            <li>With further healing, there is an increase in extracellular constituents, mostly collagen, with a decrease in the number of active fibroblasts and new vessels. Despite an increased collagenase activity in the wound (responsible for removal of built collagen), collagen accumulates at a steady rate, usually reaching a maximum 2 to 3 months after the injury.</li>
                            <li>The tensile strength of the wound continues to increase many months after the collagen content has reached a maximum. As the collagen content of the wound increases, many of the newly formed vessels disappear. This vascular involution which takes place in a few weeks, dramatically transforms a richly vascularized tissue in to a pale, avascular scar tissue.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Wound contraction</h4>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Wound contraction is a mechanical reduction in the size of the defect. The wound is reduced approximately by $70-80\%$ of its original size. Contraction results in much faster healing, since only one-quarter to one-third of the amount of destroyed tissue has to be replaced. If contraction is prevented, healing is slow and a large ugly scar is formed.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Causes of contraction</h4>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>It is said to be due to contraction by myofibroblasts. Myofibroblasts have the features intermediate between those of fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells. Two to three days after the injury they migrate into the wound and their active contraction decrease the size of the defect.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Summary</h4>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Following tissue injury, whether healing occurs by regeneration or scarring is determined by the degree of tissue destruction, the capacity of the parenchymal cells to proliferate, and the degree of destructon of stromal framework.</li>
                            <li>In the above discussion, regeneration, repair, and contraction have been dealt with separately. Yet they are not mutually exclusive processes. On the contrary, the three processes almost invariably participate together in wound healing.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Molecular control of healing process</h4>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>As seen above, healing involves an orderly sequence of events which includes regeneration and migration of specialized cells, angiogenesis, proliferation of fibroblasts and related cells, matrix protein synthesis and finally cessation of these processes.</li>
                            <li>These processes, at least in part, are mediated by a series of low molecular weight polypeptides referred to as growth factors.</li>
                            <li>These growth factors have the capacity to stimulate cell division and proliferation. Some of the factors, known to play a role in the healing process, are briefly discussed below.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Sources of Growth Factors:</h4>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Following injury, growth factors may be derived from a number of sources such as:
                                <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                    <li>Platelets, activated after endothelial damage,</li>
                                    <li>Damaged epithelial cells,</li>
                                    <li>Circulating serum growth factors,</li>
                                    <li>Macrophages, or</li>
                                    <li>Lymphocytes recruited to the area of injury</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>The healing process ceases when lost tissue has been replaced. The mechanisms regulating this process are not fully understood. TGF- $\beta$ act as a growth inhibitor for both epithelial and endothelial cells and regulate their regeneration.</li>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>The two processes of healing, described above, can occur during healing of a diseased organ or during healing of a wound. A wound can be accidental or surgical.</li>
                            <li>Healing of a wound demonstrates both epithelial regeneration (healing of the epidermis) and repair by scarring (healing of the dermis).</li>
                            <li>There are two patterns of wound healing depending on the amount of tissue damage:
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Healing by first intention (Primary union)</li>
                                    <li>Healing by second intention</li>
                                </ol>
                            </li>
                            <li>These two patterns are essentially the same process varying only in amount.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>1. Healing by first intention (primary union)</h3>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>The least complicated example of wound healing is the healing of a clean surgical incision. The wound edges are approximated by surgical sutures, and healing occurs with a minimal loss of tissue. Such healing is referred to, surgically, as primary union or healing by first intention. The incision causes the death of a limited number of epithelial cells as well as of dermal adnexa and connective tissue cells; the incisional space is narrow and immediately fills with clotted blood, containing fibrin and blood cells; dehydration of the surface clot forms the well-known scab that covers the wound and seals it from the environment almost at once.</li>
                            <li>Within 24 hours, neutrophils appear at the margins of the incision, moving toward the fibrin clot. The epidermis at its cut edges thickens as a result of mitotic activity of basal cells and, within 24 to 48 hours, spurs of epithelial cells from the edges both migrate and grow along the cut margins of the dermis and beneath the surface scab to fuse in the midline, thus producing a continuous but thin epithelial layer.</li>
                            <li>By day 3, the neutrophils have been largely replaced by macrophages. Granulation tissue progressively invades the incisional space. Collagen fibers are now present in the margins of the incision, but at first these are vertically oriented and do not bridge the incision.</li>
                            <li>Epithelial cell proliferation continues, thickening the epidermal covering layer.</li>
                            <li>By day 5, the incisional space is filled with granulation tissue. Neovascularization is maximal. Collagen fibrils become more abundant and begin to bridge the incision. The epidermis recovers its normal thickness and differentiation of surface cells yields a mature epidermal architecture with surface keratinization.</li>
                            <li>During the second week, there is continued accumulation of collagen and proliferation of fibroblasts. Leukocytic infiltrate, edema, and increased vascularity have largely disappeared. At this time, the long process of blanching begins, accomplished by the increased accumulation of collagen within the incisional scar, accompanied by regression of vascular channels.</li>
                            <li>By the end of the first month, the scar comprises a cellular connective tissue devoid of inflammatory infiltrate, covered now by an intact epidermis. The dermal appendages that have been destroyed in the line of the incision are permanently lost. Tensile strength of the wound increases thereafter, but it may take months for the wounded area to obtain its maximal strength.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>2. Healing by second intention (secondary union)</h3>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>When there is more extensive loss of cells and tissue, such as occurs in infarction, inflammatory ulceration, abscess formation, and surface wounds that create large defects, the reparative process is more complicated. The common denominator in all these situations is a large tissue defect that must be filled. Regeneration of parenchymal cells cannot completely reconstitute the original architecture. Abundant granulation tissue grows in from the margin to complete the repair. This form of healing is referred to as secondary union or healing by second intention.</li>
                            <li>Secondary healing differs from primary healing in several respects:
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Inevitably, large tissue defects initially have more fibrin and more necrotic debris and exudate that must be removed. Consequently, the inflammatory reaction is more intense.</li>
                                    <li>Much larger amounts of granulation tissue are formed. When a large defect occurs in deeper tissues, such as in a viscus, granulation tissue bears the full responsibility for its closure, because drainage to the surface cannot occur.</li>
                                    <li>Perhaps the feature that most clearly differentiates primary from secondary healing is the phenomenon of wound contraction, which occurs in large surface wounds.</li>
                                    <li>Healing by second intention takes much longer than when it occurs by first intention.</li>
                                </ol>
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Factors that influence wound healing</h3>
                        <p>A number of factors can alter the rate and efficiency of healing. These can be classified in to those which act locally, and those which have systemic effects. Most of these factors have been established in studies of skin wound healing but many are likely to be of relevance to healing at other sites.</p>

                        <h4>Local Factors</h4>
                        <p><strong>† Type, size, and location of the wound</strong></p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>A clean, aseptic wound produced by the surgeon’s scalpel heals faster than a wound produced by blunt trauma, which exhibits abundant necrosis and irregular edges. Small blunt wounds heal faster than larger ones. Injuries in richly vascularized areas (e.g., the face) heal faster than those in poorly vascularized ones (e.g., the foot).</li>
                            <li>In areas where the skin adheres to bony surfaces, as in injuries over the tibia, wound contraction and adequate apposition of the edges are difficult. Hence, such wounds heal slowly.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p><strong>† Vascular supply</strong></p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Wounds with impaired blood supply heal slowly. For example, the healing of leg wounds in patients with varicose veins is prolonged. Ischemia due to pressure produces bed sores and then prevents their healing. Ischemia due to arterial obstruction, often in the lower extremities of diabetics, also prevents healing.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p><strong>† Infection</strong></p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Wounds provide a portal of entry for microorganisms. Infection delays or prevents healing, promotes the formation of excessive granulation tissue (proud flesh), and may result in large, deforming scars.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p><strong>† Movement</strong></p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Early motion, particularly before tensile strength has been established, subjects a wound to persistent trauma, thus preventing or retarding healing.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p><strong>† Ionizing radiation</strong></p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Prior irradiation leaves vascular lesions that interfere with blood supply and result in slow wound healing. Acutely, irradiation of a wound blocks cell proliferation, inhibits contraction, and retards the formation of granulation tissue.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Systemic Factors</h4>
                        <p><strong>† Circulatory status</strong></p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Cardiovascular status, by determining the blood supply to the injured area, is important for wound healing. Poor healing attributed to old age is often due, largely, to impaired circulation.</li>
                        </ul>

                            <li>Poorly controlled diabetes mellitus is associated with delayed wound healing. The risk of infection in clean wound approaches fivefold the risk in non- diabetics.</li>
                            <li>In diabetic patients, there can be impaired circulation secondary to arteriosclerosis and impaired sensation due to diabetic neuropathy. The impaired sensation renders the lower extremity blind to every day hazards. Hence, in diabetic patients, wounds heal the very slowly.</li>

                        <p><strong>† Nutritional deficiencies</strong></p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Protein deficiency: In protein depletion there is an impairment of granulation tissue and collagen formation, resulting in a great delay in wound healing.</li>
                            <li>Vitamin deficiency: Vitamin C is required for collagen synthesis and secretion. It is required in hydroxylation of proline and lysine in the process of collagen synthesis. Vitamin C deficiency (scurvy) results in grossly deficient wound healing, with a lack of vascular proliferation and collagen deposition.</li>
                            <li>Trace element deficiency: Zinc (a co-factor of several enzymes) deficiency will retard healing by preventing cell proliferation. Zinc is necessary in several DNA and RNA polymerases and transferases; hence, a deficiency state will inhibit mitosis. Proliferation of fibroblasts (fibroplasia) is, therefore, retarded.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p><strong>† Hormones</strong></p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Corticosteroids impair wound healing, an effect attributed to an inhibition of ollagen synthesis. However, these hormones have many other effects, including antiinflammatory actions and a general depression of protein synthesis. It also inhibits fibroplasia and neovascularization. Both epithelialization and contraction are impaired. It is, therefore, difficult to attribute their inhibition of wound healing to any one specific mechanism.</li>
                            <li>Thyroid hormones, androgens, estrogens and growth hormone also influence wound healing. This effect, however, may be more due to their regulation of general metabolic status rather than to a specific modification of the healing process.</li>

                            <li>Anti-inflammatory medications do not interfere with wound healing when administered at the usual daily dosages. Asprin and indomethacin both inhibit prostaglandin synthesis and thus delay healing.</li>

                        <h4>2. Deficient Scar Formation</h4>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Inadequate formation of granulation tissue or an inability to form a suitable extracellular matrix leads to deficient scar formation and its complications. The complications of deficient scar formation are:
                                <ol type="a">
                                    <li>Wound dehiscence & incisional hernias</li>
                                    <li>Ulceration</li>
                                </ol>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>a. Wound Dehiscence and Incisional Hernias:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Dehiscence (bursting of a wound) is of most concern after abdominal surgery. If insufficient extracellular matrix is deposited or there is inadequate cross-linking of the matrix, weak scars result. Dehiscence occurs in $0.5\%$ to $5\%$ of abdominal operations. Inappropriate suture material and poor surgical techniques are important factors. Wound infection, increased mechanical stress on the wound from vomiting, coughing, or ileus is a factor in most cases of abdominal dehiscence. Systemic factors that predispose to dehiscence include poor metabolic status, such as vitamin C deficiency, hypoproteinemia, and the general inanition that often accompanies metastatic cancer. Dehiscence of an abdominal wound can be a life threatening complication, in some studies carrying mortality as high as $30\%$.</li>
                            <li>An incisional hernia, usually of the abdominal wall, refers to a defect caused by poor wound healing following surgery into which the intestines protrude.</li>
                            <li>Ulceration: Wounds ulcerate because of an inadequate intrinsic blood supply or insufficient vascularization during healing. For example, leg wounds in persons with varicose veins or severe atherosclerosis typically ulcerate. Non-healing wounds also develop in areas devoid of sensation because of persistent trauma. Such trophic or neuropathic ulcers are occasionally seen in patients with leprosy, diabetic peripheral neuropathy and in tertiary syphilis from spinal involvement (in tabes dorsalis).</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>3. Excessive Scar Formation</h4>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>An excessive deposition of extracellular matrix at the wound site results in a hypertrophic scar or a keloid. The rate of collagen synthesis, the ratio of type III to type I collagen, and the number of reducible cross-links remain high, a situation that indicates a maturation arrest, or block, in the healing process.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p><strong>Keloid Formation</strong></p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>An excessive formation of collagenous tissue results in the appearance of a raised area of scar tissue called keloid. It is an exuberant scar that tends to progress and recur after excision. The cause of this is unknown. Genetic predisposition, repeated trauma, and irritation caused by foreign body, hair, keratin, etc., may play a part. It is especially frequent after burns. It is common in areas of the neck & in the ear lobes.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p><strong>Hypertrophic Scar</strong></p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Hypertrophic scar is structurally similar to keloid. However, hypertrophic scar never gets worse after 6 months unlike keloid, which gets worse even after a year and some may even progress for 5 to 10 years. Following excision, a keloid recurres, whereas a hypertrophic scar does not.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>4. Excessive contraction</h4>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>A decrease in the size of a wound depends on the presence of myofibroblasts, development of cell-cell contacts and sustained cell contraction. An exaggeration of these processes is termed contracture (cicatrisation) and results in severe deformity of the wound and surrounding tissues. Contracture (cicatrisation) is also said to arise as a result of late reduction in the size of the wound. Interestingly, the regions that normally show minimal wound contraction (such as the palms, the soles, and the anterior aspect of the thorax) are the ones prone to contractures. Contractures are particularly conspicuous in the healing of serious burns. Contractures of the skin and underlying connective tissue can be severe enough to compromise the movement of joints. Cicatrisation is also important in hollow viscera such as urethra, esophagus, and intestine. It leads to progressive stenosis with stricture formation. In the alimentary tract, a contracture (stricture) can result in an obstruction to the passage of food in the esophagus or a block in the flow of intestinal contents.</li>
                            <li>Several diseases are characterized by contracture and irreversible fibrosis of the superficial fascia, including Dupuytren disease (palmar contracture), plantar contracture (Lederhosen disease), and Peyronie disease (contracture of the cavernous tissues of the penis). In these diseases, there is no known precipitating injury, even though the basic process is similar to the contracture in wound healing.</li>

                            <li>The basic processes involved in the healing of bone fractures bear many resemblances to those seen in skin wound healing. Unlike healing of a skin wound, however, the defect caused by a fracture is repaired not by a fibrous tissue, but by specialized bone forming tissue so that, under favorable circumstances, the bone is restored nearly to normal.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Structure of bone</h3>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Bone is composed of calcified osteoid tissue, which consists of collagen fibers embedded in a mucoprotein matrix (osteomucin). Depending on the arrangement of the collagen fibers, there are two histological types of bone:
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Woven, immature or non-lamellar bone: This shows irregularity in the arrangement of the collagen bundles and in the distribution of the osteocytes. The osseomucin is less abundant and it also contains less calcium.</li>
                                    <li>Lamellar or adult bone: In this type of bone, the collagen bundles are arranged in parallel sheets.</li>
                                </ol>
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Stages in Fracture Healing (Bone Regeneration)</h3>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Stage 1: Haematoma formation. Immediately following the injury, there is a variable amount of bleeding from torn vessels; if the periosteum is torn, this blood may extend into the surrounding muscles. If it is subsequently organized and ossified, myositis ossificans results.</li>
                            <li>Stage 2: Inflammation. The tissue damage excites an inflammatory response, the exudate adding more fibrin to the clot already present. The inflammatory changes differ in no way from those seen in other inflamed tissues. There is an increased blood flow and a polymorphonuclear leucocytic infiltration. The haematoma attains a fusiform shape.</li>
                            <li>Stage 3: Demolition. Macrophages invade the clot and remove the fibrin, red cells, the inflammatory exudate, and debris. Any fragments of bone, which have become detached from their blood supply, undergo necrosis, and are attacked by macrophages and osteoclasts.</li>
                            <li>Stage 4: Formation of granulation tissue. Following this phase of demolition, there is an ingrowth of capillary loops and mesenchymal cells derived from the periosteum and the endosteum of the cancellous bone. These cells have osteogenic potential and together with the newly formed blood vessels contribute to the granulation - tissue formation.</li>
                            <li>Stage 5: Woven bone and cartilage formation. The mesenchymal osteoblasts then differentiate to form either woven bone or cartilage. The term Callus, derived from the Latin and meaning hard, is often used to describe the material uniting the fracture ends regardless of its consistency. When this is granulation tissue, the callus is soft, but as bone or cartilage formation occurs, it becomes hard.</li>
                            <li>Stage 6: Formation of lamellar bone. The dead calcified cartilage or woven bone is next invaded by capillaries headed by osteoclasts. As the initial scaffolding (provisional callus) is removed, osteoblasts lay down osteoid, which calcifies to form bone. Its collagen bundles are now arranged in orderly lamellar fashion, for the most part concentrically around the blood vessels, and in this way the Haversian systems are formed. Adjacent to the periosteum and endosteum the lamellae are parallel to the surface as in the normal bone. This phase of formation of definitive lamellar bone merges with the last stage.</li>
                            <li>Stage 7: Remodelling. The final remodeling process involving the continued osteoclastic removal and osteoblastic laying down of bone results in the formation of a bone, which differs remarkably little from the original tissue. The external callus is slowly removed, the intermediate callus becomes converted into compact bone containing Haversian systems, while the internal callus is hollowed out into a marrow cavity in which only a few spicules of cancellous bone remain.</li>
