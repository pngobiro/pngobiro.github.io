                            <li>Histopathological examination studies tissues under the microscope. During this study, the pathologist looks for abnormal structures in the tissue.</li>
                            <li>Tissues for histopathological examination are obtained by biopsy. Biopsy is a tissue sample from a living person to identify the disease. Biopsy can be either incisional or excisional.</li>
                            <li>Once the tissue is removed from the patient, it has to be immediately fixed by putting it into adequate amount of $10\%$ Formaldehyde ($10\%$ formalin) before sending it to the pathologist.</li>
                            <li>The purpose of fixation is:
                                <ol>
                                    <li>To prevent autolysis and bacterial decomposition and putrefaction</li>
                                    <li>To coagulate the tissue to prevent loss of easily diffusible substances</li>
                                    <li>To fortify the tissue against the deleterious effects of the various stages in the preparation of sections and tissue processing.</li>
                                    <li>To leave the tissues in a condition which facilitates differential staining with dyes and other reagents.</li>

                            <li>Once the tissue arrives at the pathology department, the pathologists will exam it macroscopically (i.e. naked-eye examination of tissues).</li>
                            <li>Then the tissue is processed to make it ready for microscopic examination. The whole purpose of the tissue processing is to prepare a very thin tissue (i.e. five to seven $\mu m$ or one cell thick tissue) which can be clearly seen under the microscope. The tissue is processed by putting it into different chemicals. It is then impregnated (embedded) in paraffin, sectioned (cut) into thin slices, & is finally stained. The stains can be Hematoxylin/Eosin stain or special stains such as PAS, Immunohistochemistry, etc...</li>
                            <li>The Hematoxylin/Eosin stain is usually abbreviated as H&E stain. The H&E stain is routinely used. It gives the nucleus a blue color & the cytoplasm & the extracellular matrix a pinkish color. Then the pathologist will look for abnormal structures in the tissue.</li>
                            <li>And based on this abnormal morphology he/she will make the diagnosis. Histopathology is usually the gold standard for pathologic diagnosis.</li>

                        <h3>Cytopathologic techniques</h3>
                        <p>Cytopathology is the study of cells from various body sites to determine the cause or nature of disease.</p>

                        <h4>Applications of cytopathology:</h4>
                        <p>The main applications of cytology include the following:</p>
                        <ol class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Screening for the early detection of asymptomatic cancer. For example, the examination of scrapings from cervix for early detection and prevention of cervical cancer.</li>
                            <li>Diagnosis of symptomatic cancer. Cytopathology may be used alone or in conjunction with other modalities to diagnose tumors revealed by physical or radiological examinations.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>It can be used in the diagnosis of cysts, inflammatory conditions and infections of various organs.</p>
                        <ol start="3" class="enhanced-list">
                             <li>Surveillance of patients treated for cancer. For some types of cancers, cytology is the most feasible method of surveillance to detect recurrence. The best example is periodic urine cytology to monitor the recurrence of cancer of the urinary tract.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h4>Advantages of cytologic examination</h4>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Compared to histopathologic technique it is cheap, takes less time and needs no anesthesia to take specimens. Therefore, it is appropriate for developing countries with limited resources like Kenya. In addition, it is complementary to histopathological examination.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Cytopathologic methods</h4>
                        <p>There are different cytopathologic methods including:</p>

                        <h5>1. Fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC)</h5>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>In FNAC, cells are obtained by aspirating the diseased organ using a very thin needle under negative pressure. Virtually any organ or tissue can be sampled by fine-needle aspiration.</li>
                            <li>The aspirated cells are then stained & are studied under the microscope. Superficial organs (e.g. thyroid, breast, lymph nodes, skin and soft tissues) can be easily aspirated. Deep organs, such as the lung, mediastinum, liver, pancreas, kidney, adrenal gland, and retroperitoneum are aspirated with guidance by fluoroscopy, ultrasound or CT scan.</li>
                            <li>FNAC is cheap, fast, & accurate in diagnosing many diseases.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h5>2. Exfoliative cytology</h5>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Refers to the examination of cells that are shed spontaneously into body fluids or secretions. Examples include sputum, cerebrospinal fluid, urine, effusions in body cavities (pleura, pericardium, peritoneum), nipple discharge and vaginal discharge.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h5>3. Abrasive cytology</h5>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Refers to methods by which cells are dislodged by various tools from body surfaces (skin, mucous membranes, and serous membranes). E.g. preparation of cervical smears with a spatula or a small brush to detect cancer of the uterine cervix at early stages. Such cervical smears, also called Pap smears, can significantly reduce the mortality from cervical cancer.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p><strong>Hematological examination:</strong> This is a method by which abnormalities of the cells of the blood and their precursors in the bone marrow are investigated to diagnose the different kinds of anemia & leukemia.</p>

                        <p><strong>Immunohistochemistry:</strong> This is a method is used to detect a specific antigen in the tissue in order to identify the type of disease.</p>

                        <p><strong>Microbiological examination:</strong> This is a method, by which body fluids, excised tissue, etc. are examined by microscopical, cultural and serological techniques to identify micro-organisms responsible for many diseases.</p>

                        <p><strong>Biochemical examination:</strong> This is a method by which the metabolic disturbances of disease are investigated by assay of various normal and abnormal compounds in the blood, urine, etc.</p>

                        <p><strong>Clinical genetics (cytogenetics):</strong> This is a method in which inherited chromosomal abnormalities in the germ cells or acquired chromosomal abnormalities in somatic cells are investigated using the techniques of molecular biology.</p>

                        <p><strong>Molecular techniques:</strong> Different molecular techniques such as fluorescent in situ hybridization, Southern blot, etc. can be used to detect genetic diseases.</p>

                        <p><strong>Autopsy:</strong> Autopsy is examination of the dead body to identify the cause of death. This can be for forensic or clinical purposes.</p>

                        <p>The relative importance of each of the above disciplines to our understanding of disease varies for different types of diseases. For example, in diabetes mellitus, biochemical investigation provides the best means of diagnosis and is of greatest value in the control of the disease, whereas in the diagnosis of tumors, FNAC & histopathology contribute much.</p>

                        <p>However, for most diseases, diagnosis is based on a combination of pathological investigations.</p>

                        <h4>Coagulative necrosis</h4>

                            <li>Results from sudden severe ischaemia in such organs as the heart, kidneys etc.</li>
                            <li>Microscopically, the fine structural details of the affected tissues and cells are lost but their outlines are maintained.</li>
                            <li>The nucleus is lost.</li>
                            <li>The cytoplasm is converted into homogenous deeply eosinophilic and structurally less material.</li>

                        </ul>

                        <h4>Liquefactive necrosis</h4>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>This type of necrosis is usually seen in two situations;
                                <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                    <li>Brain infarctions i.e. ischaemic destruction of the brain tissues</li>

                            </li>
                            <li>Liquefactive necrosis is characterized by complete digestion of dead cells by enzymes and thus necrotic area is eventually liquefied i.e. converted into a cyst filled with debris and fluid.</li>

                            <li>This is a specific pattern of cell deaths seen in adipose tissue due to action of lipase.</li>
                            <li>It is more commonly seen in acute pancreatitis. The released fatty acids from necrotic cells, complex with calcium to create calcium soaps. These are grossly seen as chalky white deposit.</li>
                            <li>Fat necrosis can also be induced by mechanical trauma as in female breast (traumatic fat necrosis).</li>

                            <li>It is encountered principally in the centre of tuberculous granuloma</li>
                            <li>The body responds to tuberculous infections in a specific form of chronic inflammation; the morphologic unit of this is called granuloma.</li>
                            <li>Grossly, the caseous material is soft, friable, whitish-gray cheesy material.</li>
                            <li>Microscopically, the area is surrounded by granulomatous inflammation. It has distinctive amorphous granular pinkish debris.</li>

                        <h4>Gangrenous necrosis</h4>

                            <li>It describes the limb (usually the lower limb) that has lost its blood supply and has subsequently been attacked by bacteria; so it is a combination of coagulative necrosis modified by liquefactive action of enzymes derived from bacteria and inflammatory cells.</li>
                            <li>When coagulative pattern dominates, the affected parts shrink and appear contracted (dry), the process is termed dry gangrene. Conversely, when the affected parts are swollen (oedematous) the process is termed wet gangrene.</li>

                        <h3>Morphological types of cellular adaptation</h3>
                        <p>There are numerous types of cellular adaptation but four are common;</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Atrophy</li>
                            <li>Hypertrophy</li>

                        <h4>HYPERPLASIA</h4>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Is one type of cellular adaptation in which there is an increase in number of cells in an organ or tissue which may cause increased volume/size.</li>
                            <li>Hyperplasia takes place if the cellular population is capable of synthesizing DNA, permitting mitotic division.</li>

                        </ul>

                        <p><strong>Hormonal physiologic hyperplasia</strong></p>
                        <p>It occurs due to hormonal stimulation in response to physiologic demand, e.g. proliferation of glandular epithelium of the female breast at puberty and during pregnancy and hyperplasia of pregnant uterus.</p>

                        <p><strong>Compensatory physiologic hyperplasia</strong></p>
                        <p>It occurs when a part of an organ is removed, e.g. hyperplasia that occurs when a portion of liver is removed.</p>

                        <p><strong>Pathologic hyperplasia</strong></p>
                        <p>Most forms of pathologic hyperplasia are instances of excessive hormonal stimulation or are effects of growth factors on target cells, e.g. hyperplasia of endometrium, hyperplasia of prostate, hyperplasia of connective tissue cells in wound healing, skin warts.</p>

                        <h4>HYPERTROPHY</h4>
                        <p>Is one type of adaptive response in which there is an increase in size of cells resulting from synthesis of more structural components in response to increased functional demand or by specific hormonal stimulation.</p>

                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Atrophy represents a reduction in structural components of cells.</li>
                            <li>The cell contains fewer mitochondria and microfilaments and lesser amounts of endoplasmic reticulum.</li>
                            <li>There is a finely regulated balance between protein synthesis and degradation in normal cells. Either decreased synthesis or increased catabolism or both may cause atrophy.</li>
                            <li>Slight increase of degradation over a long period of time may result in atrophy.</li>
                            <li>Intracellular non-lysomal proteinases play a role in such protein degradation.</li>
                            <li>Atrophy also accompanied by marked increases in number of autophagic vacuoles within the cell that contain fragments of cell components (e.g. mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum), which are destined for destruction, into which the lysosome discharge their hydrolytic contents. The cellular components are then digested.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>METAPLASIA</h4>
                        <p>Is one type of adaptive response in which one adult cell type (epithelial or messenchymal) is replaced by another cell type. It represents an adaptive substitution of cells more sensitive to stress by cell types better able to withstand the adverse environment.</p>

                                            <li>Occurs in respiratory tract in response to irritation. In habitual cigarette smoker, the normal columnar ciliated epithelial cells of the trachea and bronchi are often replaced focally or widely by stratified squamous epithelial cells.</li>
                                            <li>Stone in the excretory duct of salivary glands, pancreas and bile ducts may cause replacement of normal columnar epithelium by non-functioning stratified squamous epithelial cells.</li>
                                            <li>Deficiency of vitamin A induces squamous metaplasia in the respiratory epithelium.</li>
                                            <li>Squamous metaplasia of endocervical epithelium in response to chronic inflammation.</li>

                        </ol>
                        <p>NOTE: In all instances, the more rugged stratified squamous epithelium is able to survive under circumstances in which more fragile specialized epithelium most likely would have succumbed.</p>
                        <p>The influences that predispose to such metaplasia, if present, may induce cancer transformation of metaplastic epithelium. Thus common cancer in respiratory tract is composed of squamous cells.</p>
                        <ol type="a" start="2">
                            <li>Squamous to columnar metaplasia</li>

                        <p>Barret’s oesophagus, in which the squamous oesophageal epithelium is replaced by gastric columnar cells. The resulting cancers that may arise are glandular (adeno) carcinoma.</p>

                        <p>Fibrous connective tissue cells may become transformed to osteoblasts or chondroblasts to produce bone or catillage where it is normally not encountered. This occurs particularly in the foci of injury but occasionally with no cause.</p>

                        <p>Pathogenesis of metaplasia</p>
                        <p>Metaplasia is thought to arise from genetic reprogramming of stem cells that are known to exist in most epithelium or undifferentiated messenchymal cells present in connective tissue. Chemical, vitamins or growth factors most likely play a role in such metaplasia.</p>

                            <li>Fatty change This is accumulation of triglycerides inside parenchymal cells. It is caused by an imbalance between the uptake, utilization, & secretion of fat. Fatty change is usually seen in the liver, heart, or kidney. Fatty liver may be caused by alcohol, diabetes mellitus, malnutrition, obesity, & poisonings.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>These etiologies cause accumulation of fat in the hepatocytes by the following mechanisms:</p>

                                    <li>Bilirubin: Bilirubin is a yellowish pigment, mainly produced during the degradation of hemoglobin. Excess accumulation of bilirubin causes yellowish discoloration of the sclerae, mucosae, & internal organs. Such a yellowish discoloration is called jaundice.</li>

It appears in tissues as golden brown amorphous aggregates & is identified by its staining reaction (blue color) with the Prussian blue dye. Hemosiderin exists normally in small amounts within tissue macrophages of the bone marrow, liver, & spleen as physiologic iron stores. It accumulates in tissues in excess amounts in certain diseases. This excess accumulation is divided into 2 types:
