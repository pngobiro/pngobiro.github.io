                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Common signs and symptoms of eye disorders include decrease in visual acuity, headaches, and pain in the eye or adnexa. However, many disorders of the eye are serious but asymptomatic; therefore, regular eye checkups are necessary. For diagnosis, treatment, and management of visual disorders, the medical services of a specialist may be warranted. Ophthalmology is the medical specialty concerned with disorders of the eye. The physician who treats these disorders is called an ophthalmologist. Optometrists work with ophthalmologists in a medical practice or practice independently. Optometrists are not medical doctors, but are doctors of optometry (OD). They diagnose vision problems and eye disease, prescribe eyeglasses and contact lenses, and prescribe drugs to treat eye disorders. Although they cannot perform surgery, they commonly provide preoperative and postoperative care.</p>
                        <p>Common signs and symptoms of ear disorders include hearing impairment, ringing in the ears, pain or drainage from the ears, loss of balance, dizziness, or nausea. Young children are especially vulnerable to middle ear infections that, if not treated, may cause hearing loss. For diagnosis, treatment, and management of hearing disorders, the medical services of a specialist may be warranted. Otolaryngology is the medical specialty concerned with disorders of the ear, nose, and throat. The physician who treats these disorders is called an otolaryngologist. Many otolaryngologists employ audiologists. Audiologists are allied health-care professionals who work with patients with hearing, balance, and related problems. They perform hearing examinations, evaluate hearing loss, clean and irrigate the ear canal, fit and dispense hearing aids or other assistive devices, and provide audiological rehabilitation, including auditory training and instruction in speech or lip reading.</p>

                        <h3 id="eye-disorders">Eye Disorders</h3>
                        <p>Eye disorders include not only visual deficiencies associated with refractive errors, but also disorders of associated structures, such as the eye muscles, nerves, and blood vessels. A complete examination of the eye and its adnexa is necessary to identify the source of any disorder. Most ocular examinations begin by recording visual acuity (VA) and visual field (VF).Then the eyelids, pupils, cornea, and lacrimal structures are examined and intraocular pressure is assessed as well. If infection is detected, it must be located and identified by culturing eye and nasal discharges and performing computed tomography (CT) of the sinuses. Occasionally, the patient may be referred for dental examination to determine if abscesses in the mouth are the source of infection. Family history is important because many eye disorders have a genetic predisposition, including glaucoma. Common eye disorders include errors of refraction, cataracts, glaucoma, strabismus, and macular degeneration.</p>

                        <h4 id="errors-of-refraction">Errors of Refraction</h4>
                        <p>An error of refraction (ametropia) exists when light rays fail to focus sharply on the retina. This may be due to a defect in the lens, cornea, or the shape of the eyeball. If the eyeball is too long, the image falls in front of the retina, causing nearsightedness. In farsightedness (hyperopia, hypermetropia), the opposite of myopia, the eyeball is too short and the image falls behind the retina. A form of farsightedness is presbyopia, a defect associated with the aging process. The onset of presbyopia usually occurs between ages 40 and 45.Distant objects are seen clearly, but near objects are not in proper focus. In another form of ametropia called astigmatism (Ast), the cornea or lens has a defective curvature. This curvature causes light rays to diffuse over a large area of the retina rather than being sharply focused.</p>
                        <p>Corrective lenses usually compensate for the various types of ametropia. An alternative to corrective lenses is laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) surgery. This procedure changes the shape of the cornea and, in most instances, the change is permanent. A small incision is made in the cornea to produce a flap. The flap is lifted to the side while a laser reshapes the underlying corneal tissue. At the completion of the procedure, the corneal flap is replaced. The procedure usually takes less than 15 minutes. However, not all people are candidates for this surgery. Some medical conditions, certain medications, or the shape and structure of the eye may preclude this procedure as a viable alternative to corrective lenses.</p>

                        <h4 id="cataracts">Cataracts</h4>
                        <p>Cataracts are opacities that form on the lens and impair vision. These opacities are commonly produced by protein that slowly builds up over time until vision is affected. The most common form of cataract is age related. More than one half of Americans older than age 65 have cataracts to a greater or lesser extent. Congenital cataracts found in children are usually a result of genetic defects or maternal rubella during the first trimester of pregnancy. This rare form of cataract is treated in the same manner as age-related cataract. The usual treatment is removal of the clouded lens by emulsifying it using ultrasound or a laser probe (phacoemulsification). This method is typically referred to as small incision cataract surgery (SICS)because the cataract is broken into very small particles that can be removed through the tiny incision. An artificial, bendable intraocular lens (IOL) is then inserted into the capsule. Once in position, the lens unfolds. The surgery is usually performed using a topical anesthetic, and the incision normally does not require stitches. This is one of the safest and most effective surgical procedures performed in medicine.</p>

                        <h4 id="glaucoma">Glaucoma</h4>
                        <p>Glaucoma is characterized by increased intraocular pressure (IOP) caused by the failure of aqueous humor to drain from the eye through a tiny duct called the canal of Schlemm. The increased pressure on the optic nerve destroys it, and vision is permanently lost.</p>
                        <p>Although there are various forms of glaucoma, all of them eventually lead to blindness unless the condition is detected and treated in its early stages. Glaucoma may occur as a primary or congenital disease or secondary to other causes, such as injury, infection, surgery, or prolonged topical corticosteroid use. Primary glaucoma can be chronic or acute. The chronic form is also called openangle, simple or wide-angle glaucoma. The acute form is called angle-closure or narrow angle glaucoma. Chronic glaucoma may produce no symptoms except gradual loss of peripheral vision over a period of years. Headaches, blurred vision, and dull pain in the eye may also be present. Cupping of the optic discs may be noted on ophthalmoscopic examination. Acute glaucoma is accompanied by extreme ocular pain, blurred vision, redness of the eye, and dilation of the pupil. Nausea and vomiting may also occur. If untreated, acute glaucoma causes complete and permanent blindness within 2 to 5 days.</p>
                        <p>Glaucoma is diagnosed by tonometry, a screening test that measures intraocular pressure by determining the resistance of the eyeball to indentation by an applied force. A slit lamp examination (SLE) with a high-intensity beam is used to assess the external surface and internal segments of the eye after administration of a local anesthetic. Devices such as a tonometer, which measures intraocular pressure, and a gonioscope, which visualizes the anterior chamber angle, expand the scope of the examination. Several methods of tonometry are available, but the one that is considered most accurate is applanation tonometry. Numbing drops are used and the test is pain free. Treatment for glaucoma includes medications that cause the pupils to constrict ( miotics), which permits aqueous humor to escape from the eye, thereby relieving pressure. If miotics are ineffective, surgery may be necessary.</p>

                        <h4 id="strabismus">Strabismus</h4>
                        <p>Strabismus, also called heterotropiaortropia, is a condition in which one eye is misaligned with the other and the eyes do not focus simultaneously when viewing an object. This misalignment may be in any direction-inward (esotropia),outward (exotropia),up, down, or a combination. The deviation may be a constant condition or may arise intermittently with stress, exhaustion, or illness. In normal vision, each eye views an image from a somewhat different vantage point, thus transmitting a slightly different image to the brain. The result is binocular perception of depth or three-dimensional space, a phenomenon known as stereopsis. Strabismus commonly causes a loss of stereopsis. In children, strabismus is commonly, but not always, associated with "lazy-eye syndrome" (amblyopia).Vision is suppressed in the "lazy" eye so that the child uses only the "good" eye for vision. The vision pathway fails to develop in the "lazy" eye.</p>
                        <p>There is a critical period during which amblyopia must be corrected, usually before age 6.If not detected and treated early in life, amblyopia can cause a permanent loss of vision in the affected eye, with associated loss of stereopsis. Treatment for strabismus depends on the cause. It commonly consists of covering the normal eye, forcing the child to use the deviated, or lazy, eye. Eye exercises and corrective lenses may be prescribed, or surgical correction may be necessary.</p>

                        <h4 id="macular-degeneration">Macular Degeneration</h4>
                        <p>Macular degeneration is a deterioration of the macula, the most sensitive portion of the retina. The macula is responsible for central, or "straight-ahead," vision required for reading, driving, detail work, and recognizing faces. Although deterioration of the macula is associated with toxic effects of some drugs, the most common type is age related macular degeneration (ARMD, AMD). ARMD is a leading cause of visual loss in the United States. The disease is unpredictable and progresses differently in each individual. So far, two forms of ARMD have been identified: wet and dry. The less common, but more severe, form is wet, or neovascular ARMD. It affects about 10% of those afflicted with the disease. Small blood vessels form under the macula. Blood and other fluids leak from these vessels and destroy the visual cells, leading to severe loss of central vision and permanent visual impairment. If identified in its early stages, laser surgery can be employed to destroy the newly forming vessels. This treatment is called laser photocoagulation. It is successful in about one half of the patients with wet ARMD. However, the effects of the procedure commonly do not last and new vessels begin to form. The more common form of the macular degeneration is dry ARMD. Small yellowish deposits called drusen develop on the macula and interfere with central vision. Drusen are dried retinal pigment epithelial cells that form granules on the macula. Although some vision is lost, this form of the disease rarely leads to total blindness. Patients with dry ARMD are encouraged to see their ophthalmologist frequently and perform a simple at-home test that identifies visual changes that may indicate the development of the more serious neovascular ARMD.</p>

                        <h3 id="ear-disorders">Ear Disorders</h3>
                        <p>Common signs and symptoms of ear disorders include hearing loss, earache, vertigo, and tinnitus. Hearing tests are important in diagnosing hearing loss as well as aiding in localizing the source and nature of the hearing deficiency. In addition, many infections of the nose and throat refer pain (synalgia) to the ear. Therefore, an examination of the nose and throat is usually essential in identifying the cause of ear pain. Common ear disorders include otitis media and otosclerosis.</p>

                        <h4 id="otitis-media">Otitis Media</h4>
                        <p>Otitis media (OM) is an inflammation of the middle ear. This infection may be caused by a virus or bacterium. However, the most common culprit is Streptococcus pneumoniae. Otitis media is found most commonly in infants and young children, especially in the presence of an upper respiratory infection (URI). Symptoms may include earache and draining of pus from the ear (otopyorrhea).In it's most severe form, otitis media may lead to infection of the mastoid process (mastoiditis) or inflammation of brain tissue near the middle ear (otoencephalitis). Recurrent episodes of otitis media may cause scarring of the tympanic membrane, leading to hearing loss. Treatment consists of bed rest, medications to relieve pain (analgesics), and antibiotics. Occasionally, an incision of the eardrum (myringotomy, tympanotomy) may be necessary to relieve pressure and promote drainage. The usual treatment for children with recurrent infection is the use of pressure-equalizing tubes (PE tubes) that are passed through the tympanic membrane. These tubes help drain fluid from the middle ear.</p>

                        <h4 id="otosclerosis">Otosclerosis</h4>
                        <p>Otosclerosis is a disorder characterized by an abnormal hardening (ankylosis) of bones of the middle ear that causes hearing loss. The ossicle most commonly affected is the stapes, the bone that attaches to the oval window of the cochlea. The formation of a spongy growth at the footplate of the stapes decreases its ability to move the oval window, resulting in hearing loss. Occasionally, the patient perceives a ringing sound (tinnitus) within the ear, along with dizziness and a progressive loss of hearing, especially of low tones. Development of otosclerosis is typically closely tied to genetic factors; if one or both parents have the disorder, the child is at high risk for developing the disease. Surgical correction involves removing part of the stapes (stapedectomy or, more commonly, stapedotomy) and implanting a prosthetic device that allows sound waves to pass to the inner ear. The procedure requires only a local anesthetic and usually lasts only 45 minutes. Hearing is immediately restored.</p>

                        <h3 id="oncology">Oncology</h3>
                        <p>Two major neoplastic diseases account for more than 90% of all primary intraocular diseases: retinoblastoma, found primarily in children, and melanoma, found primarily in adults. Most retinoblastomas tend to be familial. The cell involved is the retinal neuron. Vision is impaired and, in about 30% of patients, the disease is found in both eyes (bilateral).Melanoma may occur in the orbit; the bony cavity of the eyeball, the iris, or the ciliary body, but it arises most commonly in the pigmented cells of the choroid. The disease is usually asymptomatic until there is a hemorrhage into the anterior chamber. Any discrete, fleshy mass on the iris should be examined by an ophthalmologist. If malignancy occurs in the choroid, it usually appears as a brown or gray mushroom-shaped lesion.</p>
                        <p>Treatment for retinoblastoma usually involves the removal of the affected eye(s) (enucleation), followed by radiation. In melanoma where the lesion is on the iris, an iridectomy is performed. For melanoma of the choroid, enucleation is necessary. Many eye tumors are noninvasive and are not necessarily life threatening.</p>
                        <p>Both malignant and nonmalignant tumors can arise in the external ear, the canal, or the middle ear. Malignant tumors of the ear include basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell tumors. The most common ear malignancy is basal cell carcinoma, which usually occurs on the top of the pinna as the result of sun exposure. It is found more commonly in elderly patients or those with fair skin. Small, craterlike ulcers form as the disease progresses. Basal cell carcinoma does not readily metastasize; however, failure to treat it in a timely manner may result in the need for extensive surgery to remove the tumor. Squamous cell carcinoma, on the other hand, is much more invasive. However, it is a very rare type of ear tumor. In appearance, it closely resembles basal cell carcinoma, and biopsy is required to make a definitive diagnosis. Squamous cell carcinoma grows more slowly than basal cell carcinoma; however, because of its tendency to metastasize to the surrounding nodes and the nodes of the neck, it must be removed. Surgery combined with radiation therapy is the most effective treatment for squamous cell carcinoma.</p>

In the Rinne test, the base of a vibrating fork is placed against the mastoid bone (bone conduction) and in front of the auditory meatus (air conduction).If the sound is louder when the tuning fork is next to the ear, hearing in that ear is normal. If the sound is louder when the tuning fork touches the mastoid process, it is an indication of conductive hearing loss.</td></tr>
