                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Pathology associated with blood includes anemias, leukemias, and coagulation disorders. These groups of disorders typically share common signs and symptoms that generally include paleness, weakness, shortness of breath, and heart palpitations.</p>
                        <p>Lymphatic disorders are commonly associated with edema and lymphadenopathy. In these disorders, tissues are swollen with enlarged, tender nodes. Immunopathies include abnormally heightened immune responses to antigens (allergies, hypersensitivities, and autoimmune disorders) or abnormally depressed responses (immunodeficiencies and cancers).Many immunological disorders are manifested in other body systems. For example, asthma and hay fever are immunological disorders that affect the respiratory system; atopic dermatitis and eczema are immunological disorders that affect the integumentary system. Some of the most devastating diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, and AIDS, are caused by disordered immunity.</p>
                        <p>For diagnosis, treatment, and management of diseases that affect blood and blood-forming organs, the medical services of a specialist may be warranted. Hematology is the branch of medicine that studies blood cells, blood-clotting mechanisms, bone marrow, and lymph nodes. The physician who specializes in this branch of medicine is called a hematologist.</p>
                        <p>Allergy and immunology is the branch of medicine involving disorders of the immune system, including asthma and anaphylaxis, adverse reactions to drugs, autoimmune diseases, organ transplantations, and malignancies of the immune system. The physician who specializes in this combined branch of medicine is called an allergist and immunologist.</p>
                        
                        <h3 id="anemias">Anemias</h3>
                        <p>Anemia is any condition in which the oxygen carrying capacity of blood is deficient. It is not a disease but rather a symptom of various diseases. It results when there is a decrease in the number of circulating RBCs (erythropenia), the amount of hemoglobin (hypochromasia) within them, or in the volume of packed erythrocytes (hematocrit). Some of the causes of anemias include excessive blood loss, excessive blood-cell destruction, decreased blood formation, and faulty hemoglobin production. Anemia commonly causes changes in the appearance of RBCs when observed microscopically. In healthy individuals, RBCs fall within a normal range for size (normocytic) and amount of hemoglobin (normochromic). Variations in these normal values include RBCs that are excessively large (macrocytic), are excessively small (microcytic), or have decreased amounts of hemoglobin (hypochromic).Signs and symptoms associated with most anemias include difficulty breathing (dyspnea), weakness, rapid heartbeat (tachycardia), paleness (pallor), low blood pressure (hypotension) and ,commonly, a slight fever.</p>

                        <h3 id="aids">Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS)</h3>
                        <p>Acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) is an infectious disease caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which slowly destroys the immune system. The immune system becomes so weak (immunocompromised) that, in the final stage of the disease, the patient falls victim to infections that usually do not affect healthy individuals (opportunistic infections).</p>
                        <p>Symptoms of AIDS begin to appear gradually, and include swollen lymph glands (lymphadenopathy), malaise, fever, night sweats, and weight loss. Kaposi sarcoma, a neoplastic disorder, and Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) are two diseases closely associated with AIDS.</p>
                        <p>Transmission of HIV occurs primarily through body fluids- mostly blood, semen, and vaginal secretions. The virus attacks the most important cell in the immune system, the helper T cell. Once infected by HIV, the helper T cell becomes a "mini-factory" for the replication of the virus. More importantly, the virus destroys the helper T cell, which impacts the effective functioning of the humoral and cellular arms of the immune system, ultimately causing the patient's death.</p>
                        <p>Although there is no cure for HIV, treatments are available that can slow the development of the virus and the progression of the disease. These medications have serious adverse effects; however, once the decision for medical management is made, the patient should continue treatment. Failure to do so causes the virus to become highly resistant to current treatment options.</p>

                        <h3 id="allergy">Allergy</h3>
                        <p>An allergy is an acquired abnormal immune response. It requires initial exposure (sensitization) to an allergen (antigen). Subsequent exposures to the allergen produce increasing allergic reactions that cause a broad range of inflammatory changes.</p>
                        <p>Common signs and symptoms include hives (urticaria), eczema, allergic rhinitis, asthma and, in the extreme, anaphylactic shock, a life-threatening condition. The offending allergens are identified by allergy sensitivity tests. In one such test, small scratches are made on the patient's back and a liquid suspension of the allergen is introduced into the scratch. If antibodies to the allergen are present in the patient, the scratch becomes red, swollen, and hardened (indurated). A treatment called desensitization reduces the sensitivity of the patient to the offending allergen. This treatment involves repeated injections of highly diluted solutions containing the allergen. The initial concentration of the solution is too weak to cause symptoms. Additional exposure to higher concentrations promotes tolerance of the allergen.</p>

                        <h3 id="autoimmune">Autoimmune Disease</h3>
                        <p>Autoimmunity is the failure of the body to distinguish accurately between "self" and "nonself." In this abnormal response, the immune system attacks the antigens found on its own cells to such an extent that tissue injury results.</p>
                        <p>Types of autoimmune disorders range from those that affect only a single organ to those that affect many organs and tissues (multisystemic). Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disorder that affects the neuromuscular junction. Muscles of the limbs and eyes and those affecting speech and swallowing are usually involved. Other autoimmune diseases include rheumatoid arthritis (RA), idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), vasculitis, and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).</p>
                        <p>Treatment consists of attempting to reach a balance between suppressing the immune response to avoid tissue damage, while still maintaining the immune mechanism sufficiently to protect against disease. Most autoimmune diseases have periods of flare-up (exacerbations) and latency (remissions). Autoimmune diseases are usually chronic, requiring lifelong care and monitoring, even when the person may look or feel well. Currently, few autoimmune diseases can be cured; however, with treatment, those afflicted can live relatively normal lives.</p>

                        <h3 id="edema">Edema</h3>
                        <p>Edema is an abnormal accumulation of fluids in the intercellular spaces of the body. A major cause of edema is a decrease in the blood protein level (hypoproteinemia), especially albumin, which controls the amount of plasma leaving the vascular channels. Other causes of edema include poor lymph drainage, high sodium intake, increased capillary permeability, and heart failure. Edema limited to a specific area (localized) may be relieved by elevation of that body part and application of cold packs. Systemic edema may be treated with medications that promote urination (diuretics). Closely associated with edema is a condition called ascites, in which fluid collects within the peritoneal or pleural cavity. The chief causes of ascites are interference in venous return in cardiac disease, obstruction of lymphatic flow, disturbances in electrolyte balance, and liver disease.</p>

                        <h3 id="hemophilia">Hemophilia</h3>
                        <p>Hemophilia is a hereditary disorder in which the blood-clotting mechanism is impaired. There are two main types of hemophilia: hemophilia A, a deficiency in clotting factor VIII, and hemophilia B, a deficiency in clotting factor IX. The degree of deficiency varies from mild to severe. The disease is sex-linked and found most commonly in men. Women are carriers of the trait but generally do not have symptoms of the disease. Mild symptoms include nosebleeds, easy bruising, and bleeding from the gums. Severe symptoms produce areas of blood seepage (hematomas) deep within muscles. If blood enters joints (hemarthrosis), it is associated with pain and, possibly, permanent deformity. Uncontrolled bleeding in the body may lead to shock and death. Treatment consists of intravenous administration of the deficient factor. The amount of factor replaced depends on the seriousness of the hemorrhage and the amount of blood lost. Infectious Mononucleosis Infectious mononucleosis is one of the acute infections caused by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV).It is usually found in young adults and tends to appear in early spring and fall. Saliva and respiratory secretions have been implicated as significant infectious agents, hence the name "kissing disease." Sore throat, fever, and enlarged cervical lymph nodes characterize this disease. Other signs and symptoms include gum infection (gingivitis), headache, tiredness, loss of appetite (anorexia), and general malaise. In most cases, the disease resolves spontaneously and without complications. In some cases, however, the liver and spleen enlarge (hepatomegaly/ splenomegaly). Less common clinical findings include hemolytic anemia with jaundice and thrombocytopenia. Recovery usually ensures a lasting immunity.</p>

                        <h3 id="oncology">Oncology</h3>
                        <p>Oncological disorders associated with the blood, lymph, and immune systems include leukemia, Hodgkin disease, and Kaposi sarcoma.</p>

                        <h3 id="leukemia">Leukemia</h3>
                        <p>Leukemia is an oncological disorder of the blood forming organs, characterized by an overgrowth (proliferation) of blood cells. With this condition, malignant cells replace healthy bone marrow cells. The disease is generally categorized by the type of leukocyte population affected: granulocytic (myelogenous) or lymphocytic.</p>
                        <p>The various types of leukemia may be further classified as chronic or acute. In the acute form, the cells are highly embryonic (blastic) with few mature forms, resulting in severe anemia, infections, and bleeding disorders. This form of leukemia is life threatening. Although there is a proliferation of blastic cells in chronic forms of leukemia, there are usually enough mature cells to carry on the functions of the various cell types.</p>
                        <p>Although the causes of leukemia are unknown, viruses, environmental conditions, high-dose radiation, and genetic factors have been implicated. Bone marrow aspiration and bone marrow biopsy are used to diagnose leukemia. Treatment includes chemotherapy, radiation, biological therapy, bone marrow transplant, or a combination of these modalities. Left untreated, leukemias are fatal.</p>

                        <h3 id="hodgkin-disease">Hodgkin Disease</h3>
                        <p>Hodgkin disease, also called Hodgkin lymphoma, is a malignant disease of the lymph system, primarily the lymph nodes. Although malignancy usually remains only in neighboring nodes, it may spread to the spleen, GI tract, liver, or bone marrow. Hodgkin disease usually begins with a painless enlargement of lymph nodes, typically on one side of the neck, chest, or underarm. Other symptoms include severe itching (pruritus), weight loss, progressive anemia, and fever. If nodes in the neck become excessively large, they may press on the trachea, causing difficulty in breathing (dyspnea), or on the esophagus, causing difficulty in swallowing (dysphagia). Radiation and chemotherapy are important methods of controlling the disease. Newer methods of treatment include bone marrow transplants. Treatment is highly effective.</p>

                        <h3 id="kaposi-sarcoma">Kaposi Sarcoma</h3>
                        <p>Kaposi sarcoma is a malignancy of connective tissue, including bone, fat, muscle, and fibrous tissue. It is closely associated with AIDS and is commonly fatal because the tumors readily metastasize to other organs. Its close association with HIV has resulted in this disorder being classified as one of several "AIDS-defining conditions." The lesions emerge as purplish brown macules and develop into plaques and nodules. The lesions initially appear over the lower extremities and tend to spread symmetrically over the upper body, particularly the face and oral mucosa. Treatment for AIDS-related Kaposi sarcoma is usually palliative, relieving the pain and discomfort that accompany the lesions, but there is little evidence that it prolongs life.</p>

                        <p>In addition, chemotherapy and radiation are commonly used to treat diseases of the blood and immune system. For example, antineoplastics prevent cellular replication to halt the spread of cancer in the body; antivirals prevent viral replication within cells and have been effective in slowing the progression of HIV and AIDS.</p>
