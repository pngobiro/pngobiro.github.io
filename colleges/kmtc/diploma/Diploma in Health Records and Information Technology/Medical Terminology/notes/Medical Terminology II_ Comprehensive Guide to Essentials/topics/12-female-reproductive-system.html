                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Many female reproductive disorders are caused by infection, injury, or hormonal dysfunction. Although some disorders may be mild and correct themselves over time, others, such as those caused by infection, may require medical attention. Pain, itching, lesions, and discharge are signs and symptoms commonly associated with sexually transmitted diseases and must not be ignored. Other common problems of the female reproductive system are related to hormonal dysfunction that may cause menstrual disorders.</p>
                        <p>As a preventive measure, a pelvic examination should be performed regularly throughout life. This diagnostic procedure helps identify many pelvic abnormalities and diseases. Cytological and bacteriological specimens are usually obtained at the time of examination.</p>
                        <p>Gynecology is the branch of medicine concerned with diseases of the female reproductive organs and the breast. Obstetrics is the branch of medicine that manages the health of a woman and her fetus during pregnancy, childbirth, and the puerperium. Because of the obvious overlap between gynecology and obstetrics, many practices include both specialties. The physician who simultaneously practices these specialties is called an obstetrician/gynecologist</p>

                        <h3 id="menstrual-disorders">Menstrual Disorders</h3>
                        <p>Menstrual disorders are usually caused by hormonal dysfunction or pathological conditions of the uterus and may produce a variety of symptoms. Here are common disorders:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li><strong>Menstrual pain and tension (dysmenorrhea)</strong> may be the result of uterine contractions, pathological growths, or such chronic disorders as anemia, fatigue, diabetes, and tuberculosis. The female hormone estrogen is used to treat dysmenorrhea and also to regulate menstrual abnormalities.</li>
                            <li><strong>Irregular uterine bleeding</strong> between menstrual periods (metrorrhagia) or after menopause is usually symptomatic of disease, including benign or malignant uterine tumors. Consequently, early diagnosis and treatment are warranted. Metrorrhagia is probably the most significant form of menstrual disorder.</li>
                            <li><strong>Profuse or prolonged bleeding</strong> during regular menstruation (menorrhagia or hypermenorrhea) may, during early life, be caused by endocrine disturbances. However, in later life, it is usually due to inflammatory diseases, fibroids, tumors, or emotional disturbances.</li>
                            <li><strong>Premenstrual syndrome (PMS)</strong> is a disorder with signs and symptoms that range from complaints of headache and fatigue to mood changes, anxiety, depression, uncontrolled crying spells, and water retention. Signs and symptoms involving almost every organ have been attributed to PMS. This syndrome occurs several days before the onset of menstruation and ends when menses begins or a short time after and appears to be related to hormonal changes. The reason most individuals with PMS seek medical assistance is related to mood change. Simple changes in behavior, such as an increase in exercise and a reduction in caffeine, salt, and alcohol use, may be beneficial.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 id="endometriosis">Endometriosis</h3>
                        <p>Endometriosis is the presence of functional endometrial tissue in areas outside the uterus. The endometrial tissue develops into what are called implants, lesions, or growths and can cause pain, infertility, and other problems. The ectopic tissue is usually confined to the pelvic area but may appear anywhere in the abdominopelvic cavity. Like normal endometrial tissue, the ectopic endometrium responds to hormonal fluctuations of the menstrual cycle.</p>

                        <h3 id="pelvic-infections">Pelvic and Vaginal Infections</h3>
                        <p>Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is a general term for inflammation of the uterus, fallopian tubes, ovaries, and adjacent pelvic structures and is usually caused by bacterial infection. The infection may be confined to a single organ or it may involve all the internal reproductive organs. The disease producing organisms (pathogens) generally enter through the vagina during coitus, induced abortion, childbirth, or the postpartum period. As an ascending infection, the pathogens spread from the vagina and cervix to the upper structures of the female reproductive tract. Two of the most common causes of PID are gonorrhea and chlamydial infection, which are sexually transmitted diseases (STDs).Unless treated promptly, PID may result in scarring of the narrow fallopian tubes and the ovaries, causing sterility. The widespread infection of the reproductive structures can also lead to fatal septicemia. Because regions of the uterine tubes have an internal diameter slightly larger than the width of a human hair, the scarring and closure of the tubes is one of the major causes of female infertility.</p>
                        
                        <h3 id="vaginitis">Vaginitis</h3>
                        <p>The vagina is generally resistant to infection because of the acidity of vaginal secretions. Occasionally, however, localized infections and inflammations occur from viruses, bacteria, or yeast. If confined to the vagina, these infections are called vaginitis. Although symptoms may be numerous and varied, the most common symptoms are genital itching, painful intercourse, and foul-smelling vaginal discharge. It is not uncommon for vaginitis to be accompanied by urethral inflammation (urethritis) because of the proximity of the urethra to the vagina. Two of the most common types of vaginitis are candidiasis and trichomoniasis.</p>
                        <p>Candidiasis, also called moniliasis, is caused by Candida albicans, a yeast that is present as part of the normal flora of the vagina. Steroid therapy, diabetes, or pregnancy may cause a change in the vaginal environment that disrupts the normal flora and promotes the overgrowth of this organism, resulting in a yeast (fungal) infection. The use of antibiotics may also disrupt the normal balance of microorganisms in the vagina by destroying "friendly bacteria," thus allowing the overpopulation of yeast. Antifungal agents (mycostatics) that suppress the growth of fungi are used to treat this disease.</p>
                        <p>Trichomoniasis, caused by the protozoan Trichomonas vaginalis, is now known to be one of the most common causes of sexually transmitted lower genital tract infections. Trichomoniasis is discussed more fully in the sexually transmitted disease section below.</p>

                        <h3 id="stds">Sexually Transmitted Disease</h3>
                        <p>Sexually transmitted disease (STD), also called venereal disease, is any of several contagious diseases acquired as a result of sexual activity with an infected partner. As many as 20 different STDs have been identified, of which the newest and most serious is acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS).</p>
                        <p>In the United States, the widespread occurrence of STDs is regarded as an epidemic. As a group, STDs are the single most important cause of reproductive disorders. Until recently, gonorrhea and syphilis were the most common STDs. However, over the past few decades, chlamydia has become the most widespread STD. Viral diseases, such as genital herpes and genital warts, are also increasing in prevalence. The current STDs of medical concern include gonorrhea, syphilis, chlamydia, genital herpes, genital warts, and trichomoniasis.</p>

                        <h4 id="gonorrhea">Gonorrhea</h4>
                        <p>Gonorrhea is caused by the bacterium Neisseria gonorrhoeae. It involves the mucosal surface of the genitourinary tract and, possibly, the rectum and pharynx. This disease may be acquired through sexual intercourse and through orogenital and anogenital contact. Some women do not experience pain or manifest overt clinical symptoms (asymptomatic) until the disease has spread to the ovaries (oophoritis) and fallopian tubes (salpingitis), causing PID. The most common symptom of gonorrhea in women is a greenish yellow cervical discharge. The organism may infect the eyes of the newborn during vaginal delivery, which may result in blindness. As a precaution, silver nitrate is instilled in the eyes of newborns immediately after delivery as a preventive measure to ensure that this infection does not occur. The most common sign of gonorrhea in males is a discharge of pus from the penis. Other signs and symptoms include inflammation of the urethra (urethritis), which may cause painful urination (dysuria). If left untreated, the disease may infect the bladder (cystitis) and inflame the joints (arthritis).In addition; sterility may result from formation of scars that close the reproductive tubes of both sexes. Both sex partners must be treated because the infection can recur.</p>

                        <h4 id="syphilis">Syphilis</h4>
                        <p>Although less common than gonorrhea, syphilis is the more serious of the two diseases. It is caused by infection with the bacterium Treponema pallidum. If left untreated, syphilis may become a chronic, infectious, multisystemic disease.</p>
                        <p>Syphilis is characterized by three distinct phases. In the first phase, a primary sore (chancre) develops at the point where the organism enters the body. The chancre is an ulcerated sore with hard edges that contains contagious organisms. The second phase produces a variety of symptoms that make diagnosis of the disease difficult. The third phase is the latent phase whereby the disease may remain dormant for years.</p>
                        <p>Although there may be no symptoms of the disease during this time, the patient is nevertheless infectious. Symptoms may include blindness, insanity, and eventual death. Treatment with antibiotic therapy is effective.</p>

                        <h4 id="chlamydia">Chlamydia</h4>
                        <p>Chlamydia, caused by infection with the bacterium Chlamydia trachomatis, is the most prevalent and one of the most damaging STDs in the United States. In women, chlamydial infections are associated with mucopurulent discharge and inflammation of the cervix uteri (cervicitis) that may lead to PID. Chlamydia can be transmitted to the newborn baby during the birth process and cause a form of conjunctivitis or pneumonia. In men, chlamydial infections are associated with a whitish discharge from the penis that may lead to urethritis or epididymitis. Chlamydia in men, women, and babies can be successfully treated with antibiotics. However, many cases are asymptomatic, especially in women, and the disease commonly remains untreated until irreversible damage to the reproductive structures has occurred.</p>

                        <h4 id="genital-herpes">Genital Herpes</h4>
                        <p>Genital herpes causes red, blister like, painful lesions that closely resemble the common fever blister or cold sore that appears on the lips and around the mouth. Although both diseases are caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV), genital herpes is associated with type 2 (HSV-2), and oral herpes is associated with type 1 (HSV-1). Regardless, both forms can cause oral and genital infections through oral-genital sexual activity. Fluid in the blisters is highly infectious and contains the active virus. However, this disease is associated with a phenomenon called viral shedding. During viral shedding, the virus is present on the skin of the infected patient, and can be transmitted to sexual partners, even when no lesions are present. Individuals with herpes infection may have only one episode or may have repeated attacks that usually lessen in severity over the years. The disease may be transmitted to a baby during the birth process and, although rare, may lead to death of the infant. In females, lesions appear in the vaginal area, buttocks, and thighs. In men, lesions appear on the glans, foreskin, or penile shaft.</p>

                        <h4 id="genital-warts">Genital Warts</h4>
                        <p>Genital warts (condylomas) are caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV). Of the 100 identified types of HPV, only about 30 are spread through sexual contact. The warts may be very small and almost unnoticeable or may be large and appear in clusters. In females, the lesions may be found on the vulva, in the vagina, or on the cervix. In males, the lesions commonly appear on the penis or around the rectum. Many warts disappear without treatment, but there is no way to determine which ones will resolve.</p>
                        <p>When treatment is required, surgical excision or freezing the wart is the usual method. HPV infection has been found to increase the risk of certain cancers, including penile, vaginal, cervical, and anal cancer. The virus is linked to 80% of all cases of invasive cervical cancer. Thus, women who have been diagnosed with HPY infection are urged to have Papanicolaou (Pap) tests every 6 months after diagnosis. There is also a much greater incidence of miscarriages in individuals with HPV disease.</p>

                        <h4 id="trichomoniasis">Trichomoniasis</h4>
                        <p>Trichomoniasis, caused by the protozoan Trichomonas vaginalis, affects males and females, but symptoms are more common in females. In women, it causes vaginitis, urethritis, and cystitis. Signs and symptoms include a frothy, yellow-green vaginal discharge with a strong odor. The infection may also cause discomfort during intercourse and urination. Irritation and itching in the female genital area and, in rare cases, lower abdominal pain can also occur. When symptoms are present in males, they include irritation inside the penis, mild discharge, or slight burning after urination or ejaculation. Treatment is generally very effective but reinfection is common if sexual partners are not treated simultaneously.</p>

                        <h3 id="uterine-fibroids">Uterine Fibroids</h3>
                        <p>About 30% to 40% of all women develop benign tumors called fibroids (also called leiomyomas or, more commonly, myomas). These benign tumors develop slowly between ages 25 and 40 and commonly enlarge in response to fluctuating endocrine stimulation after this period. Although some individuals are asymptomatic with these types of tumors, when present they include menorrhagia, backache, constipation, and urinary symptoms. In addition, such tumors commonly cause metrorrhagia and even sterility.</p>
                        <p>Treatment of uterine fibroid tumors depends on their size and location. If the patient plans to have children, treatment is as conservative as possible. As a rule, large tumors that produce symptoms, such as pelvic pain and pressure accompanied by heavy menstrual periods (menorrhagia) or bleeding in between periods (metrorrhagia), should be removed. Usually, the uterus is removed (hysterectomy), but the ovaries are preserved. If the tumor is small, a myomectomy may be performed. However, when the tumor is producing excessive bleeding, the uterus and the tumor are excised.</p>

                        <h3 id="oncology">Oncology</h3>
                        <p>The two most common forms of cancer (CA) involving the female reproductive system are breast cancer and cervical cancer.</p>
                        <h4 id="breast-cancer">Breast Cancer</h4>
                        <p>Breast cancer, also called carcinoma of the breast, is the most common malignancy of women in the United States. This disease appears to be associated with ovarian hormonal function. In addition, a diet high in fats appears to increase the incidence of breast cancer. Other contributing factors include a family history of the disease and, possibly, the use of hormone replacement therapy (HRT). Women who have not borne children (nulliparous) or those who have had an early onset of menstruation (menarche) or late onset of menopause are also more likely to develop breast cancer. Because this type of malignancy is highly responsive to treatment when detected early, women are urged to practice breast self-examination monthly and to receive periodic mammograms after age 40.Many breast malignancies are detected by the patient.</p>

                        <h4 id="cervical-cancer">Cervical Cancer</h4>
                        <p>Cancer of the cervix most commonly affects women between ages 40 and 49 . Statistics indicate that infection associated with sexual activity has some relationship to the incidence of cervical cancer. First coitus at a young age, large number of sex partners, infection with certain sexually transmitted viruses, and frequent intercourse with men whose previous partners had cervical cancer are all associated with increased risk of developing cervical cancer. The Pap test, a cytological examination, can detect cervical cancer before the disease becomes clinically evident. Abnormal cervical cytology routinely calls for colposcopy, which can detect the presence and extent of preclinical lesions requiring biopsy and histological examination. Treatment of cervical cancer consists of surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. If left untreated, the cancer will eventually metastasize and lead to death.</p>

                        <p>Hormones perform a vital role in reproduction and sexual development of the female. Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is the use of synthetic or natural estrogens or a combination of estrogen and progestin to replace the decline or lack of natural hormones, a condition that accompanies hysterectomy and menopause. Such symptoms as vaginal dryness, hot flashes, and fatigue are commonly relieved or lessened using HRT. The medical profession is currently rethinking the use of hormone replacement in menopause because of an apparent increased risk of some disorders with extended use of the combination therapy. Use of estrogen alone for HRT is still in clinical trials but has not exhibited the strong contraindications of the combination form of HRT. Estrogen may be administered orally, transdermally, by injection, or as a topical cream (to treat vaginal symptoms only). Other hormones, including oxytocins and prostaglandins, are used for obstetrical applications. In addition, pharmacological agents are available for birth control and family planning. These include oral contraceptives, implants, morning-after pills (abortifacients), and spermicides.</p>
