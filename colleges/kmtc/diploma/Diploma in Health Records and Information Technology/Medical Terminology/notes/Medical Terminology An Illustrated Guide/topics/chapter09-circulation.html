                        <p>Blood circulates throughout the body in the <strong>cardiovascular system</strong>, which consists of the heart and the blood vessels (Fig. 9-1). This system forms a continuous circuit that delivers oxygen and nutrients to all cells and carries away waste products. Also functioning in circulation is the <strong>lymphatic system</strong>, which drains fluid and proteins from the tissues and returns them to the bloodstream.</p>

                        <h3>The Heart</h3>
                        <p>The <strong>heart</strong> is located between the lungs, with its point or <strong>apex</strong> directed toward the left (Fig. 9-2). The thick muscle layer of the heart wall is the <strong>myocardium</strong>. This is lined on the inside with a thin <strong>endocardium</strong> and is covered on the outside with a thin <strong>epicardium</strong>. The heart is contained within a fibrous sac, the <strong>pericardium</strong>.</p>
                        <p>Each of the upper receiving chambers of the heart is an <strong>atrium</strong> (plural, atria). Each of the lower pumping chambers is a <strong>ventricle</strong> (plural, ventricles). The chambers of the heart are divided by walls, each of which is called a <strong>septum</strong>. The interventricular septum separates the two ventricles; the interatrial septum divides the two atria. There is also a septum between the atrium and ventricle on each side.</p>
                        <p>The heart pumps blood through two circuits. The right side pumps blood to the lungs to be oxygenated through the <strong>pulmonary circuit</strong>. The left side pumps to the remainder of the body through the <strong>systemic circuit</strong>.</p>

                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/page-177-01.jpg" alt="The heart and great vessels, showing internal structures and blood flow." class="content-image">
                            <figcaption>FIGURE 9-2. The heart and great vessels.</figcaption>
                        </figure>

                        <h4>Blood Flow Through the Heart</h4>
                        <p>The pathway of blood through the heart is shown by the arrows in Figure 9-2. The right atrium receives blood low in oxygen from all body tissues through the <strong>superior vena cava</strong> and the <strong>inferior vena cava</strong>. The blood then enters the right ventricle and is pumped to the lungs through the <strong>pulmonary artery</strong>. Blood returns from the lungs high in oxygen and enters the left atrium through the <strong>pulmonary veins</strong>. From here it enters the left ventricle and is forcefully pumped into the <strong>aorta</strong> to be distributed to all parts of the body.</p>
                        <p>Blood is kept moving in a forward direction by one-way <strong>valves</strong>. The valve in the septum between the right atrium and ventricle is the <strong>tricuspid valve</strong> (meaning three cusps or flaps); the valve in the septum between the left atrium and ventricle is the <strong>bicuspid valve</strong> (having two cusps), usually called the <strong>mitral valve</strong> (so named because it resembles a bishop's miter). The valves leading into the pulmonary artery and the aorta have three cusps. Each cusp is shaped like a half-moon, so these valves are described as <em>semilunar valves</em>. The valve at the entrance to the pulmonary artery is specifically named the <strong>pulmonic valve</strong>; the valve at the entrance to the aorta is the <strong>aortic valve</strong>.</p>
                        <p><strong>Heart sounds</strong> are produced as the heart functions. The loudest of these, the familiar lubb and dupp that can be heard through the chest wall, are produced by alternate closing of the valves. The first heart sound (S<sub>1</sub>) is heard when the valves between the chambers close. The second heart sound (S<sub>2</sub>) is produced when the valves leading into the aorta and pulmonary artery close. Any sound made as the heart functions normally is termed a <strong>functional murmur</strong>. (The word <em>murmur</em> used alone with regard to the heart describes an abnormal sound.)</p>

                        <h4>The Heartbeat</h4>
                        <p>Each contraction of the heart, termed <strong>systole</strong> (<em>SIS-tō-lē</em>), is followed by a relaxation phase, <strong>diastole</strong> (<em>dī-AS-tō-lē</em>), during which the chambers fill. Each time the heart beats, both atria contract and immediately thereafter both ventricles contract. The wave of increased pressure produced in the vessels each time the ventricles contract is the <strong>pulse</strong>.</p>
                        <p>Contractions are stimulated by a built-in system that regularly transmits electrical impulses through the heart. The components of this conduction system are shown in Figure 9-3. They include the <strong>sinoatrial (SA) node</strong>, called the pacemaker because it sets the rate of the heartbeat, the <strong>atrioventricular (AV) node</strong>, the <strong>AV bundle</strong> (bundle of His), the left and right <strong>bundle branches</strong>, and <strong>Purkinje</strong> (<em>pur-KIN-jē</em>) <strong>fibers</strong>.</p>
                        <p>Although the heart itself generates the heartbeat, factors such as nervous system stimulation, hormones, and drugs can influence the rate and the force of heart contractions.</p>

                        <h3>Blood Pressure</h3>
                        <p><strong>Blood pressure</strong> is the force exerted by blood against the wall of a blood vessel. It is commonly measured in a large artery with an inflatable cuff (Fig. 9-4) known as a blood pressure cuff or blood pressure apparatus, but technically called a <strong>sphygmomanometer</strong>. Both systolic and diastolic pressures are measured and reported as systolic then diastolic separated by a slash, such as 120/80. Pressure is expressed as millimeters of mercury (mm Hg), that is, the height to which the pressure can push a column of mercury in a tube. Blood pressure is a valuable diagnostic measurement that is easily obtained.</p>

                            <h4 class="callout-title"><span class="callout-icon">ℹ️</span> Box 9-1 Name That Structure</h4>
                            <p>An eponym is a name that is based on the name of a person, usually the one who discovered a particular structure, disease, principle, or procedure. Everyday examples are graham cracker, Ferris wheel, and boycott. In the heart, the bundle of His and Purkinje fibers are part of that organ's conduction system. Korotkoff sounds are heard in the vessels when taking blood pressure. Cardiovascular disorders named for people include the tetralogy of Fallot, a combination of four congenital heart defects, Raynaud disease of small vessels, and the cardiac arrhythmia known as Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. In treatment, Doppler echocardiography is named for a physicist of the 19th century. The Holter monitor and the Swan-Ganz catheter give honor to their developers.</p>
                            <p>In other systems, the islets of Langerhans are clusters of cells in the pancreas that secrete insulin. The graafian follicle in the ovary surrounds the developing egg cell. The eustachian tube connects the middle ear to the throat.</p>
                            <p>Many diseases have eponymic names: Parkinson and Alzheimer, which affect the brain, Graves, a disorder of the thyroid, Addison and Cushing, involving the adrenal cortex, and Down syndrome, a hereditary disorder. The genus and species names of microorganisms often are based on the names of their discoverers, <em>Escherichia</em>, <em>Salmonella</em>, <em>Pasteurella</em>, and <em>Rickettsia</em> to name a few.</p>
                            <p>Many reagents, instruments, and procedures are named for their developers. The original name for a radiograph was <em>roentgenograph</em> (RENT-jen-ō-graf ), named for Wilhelm Röntgen, discoverer of x-rays. A curie is a measure of radiation, derived from the name of Marie Curie, a co-discoverer of radioactivity.</p>
                            <p>Although eponyms give honor to physicians and scientists of the past, they do not convey any information and may be more difficult to learn. There is a trend to replace these names with more descriptive ones; for example, auditory tube instead of eustachian tube, ovarian follicle for graafian follicle, pancreatic islets for islets of Langerhans, and trisomy 21 for Down syndrome.</p>

                        <h3>The Vascular System</h3>
                        <p>The vascular system consists of:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Arteries</strong> that carry blood away from the heart (Fig. 9-5). <strong>Arterioles</strong> are small arteries that lead into the capillaries.</li>
                            <li><strong>Capillaries</strong>, the smallest vessels, through which exchanges take place between the blood and the tissues.</li>
                            <li><strong>Veins</strong> that carry blood back to the heart (Fig. 9-6). The small veins that receive blood from the capillaries and drain into the veins are <strong>venules</strong>.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/page-181-01.jpg" alt="Principal systemic arteries." class="content-image">
                            <figcaption>FIGURE 9-5. Principal systemic arteries.</figcaption>
                        </figure>

                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/page-182-01.jpg" alt="Principal systemic veins." class="content-image">
                            <figcaption>FIGURE 9-6. Principal systemic veins.</figcaption>
                        </figure>

                        <p>All arteries, except the pulmonary artery (and the umbilical artery in the fetus), carry blood high in oxygen. They are thick-walled, elastic vessels that carry blood under high pressure. All veins, except the pulmonary vein (and the umbilical vein in the fetus), carry blood low in oxygen. Veins have thinner, less elastic walls and tend to give way under pressure. Like the heart, veins have one-way valves that keep blood flowing forward.</p>
                        <p>Nervous system stimulation can cause the diameter of a vessel to increase (vasodilation) or decrease (vasoconstriction). These changes alter blood flow to the tissues and affect blood pressure.</p>

                        <h3>The Lymphatic System</h3>
                        <p>The <strong>lymphatic system</strong> is a widely distributed system with multiple functions (Fig. 9-7). Its role in circulation is to return excess fluid and proteins from the tissues to the bloodstream. The fluid carried in the lymphatic system is called <strong>lymph</strong>. Lymph drains from the lower part of the body and the upper left side into the <strong>thoracic duct</strong>, which travels upward through the chest and empties into the left subclavian vein near the heart. The <strong>right lymphatic duct</strong> drains the upper right side of the body and empties into the right subclavian vein.</p>
                        <p>Another function of the lymphatic system is to absorb digested fats from the small intestine (see Chapter 12). These fats are then added to the blood near the heart.</p>
                        <p>One other major function of the lymphatic system is to protect the body from impurities and invading microorganisms. Along the path of the lymphatic vessels are small masses of lymphoid tissue, the <strong>lymph nodes</strong> (see Fig. 9-7). Their function is to filter the lymph as it passes through. They are concentrated in the cervical (neck), axillary (armpit), mediastinal (chest), and inguinal (groin) regions. The lymph nodes and the remainder of the lymphatic system also play a role in immunity (see Chapter 10). Other organs and tissues of the lymphatic system include the <strong>tonsils</strong>, located in the throat (described in Chapter 11), the <strong>thymus gland</strong> in the chest, and the <strong>spleen</strong> in the upper left region of the abdomen (see Fig. 12-1).</p>

                        <h3>Atherosclerosis</h3>
                        <p>The accumulation of fatty deposits within the lining of an artery is termed <strong>atherosclerosis</strong> (Fig. 9-8). This type of deposit, called a <strong>plaque</strong>, begins to form when a vessel receives tiny injuries, usually at a point of branching. Plaques gradually thicken and harden with fibrous material, cells, and other deposits, restricting the lumen (opening) of the vessel and reducing blood flow to the tissues, a condition known as <strong>ischemia</strong>. A major risk factor for the development of atherosclerosis is <strong>dyslipidemia</strong>, abnormally high levels or imbalance in lipoproteins that are carried in the blood, especially high levels of cholesterol-containing low-density lipoproteins (LDL). Other risk factors for atherosclerosis include smoking, high blood pressure, poor diet, inactivity, stress, and family history of the disorder. Atherosclerosis may involve any arteries, but most of its effects are seen in the coronary vessels of the heart, the aorta, the carotid arteries in the neck, and vessels in the brain.</p>

                            <img src="../assets/images/page-191-01.jpg" alt="Coronary atherosclerosis showing fat deposits, occlusion, and blood clot." class="content-image">

                        </figure>

                        <h3>Thrombosis and Embolism</h3>
                        <p>Atherosclerosis predisposes a person to <strong>thrombosis</strong>, the formation of a blood clot within a vessel. The clot, called a <strong>thrombus</strong>, interrupts blood flow to the tissues supplied by that vessel, resulting in necrosis (tissue death). Blockage of a vessel by a thrombus or other mass carried in the bloodstream is an <strong>embolism</strong>, and the mass itself is called an <strong>embolus</strong>. Usually the mass is a blood clot that breaks loose from the wall of a vessel, but it may also be air (as from injection or trauma), fat (as from marrow released after a bone break), bacteria, or other solid materials. Often a venous thrombus will travel through the heart and then lodge in an artery of the lungs, resulting in a life-threatening pulmonary embolism. An embolus from a carotid artery often blocks a cerebral vessel, causing a <strong>cerebrovascular accident</strong> (CVA), commonly called <strong>stroke</strong> (see Chapter 17).</p>

                        <h3>Aneurysm</h3>
                        <p>An arterial wall weakened by atherosclerosis, malformation, injury, or other causes may balloon out, forming an <strong>aneurysm</strong>. If an aneurysm ruptures, hemorrhage results. Rupture of a cerebral artery is another cause of stroke. The abdominal aorta and carotid arteries are also common sites of aneurysm. In a <strong>dissecting aneurysm</strong> (Fig. 9-9), blood hemorrhages into the thick middle layer of the artery wall, separating the muscle as it spreads and sometimes rupturing the vessel. The aorta is most commonly involved. It may be possible to repair a dissecting aneurysm surgically with a graft.</p>

                        <figure>

                        </figure>

                        <h3>Hypertension</h3>
                        <p>High blood pressure, or <strong>hypertension</strong> (HTN), is a contributing factor in all of the conditions described above. In simple terms, hypertension is defined as a systolic pressure greater than 140 mm Hg or a diastolic pressure greater than 90 mm Hg. Hypertension causes the left ventricle to enlarge (hypertrophy) as a result of increased work. Some cases of HTN are secondary to other disorders, such as kidney malfunction or endocrine disturbance, but most of the time the causes are unknown, a condition described as primary or essential hypertension.</p>
                        <p>Changes in diet and life habits are the first line of defense in controlling HTN. Drugs that are used include diuretics to eliminate fluids, vasodilators to relax the blood vessels, and drugs that prevent the formation or action of angiotensin, a substance in the blood that normally acts to increase blood pressure.</p>

                        <h3>Heart Disease</h3>
                        <h4>CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE</h4>
                        <p>Coronary artery disease (CAD), which results from atherosclerosis of the vessels that supply blood to the heart muscle, is a leading cause of death in industrialized countries (see Fig. 9-8). An early sign of CAD is the type of chest pain known as <strong>angina pectoris</strong>. This is a feeling of constriction around the heart or pain that may radiate to the left arm or shoulder, usually brought on by exertion. Often there is anxiety, <strong>diaphoresis</strong> (profuse sweating), and <strong>dyspnea</strong> (difficulty in breathing).</p>
                        <p>CAD is treated by control of exercise and administration of nitroglycerin to dilate coronary vessels. Other drugs may be used to regulate the heartbeat, strengthen the force of heart contraction, or prevent formation of blood clots. Patients with severe cases of CAD may be candidates for <strong>angioplasty</strong>, surgical dilatation of the blocked vessel by means of a catheter, technically called <strong>percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty</strong> (PTCA) (Fig. 9-10). If further intervention is required, the blocked vessel may be surgically bypassed with a vascular graft (Fig. 9-11). In this procedure, known as a <strong>coronary artery bypass graft</strong> (CABG), another vessel or a piece of another vessel, usually the saphenous vein of the leg or the left internal mammary artery, is used to carry blood from the aorta to a point past the obstruction in a coronary vessel.</p>
                        <p>CAD is diagnosed by <strong>electrocardiography</strong> (ECG), study of the electrical impulses given off by the heart as it functions, stress tests, <strong>coronary angiography</strong> (imaging), <strong>echocardiography</strong>, and other tests.</p>

                        <p>Degenerative changes in the arteries predispose a person to thrombosis and sudden <strong>occlusion</strong> (obstruction) of a coronary artery. The resultant area of myocardial necrosis is termed an <strong>infarct</strong> (Fig. 9-12), and the process is known as <strong>myocardial infarction</strong> (MI), the "heart attack" that may cause sudden death. Symptoms of MI include pain over the heart (precordial pain) or upper part of the abdomen (epigastric pain) that may extend to the jaw or arms, pallor (paleness), diaphoresis, nausea, and dyspnea. There may be a burning sensation similar to indigestion or heartburn.</p>

                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/page-194-02.jpg" alt="Myocardial infarction showing zones of necrosis, injury, and ischemia." class="content-image">

                        </figure>

                        <p>MI is diagnosed by electrocardiography, by measurement of certain enzymes (CK, LDH, AST) released into the blood from the damaged heart muscle and by a variety of other methods described later in this chapter. Patient outcome is based on the degree of damage and early treatment to dissolve the clot and re-establish normal heart rhythm.</p>

                        <h4>ARRHYTHMIA</h4>
                        <p><strong>Arrhythmia</strong> is any irregularity of heart rhythm, such as a higher- or lower-than-average heart rate, extra beats, or an alteration in the pattern of the beat. <strong>Bradycardia</strong> is a slower-than-average rate, and <strong>tachycardia</strong> is a higher-than-average rate. In cases of MI, there is often <strong>fibrillation</strong>, an extremely rapid, ineffective beating of the heart. MI may also result in <strong>heart block</strong>, an interruption in the electrical conduction system of the heart (Fig. 9-13). <strong>Cardioversion</strong> is the general term for restoration of a normal heart rhythm, either by drugs or application of electric current. Several devices are in use for electrical <strong>defibrillation</strong>. If, for any reason, the SA node is not generating a normal heartbeat, an <strong>artificial pacemaker</strong> (Fig. 9-14) may be implanted in the chest to regulate the beat.</p>

                        <h4>HEART FAILURE</h4>
                        <p>The general term <strong>heart failure</strong> refers to any condition in which the heart fails to empty effectively. The resulting increased pressure in the venous system leads to <strong>edema</strong>, often in the lungs (pulmonary edema), and justifies the description <strong>congestive heart failure</strong> (CHF). Other symptoms of congestive heart failure are <strong>cyanosis</strong>, dyspnea, and <strong>syncope</strong>. Heart failure is one cause of <strong>shock</strong>, a severe disturbance in the circulatory system resulting in inadequate delivery of blood to the tissues. Heart failure is treated with rest, drugs to strengthen heart contractions, diuretics to eliminate fluid, and restriction of salt in the diet.</p>

                        <h4>CONGENITAL HEART DISEASE</h4>
                        <p>A congenital defect is any defect that is present at birth. The most common type of congenital heart defect is a hole in the septum (wall) that separates the atria or the ventricles. The result of a septal defect is that blood is shunted from the left to the right side of the heart and goes back to the lungs instead of out to the body. The heart has to work harder to meet the body's need for oxygen. Symptoms of septal defect include cyanosis (leading to the description "blue baby"), syncope, and <strong>clubbing</strong> of the fingers. Most such congenital defects can be corrected surgically.</p>
                        <p>Another type of congenital defect is malformation of a heart valve. Failure of a valve to open or close properly is evidenced by a <strong>murmur</strong>, an abnormal sound heard as the heart cycles.</p>
                        <p>Still other congenital defects result from failure of fetal modifications to convert to their adult form at birth. In <strong>patent ductus arteriosus</strong> (Fig. 9-15), a vessel present in the fetus to bypass the lungs fails to close at birth. Blood can then flow from the aorta to the pulmonary artery and return to the lungs.</p>

                        </figure>

                        <h4>RHEUMATIC HEART DISEASE</h4>
                        <p>In <strong>rheumatic heart disease</strong>, infection with a specific type of streptococcus sets up an immune reaction that ultimately damages the heart valves. The infection usually begins as a "strep throat," and most often it is the mitral valve that is involved. Scar tissue fuses the leaflets of the valve, causing a narrowing or <strong>stenosis</strong> that interferes with proper function. People with rheumatic heart disease are subject to repeated infections of the valves and must take antibiotics prophylactically (preventively) before any type of surgery and before even minor invasive procedures such as dental cleaning. Severe cases of rheumatic heart disease may require surgical correction or even valve replacement. The incidence of rheumatic heart disease has declined with the use of antibiotics.</p>

                        <h3>Disorders of the Veins</h3>
                        <p>A breakdown in the valves of the veins in combination with a chronic dilatation of these vessels results in <strong>varicose veins</strong>. These appear twisted and swollen under the skin, most commonly in the legs. Contributing factors include heredity, obesity, prolonged standing, and pregnancy, which increases pressure in the pelvic veins. This condition can impede blood flow and lead to edema, thrombosis, hemorrhage, or ulceration. Treatment includes the wearing of elastic stockings and, in some cases, surgical removal of the varicosities, after which collateral circulation is established. A varicose vein in the rectum or anal canal is referred to as a <strong>hemorrhoid</strong>.</p>
                        <p><strong>Phlebitis</strong> is any inflammation of the veins and may be caused by infection, injury, poor circulation, or damage to valves in the veins. Such inflammation typically initiates formation of a blood clot, resulting in <strong>thrombophlebitis</strong>. Any veins are subject to thrombophlebitis, but the more serious condition involves the deep veins as opposed to the superficial veins, in the condition termed <strong>deep vein thrombosis</strong> (DVT). The most common sites for DVT are the deep veins of the legs, causing serious reduction in venous drainage from these areas.</p>

                        <h3>Lymphatic Disorders</h3>
                        <p>Changes in the lymphatic system often are related to infection and may consist of inflammation and enlargement of the nodes, called <strong>lymphadenitis</strong>, or inflammation of the vessels, called <strong>lymphangiitis</strong>. Obstruction of lymphatic vessels because of surgical excision or infection results in tissue swelling, or <strong>lymphedema</strong>. Any neoplastic disease involving lymph nodes is termed <strong>lymphoma</strong>. These neoplastic disorders affect the white cells found in the lymphatic system, and they are discussed more fully in Chapter 10.</p>

                        <h3>Case Study 9-1: PTCA and Echocardiogram</h3>
                        <p>A.L., a 68-year-old woman, was admitted to the CCU with chest pain, dyspnea, diaphoresis, syncope, and nausea. She had taken three sublingual doses of nitroglycerine tablets within a 10-minute time span without relief before dialing 911. A previous stress test and thallium uptake scan suggested cardiac disease.</p>
                        <p>Her family history was significant for cardiovascular disease. Her father died at the age of 62 of an acute myocardial infarction. Her mother had bilateral carotid endarterectomies and a femoral-popliteal bypass procedure and died at the age of 72 of congestive heart failure. A.L.'s older sister died from a ruptured aortic aneurysm at the age of 65. Her ECG on admission presented tachycardia with a rate of 126 bpm with inverted T waves. A murmur was heard at S<sub>1</sub>. Her skin color was dusky to cyanotic on her lips and fingertips. Her admitting diagnosis was possible coronary artery disease, acute myocardial infarction, and valvular disease.</p>
                        <p>Cardiac catheterization with balloon angioplasty (PTCA) was performed the next day. Significant stenosis of the left anterior descending coronary artery was shown and was treated with angioplasty and stent placement. Left ventricular function was normal.</p>
                        <p>Echocardiogram, 2 days later, showed normal-sized left and enlarged right ventricular cavities. The mitral valve had normal amplitude of motion. The anterior and posterior leaflets moved in opposite directions during diastole. There was a late systolic prolapse of the mitral leaflet at rest. The left atrium was enlarged. The impression of the study was mitral prolapse with regurgitation. Surgery was recommended.</p>

                        <h3>Case Study 9-2: Mitral Valve Replacement Operative Report</h3>
                        <p>A.L. was transferred to the operating room, placed in a supine position, and given general endotracheal anesthesia. Her pericardium was entered longitudinally through a median sternotomy. The surgeon found that her heart was enlarged with a dilated right ventricle. The left atrium was dilated. Preoperative transesophageal echocardiogram revealed severe mitral regurgitation with severe posterior and anterior prolapse. Extracorporeal circulation was established. The aorta was cross-clamped, and cardioplegic solution (to stop the heartbeat) was given into the aortic root intermittently for myocardial protection.</p>
                        <p>The left atrium was entered via the interatrial groove on the right, exposing the mitral valve. The middle scallop of the posterior leaflet was resected. The remaining leaflets were removed to the areas of the commissures and preserved for the sliding plasty. The elongated chordae were shortened. The surgeon slid the posterior leaflet across the midline and sutured it in place. A no. 30 annuloplasty ring was sutured in place with interrupted no. 2-0 Dacron suture. The valve was tested by inflating the ventricle with NSS and proved to be competent. The left atrium was closed with continuous no. 4-0 Prolene suture. Air was removed from the heart. The cross-clamp was removed. Cardiac action resumed with normal sinus rhythm. After a period of cardiac recovery and attainment of normothermia, cardiopulmonary bypass was discontinued.</p>
                        <p>Protamine was given to counteract the heparin. Pacer wires were placed in the right atrium and ventricle. Silicone catheters were placed in the pleural and substernal spaces. The sternum and soft tissue wound was closed. A.L. recovered from her surgery and was discharged 6 days later.</p>
