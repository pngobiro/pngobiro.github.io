                            <li>Indicators are statistical values which give insight into the quality of health services or health status.</li>
                            <li>A Measurable marker of a change over time</li>
                            <li>A Unit of Information Measured overtime that documents change in a specific condition.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Obviously indicators are intimately related to activities. Each issue or problem is measured in terms of indicators which define the magnitude of the problem.</p>
                        <p>Developing indicators is the 1<sup>st</sup> step in performing a meaningful analysis of Health Information. The most useful method in developing indicators for health information is a review of the objective of the various programs of health services. If program objectives are clearly stated, developing indicators become a relatively simple task.</p>

                        <p>The analysis of data collected in the health information system is simple and straightforward. Not having acalculator is an invalid excuse for lack of analysis as analysis can be done without one. The most important dataanalysis is to estimate coverage for the services offered e.g. what proportion of children less than 1 year completeimmunization schedule before their first birth day? Or what percentage of women delivers without attendingantenatal clinics?</p>
                        <p><code>Percentage coverage = (number of cases in clinic × 100) / Total number of cases in catchment population</code></p>
                        <p>It is vital in data analysis to identify appropriate denominators and numerators. Population data are available fromthe past census and population projections. Having estimated the catchment population, the next step is to estimate the target population for various serviceswhich is the denominator of the coverage fraction. E.g. catchment population = 25,000.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>a) Antenatal care</strong></p>
                        <p>Target population 4.5Percentage of 25,000 = 4.5 / 100 * 25,000 = 1,125<br>
                        If number of new visits are 976 therefore coverage = 976 / 1125 * 100 = <strong>86.76 Percentage</strong><br>
                        If number of re-visits are 2,090 the mean number of visits per new attendant for antenatal care is new visits + revisits divide by new visits.<br>
                        = (976 + 2090) / 976 = 3.1 visits Per new antenatal attendant.</p>

                        <p><strong>b) Morbidity data</strong></p>
                        <p>Morbidity data are collected in both outpatient and in-patient by age, and diagnosis. Considering new cases gives a picture of the morbidity pattern at the health facility for example;</p>

                        <p><strong>Data Quality</strong> - the degree of excellence exhibited by the data in relation to the portrayal of the actual scenario. -The state of completeness, validity, consistency, timeliness, and accuracy that makes data appropriate for a specific use.</p>
                        <p><strong>Data Quality Assessment (DQA)</strong>- a process of verifying the quality of data, assessing the system that produces that data, and developing actions to improve both the process and the system</p>
                        <p><strong>Routine Data Quality Assessment (RDQA)</strong> - A continuous/regular process of verifying the quality of data, assessing the system that produces that data and developing action plans for improvement</p>
                        <p><strong>Quality Assurance (QA)</strong> - A process that focuses mainly on measuring compliance with established standards</p>
                        <p><strong>Quality Improvement (QI)</strong> - A systematic process to improve the quality of health care by monitoring quality, finding out what is not working, and fixing the problems of health care delivery</p>

                        <h3>Dimensions/attributes of Data Quality</h3>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li><strong>Accuracy</strong> - data that measure what they are intended to measure . its also known as validity</li>
                            <li><strong>Reliability</strong> - data that are generated based on protocols and procedures that do not change according to who is using them and when or how they are used</li>

                        <h3>Threats to data quality</h3>
                        <p>Impediments to good data quality. Three sources that threaten data quality</p>
                        <ol type="I">
                            <li>Inappropriate data collection instruments</li>
                            <li>Poor recording and reporting</li>
                            <li>Errors in processing data</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h4>Inappropriate data collection instruments and procedures.</h4>
                        <p>One important requirement of a well planned and executed information system is the development of a set of concepts to be covered and adherence of all stages of data collection and processing operations.</p>
                        <p>These concepts provide the basis for development of questions, wordings, instruments for data collectors and specifications, for editing, coding and tabulating data.</p>
                        <p>Imprecise definition of terms, lack of standardization, inaccurate translations of materials adopted from other context, leaving inadequate space for writing responses on data collection forms are some of the ways that can bring about errors.</p>
                        <p>Sometimes a well designed instrument might be used in an inappropriate setting for example, a sentinel surveillance system designed to classify the mechanism of HIV transmission in Sub Saharan Africa cannot be replicated in Western Asia without significant modifications of the data instrument.</p>
                        <p>The poor layout and quality of printed forms often contribute to low quality data in developing countries where resources are scarce. Forms are sometimes illegible due to quality of the original form and repeated photocopying.</p>

                        <h4>Threats to data quality from Poor recording and reporting</h4>
                        <p><strong>(a) Failure to report data</strong></p>
                        <p>Despite procedures for timely transmission of data between different levels of a health care system, sometimes data transmission does not occur.</p>
                        <p>Given the high cost of stationery (forms, operational cards, registers etc) and the inefficient supply system in many developing countries, the reporting health facility may lack access to necessary supplies or data transmission may be hampered by the frequent absence of personnel in charge of the information system or even if the personnel are available the high opportunity cost of time spent recording data on multiple forms coupled with lack of incentives for reporting may hamper regular reporting.</p>
                        <p>Another problem may be lack of transportation and other means of communication (Electronic Data transfer).</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>(b) Unintentional recording and reporting of inaccurate data</strong></p>
                        <p>Errors are sometimes introduced into the data for innocent reasons. Staffs may not have appropriate skills or supporting equipment to effectively carry out their data reporting responsibilities for example it is not uncommon in developing countries for the same reporting forms to be used at different levels of the health care system.</p>
                        <p>With computerized data entry a clerk with limited experience may enter codes in a data base by selecting from menu options that may not match the exact terminology used by the physician.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>(c) Potential sources of Errors in recording clinical data</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Misinformation from the patients</li>
                            <li>Quality of clinical findings</li>
                            <li>Errors in recording patients data by providers</li>
                            <li>Personnel errors during the recording of diagnostic tests</li>
                            <li>Inaccurate interpretation of tests/results</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p><strong>(d) Intentional recording and reporting of false errors</strong></p>
                        <p>One of the greatest fear of users is that information system will monitor employees work and that repercussions will occur if the employees do not attain a particular level of performance indicator.</p>
                        <p>Sometimes the health system is set up in such a way that reporting accurate data acts as a disincentive.</p>
                        <p>Physicians at times deliberatively mis-record patient data to avoid litigation.</p>

                        <h4>Errors in processing data</h4>
                        <p>Errors occur during the transfer and aggregation of data at all levels of the information system. Manual processing which is common in most developing countries involve tedious computation that often result in errors. Corrections are rarely made for missing reports.</p>
                        <p>If computers are available, data processing operations typically involve a serious of basic steps each of which is suitable to possible introduction of errors;</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Editing</li>
                            <li>Coding</li>
                            <li>Data entry</li>
                            <li>Tabulation</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p><strong>(a) Editing</strong></p>
                        <p>Registers and forms are edited to correct inconsistencies and eliminate omissions. During this stage managers need to make decisions about treatment of "unknown" responses in the raw data.</p>
                        <p>Where information is lacking on one variable, can a reasonable entry be estimated based on other information supplied in the form?</p>

                        <p><strong>(b) Coding</strong></p>
                        <p>It is the conversion of entries on forms or registers into symbols. While many coding procedures are relatively simple, involving classification of individuals by sex (male, female), by location(village x , village y ), reason for risk (preventive, curative) and so on, some coding procedures are complicated and have the potential for significant errors.</p>
                        <p>For instance, when classifying causes of death according to International Statistical classification of Diseases 10<sup>th</sup> Revision (ICD 10) categories, it is relatively easy to confuse the coding of disease A37.0 (whooping cough due to bordetellapertusis) with that of category A37.1 (whooping cough due to Bordetellaparapertusis)</p>

                        <p><strong>(c) Data entry</strong></p>
                        <p>Data entry refers to the means of transfer of the data from the original document to the computer. For manual data entry into the computer, many institutions perform double entry to reduce errors. With double entry a computer program accepts the record only if the clerk has entered it exactly the same way. This procedure minimizes the introduction of errors due to typing mistakes.</p>

                        <p><strong>(d)Tabulation</strong></p>
                        <p>A final step entails re-arranging the data in order to provide the most useful charts and figures for decision makers. The potential for errors is significant if the programmer provides incorrect instructions (to the computer) for the required tabulation. For instance a program manager might request for information on the number of ANC visits in District X (a rural accessible area) in 2000.</p>
                        <p>The programmer might incorrectly insert the code for District Y (an urban area of high access) for 2001.</p>
                        <p>Without reviewing the coding from the programming, the program manager might recognize that District X and Y were confused, but unlikely to know that the years 2000 and 2001 were also tabulated erroneously.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The following strategies can help to ensure high quality data at low cost.</p>
                        <p><strong>(a) Keep the design of the information system as simple as possible</strong></p>
                        <p>Operational cards, registers and forms should be designed in a simple manner with clear instructions. Valid, sensitive and specific instructions MUST be selected to increase data quality. It is also important to minimize the number of levels in the information system in orders to avoid errors during the transfer and processing of data.</p>
                        <p>In general the collector and the user of data should be as close as possible.Indeed, in action led information systems, the collectors and users of data may be the same people. This will reduce errors in handling data and will improve decision making process as data is more likely to be meaningful to the person who collects them.</p>

                        <p><strong>(b) Involve users in the design of the system</strong></p>
                        <p>Involving users in the design of the system is an incentive in two ways:-</p>
                        <ol type="i">
                            <li>It helps develop an information system that is best suited to the user</li>
                            <li>It increases ownership of the system</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>While involving users takes more time, it promotes a general understanding of the system and improves the quality of the data produced. Furthermore it ensures that the data collected is relevant.</p>

                        <p><strong>(c) Design of the data collection instruments</strong></p>

                        <h3>Fertility rates</h3>
                        <p>The various measures that can be used to express fertility levels in a given community:-</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Child woman ratio</li>

                        </ul>

                        <h4>(a) Child woman ratio</h4>
                        <p><code>Population aged (0-14) / population of women of CBA (15-49)</code></p>
                        
                        <h4>(b) Crude birth rate</h4>
                        <p>It is the most basic form of fertility measurement which is a ratio of birth occurring in the year to the population of a given geographical area multiplied by 1000 as a common expression<br>
                        <code>CBR = (No of births during the year / Population during the year) X 1000</code></p>
                        <p>The resultant answer is expressed as ______ births per 1000 population</p>

                        <h4>(c) General fertility rate</h4>
                        <p>This is a measure of fertility that seeks to overcome the influence of SEX and AGE composition on the population in the presentation of fertility rate or measurement. It shows the number of births per 1000 women of child bearing age.<br>
                        <code>GFR = (No of births during the year / Population of women aged (15-49)) X 1000</code></p>
                        <p>The resultant answer is expressed as ______ births per 1000 women of CBA</p>
                        <p><strong>Example:</strong> A population distribution had 175,973 births and a female population of 297,533 women aged 15-49 years.</p>
                        <p>Calculate GFR<br>
                        = (175,973 / 297,533) × 1000 = 591.44 = 592</p>
                        <p>The GFR for the area is 592 births per 1000 women of (15-49) years</p>

                        <h4>(d) Age specific fertility rate</h4>
                        <p><code>ASFR = (No of births in a specific age / Population of women in a specific age) X 1000</code></p>
