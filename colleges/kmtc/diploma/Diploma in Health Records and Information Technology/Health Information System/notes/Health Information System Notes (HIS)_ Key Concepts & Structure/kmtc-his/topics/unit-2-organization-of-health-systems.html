                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h3>Flow of health information system</h3>
                        <p>✓ Like any other system, HIS consist of parts which are integrated, interdependent and work towards a common goal.</p>
                        <p>✓ The malfunctioning of any part affect other parts of the system</p>
                        <p>✓ The system is a combination of health information and management information</p>
                        <p>✓ The system collects information on health (morbidity and mortality) and management (human resource, finance, assets and infrastructure) drugs and supplies.</p>

                        <h4>There are 3 levels of information flow</h4>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Unit level</li>
                            <li>Sub county level</li>
                            <li>National level</li>
                        </ol>

                        <p><strong>1. Unit level:</strong></p>
                        <p>Comprises of all data collected from the community units submitted to the attached health facility e.g. dispensaries, health centers,</p>

                        <p><strong>2. Sub county level</strong></p>
                        <p>Data is then submitted to the sub county HRIO office at the sub county level. The sub county HRIO then key in data into the KHIS which can be accessed by both county and National level</p>

                        <p><strong>3. National level</strong></p>
                        <p>At the national level the data is analyzed interpreted and the national level gives feedback to county, county gives feedback to sub county then sub county gives feedback to the unit level. Therefore the information flow is BOTTOM- TOP-BOTTOM.</p>
                        
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_11_18_adcbe07da1eff8f2ba44g-23-1.jpg" alt="A flowchart showing the bottom-up and top-down flow of health information. It starts at the community (unit level), goes up to health facilities, then to the Sub-County level, County level, and finally the National level. Feedback then flows back down from the National level to the lower levels." class="content-image">

                        <p>✓ The linkage between different levels of institution may look confusing, but in principle the flow of information is bottom top bottom. Data is collected, processed, analyzed, interpreted and a report written.</p>
                        <p>✓ The principle that needs to be emphasized about health information collection and use is that data flows in systems and is made up of individuals and departments. If one link is weak, the entire system suffers.</p>
                        <p>✓ Data collection is closely related to data use. Any improvement in collection of data is not enough without a corresponding improvement in its use.</p>
                        <p>✓ Managers who use data are likely to encourage its collection.</p>
                        <p>✓ Health information is a vital resource for health planning, implementation and evaluation. Data users include everyone in the delivery system, ranging from individuals, patients, clients, county planners, national planners and international donor agencies.</p>
                        <p>✓ Uses of data likewise range from monitoring of individual health, nutritional programs, evaluation and long term policy development.</p>
                        <p>✓ It is absolutely essential to be selective and identify priority areas for data collection, since data collectors have limited capacity and data users have limited interests. The collection of data that will not be useful is wasteful</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>According to KEPH, initially there used to be levels of health care services: The levels of health care services included the following:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Level 1-Community</li>
                            <li>Level 2 -Dispensary</li>
                            <li>Level 3 -Health Centers</li>
                            <li>Level 4-Sub county/District Hospitals</li>
                            <li>Level 5 -Provincial Hospital</li>
                            <li>Level 6 -National Teaching and referral Hospital</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>After devolution the health care services was then organized in terms of Tiers. The currently four tiers of health care include the following:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Tier one -Community</li>
                            <li>Tier two -Primary care level(Dispensaries and Health Centers))</li>
                            <li>Tier three -Sub county/County Hospitals</li>
                            <li>Tier four - National teaching and referral hospitals</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h4>1. Tier 1: Community Level</h4>
                        <p>This is a Community unit as defined in the previous KEPH Level 1 unit.</p>
                        
                        <h5>What is a Community Health Unit?</h5>
                        <p>This is a health service delivery structure within a defined geographical area covering a population of approximately 5,000 people.</p>
                        <p>Each unit has 100 households and each household has 5 members and an average of 10 villages</p>
                        <p>CHEWs (Community Health Extention Workers) currently known as CHAs(Community Health Assist) carry out supervisory work in the community units they are attached to. Community units comprises of:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>CHEW/CHA</li>
                            <li>CHW/CHV</li>
                            <li>CHC</li>
                            <li>VHC</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>It is governed by a Community Health Committee (CHC) and each Community Health unit is linked to a specific Health facility.</p>

                        <h5>Why Community Health Units?</h5>
                        <p>To bring services closer to the people using innovative approaches that empowers them to be responsible for their own health.</p>
                        <p>To provide linkage between the community members and the health facility</p>

                        <h5>Services Available at Community Health Units (CHUs)</h5>
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li>Water and sanitation hygiene; e.g. Faecal management, Household water treatment and demonstrations on hand washing with soap, etc.</li>

                            <li>Provision of Long Lasting Insecticide Treated Nets (LLITNs).</li>
                            <li>Management of diarrhea, injuries, wounds, jiggers and other minor illnesses.</li>
                            <li>Provision of Information, Education & Communication (IEC) materials</li>
                            <li>Defaulter tracing (ART, TB and Immunization)</li>
                            <li>Referrals to health facilities</li>
                            <li>First Aid Services</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h4>2. Tier 2: Primary Care Level</h4>
                        <p>Provision of basic outpatient health services - previous KEPH levels 2 and 3,dispensaries and health centers respectively.</p>
                        <h5>health centers</h5>
                        <p>provides many of the ambulatory health services. Health centres generally offer preventive and curative services, mostly adapted to local needs.</p>
                        <h5>Dispensaries</h5>
                        <p>are meant to be the system's first line of contact with patients, but in some areas, health centres or even hospitals are effectively the first points of contact. Dispensaries provide wider coverage for preventive health measures, which is a primary goal of the health policy. Dispensaries are manned by the nurse whereas Health centers are manned by the clinical officers</p>
                        
                        <h4>3. Tier 3: County Level</h4>
                        <p>Provision of primary referral services - previous KEPH level 4 District hospitals concentrate on the delivery of health care services and generate their own expenditure plans and budget requirements based on guidelines from headquarters through the provinces.</p>
                        
                        <h4>4. Tier 4: National Level</h4>
                        <p>Provision of secondary and specialized services - previous KEPH Level's 5 and 6</p>
                        <p>Provincial hospitals act as referral hospitals to their district hospitals. They also provide very specialized care. The provincial level acts as an intermediary between the national central level and the districts. They oversee the implementation of health policy at the district level, maintain quality standards, and coordinate and control all district health activities. Similar private hospitals at the provincial level include Aga Khan Hospitals in Kisumu and Mombasa</p>
                        <p>National referral hospitals are at the apex of the health care system, providing sophisticated diagnostic, therapeutic, and rehabilitative services. The two national referral hospitals are Kenyatta National Hospital in Nairobi and Moi Referral and Teaching Hospital in Eldoret. The equivalent private referral hospitals are Nairobi Hospital and Aga Khan Hospital in Nairobi</p>
