\section*{What is health information technology?}

It is a broad concept that encompasses an array of technology to store, share and analyze health information.

\section*{TOPIC TWO: HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF HEALTH INFORMATION SYSTEM IN KENYA}

Before independence, there was no formal structure to collect, collate, analyze and disseminate health information. In 1972, a committee that included representatives from the MoH, WHO, the Central Bureau of Statistics (now KNBS) and the Attorney General Chambers was formed. The task of the HIS committee was to design a HIS for Kenya. A pilot project was designed and tested in 3 locations
- Mombasa urban district
- Kwale peri-urban district and
- Kitui rural district.

Pilot project was completed in 1976 and recommendations were given and adopted.

One major recommendation was to merge two sections, the Research and Evaluation Section of the Division of Family Health and Vital Health Statistics Section of the Division of Communicable Diseases Control into one entity namely the Health Information System Division.
- Another recommendation was to develop a system of code numbers for the data collection and reporting forms (the prefix MED to MoH ) to get rid of the colonial connotation that would identify all forms in the Ministry of Health.

In 1982, another committee of professionals was formed to investigate on the accuracy and efficiency of all health data collection forms. The committee recommended that the forms were
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_18_7794677cee204c34483ag-09.jpg?height=112&width=372&top_left_y=2569&top_left_x=878)
working well. In 1984, the national policy on, -District Focus for Rural Development|l (DFRD) was initiated.

In response to this new development, the MoH decentralized its reporting activities by establishing HIS offices in all Districts now Counties where health data from all health facilities would be processed and analyzed for use before it is transmitted to the next level (DHRIO).

Reforms have taken place within the health sector since in an attempt to ensure highest health standards possible for her citizens for which the HIS continues to play a key role.

In 1994, the MOH and other stakeholders in the health sector spearheaded the development of 1st Kenya Health Policy Framework (KHPF 1994-2010).

The KHPF outlined areas which required immediate attention including the provision of integrated data collection and reporting tools, improvement of data flow mechanisms, support districts in supportive supervision, provide clear policy guidelines on HIS and improve feedback mechanisms at all levels.

In 2003, key reforms were undertaken with the introduction of performance based monitoring in the public sector. Based on the comprehensive health information assessment report (2004), the sector identified core indicators for performance monitoring leading to the revision, integration and harmonization of the minimum data sets (data collection and reporting tools) and core indicators for performance monitoring.

One of the strategic objectives of KHSSP II (2005 2010) was to strengthen monitoring and evaluation (Health Information System) in the Health Sector under the clarion call of "reversing the trends". The implementation of the above sector strategic plan was through Annual Operational Plans (AOPs) now Annual Work Plans (AWPs) which were to be monitored through an established framework on set targets.

AOPs gave rise to annual performance reviews and annual reports. Prior to 2008, information transmission and data management were manual with minimal automation (Kwale and CLARION models) In 2008, File Transfer Protocol (FTP) which was using the excel spreadsheets was introduced Districts were able to transfer data to the national sever in an easier and more efficient manner.

The national level received only district aggregates which could not be disaggregated to show facility specific details, thus making it impossible to do analysis of comparative performance across facilities .They were many worksheets for the master workbook at the national level and because of continuous splitting up of districts to create new districts further complicated the data management process. 22

Because of inadequacies of the FTP system, the MoH embarked on a process to acquire a web based database that would facilitate processing of facility level data at all levels. At this time, different soft wares (over 70) were in use in the health sector and an assessment was conducted with a view of coming up with an integrated software. This led to the adoption of the District Health Information System Software (DHIS) in 2010, which was web-based and was to be used for aggregate data management.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_18_7794677cee204c34483ag-11.jpg?height=112&width=372&top_left_y=2569&top_left_x=878)

\section*{Health Information System, Vision, Mission \& Goal}
- Vision: Be a center of excellence for quality health and health related data and information for use by all.
- Goal: To generate and use health information for policy formulation, management, planning, budgeting, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of health services and programme interventions in the health sector
- Mission (Purpose): To provide timely, reliable and accessible quality health service information for evidence based decision making in order to maximize utilization of scarce resources in the health sector.

\section*{Broad objectives of HIS}
1. To generate/provide data/ information (qualitative and quantitative) quality and timely required for planning, M\&E, efficient management of health services and decision making.
2. To facilitate/help information dissemination, feedback (horizontal and vertical) and use of information for evidence based decision making.
3. To create and maintain health information data base.
4. To create an open, continuous dialogue between those who collect and users of information with the aim of improving health services.
5. To determine end user information needs at the various levels of the health system.

\section*{Advantages of a functional HIS}
a. Information is readily available when requested or required, avoiding the last minute rush to look for data.
b. Policy makers and managers of programs use the information for health and development planning and implementation and are sensitized on importance and effective utilization of information
c. Resource mobilization and allocation. Once data is readily available it is easy to project the required resources by extrapolating from the past trends with a fairly good accuracy. Rule of the thumb should not be norm or the practice.
d. Monitoring trends: Disease surveillance is functional and it is thus easy to predict the occurrence of epidemics of diseases.
e. Problems and gap identification: Various departments and institutions becomes part of the system; there is collaboration and coordination among various actors.
f. The work and duties of the staff that are involved in the system is appreciated and recognized.
g. Ad hoc surveys and consultancies are avoided.
h. Decision making and priority service setting.
i. Operational research and training becomes easy and enables quick retrieval of the evidences in practice and use evidence based practices for demonstration.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_18_7794677cee204c34483ag-13.jpg?height=112&width=375&top_left_y=2569&top_left_x=875)
j. Monitoring and evaluation of projects and programs will be made easier and alongside working corrective measures or change of strategies will be realized in the initial stages.
k. Donor influence in HMIS is also avoided as in case of reviews.

\section*{Principle Characteristics of well-designed HIS}
- Collecting less data - collects prioritized/essential data based on indicators on a routine basis.
- Uses the data collected
- Collects timely, accurate and complete data
- It has feedback mechanism
- Non duplication of data collected
- Interdependence / Integration various depts., units have to contribute or various player to cooperate
- Interoperability - ability of the system to communicate with other systems
- Availability of forms/reporting tools (Manual or modern e.g. computers, smartphones, PDA)
- Encourages decentralized planning and management
- Support Primary Health Care (PHC)
- Includes all service providers at all levels

\section*{Data flow/Transmission}

Definition: This refers to passage/transfer of data (manual or electronically) between levels of health care system (lowest - highest level)
Two ways of data transmission
1. Vertical - hierarchal level (scalar chain - in relation to management functions operational - tactical strategic i.e. community/facility district/county - national level)
2. Horizontal - Amongst actors on the same level (e.g. fellow staffs, consumers, management boards, NGOs, and other partners

\section*{Data Flow/Transmmison - MoH,K}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_18_7794677cee204c34483ag-15.jpg?height=1500&width=1885&top_left_y=620&top_left_x=238)

\section*{Challenges facing HIS in Kenya today?}
\# Competing priorities
\$ Lack of or inadequacy of requisite skills at all levels.
\# Inadequate personnel
* Low staff morale, poor working and storage space at all level
\# Inadequate supply of equipment such computers and printers,
- Lack of centralized data base at all levels
\# Weak feedback/data sharing mechanism and poor dissemination at all levels
- Inadequate facilitative supervision
\# Inadequate finances/unclear funding mechanism to support HIS activities
- Inadequate reporting tools
- Late and incomplete reports
\$ Lack of integration of the health information system
\$ Lack of one plan, one monitoring and evaluation frame work, one funding to strengthen a functional and reliable comprehensive health information system
‡ Lack of clearly defined functional linkages between the different components of the health system especially with regard to quality standards for health services and sharing of health

\section*{Possible solutions}
\# Develop staff skills and understanding.
\# Intensify data sharing to create demand.
± Strengthen local information systems and structures.
\# Create an information culture (Data Demand and Information Use)
\# Conduct regular review meetings at all levels and share feedback reports

\section*{The roles of the MOH are as follows:}
- Planning,
- Coordination
- Service delivery programs
- Organizing and implementing health information system
- Monitoring and evaluation supportive supervision.
- Helping decision makers to detect and control emerging and endemic health problems.

\section*{The value \& importance of health information}

Better information means safer health care health in increasing patient safety by virtual of the information contained in the electronic health records (HER) and the features checking notifications etc. the system use to ensure high quality care.

Electronic exchange of clinical information allows Doctors, Nurses, Pharmacists and other health care providers and patients to access and securely share patients vital medical information, electronically improving the speed, quality, safety coordination and cost of patient care.

\section*{The role of health information in managing health activities}
1. Ensuring that the patient information in secure and protected.
2. Improving healthcare quality, reducing medical errors, reducing health disparities' and advancing of patient-centered medical care.
3. Reducing healthcare costs resulting from inefficiency, medical errors, inappropriate care, duplicative care and incomplete information.
4. Providing appropriate Information to help guide medical decisions at the time and place of care,
5. Ensuring that meaningful public input is included in development of such infrastructure
6. Improving public health activities and facilitating the early identification and rapid response to public health threats
7. Facilitating health and clinical research and healthcare quality,
8. Promoting early detection, prevention and management of chronic diseases.
9. Promoting a more effective market place increased consumer choice and improved outcomes in healthcare services
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_18_7794677cee204c34483ag-17.jpg?height=112&width=378&top_left_y=2569&top_left_x=875)
10. Improving efforts to reduce health disparities

\section*{Health information resources}

Health information systems (HIS) form a holistic overview of people, process and reports of health information most important for decision making in the health sector.

The health metric network defined HIS as consisting of 6 components, namely
- HIS resources (Legislative regulatory planning frameworks, personnel finances logistics support and ICTs)
- Indicators Determinant of health system INPUTS OUTPUTS AND OUTCOMES
- Data source-Determinants of health system Inputs, outputs and outcomes
- Data management; Data collection, storage, quality assurance and flow processing, compilation and analysis
- Information products; Data transformed into information for evidence and knowledge to shape health action
- Dissemination and use; Making information readily accessible to decision makers and communities

\section*{Policies and Regulations}

Policies that govern national information systems (HIS) is the indicator of strength of a country, s HIS.

HIS policies outline a deliberate system of principle to guide decision and achieve HIS outcomes. Patients must be ensured that the health information they share with health care professionals will remain confidential, without such assurance, patients may withhold critical information that could affect the quality safety and outcome of care,

\section*{The link between health information services and the user}
- Medical education and mentoring which ranges from the provision of continuous medical education from professionals and special medical education seminars targeted groups of interactive expert
- Remote patient monitoring uses devices to remotely collect and send data to monitoring stations for interpretation i.e telehealth application which includes telemetry devices which captures a specific vital sign example blood pressure, glucose, ECG or weight, such services can reduce nurse's visitation,
- Consumer medical and health information includes the use of internet for consumer to obtain specialized health information and on -line discussion groups to pride peer to peer support.
- Direct patient care such as sharing audio, video and medical data between a patient and a health professional for use in rendering a diagnosis, treatment plan, prescription or advice. This might involve patients located at a remote clinic, a physician, s office or home.

\section*{TOPIC THREE: ORGANISATION OF HEALTH INFORMATION IN KENYA}

Kenya's health care system is structured in a step wise manner so that complicated cases are referred to a higher level. Gaps in the system are filled by private, NGO and church run units.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_18_7794677cee204c34483ag-20.jpg?height=1462&width=1630&top_left_y=745&top_left_x=466)

\section*{The Levels of service delivery}

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline National health sector strategic plan 2(2005-2010) & Kenya health sector strategic plan 3 2012-2017 \\
\hline Level 1community Services. & Tier 1: Community \\
\hline Level 2 Dispensaries & \\
\hline Level 3 -Health centers & Tier 2primary care level 2 and 3 \\

\hline Level 5 -County referral hospitals & Tier 3 - County level previous KEPH level 4 \\
\hline Level 6 -National referral hospital 6 & Tier 4National level previous KEPH level 5 \& 6 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

KEPH means Kenya essential package for health

\section*{KENYA HEALTH SECTOR STRATEGIC PLAN III 2012-2017}

The Tier of care in the Kenyan health systems are defined as community, Primary care, county referral services, and national referral services
I. Tier 1: community
II. Tier2 Primary care level, previous KEPH 2 \& 3
III. Tier 3: County level previous KEPH Kenya essential package for health level 4
IV. Tier 4: National level previous KEPH level 5\&6

Tier 1 - (level 1) which comprises all the community-based health activities, organized around the comprehensive community strategy (CCS). This is a non-facility-based level.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_18_7794677cee204c34483ag-21.jpg?height=112&width=372&top_left_y=2569&top_left_x=878)

Referrals at this level are initiated by community health workers (CHS) in the community units (CU) are linked to primary health care facilities to which majority of the referrals from this level are made.

Tier 2; the primary care facilities (Levels 2 \& 3) comprises dispensaries, clinics, health centers and maternity homes. Dispensaries are managed by a small number of staff, a large majority being nurses. Like the community level dispensaries refer to level 3 facilities and in some cases level four. Some dispensaries with larger capacity act as receiving points from other smaller facilities of the same level. Also, at level 3 offers services of inpatient services, mostly maternity. These facilities mainly received from level 1 and 2 facilities.

Tier 3 - (level 4 and 5) County Referral health facilities comprises all levels 4 \& 5 facilities operating in and managed by the county. All the county managed facilities from a country referral system, which shares specific services to form a virtual network. The county referral system receives referrals from primary care facilities in its area of responsibility from other country facilities in the country, and from facilities outside the county (horizontal referral) and community units. At this level they offer inpatient and outpatient services and have large laboratories that offer diagnostic services that otherwise would not be available at the primary care facilities .Also in emergency referrals from may come from level 1.

Tier 4. The national Health facilities /teaching and referral institutions (level 6) Includes the facilities that provide specialized healthcare services, such as hospitals, laboratories, blood banks and research institutions. These facilities operate with defined level of autonomy. Also at this level is where there is expertise and services are offered and linkage with local and international universities facilities and staff are maintained.

TOPIC FOUR: UTILIZATION OF HEALTH SECTORS INDICATORS
}

\section*{OBJECTIVES}

\section*{Introduction /definition, Types of Indicators}
1. The domains (input, process, output, Impact)
2. The units of measure (rates, Ratios
3. The frequency, coverage and performance
4. Data source (numerators and denominators)
5. The application level (sector, programme national, county, facility, community

\section*{6. The millennium Development goals}

\section*{Definition of indicators}

An indicator; is a specific, observable and measurable characteristic that can be used to show changes or progress a programme is making toward achieving a specific outcome. There should be at least one indicator for each outcome. The indicator should be focused, clear and specific

Health indicator; is a variable susceptible to direct measurement that reflects the state of health of a person, place, and a phenomenon. OR A quantifiable characteristics of a population which researchers use as supporting evidence for describing the health of a population..

Quality of care can be defined as the degree to which services for individuals and populations increase the like hood of desired health
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_18_7794677cee204c34483ag-23.jpg?height=112&width=372&top_left_y=2569&top_left_x=878)

\section*{Indicator as a measure that assess a particular health care process.}
- Qualitative measures that can be used to monitor and evaluate the quality of important governance, management, clinical and support functions that affect patient's outcome
- Are measurement tools, screens or flags that are used as guides to monitor, evaluate and improve the quality of patient care, clinical and support functions that affect patient outcomes
- Indicators provide quantitative basis for clinicians, organizations and planners aiming to achieve improvement in care and processes by which patients care is provided.
- Indicators measurement and monitoring serve many purposes, they make possible to document the quality of care, make comparisons (benchmarking) overtime between places (e.g. hospitals, make judgment and set priorities (e.g. choosing a hospital or surgery or organizing medical care) support accountability, regulation and accreditation support quality improvement and support patient choice of providers. The use of indicators enables professionals and organizations to monitor and evaluate what happens to patients because of how well professionals and organizational system function to provide for needs of patients.

\section*{Key characteristics of ideal indicators An ideal indicator RAVES}
- Reliable-It gives the same result if used by different people
- Appropriate: It is the best way of measuring what we want to know
- Valid: It is measures what you want to measure
- Easy - It is feasible to collect the data to produce this indicator.
- Sensitive -It reflects changes in events being measured
- Is based on agreed definitions and described exhaustively and exclusively.
- Highly or optimally specific and sensitive i.e. detects few false positive and false negative
- Indicators discriminates well.
- Identifies events for the user i.e. meant for clinical providers, it is relevant to clinical practice.
- Permits useful comparison.
- Is evidence based.

\section*{The types of health indicators}

Mortality indicators
Morbidity indicators
Health status conditions
Disability indicators
Nutritional indicators
Social and mental indicators
Health system indicators
Health determinant

\section*{Example of health status indicators}

They inform about the causes of diseases and death in a given population
Example; morbidity rates of measles, death rates of TB, incidence of diarrhea, low weight rates

Monitors affordability of resources,
Measures availability/Quality of resource

\section*{Process:}

Monitors activities that are carried out

Measures accessibility of services coverage and quality

\section*{Output:}

Monitors results of activities
Measures acceptability, use change performance, coverage and quality
They show to what extent the expected result was attained with available resources. The degree to which outputs affect outcomes and impacts

\section*{Example:}

Percentage of fully immunized children
Incidence rates of EPI targeted disease
Reported new cases of acute flaccid paralysis
