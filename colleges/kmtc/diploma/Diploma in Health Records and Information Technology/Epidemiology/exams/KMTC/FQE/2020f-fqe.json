Researcher: Used to assess the strength of association between exposure and disease, helping to establish causality. c) Uses of Attributable Risk: i) Prevention Programs: It shows the potential impact of an intervention. It quantifies the excess disease burden that could be eliminated if the risk factor (smoking) is removed. ii) Health Planning: It helps in resource allocation by estimating the public health impact.

All of them were from Kinango sub-county situated 35 kilometers from the country referral hospital. Dr. Mohammed has no information on Kinango which he last visited two years before. He likes curative care so much that he hardly moves out to supervise the health facilities in his area of jurisdiction or to attend health committee meetings. Therefore, he has no information on the population that his hospital is supposed to cover. a) In your own opinion, why does Dr. Mohammed behave the way he does? b) In reality, does this happen?

      "explanation": "a) Reasons for Dr. Mohammed's Behavior: Clinical Bias: He likely has a clinical background (doctor/clinician) rather than public health training, leading to a focus on individual treatment (\"Curative bias\"). Lack of Resources: He may lack transport, fuel, or staffing to conduct field visits or supervision. Understaffing: If he is the only doctor, he may be overwhelmed by the patient load at the referral hospital, leaving no time for administrative duties. Lack of Motivation/Incentives: Poor supervision from national level or lack of allowances for field work. b) Reality Check: Yes, this is very common in reality. Reasons: Shortage of Health Workers: Managers often have to double as clinicians due to staff shortages. Poor Funding: Public health activities (prevention, supervision) are often underfunded compared to curative services (drugs, equipment). Training Gaps: Many managers are appointed based on clinical seniority, not management or epidemiological competence. c) Essential Health Information Needed: Demographics: Population size, age/sex distribution, density in Kinango. Morbidity/Mortality Data: Top causes of illness and death (e.g., Diarrhea incidence rates). Environmental Factors: Water sources, sanitation coverage (latrines) in Kinango. Health Service Coverage: Immunization rates, facility utilization, staffing levels in peripheral facilities. Social Determinants: Poverty levels, education, cultural practices affecting health. d) Methods to Obtain Information: Routine Health Information System (DHIS2): Review monthly reports from Kinango health facilities. Surveillance Reports: Check IDSR (Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response) data for outbreaks. Field Visits/Supervision: Conduct supportive supervision visits to Kinango. Community Health Volunteers (CHVs): Gather reports from Level 1 community units. Surveys: Conduct rapid assessments or household surveys in the affected area.
