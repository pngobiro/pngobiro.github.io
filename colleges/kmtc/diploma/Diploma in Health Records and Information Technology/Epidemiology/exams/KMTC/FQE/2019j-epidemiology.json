Interventional Studies Interventional (experimental) studies are epidemiological study designs where the investigator actively manipulates the exposure. The researcher assigns subjects to either an exposed group (intervention/treatment) or an unexposed group (control/placebo) to observe the outcome. The most common type is the Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT). c. Advantages of Interventional Studies Provide the strongest evidence for causality (cause-effect relationship).
