The question asks for \"Except\", but both C and D would decrease it. Often in these exams, \"Death\" is the intended distractor, or \"Recovery\". Since D is crossed out in the image and \"Death\" decreases it, C \"Recovery\" also decreases it. The question might have been \"Which decreases prevalence\" or implies \"Which of these increases... except\". Both C and D decrease it. Let's assume the question meant \"Which factor *decreases* prevalence\" or is asking which of the list does NOT increase it. Both C and D fit.

Matching: Match controls to cases based on confounding variables like age and sex to ensure comparability. Assessment of Exposure: Look back in time (retrospectively) to determine the history of exposure (Smoking) in both groups. Ask: \"Did you smoke?\" Analysis (2x2 Table): Compare the frequency of smoking in cases vs. controls. Calculate the Odds Ratio (OR): (Odds of smoking in cases) / (Odds of smoking in controls). Interpretation: If significantly more lung cancer patients smoked compared to healthy controls (OR > 1), an association is suggested. (b) Interventional (Experimental) Studies: These are epidemiological studies where the researcher actively manipulates the exposure (e.g., gives a drug, vaccine, or health education) to one group while withholding it from another (control group) to observe the outcome. The hallmark is Randomization. (c) Advantages of Interventional Studies: Gold Standard: Provides the strongest evidence for causality. Control of Bias: Randomization eliminates selection bias and confounding (both known and unknown). Control of Exposure: The investigator knows exactly who received the intervention and the dose. (d) Disadvantages of Interventional Studies: Ethical Issues: It may be unethical to expose people to harmful agents or withhold beneficial treatment.
