                        <p>Starting PowerPoint: <strong>Start → Program → MS PowerPoint</strong></p>
                        <p>This opens a PowerPoint starter dialog-box which shows the different ways that may be used to create a presentation.</p>
                        <p>Presentation may be created in four (4) different ways.</p>
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li>AutoContent Wizard</li>
                            <li>Design Template</li>
                            <li>Blank Presentation</li>
                            <li>From an Existing File</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3>Auto content Wizard</h3>
                        <p>This enables the user to create a new presentation out of sample lines already created and saved in the computer. That is a kind of a template that gives guidelines and design that may be used to create a new presentation and it is done by way of replacing the information on slides with your new ideas that will form the new presentation.</p>
                        <h4>To use AutoContent Wizard:</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Start PowerPoint & click on the Office Button</li>
                            <li>Click on New from the list of commands, a New Presentation dialog box will appear</li>
                            <li>Under the Templates option, click on Installed templates Command</li>
                            <li>Select a theme of your choice from the list that appears then click Create</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Design Template</h3>
                        <p>This the one used to design a presentation using different background provided by PowerPoint. The selected background is applied on the slide known as the Master Slide. This method is commonly used to create a one-slide presentation such as a poster or an advertisement and when printed, it may appear like a Word Processing document.</p>
                        <h4>To do this:</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Start PowerPoint & click on the Office Button</li>
                            <li>Click on New from the list of commands, a New Presentation dialog box will appear</li>
                            <li>Under the Templates option, click on Installed themes Command</li>
                            <li>Select a theme of your choice from the list that appears then click Create</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>NB: Instructions include click to add text / click to add sub-title etc</p>
                        
                        <h3>From An Existing Presentation</h3>
                        <p>This enables one to create a presentation in cases where identical presentations need be. Layout and design of existing presentation are used for a new one.</p>
                        <h4>To do this:</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Start PowerPoint & click on the Office Button</li>
                            <li>Click on New from the list of commands, a New Presentation dialog box will appear</li>
                            <li>Under the Templates option, click on New from existing Command</li>
                            <li>A New from existing presentation dialog box will appear.</li>
                            <li>Select / choose the location of the saved presentation that you want to use then click on Create new</li>
                            <li>Replace the information on the new slide with new information i.e. your own ideas</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Blank Presentation</h3>
                        <p>This allows the user to create a presentation from scratch, i.e. every element of the presentation (ideas, layout, text, graphics...) is determined by the user.</p>
                        <h4>To do this:</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Start PowerPoint & click on the Office Button</li>
                            <li>Click on New from the list of commands, a New Presentation dialog box will appear</li>
                            <li>Under the Templates option, click on Blank and recent Command</li>
                            <li>Select Blank presentation from the list that appears then click Create</li>
                        </ul>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Click on Office button to display a list of commands</li>

                        </ul>

                        <h3>Viewing Presentation</h3>
                        <p>A PowerPoint Presentation can be viewed in different ways depending on the operation carried out. That is:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Normal View</li>
                            <li>Slide Sorter View</li>
                            <li>Notes Page View</li>
                            <li>Slide Show View</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h4>Normal View</h4>
                        <p>This view is normally very useful during the initial stages of creating a presentation. One can quickly move to a particular slide by clicking on its slide number from the left panel for the actual slide to be displayed on the right panel.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Slide Sorter View</h4>
                        <p>Is a view that displays all the slides in the presentation on one screen. It acts as the Print Preview to the presentation. It is very important when we wish to add / delete / remove slides.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Notes Page View</h4>
                        <p>This view divides the screen into 2 parts - the slide at the top and the notes option at the bottom. The notes part displays the flow of ideas while that on the top displays the actual slide being worked on. The notes page view is used to edit the speaker notes as they will look when you print them out.</p>

                        <h4>Slide Show View</h4>
                        <p>Is the final view of a presentation that is shown to the audience where slides are shown one after the other on full screen. The slides may be made to 'transmit' automatically or manually by the mouse.</p>

                        <h3>Switching Between Views</h3>
                        <p>There are two ways to do this:</p>
                        <ol type="i">
                            <li>Go to View tab then click on the suitable view under the Presentation views group.</li>
                            <li>Click on the viewing commands on the right hand side of the status bar.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3>Inserting Slides</h3>
                        <p>After creating the first slide of a presentation (the master slide), most slides may be inserted to complete the show.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>On the Home tab, click on arrow pointing downwards on the New slide command under the Slides group</li>
                            <li>Select the slide layout of your choice</li>

                            <li>Enter text in your new slide</li>
                            <li>Or press Ctrl + M on the keyboard</li>

                        </ul>

                        <h3>Slide Layout</h3>
                        <p>This refers to how you want your information to be arranged on your slide. There are different types of slide layout depending on the type of information or data to be entered in a slide.</p>
                        
                        <h4>a. Inserting Tabular Information</h4>
                        <p>This is used when information has to be presented in tables for clarity e.g. a price list.</p>
                        
                        <h4>b. Graphical Information</h4>
                        <p>Helps in presenting information using graphs and charts e.g. comparison of some products e.t.c</p>
                        
                        <h4>c. Smart Art Graphic</h4>
                        <p>Helps in presenting information in form of a list, Process, Cycle, Hierarchy, Relationship, Matrix and Pyramid.</p>

                        <h4>d. Inserting Picture from file</h4>
                        <p>This is used when you want to insert a picture that you have saved in your computer.</p>
                        
                        <h4>e. Inserting Clip Arts</h4>
                        <p>Clip arts are used to make slides more attractive as well as easily understood.</p>

                        <h4>f. Inserting Media Clip</h4>
