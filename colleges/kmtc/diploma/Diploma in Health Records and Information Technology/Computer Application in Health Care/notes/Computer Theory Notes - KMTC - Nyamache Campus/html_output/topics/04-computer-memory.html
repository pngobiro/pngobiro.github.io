                        <p>Memory or storage capacity is one of the important components of a computer. Any storage unit of a computer system is classified on the basis of the following criteria:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Access time.</strong> This is the time required to locate and retrieve stored data from the storage unit in response to program instructions.</li>
                            <li><strong>Storage capacity.</strong> It is the amount of data that can be stored in the storage unit.</li>

                        <p>The computer stores a character in the storage cells with binary (0,1) mechanism. Thus the basic unit of memory is a bit (binary digit - 0,1). To store a character, a computer requires 8 bits or 1 byte. This is called the word length of the storage unit. Hence the storage capacity of the computer is measured in the number of words it can store and is expressed in terms of bytes. The different units of measurement are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>8 Bits = 1 Byte</li>
                            <li>2<sup>10</sup> (or) 1024 Bytes = 1 Kilo Byte (KB)</li>
                            <li>2<sup>10</sup> (or) 1024 KB = 1 Mega Byte (MB)</li>
                            <li>2<sup>10</sup> (or) 1024 MB = 1 Gega Byte (GB)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Conversion</h4>
                        <p><strong>ASCII - American Standard Code for Information Interchange.</strong> This code has given alphabets like some numbers which can be converted to Binary form. A-65 ...... Z-90 and a-97 .......... z-121. By using these codes the alphabets can be converted to digital and hence to Binary form.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>A computer memory is of two types:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Primary Memory (Internal storage)</li>
                            <li>Secondary Memory (External storage)</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3>Primary Memory:</h3>
                        <p>Primary memory is also called internal memory and is an important part of a computer. It is the main area in a computer where the data is stored. The stored data can be recalled instantly and correctly whenever desired. This memory can be quickly accessed by the CPU for reading or storing information. Primary memory is further classified into two types:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Random Access Memory (RAM)</li>
                            <li>Read- Only Memory (ROM)</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h4>Random Access Memory (RAM)</h4>
                        <p>RAM is also known as read/write memory as information can be read from and written onto it. RAM is a place in a computer that holds instructions for the computer, its programs and the data. The CPU can directly access the data from RAM almost immediately. However, the storage of data and instructions in RAM is temporary, till the time the computer is running. It disappears from RAM as soon as the power to the computer is switched off. i.e it is volatile memory.</p>

                        <h4>Read- Only Memory (ROM)</h4>
                        <p>It is called Read-only memory as information can only be read from and not written or changed onto ROM. ROM is the _built-in memory of a computer. It stores some basic inputoutput instructions put by the manufacturer to operate the computer. The storage of data and instructions in ROM is permanent. It does not depend on the power supply. i.e. it is nonvolatile memory.</p>

                        <h3>Secondary memory:</h3>
                        <p>The primary memory which is faster (and hence expensive) is generally not sufficient for large storage of data. As a result, additional memory, called the -auxiliary or -secondary memory is used. It is also referred as --backup storage as it is used to store large volume of data on a permanent basis which can be transferred to the primary memory whenever required for processing. Data are stored in secondary storage in the same binary codes as in the main (primary memory) storage. Some of the devices of secondary storages are Floppy Disk, Hard Disk, CD-ROM, DVD and Flash drive.</p>
                        
                        <h4>1. Floppy Disk:</h4>
                        <p>It is also referred as -Diskette: and is made of flexible Vinyl material. It has a small hole on one side called -Right protect notch, which protects accidental writing/deleting the information from the disk. There is a hole in the centre through which the spindle of drive unit rotates the disk. The disks are available in two sizes of 5.25 and 3.5 inches and these could be either low density or high-density floppies. Storage capacity of floppies is measured in kilobytes (KB) and megabytes (MB).</p>
                        
                        <h4>2. Hard Disk:</h4>
                        <p>The hard disk can hold more information than the floppy disk and the retrieval of information from hard disk is faster when compared to floppies or tapes. A hard disk is fixed inside the CPU and its capacity ranges from 20 MB onwards. The hard disk is made up of a collection of discs (one below the other) known as platters on which the data is recorded. These platters are coated with magnetic material. It is less sensitive to external environmental disorders and hence the storage in hard disk is safe. A small hard disk might be as much as 25 times larger than a floppy disk. Storage Capacity of hard disks varies from 20 MB to several Gega bytes like 80 GB, 160 GB.</p>

                        <h4>3. CD-ROM:</h4>
                        <p>CD-ROM stands for Compact Disk-Read Only Memory. It is used to store a wide variety of information. Its main advantage is that it is portable and can hold a large amount of data. The storage capacity of most CD-ROMs is approximately 650 MB or 700 MB. CD-ROMs have the following variations:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>(i) CD-R (Compact disc Recordable): Data can be written onto it just once. The stored data can be read. Data once written onto it cannot be erased.</li>
                            <li>(ii) CD-RW (Compact disc Rewritable): It is also called erasable CD. Data once written onto it can be erased to write or record new information many times. To use a CD-ROM, a device called CD drive is needed.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>4. DVD:</h4>
                        <p>DVD stands for Digital Versatile Disc. It is similar to a CD-ROM, except that it can store larger amounts of data. The storage capacity of a DVD is at least 4.7MB. DVDs that can store up to 17 GBs are also available. Because of their capacity, DVDs are generally used to store a very large multimedia presentations and movies that combine high quality sound and graphics.</p>
                        
                        <h4>5. Flash Drive:</h4>
                        <p>It is a small, portable device that can be used to store, access and transfer data. Due to its small size, it is commonly called Pen drive. It is also called USB drive. We can read, write, copy, delete, and move data from computer to pen drive or pen drive to computer. It comes in various storage capacities of 2 GB, 4 GB, 8 GB etc. It is popular because it is easy to use and small enough to be carried in a pocket. This device is plugged into the USB port of the computer and the computer automatically detects this device.</p>
