\section*{INTRODUCTION}

\section*{Definition:}

A Computer is an electronic device that can perform activities that involve Mathematical, Logical and graphical manipulations. Generally, the term is used to describe a collection of devices that function together as a system. It performs the following three operations in sequence.
1. It receives data \& instructions from the input device.
2. Processes the data as per instructions.
3. Provides the result (output) in a desired form.

Data: It is the collection of raw facts, figures and symbols. Example: Names of students and their marks in different subjects listed in random order.

Information: It is the data that is processed and presented in an organized manner. Example: When the names of students are arranged in alphabetical order, total and average marks are calculated \& presented in a tabular form, it is information.

Program: Set of instructions that enable a computer to perform a given task.

\section*{Advantages of computers:}

\section*{High speed}

Computers have the ability to perform routine tasks at a greater speed than human beings. They can perform millions of calculations in seconds.

\section*{Accuracy}

Computers are used to perform tasks in a way that ensures accuracy.

\section*{Storage}

Computers can store large amount of information. Any item of data or any instruction stored in the memory can be retrieved by the computer at lightning speeds.

\section*{Automation}

Computers can be instructed to perform complex tasks automatically (which increases the productivity).

\section*{Diligence}

Computers can perform the same task repeatedly \& with the same accuracy without getting tired.

\section*{Versatility}

Computers are flexible to perform both simple and complex tasks.

\section*{Cost effectiveness}

Computers reduce the amount of paper work and human effort, thereby reducing costs.

\section*{Limitations of computers}
a. Computers need clear \& complete instructions to perform a task accurately. If the instructions are not clear \& complete, the computer will not produce the required result.
b. Computers cannot think.
c. Computers cannot learn by experience.

\end{tabular}

\section*{ANATOMY OF COMPUTERS}

The computer system consists of three units:
1. Input device
2. Central Processing Unit (CPU)
3. Output device

The various functions of these units can be summarized as:

\section*{Unit}

Input device

\section*{Function}
: Reads information from input media and enters to the Computer in a coded form

\section*{CPU}

Memory unit Stores program and data
Arithmetic Logic unit performs arithmetic and logical functions
Control Unit Interprets program instructions and controls the input and output devices

Output device decodes information and presents it to the user

\section*{Central Processing Unit}

It is the part of the computer that carries out the instructions of a computer program. It is the unit that reads and executes program instructions. Hence it is known as the brain of the computer. The CPU consists of storage or memory unit, Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) and control unit.

\section*{(a) Memory Unit}

It is also known as the primary storage or main memory. It stores data, program instructions, internal results and final output temporarily before it is sent to an appropriate output device. It consists of thousands of cells called storage locations. These cells activate with off-on or binary digits $(0,1)$ mechanism. Thus a character either a letter or numerical digit is stored as a string of $(0,1)$ Binary digits (BITS). These bits are used to store instructions and data by their combinations.

\section*{(b) Arithmetic and Logical Unit (ALU)}

It is the unit where all Arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction etc.) and logical functions such as true or false, male or female are performed. Once data are fed into the main memory from input devices, they are held and transferred as needed to ALU where processing takes place. No process occurs in primary storage. Intermediate generated results in ALU are temporarily placed in memory until needed at later time. Data may move from primary memory to ALU and back again to storage many times before the process is finalized.

\section*{(c) Control Unit}

It acts as a central nervous system and ensures that the information is stored correctly and the programs instructions are followed in proper sequence as well as the data are selected from the memory as necessary. It also coordinates all the input and output devices of a system

\section*{Input Devices}

Devices used to provide data and instructions to the computer are called Input devices. Some important input devices are: Key board, Mouse, Scanner, MICR, Web camera, Microphone etc.

\section*{Keyboard}

The Key board is used for typing text into the computer. It is also known as standard Input device. A computer keyboard is similar to that of a type writer with additional keys. The most
commonly available computer keyboard has 104 keys. There are different types of keys on the keyboard. The keys are categorized as:
- Alphanumeric keys, including letters \& numbers.
- Punctuation keys, such as colon (:), semicolon (;) Question mark (?), Single \& double
- Quotes
- Special keys such as arrow keys, control keys, HOME, END, ESC, ENTER, BACKSPACE, TAB etc.
- Function keys (F1 to F12),

\section*{Mouse}

It is a device that controls the movement of the cursor on a monitor. A mouse will have 2 buttons on its top. The left button is the most frequently used button. There will be a wheel between the left and right buttons. This wheel enables us to smoothly scroll through screens of information. As we move the mouse, the pointer on the monitor moves in the same direction. Optical mouse is another advanced pointing device that uses a light emitting component instead of the mouse ball. Mouse cannot be used for entering the data. It is only useful to select the options on the screen.

\section*{Scanner}

It is an input device that can read text or illustrations printed on paper and translate into digital form. The main advantage of these scanners is that the data need not be entered separately resulting in saving lot of time.

Scanners are of two types:
1. Optical scanners
2. MICR

\section*{Optical scanners:}

\section*{Optical character Recognition (OCR):}

In this, characters are read with the help of a light. This is used in office atomization, documentation in library etc.

\section*{Optical mark recognition (OMR):}

It is a technology where an OMR device senses the presence or absence of a mark such as a pencil mark. OMR is used in tests such as aptitude tests.

\section*{Optical barcode recognition (OBCR):}

Barcode readers are photoelectric scanners that read the bar codes or vertical zebra striped marks printed on product containers. This is used in super markets, book shops etc.

\section*{Magnetic Ink Character Recognition (MICR):}

This is widely used in banks to process the cheques. This allows the computer to recognize characters printed using magnetic ink. It is a character recognition technology used primarily by the banking industry to facilitate the processing of the cheques. MICR characters (cheque No., Account .Number .etc.) are printed in special ink usually containing iron oxide. When a document that contains the ink needs to be read, it passes through a machine which magnetizes the ink and there will be a reader sorter unit which translates the magnetic information into characters. MICR provides a secure, high speed of scanning and processing information. It scans about 2600 cheques/min.

\section*{Output devices}

Any device that is capable of representing information on a computer is called an Output device. Output devices receive information from the CPU and present it to the user in the desired form.

Some important Output devices are: Monitor, Printer

\section*{1. Terminal/Monitor}

It is similar to TV screen- either a monochrome (black and white) or colour - and it displays the output. It is also referred as Visual Display Unit (VDU). Several types of monitors are in use. Some of them are Colour Graphic Adapter (CGA), Enhanced Graphics Adaptor (EGA), Video Graphics Adapter (VGA) and Super Video Graphics Adapter (SVGA). The screen sizes differ from system to system. The standard size is 24 lines by 80 characters. Most systems have provision for scrolling which helps in moving the text vertically or horizontally on the screen.

\section*{2. Printer}

A printer is used to transfer data from a computer onto paper. The paper copy obtained from a printer is often referred as --printout. The different printers and their speeds are as follows:

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|}
\hline S. No & Type & Mode of Printing & Speed \\
\hline 1. & Dot - Matrix printer & Prints the character in dotted pattern through printer ribbon using either 24 pin or 9 pin & 200/300 to 700 CPS \\
\hline 2. & Ink Jet printer & Work by spraying ionized ink & Slow, 90 CPS \\
\hline 3. & Laser printer & Also called page printer. Uses laser beam to produce an image. & 6 to 12 PPM 4 \\
\hline 4. & Line printer & Prints lines at a time instead of single characters. & 300 to 600 LPM \\
\hline 5. & Plotter & Produces drawings or graphs through pens which are filled with different colours. & \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

Note: (CPS: Characters per Second; PPM: Pages per Minutes; LPM: Lines Per Minute)

\section*{MEMORY OF THE COMPUTER}

Memory or storage capacity is one of the important components of a computer. Any storage unit of a computer system is classified on the basis of the following criteria:

Access time.
This is the time required to locate and retrieve stored data from the storage unit in response to program instructions.

Storage capacity.
It is the amount of data that can be stored in the storage unit.
Cost per bit of storage.
Units of memory: The computer stores a character in the storage cells with binary $(0,1)$ mechanism. Thus the basic unit of memory is a bit (binary digit $-0,1$ ). To store a character,
a computer requires 8 bits or 1 byte. This is called the word length of the storage unit. Hence the storage capacity of the computer is measured in the number of words it can store and is expressed in terms of bytes. The different units of measurement are

8 Bits = 1 Byte
210 (or) 1024 Bytes = 1 Kilo Byte (KB)
210 (or) $1024 \mathrm{~KB}=1$ Mega Byte (MB)
210 (or) $1024 \mathrm{MB}=1$ Gega Byte (GB)

\section*{Conversion}

ASCII - American Standard Code for Information Interchange.
This code has given alphabets like some numbers which can be converted to Binary form.
A- $65 \ldots \ldots . Z-90$ and $a-97 \ldots \ldots \ldots . \mathrm{z}-121$
By using these codes the alphabets can be converted to digital and hence to Binary form.

\section*{Types of Memory}

A computer memory is of two types
1. Primary Memory (Internal storage)
2. Secondary Memory (External storage)

\section*{Primary Memory:}

Primary memory is also called internal memory and is an important part of a computer. It is the main area in a computer where the data is stored. The stored data can be recalled instantly and correctly whenever desired. This memory can be quickly accessed by the CPU for reading or storing information. Primary memory is further classified into two types:
1. Random Access Memory (RAM)
2. Read- Only Memory (ROM)

\section*{Random Access Memory (RAM)}

RAM is also known as read/write memory as information can be read from and written onto it. RAM is a place in a computer that holds instructions for the computer, its programs and the data. The CPU can directly access the data from RAM almost immediately. However, the storage of data and instructions in RAM is temporary, till the time the computer is running. It disappears from RAM as soon as the power to the computer is switched off. i.e it is volatile memory.

\section*{Read- Only Memory (ROM)}

It is called Read-only memory as information can only be read from and not written or changed onto ROM. ROM is the _built-in memory of a computer. It stores some basic inputoutput instructions put by the manufacturer to operate the computer. The storage of data and
instructions in ROM is permanent. It does not depend on the power supply. i.e. it is nonvolatile memory.

\section*{Secondary memory:}

The primary memory which is faster (and hence expensive) is generally not sufficient for large storage of data. As a result, additional memory, called the -auxiliary or -secondary memory is used. It is also referred as --backup storage as it is used to store large volume of data on a permanent basis which can be transferred to the primary memory whenever required for processing. Data are stored in secondary storage in the same binary codes as in the main (primary memory) storage. Some of the devices of secondary storages are Floppy Disk, Hard Disk, CD-ROM, DVD and Flash drive.

\section*{1. Floppy Disk:}

It is also referred as -Diskette: and is made of flexible Vinyl material. It has a small hole on one side called -Right protect notch, which protects accidental writing/deleting the information from the disk. There is a hole in the centre through which the spindle of drive unit rotates the disk. The disks are available in two sizes of 5.25 and 3.5 inches and these could be either low density or high-density floppies. Storage capacity of floppies is measured in kilobytes (KB) and megabytes (MB). The details about the storage capacities of the floppies are presented below: Floppy Disk Storage Capacity Size (Diameter) Low Density 360 KB 5.25 inches High Density 1.2 MB 5.25 inches High Density 1.44 MB 3.5 inches extended 2.8 MB 3.5 inches.

\section*{2. Hard Disk:}

The hard disk can hold more information than the floppy disk and the retrieval of information from hard disk is faster when compared to floppies or tapes. A hard disk is fixed inside the CPU and its capacity ranges from 20 MB onwards. The hard disk is made up of a collection of discs (one below the other) known as platters on which the data is recorded. These platters are coated with magnetic material. It is less sensitive to external environmental disorders and hence the storage in hard disk is safe. A small hard disk might be as much as 25 times larger than a floppy disk. Storage Capacity of hard disks varies from 20 MB to several Gega bytes like $80 \mathrm{~GB}, 160 \mathrm{~GB}$.

\section*{3. CD-ROM:}

CD-ROM stands for Compact Disk-Read Only Memory. It is used to store a wide variety of information. Its main advantage is that it is portable and can hold a large
amount of data. The storage capacity of most CD-ROMs is approximately 650 MB or 700 MB. CD-ROMs have the following variations:
(i) CD-R (Compact disc Recordable): Data can be written onto it just once. The stored data can be read. Data once written onto it cannot be erased.
(ii) CD-RW (Compact disc Rewritable): It is also called erasable CD. Data once written onto it can be erased to write or record new information many times. To use a CD-ROM, a device called CD drive is needed.
4. DVD:

DVD stands for Digital Versatile Disc. It is similar to a CD-ROM, except that it can store larger amounts of data. The storage capacity of a DVD is at least 4.7MB. DVDs that can store up to 17 GBs are also available. Because of their capacity, DVDs are generally used to store a very large multimedia presentations and movies that combine high quality sound and graphics.

\section*{5. Flash Drive:}

It is a small, portable device that can be used to store, access and transfer data. Due to its small size, it is commonly called Pen drive. It is also called USB drive. We can read, write, copy, delete, and move data from computer to pen drive or pen drive to computer. It comes in various storage capacities of $2 \mathrm{~GB}, 4 \mathrm{~GB}, 8 \mathrm{~GB}$ etc. It is popular because it is easy to use and small enough to be carried in a pocket. This device is plugged into the USB port of the computer and the computer automatically detects this device.

\section*{HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE}

\section*{Hardware:}

The physical components of the computer are known as -Hardware. It refers to the objects that we can actually touch.

Ex: input and output devices, processors, circuits and the cables.

\section*{Software:}

Software is a program or set of instructions that causes the Hardware to function in a desired way. The basic difference between the Hardware and Software is just the same as that exists between TV and TV studio. Without TV studio (software) from where the programs are telecast, the TV (Hardware) is a dead machine.

There are five categories of software. They are:
1. Operating System
2. Translators
3. Utility programs

\section*{4. Application programs}

\section*{5. General purpose programs}

\section*{1. Operating System (OS):}

The software that manages the resources of a computer system and schedules its operation is called Operating system. The operating system acts as interface between the hardware and the user programs and facilitates the execution of programs. Generally the OS acts as an interface between the user and the Hardware of the computer. i.e. It is a bridge between the user and the Hardware.

The User interface provided by the OS can be character based or graphical.
CUI -- Character user Interface
GUI -- Graphical user Interface
CUI: It is operated with keyboard only. Ex: MS-DOS, UNIX
Disk Operating System (DOS): It was developed as early as 1980 by Bill Gates at the age of 19. It is suited for personal computers. Dos is a single user and single task operating system WINDOWS: It works with DOS and it supports single user and multitask system. It requires a powerful PC with a minimum RAM of 8 MB .

\section*{2. Translators:}

Computers can understand instructions only when they are written in their own language the machine language. Therefore, a program written in any other language should be translated into machine language. The software that translates the instructions of different languages is known as translators.

There are two types of translators. They are compilers and Interpreters.
$\checkmark$ A Compiler checks the entire user written program (known as the source program) and if it is error free, produces a complete program in machine language (known as object program). The source program is retained for possible modifications and corrections and the object program is loaded into the computer for execution. If the source program contains errors, the compilers produce a list of errors at the end of the execution of the program. i.e. a compiler translates the whole program before execution.
$\checkmark$ An interpreter does a similar job but in a different style. The interpreter translates one statement at a time and if it is error - free, executes. This continues till the last statement. Thus an interpreter translates or executes the first instruction before it goes to the second, while a compiler translates the whole program before execution.
The major difference between compiler and interpreter is
1. Error correction is very much simpler in the case of interpreter as it translates the statements in stages. The compiler produces an error list of the entire program at the end. 2. Interpreter takes more time for the execution of the program compared to compilers as it translates one statement at a time

\section*{Programming Languages:}

There are three types of programming languages.

\section*{1. Machine Languages}

Computers respond only to machine language. This language is in terms of binary codes $(0,1)$. I.e. all programs should be written with these codes, which are difficult, time consuming and leading to errors while writing the programs. There is no unique standard machine language. Rather there are many machine languages. These are machine dependent. These are referred as the first generation languages.

\section*{2. Assembly Languages}

It uses mnemonic codes rather than numeric codes (as in machine languages). Ex. Add or A is used as a symbol for addition. It requires translators to convert into machine language. Like machine language, writing program in assembly language is also time consuming. These are also machine dependent.

\section*{3. High Level Languages (HLL)}

These are referred as problem oriented languages (POL). These are referred as third generation languages. The advantages of these languages are
- The high level languages are convenient for writing programs as they can be written without any codes. These languages follow rules like English language.
- Because of their English like nature, less time is required to write a program.
- They are machine independent. A program written in any HLL can be run on computers of different types without any modifications.

Several High Level Languages which are in common use:
- FORTRAN : Formula Translation
- COBOL: Common Business Oriented Language
- BASIC: Beginner's All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code
- PROLOG: Programming in Logic
- ALGOL: Algorithmic Language

Utility Programs: These are pre-written programs supplied by the manufacturer for maintaining day to day activities of computer system.

Example: copy, sort, mailing, virus scanning software etc.,

\section*{4. Application Programs}

These are user written programs to do a specific job which can be changed to meet the individual needs. These programs are written in different languages such as BASIC or C or by using database packages like dBase, Oracle. Example: Payroll, Billing, Railway Reservation etc.

\section*{5. General Purpose Packages}

These packages are developed to suit the needs of research workers / scientists in different fields. These packages are categorized as:
i) Data Analysis
ii) ii) Word Processing
iii) iii) Spread Sheet
iv) iv) Graphics
v) v) Databases

\section*{Functions of Operating System}

Today most operating systems perform the following important functions:
1. Processor management: It manages the assignment of processor to different tasks being performed by the computer system.
2. Memory management: It manages the allocation of main memory and other storage areas to the system programmes as well as user programmes and data.
3. Input / Output management: It manages the co-ordination and assignment of different Input and Output devices while one or more programmes are executed.
4. File management: It allows all files to be easily changed and modified through the use of text editors or some other file manipulation routines.
5. Establishment and enforcement of a priority system: It determines and maintains the order in which jobs are to be executed in the computer system.
6. Interpretation of commands and instructions.
7. Facilitates easy communication between the computer system and the computer operator

\section*{Classification of Computers}

Computers are classified according to the storage capacity, speed and the purpose for which they are developed. These can be classified into three types:

\section*{1. Analog Computes}

\section*{2. Digital Computers}

\section*{3. Hybrid Computers}
1. Analog computers: They operate by measuring instead of counting. The name (derived from Greek word analog) denotes that the computer functions by establishing similarities between the two quantities. They are powerful tools for solving differential equations.
2. Digital Computers: These computers operate by counting. All quantities are expressed as discrete digits or numbers. These are useful for evaluating arithmetic expressions and manipulations of data.
3. Hybrid Computers: Computers which combine the features of analog and digital computers are known as Hybrid computers. A majority of the computers that are in use are digital. These computers were essentially developed for computations. Later, the developments in the computers led to the use of digital computers in variety of applications. Depending on the use of applications, the digital computers are classified into;
1) Special Purpose Computers
2) General Purpose Computers
1. Special Purpose Computers: These are developed with a specific purpose. Some of the areas where these computers are being used are - soil testing, drip irrigation, medical scanning, traffic signals, spacecraft, rocket technology etc.,
2. General Purpose Computers: These are developed to meet the requirements of several areas such as simulation, solving mathematical equations, payroll and personnel database. These computers are available in different sizes and capabilities and are further classified (based on memory, speed, and storage) as follows.
a) Super Computers
b) Mainframe Computers
c) Mini Computers
d) Micro

\section*{Computers}
a) Super Computers: These have extremely large storage capacities and computing speeds which are at least 10 times faster than other computers. These are used for large scale numerical problems in scientific and engineering disciplines such as electronics, weather forecasting etc. The first super computer was developed in U.S.A. by CRAY computers. In India the indigenous super computer was developed under the name Param.
b) Mainframe Computers: They also have large storage and high computing speed (but relatively lower than the super computers). They are used in applications like weather forecasting, space applications etc., they support a large number of terminals for use by a variety of users simultaneously, but are expensive
c) Mini Computers: It is a medium sized computer with moderate cost, available indigenously and used for large volume applications. It can serve multi-users simultaneously.
d) Micro Computers: A microcomputer is the smallest general purpose processing system. Micro computers are also referred as personal computers(PC). These are self-contained units and usually developed for use by one person at a time but can be linked to very large systems. They are cheap, easy to use even at homes and can be read for variety of applications from small to medium range. These are available in three models:
1. PC: Personal Computer
2. PC-XT: Personal computer with Extended Technology
3. PC-AT : Personal computer with Advanced Technology

\section*{PERSONAL COMPUTERS}

Personal Computer: A personal computer has a Monitor (VDU), a keyboard, Disk Drive (s), printer and CPU. The CPU of PC has a mother board with several chips mounted on a circuit board. The major components of the circuit board are: Microprocessor, RAM and ROM chips and other supporting circuits.

Microprocessor: The Microprocessor chip is like a brain of human being which contains circuits and registers to perform arithmetic, logic and control functions. i.e. it contains ALU and CU. These chips will be able to retrieve data from the input output devices, store, manipulate and process a byte of data at a time. There is an address bus which is built into these chips to determine the storage locations (of RAM) of the data and the instructions of the program.

Over the years, different microprocessors were developed and the first in the series is INTEL 8080. The other processors are 8088, 80286, 80386, 80486, Pentium I, II, III and Pentium 4. The Pentium 4 can execute any piece of code that ran on the original 8088, but it does it about 5000 times faster.

Clock Speed: The speed with which the instruction is executed or number of pulses per second is called the clock speed. It is measured in terms of million pulses per second.

Note: The input, output and secondary storage units like floppy drives, keyboard, mouse, etc., are called peripherals.

\section*{Working with personal computers}

Drives of the computer: A computer can have Floppy Disk Drive along with Hard Disk drives in the system. These are referred as follows:

\begin{tabular}{ll} 
Floppy Disk Drive & $: \mathbf{A}$ or B \\
Hard Disk & $: \mathbf{C}$
\end{tabular}

\section*{Booting of the Computer}

Booting imply activating the computer for working. Thus, when the computer is switched on, the operating system residing in the floppy or in the hard disk is transferred into the primary memory. After this, the computer is ready to accept the commands at user terminal. If OS does not exist either in floppy drive or in the hard disk drive, non-system or disk error is flashed on the screen. The booting of the computer is carried out with software which resides on ROM chip called BIOS (Basic Input Output System). Thus when a PC with system disk either in Hard-Disk Drive or Floppy Drive is switched on, the screen finally displays one of the following symbols with a blinking cursor at its end:
a) A: $\backslash>$ This imply that the computer is booted through Floppy drive 'A' and is ready to accept DOS commands. The symbol $-1>$ is referred as DOS prompt from where DOS commands can be entered.
b) C :|> It imply that the PC is booted through the Hard-Disk Drive 'C'.

Booting is essential whenever the system is locked or switched-off. A PC can be booted through two ways:
a) Cold Booting
b) Warm Booting.
a) Cold Booting: It is only switching OFF the system and after some time again switching ON.
b) Warm Booting: It is carried out by pressing the following three keys simultaneously:

Ctrl + Alt + Del. It is preferable to cold booting as it safeguards the system from sudden power fluctuations resulting out of switching ON and OFF the system.

\section*{MS-DOS}

MS-DOS is a collection of programs and other files. It is a single user and single programming environment. MS-DOS is designed to provide a method of organizing and using the information stored on disks, application programs, system programs and the computer itself.
Files and File names: A file is a collection of related information. The files should have suitable names for their identification in later use. Rules for naming the files:
1. File names should be of one to eight characters in length with an option of one to three character extension
2. File names can include any one of the following characters: A to Z (or a to z ) 0 to $9, \$, \&$, \#, @. \%, ( ), \{ \}. The characters which are not allowed are: :,; + / $*$ as these have special meaning
3. A period (.) is used to separate the first part of a file name from the extension. (LETTER.TXT etc.,)
4. When a file name includes an extension, it should be referred along with its extension and not only with the first part
5. Reserved devices names are not allowed. (COMMAND.COM, DATE, etc.,

\section*{Types of files in DOS}

There are different types of files you can create in your computer, according to the usage. To differentiate each file, the computer will give an extension to identify the different types of files you have created.

Executable Files: The files with extension of either .COM or .EXE are called executable files. These files are directly executed by typing their names (without the extension) by the computer. A file with .COM extension refers to COMMAND file name and the other with .EXE extension refers EXECUTABLE program file. Batch Files: the file containing a series of DOS commands, which are executed automatically one at a time in the order entered, is known as the batch file. A batch file has the extension .BAT. If the batch file is given a special name AUTOEXEC.BAT, it is automatically executed when the computer is switched on or during booting.

Backup Files: These are backup files of a file and have extension. These files are such that their contents cannot be altered (edited). These files are created while working with WORDSTAR package for typing a document.

System Files: These are program files developed for system control. They have system extension. Directory: which means that they encrypt a collection of files, size, date and time of creation of files? The relation between files, directories and disk is similar to the relation between papers, filing folders and filling cabinets. Just as a cabinet contain papers and other folders, a directory may contain directories also. The main directory of a drive is called Root Directory into which several directories and sub-directories may exist.

\section*{Types of DOS commands}

There are two types of commands:
i) internal
ii) external

\section*{Internal DOS commands:}

Internal commands are those commands which manage files. They are loaded into the memory of the PC when PC is booted. These are stored in a large file with file name COMMAND.COM, when a PC is booted.
1. DIR: Dir displays continuously the directory of file names, file size, date and time of creation C: $\backslash>$ dir a: This command displays the list of files and directories from the drive A i.e. the floppy drive. It can be specified with two options:
i) Dir/p: It pauses the listing of the directory whenever the screen is full. The next screen load of files can be displayed by pressing any key.
ii) Dir/w: displays the files of the directory in a five column format. Only file names and their extensions will be displayed without the date and time of creation. The total number of files and remaining bytes are listed. In addition, DIR can also be specified with wildcard characters (such as * or?) to list files sharing a common element in the file name or extension. Eg: DIR STATS.*: lists all files with STATS and other combinations along with the extensions.
\$ DIR *.COM : lists all files with extension .COM
$\$$ DEL: Deletes a specified file.
\$ Syntax: DEL \{filename\}
$\$$ Del stats deletes the file -stats
$\$$ Del stats.* deletes all extensions of the file -stats.

\section*{Computer viruses and Vaccines:}

A VIRUS is a set of instructions (or program) or software prepared to destroy a package and data.

A virus kills data and program files. Although the purpose for developing such software is not known, they appear to be basically developed for a check against the piracy of program packages.

\section*{Functioning of viruses:}

Viruses reside in executable files such as .COM or .EXE. Thus when PC is switched on, the virus enters the RAM through .COM (COMMAND.COM) file and starts destructive work of killing data and program files. Whenever the PC is switched off, they again go back to the executable files.

More than 1000 computer viruses have been identified. They are classified as:
i) File Allocation Table (FAT) based viruses
ii) Key board viruses
iii) File based viruses Some of the well known viruses are:

VACCINE: It is software developed for removing the viruses.
In DOS version, there are in-built programs to guard against computer viruses. These are anti-virus programs for both DOS and WINDOWS and a memory resident virus-safe program that guards against the introduction of files that may be affected by virus. Some of the anti-virus vaccines are: NASHSOFT, UTSCAN, AVG, AVIRA, MECCAF etc.

\section*{WINDOWS}

Salient features of Windows Operating System:
1. It converts the plain character based user interface provided by DOS into a Graphical User Interface(GUI) such as pictures, symbols and words on your screen that can be controlled by the mouse.
2. It provides a multitasking capabilities to the PC.
3. It supports long file name rather than the limited 8 characters with extension of three letter file name (8:3) as used by DOS. In Windows file name can have name up to 255 characters long.
4. Windows owes its name to the fact that it runs each program or document or application in its own separate window.
5. Windows have the facility of accessories such as Word pad, Note pad, Calculator and Paint.
6. User can paste portion of one document into another by utilizing more advanced document linking features called Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE), Object Linking and Embedding (OLE).
7. It provides a big facility of plug and play standard. It allows user to simply plug a new board such as a video, audio or network card into the computer without having a set of switches or making other settings
8. If a program crashes, then it will display fault error message about its crash and you can eliminate the crashed program from the task list without affecting other running applications.

Parts of a window screen: Desktop: The desktop is the on-screen work area on which Windows, Icons, menus and dialog boxes appear. The Desktop can have several components.

\section*{Components of the Desktop:}

\footnotetext{
- Icons
}
- Taskbar

Icons: Icon is a small image that represents a file, folder or program. The text below each icon is the name of the Icon. When we rest the mouse pointer on an icon, a rectangular box appears. This is referred to as Tooltip. It gives a brief description of the Icon. By default, there will be $4-5$ icons on the desktop. They are:
- My Computer
- My documents
- Internet Explorer
- Recycle bin etc.

My Computer: This is the icon which represents all the files and folders which can be used in the system. It is used to access the drives, folders and files on the computer. i.e. Floppy drive(A), Local C, D, E, Printer, Control panel etc.

My Documents: This is the default storage location for the files created in the windows.
Internet Explorer: This is an application used to browse the internet. Recycle bin: This is a folder that stores all the files and folders deleted from windows temporarily, which can be restored again if needed

\section*{Anatomy of a Window:}

The window on a desktop is the rectangular area displaying content independently of other areas of the screen. The different parts of a window are the Title bar, Menu bar, the Toolbar, and the min, max and close buttons. These tools are used to manage the window and the components within it.

Title bar-This is the title of the window, like your name at the top of a piece of paper. The Title bar is also the handle for the window. If you click and hold the mouse button down on the title bar, you can move it around the screen.

Minimize - To have a window take the minimum amount of desktop space possible, click the minimize button. This drops the window into the Task bar like a piece of paper going into a drawer. The Task bar will show the task whether or not the window is minimized.

Maximize $\square$ To have a window take the maximum desktop space, click the maximize button. This stretches the window out like an architect's floor plan being rolled out over the desk.

Restore - A maximized window will cover over all the other windows and icons on the desktop. The Restore button places the window back so that more than one window can display at a time.

Close (X) - When done with a window, you can have it taken completely off the desktop by closing it. Use the X button to do this.

Menu bar: The Menu bar displays a list of commands that can be used to perform various tasks. (This will be below the Title bar). Menu items are commands within the menu bar that allow choosing of functions and tasks.

Tool bar: contains a set of buttons for frequently used commands. Scroll Bars: On the bottom and right edges of a window we find scroll bars. They are used to pan across the information in the window, when we have information which won't fit into the window. The Status Bar: The Status bar appears at the very bottom of the window and provides such information as the cursor position, current page number, the number of words in the document etc.

\section*{Booting in Windows:}
- When the computer is switched on, the BIOS is activated.
- The BIOS present in ROM searches for the operating system and drives.
- If there is no OS, it shows non-system or disk error.
- If OS is present, then it transfers the OS from ROM to RAM.
- Then the desktop is displayed on the monitor.

\section*{WINDOWS EXPLORER}

\section*{WORD PROCESSING}

Definition: Word-processing is essentially typing, editing, and manipulation of a document in a desired form.

\section*{Units of the Document:}

Since word-processing is concerned with preparation of a document (in a desired form), it is essential to know the units of the document:
1. Character: It refers to the alphabets, numerical digits, punctuations and other special symbols which are commonly used in the text.
2. Word: A word is group of characters that are separated from other group of characters by some delimiters like, comma, full stop and space.
3. Sentence: A sentence is a group of words preceded and followed by appropriate delimiting characters.
4. Paragraph: It is a group of one or more sentences, paragraphs are separated by leaving blank lines between them.
5. Pages: It is the amount of text that can be printed on one page of a paper.
6. Chapters: It is a collection of pages
7. Documents and files: It is a group of chapters. Usually, a complete document may be very short such as a memo (or letter) or very long such as a book consisting of several chapters. These documents are referred as Files.

\section*{Features of Word-processing}
1. Word-wrap
2. cursor control
3. editing
4. formatting
5. spell-check
6. thesaurus
7. macros
8. printing
9. file management
10. mail merge printing
1. Word-wrap: In word-processing packages, the text can be continuously typed and the computer automatically starts a fresh line when a line is filled up. As soon as the length of a sentence exceeds the right margin, the corresponding word is automatically adjusted in the following line. This is called word-wrap. A paragraph is created only when carriage control is externally given for a sentence.
2. Cursor Control: The four directional keys of the keyboard ( ) helps in locating the text for editing in much the similar manner as that of a pointer or pencil.
3. Editing: Words or lines can be entered (inserted) or deleted in any part of the text with proper alignment. Similarly, there is a facility to recover 'the text which is deleted by mistake or accidentally. Another important facility is that any word 'can be replaced by a new word throughout the file, wherever the old word appears. In addition to these, a block of text (which is frequently used) can be prepared and moved or copied wherever desired in the file.
4. Formatting: The text formatting refers to the way the text is desired to appear on a page. This includes following functions;
\$ setting left and right margins
\$ paragraph settings
\$ line spacing
\$ selecting font specifications such as underline, bold, italics, superscripts and subscripts
\$ setting foot-notes
\$ number of lines per page
\$ printing page numbers and headings for Header ${ }^{\text {c }}$ and Footer
\$ table of contents
$\$$ indexing the text
5. Spell-checker: Word-processing packages provide checking of spellings facility
6. Thesaurus: It provides synonyms (or words with similar meanings)
7. Macros: A macro is a character or word that represents a series of keystrokes. The ability to define macros allows us to save a lot of time by replacing common combinations of keystrokes.
8. Printing: It gives a hard copy of the text. The printing can be controlled after printing a fixed number of pages or can be resumed from any specified page number.
9. File management: This facility allows to create, delete, move and search for files.
10. Mail merge printing: This facility helps in printing same original letter with different addresses, so that each letter is original and not a carbon copy.

1. Rest the mouse pointer over the row above which you want to insert the new row.
2. On the Insert menu, click rows. A row is inserted and the existing row moves down after the new row. Similarly, to insert a column,
1. Rest the mouse pointer over the column before which you want to insert the new Column.
2. On the Insert menu, click columns. Changing Row height and Column width: By default, every row is 12.75 points high and every column is 8.43 characters wide. As you fill it with data, however you have to change the size of rows \& columns so that it is fitted to the length of the data.

\section*{To resize a column:}
1. Rest the mouse pointer on the column boundary on the right side.
2. The shape of the mouse pointer changes then
3. Drag the boundary until the required width is obtained.
(OR)
1. The column which is to be adjusted is made active by clicking on column letter.
2. The column option is selected from the Format menu.
3. Click on the width option. A dialogue box is displayed.
4. Type in the required size of the column in the text box column width. Similarly, Row height can also be adjusted by selecting the rows. Sorting: Highlight the cells that should be sorted and click the sort Ascending (A-Z) button or Sort Descending (Z-A) button found on the Standard toolbar.

\section*{Printing:}

To print the worksheet, select File $\square$ Print from the Menu bar (or) click on the Print button from the Standard Toolbar (or) follow the key sequence Ctrl + p Inserting Page breaks:

To set the page breaks within the worksheet, select the row you want to appear just below the page break by clicking the row's label. Then choose Insert $\square$ page break from the Menu bar. When you attempt to print a worksheet Excel automatically inserts page breaks view. File menu $\square$ page break preview The page breaks are shown in dasher lines. If the automatic allocation of page breaks does not satisfy with your requirements, you can add the page breaks in the required space. Step 1: select a cell above which the page break is needed. After that, select the full row until the data in the sheet exists. Step 2: select insert $\square$ page break Saving a workbook: To save a workbook, $\square$ File $\square$ Save (or) $\square \mathrm{Ctrl}+\mathrm{S}$ (or) $\square$ click on the save button on the Tool bar. Save dialogue box appears. Type the name and click Save.

\section*{Formulas:}

In Excel. One of the powerful features is formulas. A formula is an equation that is used to perform calculations on data in a worksheet. We can use formula to perform Mathematical, Statistical and date/time operations on a single value or a set of values by using operators. The cells in which formulas are stored, display the result of the calculation and not the formula. In Excel, a formula starts with an equal (=) sign and should be followed by the operation to be performed. We can use any number of operators in a single formula. MSExcel evaluates the formula according to the order of precedence of the operators.

Operator Operation Order of precedence ( ) Bracket 1 ^ Exponentiation 2 *, / Multiplication, Division, Addition, Subtraction and Concatenation $=><$ Comparisons 6

\section*{Examples of the formula expressions:}
1. Suppose the values in the cells B2, C2, D2 are 34, 28, 56 respectively. To add these values and to have the result in the cell F2,
Step i) Click on the cell in which total marks is to be displayed, i.e F2
ii) Type $=($ B2 + C2 + D2 $) \|$
iii) Press Enter .The value -118 will be displayed in F2.

Suppose the value of the cell B6 is 78345 . Divide the value by 5 and have it in the cell E6: Step i) Click the cell E6.
ii) Type $-=(\mathrm{B} 6 / 5)-\quad$ iii) Press Enter The value -15669 will be displayed in the cell E6. 3. Multiply the value 549 of the cell C3 with the value 43 of the cell F3 and have the result in the cell I3.

Step i) Click the cell I3
ii) Type = (C3 * F3)
iii) Press Enter the result 23607 will be displayed in the cell I3.

Functions:
A function is a built-in, readymade and frequently used formula that accepts data, perform calculations and returns results. To enter a function in a cell,
1. Click the cell in which you want the result of the function to be displayed.
2. Type = sign.
3. Type the function name.
4. Type the cell range and other arguments within brackets.
5. Press Enter. Note : To specify a range of cells, a colon (:) is used between the first and last cell addresses. Example: = Average (B1: B10). Calculates the average of the values in the cells B1 to B10 Mathematical functions with syntax and purpose:
i) Sum( number 1 , number $2, \ldots$ ) gives the sum of the values in a specified range
ii) $\quad \mathrm{Abs}$ (number) gives the absolute value of the number
iii) Fact( number ) gives the factorial of the number
iv) Sqrt (number) gives the square root of the number
v) Log(number) gives the logarithm of the number Statistical functions with syntax and purpose:
a. Average(range of cells) calculates the average of the values in a specified range
b. Stdev (range of cells) calculates the standard deviation of the given data
c. Mean( range of cells) calculates the mean of the given data
d. Max( range of cells) gives the maximum value within the range specified count() counts how many numbers are there in the list of arguments

\section*{Function Wizard:}

\section*{Pie Chart:}

A Pie chart is used to represent the distribution of a categorical data. In this chart, a circle is divided into sectors, whose area is proportional to the frequencies or percentages of cases under various categories. Data on each variable is entered in the Excel worksheet in a row or column with suitable headings. Then we select the data of the first series and choose pie chart and proceed as per the options given in the dialogue box. A separate chart pie chart should be drawn for each data set.

Statistical Analysis Tools Microsoft Excel provides a set of data analysis tools called the Analysis Tool Pak- that you can use to save steps when you develop complex statistical or engineering analyses. You provide the data and parameters for each analysis; the tool uses the appropriate statistical or engineering macro functions and then displays the results in an output table. Some tools generate charts in addition to output tables. Related to worksheet functions, Excel provides many other statistical, financial, and engineering worksheet functions. Some of the statistical functions are built-in and others become available when you install the Analysis Tool Pak. Accessing the data analysis tools: The Analysis Tool Pak includes the tools described below. To access these tools, click Data Analysis on the Tools menu. If the Data Analysis command is not available, you need to load the Analysis Tool Pak add-in program.

Analysis Tools: ANOVA: Single factor ANOVA: Two-Factor with replication ANOVA: Two-Factor without replication Correlation Covariance Descriptive statistics F-test two-
sample for variances Histogram Regression t -test: two sample assuming equal variances t test: two sample assuming unequal variances Z-test: two samples for means

\section*{Steps to use Analysis Tools:}

\section*{Networking and Internet}

A network is an arrangement that enables two or more computers to communicate (talk) to each other.

\section*{Types of Networks}

Networks can range from a small group of computers linked together in a class room to thousands of computers linked together across the globe. Depending on the geographical location, networks can be classified as
a. LAN ( Local Area Network)
b. MAN ( Metropolitan Area Network)
c. WAN (Wide Area Network)

Local Area Network: If a network is confined to a single location, typically a building, it is called a LAN. Example: Set of interconnected computers within an office.

Metropolitan Area Network: A metropolitan area network is a network that is larger than a LAN, it connects the computers distributed across multiple buildings. Example: the computers in all branches of an office within a city.

Wide Area Network: When a network is located over wide areas such as cities, states, countries or even continents, it is called a WAN. Example :
i. Computers in different branches of a Globalised company.

\section*{Internet}

The internet is a global connection of computers. These computers are connected via a huge network of telecommunication links. The internet allows you to access to a whole resource of data and information stored at different sites (called hosts) and locations around the world. The communication links which inter connect each host computer use a common
method of transmission known as TCP/IP, which stands for Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol.

\section*{Internet connection helps us to:}
1. Read information on a wide range of topics
2. Send or receive E-mail
3. Down load useful programs such as virus detectors, file compression, decompression utility etc.,
4. Share your opinions and your knowledge on a variety of topics through various new groups.
5. Chat with other people anywhere in the world
6. View interesting video's listen to music or wander through a 3-D world.

\section*{Requirements for connecting to the Internet:}
a) Modem: A modem is a peripheral device that allows a computer to connect and communicate with other computers. Modem stands for Modulator Demodulator.
b) Web Browser: A browser is a software program that is necessary in order to view web pages on the web. Ex: Internet Explorer, Netscape Navigator, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft outlook express etc.
c) Telephone line: A telephone line is required to transfer data from one computer to another. The computer is connected to a modem, which, in turn, connected to a telephone line.
d) Subscription with Internet service provider (ISP): ISP's are companies that provide access to the internet. We need subscription with any ISP to get an Internet connection. Some of the ISPs in India are VSNL, MTNL, Sify, Specrta Net etc. e)
e) World Wide Web (WWW): It refers to the collection of information accessible on the internet. The web is similar to a library. It consists of millions and millions of pages of text, pictures, sounds and animation on various topics. These pages, called web pages are stored on different computers that are connected to the internet. The web pages have links between them i.e when we click a certain word or picture in a page, it will take us to another page. These words or pictures that help to move from one page to another are called hyperlinks. A collection of related web pages is known as a web site. A web site can be accessed by means of a unique name assigned to it. Internet was initially designed for the transmission of text basing on the protocols mentioned. In order to transmit a graphically designed web page complete with pictures, embedded sound and animation a special language was designed which is referred to as Hyper Text Mark up

Language (HTML). HTML uses special text codes to define the various elements of a web page. The WWW support a protocol called Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP). All internet servers cannot support HTTP and so the web can be regarded as a subset of the larger internet. HTTP provides a method of transmitting a professionally laid out page over the text based internet. Uniform Resource Locator: (URL): Each web site has a unique address commonly referred to as a URL. A URL specifies the exact location of the web page on the internet.

\section*{E-Mail}

E-mail or electronic mail is a service for sending or receiving messages electronically through a computer network. The electronic mail uses various technologies that support electronic transmission of text, data and graphics.

\section*{Some of the features of $\boldsymbol{E}$-mail are}
\$ It is much faster than the normal mail. Messages can be sent within a matter of seconds to any part in the world.

It can be sent to many people at the same time
