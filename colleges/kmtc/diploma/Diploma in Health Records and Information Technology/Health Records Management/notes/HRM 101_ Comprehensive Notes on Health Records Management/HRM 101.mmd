\section*{UNIT 1}

\section*{INTRODUCTION TO HEALTH RECORDS MANAGEMENT}

The health record is a written collection of information about a patient. It originates from the patient's first encounter or treatment at a hospital, health post or other primary health care centre.

The health record is thus a record of all the procedures carried out on that patient, while he is in the hospital or under treatment at a clinic or centre. It should contain the past medical history of the patient, including opinions, investigations and other details relevant to the health of the patient.

You might also hear patients referred to as 'clients' in certain settings. Sometimes these words are used interchangeably.

As a document it may appear in many shapes and sizes with varied information related to the care of the patient recorded by many health care professionals in many ways. In physical appearance, it consists of a number of sheets of paper or cards and may be placed in a cover or envelope.

In more advanced health care facilities, the information may be recorded digitally in a computer; the sheets of paper scanned onto optical media or the actual sheets may be microfilmed. (Microfilming is similar to taking a picture of the paper and storing it on a film strip.)

Also through data entry on a database where they are different types of databases i.e. MySQL and access

Edna Huffman (1994), one of the first medical record professionals in the U.S., defined a health record as "a compilation of pertinent facts of a patient's life and health history, including past and present illness (es) and treatment(s), written by the health professionals contributing to that patient's care. The health record must be compiled in a timely manner and contain sufficient data to identify the patient, support the diagnosis, justify the treatment, and accurately document the results."

The actual physical record should be of an acceptable size and standardized on suitable forms, as far as possible to enable interchange of information, from hospital to hospital, hospital to health centre, hospital to general practitioner or other primary health worker.

The record must contain forms approved by the facility and the folder itself should be of a standard weight.

It is also important to note difference between a medical record and a health record
Medical record: it is a document created by a health profession concerning diagnostic procedures done on any client visiting the health facility

Examples:
- X-ray films,
- Temperature pulse respiration chart - filled by a nurse / clinician monitoring those elements above either four times per day or thrice,
- Cardiograph
- Encephalogram record
- C-T scan image (computer tomography image)

Health record: it is a general term referring to all documents created in a health facility concerning clients / patients visiting the health facility including:
- Counselling documentations
- Maternity records where the B1 are generated
- X-ray films

Point to note: all pregnant mothers attending check-ups clinics are not patients
This is where health professionals prefer to call all people visiting the health facility for one reason or another as a client before undergoing any diagnostic procedure for approval to be called a patient.

The hospital or facility health professionals assist in creating any health record by extracting information from clients thus the owner of information on a medical he or she is the client but the physical health record it is for the government, but in private hospitals it is for the hospital

\section*{HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF HEALTH RECORDS DISCIPLINE}

\section*{Learning Objectives}

The learner should be able to:-
1. Define health records
2. Give a historical background of health records discipline
3. Define a health records department
4. Enumerate the functions of a health records and information department
5. Explain the various functions of a health records and information department

\section*{Definition:}

A health record is any written document about a patient in a professional relationship with a doctor.

It is a single repository data of a patient.

\section*{Historical Background}

The history of Health Records runs parallel with the history of medicine. Records are necessary for the practice of medicine as medications are for effective treatment, and they seem to have been made from earliest antiquity.

The first real physician of health records in Egypt is Imhotep. He lived in the pyramid age (about $3,000-2500 \mathrm{BC}$ ) and was grand vizier, chief architect, and royal medical adviser to a Pharaoh of the $29^{\text {th }}$ century before Christ. Imhotep has been credited with the authorship of the Edwin Smith Papyrus. This papyrus is one of the most valuable ancient medical documents that has come down to us and appears to have been copied about 1600 BC from an earlier original. This papyrus is a roll over 15 feet by about 3 inches wide and is made up of 12 sheets of the usual size. It is written on both sides and consists of 48 cases of Clinical Surgery.

It had information on conditions like gout and tumours

In Greece Hippocrates, known as the "father of medicine" was born about 460 BC. He was the first to cast out superstition and to practice medicine on scientific principles. He was the author of the Hippocratic Oath, which is pledged by physicians and which, states in part:
"Whatsoever in my practice or not in my practice, I shall see or hear amid the lives of men which ought not to be noised abroad- as to this I shall keep silence, holding such things unfitted to be spoken".

It was short but it captured many things that surround patient care information i.e. health records professional ethics, confidentiality, disclosure, security of patient information, ownership of a health record etc.

Thus originated the privacy of all information given to physicians by patients, eventually the Health Records per see was, also considered as privileged communication. Hippocrates kept detailed case reports of his patients.

In the $18{ }^{\text {th }}$ Century, Benjamin Franklin was one of the first leaders in the movement to establish the first incorporated hospital within the United States. This institution was known as Pennsylvania in 1751. Franklin served as secretary of the hospital, and many of its earliest records are in his handwriting.

In the $19{ }^{\text {th }}$ Century in 1821 the famous Massachusetts General Hospital Boston opened. Is has the distinction of having a complete file of clinical records, with all cases catalogued, dating from the day it opened.

In the $20^{\text {th }}$ Century, it was not until the beginning of this era that medical records received serious consideration by other types of hospitals and especially by hospitals and medical associations.

In 902 the American Hospital Association discussed Health Records for the first time at a convention.

In 1948 Health Records Association was started in Britain.
In 1967 the Department of Health Records was started in Kenya at Kenyatta National Hospital, Nairobi.

In 1978 the Health Records and Information Technician Program was started at the Medical Training College, Nairobi.

In 1990, the Health records and information officers program was started at the medical training college, Nairobi.

\section*{PURPOSE OF THE HEALTH RECORD}

As indicated above a good complete health record should encompass all information about a patient's health, ill health, treatment over a period of time and patient status at discharge. Health records are kept for:
- communication purposes
- continuity of patient care/ treatment
- evaluation of patient care
- monitoring and evaluation of health systems
- medico-legal purposes
- statistical purposes
- research
- Education.
- historical purposes

\section*{Communication purposes}

Health records are kept initially for communication between persons responsible for the care of the patients present and future needs. Many health professionals often see a patient. In a hospital the registration entails collection of identification information which also includes the patient's financial status. Only those people that actually treat the patient should document in the patient record. Some of these people include:
- consultants, physicians, surgeons, obstetricians
- nurses
- physiotherapist
- occupational therapists
- medical social workers
- laboratory technologists
- dieticians
- medical students
- Radiologists, etc.

Medical record staff will have access to the record to ensure that all documents are appropriately filed and organized and may also perform quality audits or research as requested by the facility or other agency.

\section*{Continuity of patient care / Treatment}

The patient may be readmitted to the same or another hospital or visit a clinic where all his past medical history should be available for assessment in the light of their current problem. It is vital that the primary health worker, who is responsible for the patient as a whole, should receive information about a patient's hospitalisation as soon as possible after the patient is discharged from hospital.

The main function of the health record department in a hospital or clinic, in this context, is as a service area, that is, medical records should be produced for patient care at all times and as quickly as possible. Also, discharge summaries and letters must be processed so that people outside the hospital may be informed of the patient's progress and their continued management after discharge.

\section*{Evaluation of patient care}

In any setting in which an individual puts the responsibility for their health and well-being into the hands of others, there should be some mechanism that enables evaluation of the standard of care being given. In some countries, hospital medicine is evaluated by an 'accreditation' system. Surveys of each hospital are made and hospitals given 'accreditation' by a Board for a limited number of years, depending on the standard which they reach. Also, in some countries, the health record services of a hospital must meet predetermined standards.
The health records is first and foremost of value in the present and future treatment of the patient.

\section*{Medico-legal}

Occasionally, health or medical records are used to substantiate substandard care and are then used to find justice and fair judgement in court rulings. This happens with regularity in the U.S., England and Australia, Kenya and others.

The record also, however, protects the patients by documenting all injuries and diseases or conditions in the record so that there is no confusion about what happened to the patient.

\section*{Statistical purposes}

Statistics are collected in hospitals, clinics and in primary health care centres. They may be used to tabulate numbers of diseases, surgical procedures and incidence of recovery after certain treatments; to assess areas which the hospital or clinic serves by collecting demographic details; or for public health or epidemiology. The morbidity and mortality statistics collected are used in planning health services activities, decision making, supply of drugs \& equipment ,staffing and day today running of the institutions.

\section*{Research}

In the past, accurate recording of observation in the health record would lead to accurate information required for research, but demographic and epidemiological information contained in the record is more often used today for purposes. The MOH (Ministry of Health) will use data reported from medical records through the current HMIS reporting structure to compare diseases and conditions across hospitals in the country and, in turn, will report data to the World Health Organization for comparisons throughout the world. The facility where the data is collected should also use the information to improve patient's care and also to monitor their progress closely for example:
- The cohort registers to monitor clients progress in quarters especially the HIV infected and HIV Exposed infants (HEI) ,
- Inpatient master index etc.

\section*{Education}

Health records can be used as an education tool or instrument. When the quality of health records is high the task of a learner is simplified and verse visa when the quality is poor the learners task is made more difficult and his progress is there for impended. The physician interested in a case may use the information from the records teach his students especially records created through clinophotography: these photographs taken during collecting information on physical changes and appearance especially when a client undergoes a plastic surgery ,unique skin diseases and other abnormalities encountered etc. .

Photos are stored for education purposes

The two photographs above showing Inflammatory breast carcinoma

\section*{Historical purposes}

The record acts as a sample of the type of patient care and method of treatment used at a particular point in time. Because all information is recorded in the record, those treating the patient can go back to earlier visits to see previous methods of treatment. Patients themselves can also access their records to verify dates of visits and treatments they have received.

\section*{Administrative Purposes}

Complete health records mean increased and deficient to the patient and to the public, these will help to avoid vexation, litigation, fair settlement of claims and capacity to answer enquiries on how the institution work. Equally complete health records will assist the administrators in the smooth running of the institution.

\section*{ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE OF A HEALTH RECORDS DEPARTMENT}

Since the department has a variety of functions, it is necessary to organize the department into functions with employees assigned to each function. Or in small facilities, several of the functions may be performed by one or two employees. However, an organization chart for a medical record department may look like this:

\section*{Medical Records Org Chart}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_17_60afc56b7f70eef0d001g-010.jpg?height=641&width=1146&top_left_y=802&top_left_x=302)

The person in charge of the department may be called a "director," "manager," or "coordinator." The number of staff or employees in each department will vary by the size of the facility and the numbers of patients seen in the facility. Some departments may have thirty (30) employees including managers and supervisors and others may have ten (10) or even fifty (50). Some large hospitals in other countries have as many as 100 employees. The number of employees may also vary based on whether the facility has a computer system or is using paper medical records. In a computerized system, manual retrieval of records is not necessary.

Organization charts will also look different in different facilities but it is recommended that the director or manager of the department report to an administrative official. It is also recommended that patient/client registration function report to the Director of Medical Records.

\section*{1. RECEPTION}

This is the reception of patients when they arrive in a health care facility. In this area the patient/client is greeted and welcomed to the hospital.

\section*{2. REGISTRATION}

Registration is recording of identification details mostly social on documents needed for any attendance

\section*{3. ADMISSION}

The same identification details recorded during registration is used and the ward number added on the form.

\section*{4. DISCHARGE}

This is a procedure carried out when a patient is supposed to leave the hospital after treatment.

\section*{5. Appointments}

Patients are asked to report to the various clinics on certain time and dates ready to be seen.

\section*{6. FILING}

Is a way of arranging the documents in a prescribed order or in systematic manner.

\section*{7. TRACING}

This is monitoring the movements of all the documents and their whereabouts.

\section*{8. CLINIC PREPARATION}

This is getting ready all the documents -48 hours in advance before a patient attends a clinic.

\section*{9. FOLLOW-UP OF PATIENTS}

There are some patients who still need to be monitored after they have been discharged from the hospital such as psychiatric, cancer cases etc.

\section*{10. CODING AND INDEXING}

Diseases and operations and other procedures in medicines need to be coded and indexed using the international classification of diseases, ICD and the international classification of procedures in medicine ICPM (WHO).

\section*{11. COLLECTION, TABULATION, ANALYSIS, INTERPRETATION AND DISSEMINATION OF DATA}

Raw data collected form health records are put in tables, analysed interpreted and forwarded to the users.

\section*{12. MAINTENANCE OF HEALTH RECORDS EQUIPMENT}

All the equipment used in a health records department must be maintained by the health records and information technician.

\section*{13. MAINTAIN CONFIDENTIALITY}

All the information in a health records document is confidential and should not be handled by unauthorised persons.

\section*{14. MANAGE SPECIAL HEALTH RECORDS}

There are special health records that are initiated and handled differently from other records, namely:-
(a) Psychiatric records
(b) Tuberculosis records
(c) Maternity records
(d) Sexually Transmitted diseases records
(e) HIV/AIDS

\section*{15. DESIGN MEDICAL FORMS}

All medical forms are supposed to be designed by the health records and information technician in consultation with the users

\section*{16. ENSURE QUALITY ASSURANCE OF HEALTH RECORDS}

The quality of the record will reflect the type of health care being rendered to the patient/ client.

\section*{CHAPTER TWO}

\section*{THE UNIT HEALTH RECORDS SYSTEM}

\section*{INTRODUCTION}

This is a Health Records system where one patient is given one number for the rest of his stay or attendance in one hospital.

\section*{Learning objectives}

Students should be able to:-
1. Define the unit systems
2. Describe the health unit system
3. Initiate the unit record
4. Prevent the duplication of the unit number
5. Describe the contents of the unit health records.

The unit system is a health records system in which all health records notes relating to one patient are contained in one case folder- the patient is the unit.

\section*{Initiation of the unit system}

The change from the old system of numbering to the unit system presents no difficulties.
From any given day it is simply necessary to assign a unit number to every patient attending for the first time. Thereafter, a six digit range of numbers is normally used ranging from 1 to 999,999 . Some health records officers prefer to insert zeroes at the beginning i.e. 000,001 but this arrangement is quite optional. When an old patient attends or is admitted at the first time his old notes are filed at the back of his new unit folder under the new unit number. Only the old records of the patients who present themselves after the appointed day are brought forward in this way the others, remaining in the old file under their original identification number. A tracer card should be replaced where the old record was indicating the new unit number.

\section*{Prevention of duplication}

Duplication in the use of unit numbers can be prevented:-
a) Either by not giving the same number to two patients
b) Not giving the same patient more than one number

In addition to the above the patient can be asked whether he has attended the hospital previously during registration. Whether the patient says yes or no a cross checking can be done through the patient master index to ascertain this.

\section*{The unit number register}

From the foregoing comments the importance of the unit system will be appreciated if the unit number register is maintained. In the unit number register the following information will be included:-
a) Full names of patients
b) Addresses
c) Dates of birth
d) Registration dates
e) Specialty to which they have been referred

\section*{The contents of the unit health record}

\section*{1. The folder}

When selecting a folder the following points should be noted:-
i. Strength of manila
ii. Method of fastening documents
iii. Clarity of numbering on the outside cover
iv. Cost of the folder

The folder should be made of tough manila with a gusset and single or double fold inside, through which are threaded metal or plastic prongs with which the loose sheets may be fastened into the folder.

\section*{2.The front sheet of identification sheet}

This is the area where all the patients' social details are transcribed from the pre-registration form. The inside front cover of the folder is sometimes used for this purpose. Space should be provided to record several changes of address and change of a doctor.
A section is often provided here to list the consultants whose clinics the patient has attended or to whose wards he has been admitted.

It is important that all these facts should be readily visible to the doctor who is in charge of the patient, and who may wish to remind himself at a glance at the personal facts about the patient without hunting through sheaves of documents. Is also important that the information should be complete and accurate so that the person writing a letter to the doctor will address this correctly, or anyone writing to the patient will send the letter to the correct address.

\section*{3. Clinical history sheet}

Two types of clinical history are in common use. In one, each consultant has his individual history sheets on which he only will write. A patient currently attending three different clinics
will have three separate history sheets although these are likely to be filled next to each other. An alternative way is the continuous history sheet on which each doctor writes as he sees the patient. This achieves a chronological statement about the patient which would seem to have many advantages. If the continuous history sheet is used, it is important that different clinics that the patient has attended should be easily identifiable - perhaps by using different coloured rubber date / clinic stamps.

\section*{4. Continuation sheet}

Some patients' attendance may be so short that their entire hospital episode is contained on one history sheet. This is not very usual, and continuation sheets are similar to history sheets but without any special printed identification of consultant or clinic which enables them to be used by all consultants.

\section*{5. Prescription chart}

This chart makes formal provision for the doctor to prescribe drugs for in or out-patients. The form must always find its way back to the case folder from the pharmacy so that the doctor treating the patient can see what previous medication has been prescribed.

\section*{6. Surgical operation sheet}

Special forms are provided on which operations may be recorded. They normally contain sections in which the names of all surgeons and anaesthetists taking part in the operation are to be recorded, and special remarks about drainage, blood loss, special recovery treatment etc.

\section*{7. Anaesthetic record}

As aesthetic techniques become increasingly sophisticated and complicated, the need for a special form on which to record the relevant facts has been rendered ineffective. Most anaesthetic record forms contain considerable amount of detail, filled in by the anaesthetist during the operation and immediate post-operative period

\section*{8. Temperature, pulse and respiration (TPR) chart}

There are two usual versions of this chart. One is the b.d twice daily chart for the recording of the routine observations. Urine and stool details are usually recorded at the foot of the T.P.R chart. A separate chart is often used for 4 hourly recordings for more seriously ill patients. This is frequently printed on coloured paper, or in coloured ink, to make it noticeable.

\section*{9. Report mount sheets}

Many reports which are smaller than the size of most forms have to be filed in the folder. They are usually mounted on a report mount sheet. These mount sheets vary in designs and methods of gumming. There are two possibilities, all reports may have a gummed edge and be stuck on the mount sheet itself, or may have a series of gummed strips on to which all reports will be stuck. Several versions of the mount sheet with gummed strips are available. The most popular and the most expensive has strips of self-adhesive gum protected with greased paper. The protective paper is peeled off and the edge of the report pressed on to the exposed gum. This procedure is so much agreeable than having to moisten the edge of a form as is usually done, unhygienic ally, with the tongue-that its introduction is extremely popular with all members of staff who have fasten reports into notes. The forms are filed one above the other, but with approximately one quarter inch or one third inch of the lower edge left visible so that the date and type of report can immediately be seen. In this way, a dozen or more reports will be file on one mount sheet.

\section*{10. Consent Forms}

Written consent has to be obtained for all operative procedures (which are technically an assault on the patient). For sterilization procedures, for post mortem examination-the consent has to be obtained from the patient, relative or parent (if the child is under 18 years) but in other countries it is 16 years. These forms are usually fastened onto a mount sheet, often separate one from those used for laboratory or other report forms.

\section*{11. Report Forms}

All investigations-laboratory (Haematology, biochemistry, bacteriology, histology) cardiology, radiological results in some sort of report form that will have to be fastened into patients' notes. These reports are becoming rapidly a very special problem, as they swell the bulk of the folders in rapidly increasing numbers. Some laboratories issue cumulative report forms each on which in turn replaces all the reports that have been issued previously but unless the previous reports are conscientiously removed there is no reduction in bulk. Computerized laboratory reports have not yet provided an easy answer to this problem as storage space is within the folder.

\section*{12 Clinical photographs}

When a patient has an unusually interesting condition, a clinical photograph may be taken. In plastic surgery, where the patient may pass through several stages of treatment, a photograph is often taken at intervals to record progress. Photographs may be kept centrally in the Medical Photograph Department, but they are frequently filed in the case folder, either
mounted on card or in a special plastic folder with pockets for the storage of a series of smaller photographs or slides.

\section*{13. In-Patient Summaries}

After a patient has been discharged from hospital, it is usual for the registrar or consultant to dictate a "summary" (though this is frequently a substantial document) of salient points of the patient's progress while as an in-patient carried out operations or other treatment and condition on discharge are always included. A copy of this summary is often used as the hospital's full report to the general practitioner. The summary usually forms the document on which diagnostic coding is carried out.

\section*{14. Correspondences}

Copies or originals of all communications from the general practitioner to the hospital doctor, and from hospital to the general practitioner must be returned. These will include copies of the discharge note, which is traditionally written by the junior hospital doctor on the day of the patient's discharge, to keep the doctor informed of the most important points about the patient's stay in the hospital until he receives full discharge summary.

These are some of the more important documents normally included in the case folder, but there will be literally hundreds more in use in most hospitals, their number and use depending on the type of hospital. Students will become familiar with these forms as with the case notes.

\section*{DIFFERENT TYPES OF HEALTH RECORDS-THEIR VALUES, USES AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF A HRIO/HRIT}

\section*{Learning objectives}

The learner should be able to:-
1. Identify different types of health records
2. Explain the uses and value of health records in:-
(i) Treatment
(ii) Planning
(iii) Research
(iv) Teaching
(v) Administration
(vi) Monitoring and Evaluation
3. Explain the qualities and responsibilities of a Health Records/Information Technician

\section*{TYPES OF HEALTH RECORDS}

There are different types of health records:-
1. Case records
2. Outpatient records
3. Diagnostic records

\section*{1. Case Records}

These are records initiated for patients who get admitted into the wards or who continuously attend the various consultant clinics. The information that is contained in the case can be expressed verbally, graphically, diagrammatically or in a tabular form. This depends on the person taking in the information. The range of documents to be included in the case record also depends on the local requirements although certain documents are common in all hospitals.

\section*{2. Out-Patient Records}

This includes all the cards that are used in the Out-Patient Departments, for example the Casualty Wards, Ante-Natal Wards, Immunization cards and any other card that may be used in the outpatient departments.

\section*{3. Diagnostic Records}

These include notes on Radiography, Pathology, Electrocardiography and other investigations that are usually initiated by report forms. These forms are usually 6 " $\times 4$ " in size and are available in all consultation rooms both in the Out-patient and In-patient departments in a health care facility. They could be different colours for quick identification.

\section*{VALUES AND USES OF HEALTH RECORDS}

Health records have various uses:-

\section*{1. Treatment}

The health record is the first and foremost of value in the present and future treatment of the patient. The individual record is a reminder to the physician, surgeon, clinician, nurse, social workers or health records technicians of what he/she has personally observed during the patient's illness. It contains information of what has been observed by others. It provides or should provide the whole previous hospital record of the patient, so that every fact that may be important is permanently available for reference at any time. A complete record prevents duplication of work and effort and facilitates future care of the patient (patient follow up).

\section*{2. Planning}

Health statistics and information gathered from the health records will definitely be very useful in the planning of health care services. It is very necessary that these statistics should be very accurate and disseminated promptly to users: - inadequate records mean incomplete statistics leading to improper planning of various activities in the health service.

\section*{3. Research}

Accurate recording of observation in the health records will lead to accurate information required for research. They should contain that basic information that is required of them to meet the purposes for which they are intended, one being research. The methods of filing and retrieving should be systematic and simple.

\section*{4. Teaching}

Health records can be used as an educational tool or instrument. When the quality of the records is high, the task of the student is simplified conversely when the quality is poor the student's task is made more difficult and his progress is impeded.

\section*{5. Administration}

Complete health records mean increased and efficient services to the public, avoiding vexations, litigations and fair settlement of claims and capacity to answer queries about how hospitals work.

For the record to meet and be useful for the above purposes it should designed for the purposes for which it is to be used. It is important for the record to meet the requirements of both the clinician and the records personnel. The records also should be complete. To be complete the records to meet should be complete. To be complete the records should be analysed quantitatively by the health records officer and qualitatively by the clinician.

\section*{QUALITIES OF A HEALTH RECORDS TECHNICIAN}

Most of these qualities apply to most of the employees in a health care delivery service. A trained health records technician should have

Integrity - Honest and upright
Adaptability - Should be flexible to the circumstances in an environment
Discretion - Ability to use his own knowledge to make decisions
Politeness - Humility / humbleness
Calmness - A state of not being emotional in an emergency situation
Neat appearance - Smart and acceptable appearance in his work
Consistent efficiency - Effective and exceptional performance in his work.
Personal sense of vacation and service to the other health workers and thence the patient.

\section*{DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITY OF HEALTH RECORDS OFFICER}

The health records officer should be able to:-
1. Manage and organize health records and health information services.
2. Manage and maintain health records and information systems:
(a) Initiate, collect, store and retrieve health records
(b) Collect, tabulate analyse, interpret and store health information.

All this co-ordination is done to enhance the treatment of the patient. Therefore the stands in the middle and all these activities revolve around the patient. No one department is more important than the other; they should work together towards the achievement of this common goal.

\section*{UNIT 2}

\section*{RECEPTION, REGISTRATION AND INITIATION OF PATIENTS/CLIENTS RECORDS}

\section*{INTRODUCTION}

This chapter explains reception registration and how the patients/clients records are created.

\section*{Learning Objectives}

The students should be able to:-
1. Define Reception, registration and initiation of a health record.
2. Receive patients/clients
3. Register patients/clients
4. Initiate patient/client records

\section*{1. RECEPTION OF PATIENTS/CLIENTS}

Reception is the art of greeting and welcoming. The right person should be selected for this work, because he is the one who will interview the patient.

He or she should have ease, assurance of manner and a pleasant appearance.
He has to convey to the anxious patient that there is nothing to worry about; the hospital is smoothly run, created for his care. This is not a job for a neurotic or anxious person.
It requires cool efficiency, the ability to convey confidants, patients and compassion- a very demanding combination of qualities.

\section*{2. REGISTRATION OF PATIENTS}

Is the completion of a documentation of personal and health data before a patient is treated Registration falls into two procedures - that for out-patients and the consultative clinics the registration should be carried out before the patients attends the clinic. The environment should be conducive and the patients should be interviewed individually and in privacy. The patient is registered, a file opened and an appointment is given prior to the clinic day. Another important factor that should be noted is that the patient should only be given one unit number and the patient should be asked whether he has attended the hospital before. If the answer is no is when a new number should be given to prevent duplication of numbers. Whether the answer is yes or no, this should be cross checked with the patient master index.

\section*{3. INITIATION OF PATIENTS RECORD}

The identification details that are taken during the registration time is used to create the patient's file. The registration details are:- patient's full names, date of birth, hospital number given, address, occupation, marital status, religion, name of next of in, address of next of kin. Many hospitals have formed formal systems of pre-registration- this is sending the patient a simple form to be completed. This form will ask for all identification details to be confirmed. Any form used should be simple as possible to make it easy for the patient to complete it. This form when returned will be used to create the patients/clients health records. The use of mechanical documentation ensures continuing use of the same data throughout the patient's stay in the hospital.

The master index cards should also be created during the time that the record is being created and filed immediately. This will help to answer enquiries in case the patient happens to lose the attendance card.

\section*{UNIT 3}

\section*{CREATING MAINTAINING HEALTH RECORDS INDICES}

\section*{Learning Objectives}

The learner should be able to:-
1. Define various health record Indices
2. Explain the importance of health records indices
3. Describe the procedures used in creating health records indices
4. Describe various equipment used in storage of health record indices
5. Describe the techniques used infilling health record indices.

\section*{INDICES}

There are various health records indices used and maintained in a health records department namely:-
1. The Patient Master Index
2. The Diagnostic Index
3. The Operations Index
4. The Waiting List Index

\section*{1. The Patient Master Index}

Definition
The Patient Master Index is the alphabetical key to the numerically file case records.
Importance
This is a very important index in the case where a patient has lost his attendance cards.
The following details must appear on any index card:-
Surname
First names
Sex
Hospital number
Address
Space left for change of address.

A typical layout of the card which measures 3 " x $2 \frac{1}{2}$ " or 5 " x 3 " would be
NB. The examination tricks are about drawing the card, mentioning details, recognition of measurements plus importance of each detail found on the card

Also why the card is created, when and where, how and where it is filed, when and why it is revisited.

\section*{Creation of the Master}

The Master Index card is created when the patient is being registered.
Equipment used for filing the Master Index Cards
1. Strip Index
2. Elevator files
3. Cartwheel
4. Carousel type files
5. Guide cards
6. Drawers
7. Strip index

\section*{Drawer filing}

Cards may be filled "blind" in drawers-filed one behind the other in an upright position.

\section*{Strip Index}

A strip index as its name indicates consists of a series of thin wooden strips coated with paper on which details required for the master index are filed on metal panels. The strips are filed on metal panels with a fold of metal down each edge which holds the strips in place. The panels are hanged on a central revolving spindle so that they fan out like leaves on an open book. They may also be wall mounted. This is recommended for the waiting list and not the master index.

\section*{Elevator Files}

In an elevator file the cards are usually filed in trays about a foot long and several trays about a foot long and several of these trays are files on a shelf in the machine. The machine looks like a large metal cabinet which may be up to five feet high and up to ten feet wide, with an opening at the top. In this opening two or three shelves with their trays of cards are visible. The largest elevator file would probably hold 900,000 index cards. The large files are electrically driven. If the card is wanted, the filing clerk presses a button indicating the shelves; the cards rotate until the correct one arrives at hand level. The clerk then looks in the appropriate tray for the card. Smaller elevator files are manually controlled.

The advantage is that there is speedy access to all cards while the clerk is comfortably sitting on a chair.

The disadvantage is that the machine is expensive and may not be afforded by some of the health facilities.

\section*{Cartwheel type files}

In this type the cards are attached to a large upright central wheel which is rotated until the required section comes on top. This type of file is probably not suitable for a very large hospital.

\section*{Carousel type files}

In this type the cards are housed in open metal boxes which are attached to a central upright spindle. The boxes can be swung out for use and then folded back towards the spindle when finished with. Because the boxes are attached right round the stem, several clerks can have access at once. The equipment is space saving considering the number of cards that can be housed.

\section*{The notes carrying a unique hospital number}

There are always one or two departures from the unit system in hospitals which use this system. To maintain confidentiality, some of the departments like Psychiatry may keep detailed notes about their patients. But the Tunbridge report of 1965 and the Walker report published in Scotland in 1967 advocates the inclusion of all the patients' notes even if he attends any other speciality put together in one folder. We only need to mention this although this should not be the case.

\section*{Guide Cards and back stops}

All the equipment described above except the strip index will need some guide card or back stop. The function of the guide card is to sub divide the file into reasonable sections, so that too much time is spent hunting through several hundred cards before finding the precise section of the file that is needed. Whatever type of guide card chosen, clear, bold lettering
will aid both filing and finding of cards. Back stops are the pieces of metal that stop the cards in a drawer that is not full from sliding down. Back stops should be firm enough to stay in place when the drawer is closed too roughly, but mobile enough to be readily adjustable as the cards have to be expanded backwards.

\section*{Filing Techniques used in filing Master Index Cards}

\section*{(a) Sorting}

The most important step in filing is sorting-which means putting the cards into good order before being filed.

There are two methods of sorting most appropriate to a master index:-
(i) Use of sort-file -This is series of flaps each bearing a letter of the alphabet-arranged in a solid base.
(ii) Pigeon Holes- each lettered for the initial sorting of the index cards.

\section*{(b) Filing}

This requires a lot of concentration. It easy to file in a card when the files in front and behind have been checked. This should be allocated to an experience clerk.

\section*{(c) Checking}

It is obvious that mistakes do occur when one is filing the cards and therefore constant checking of file cards is required.

\section*{1. Reference to Index}

Once cards have been filed and checked they should only be removed when the address needs to be changed. Cards should never be so packed as to prevent checking and filing. The most important thing to note here is that the master index cards should be filed strictly alphabetically and only one member of staff should work on the cards at any one time to prevent cards from being misfiled.

\section*{Diagnostic Index}

The diagnostic index is to provide access for study purposes to the clinical data contained in the hospital records. A health personnel wishing to carry out a study on any particular disease can obtain from the index the case folder number of those patients who have been admitted or have attended an out-patient department with a particular disease in which he is interested. The disease index will provide the number of the relevant case records and may also provide some minimal data about the patient's age, sex, and outcome of the episode of treatment.

\section*{Equipment used to maintain the diagnostic index}
(i) Vertical Index Card
(ii) Visible Edge Card
(iii) Computers

\section*{Operations Index}

It will be possible for the Health Records and Information Officer to maintain an operations index besides the diagnostic index. Operative procedures need to be coded, just as do diagnoses. The code used is the classification of surgical operations.

\section*{Equipment used to maintain the operations Index}

The information is recorded on the same media as the disease index. Identification factors records on the operations index: case record, number, sex, and age, and surgeon, outcome of episode and date of discharge.

\section*{UNIT 4}

SCHEDULING AND FOLLOW UP; PREPARING OF IN AND OUT PATIENT CLINIC, PATIENTS

\section*{Learning Objectives}

The learner should be able to:-
1. Define scheduling and follow up
2. Describe concept of scheduling and follow up
3. Explain the purpose of scheduling and follow up.
4. Describe the types of appointment systems
5. Describe different sources of appointments
6. Explain queuing theory
7. Describe the equipment used to maintain appointments
8. Explain how to prepare a clinic

Appointment system is a systematic way pf giving a specific date, time and venue of the clinic to an individual patient/client.

\section*{Concepts of scheduling}
1. Patients should be distributed evenly to various clinics depending on the number that the consultants will be able to see.
2. The staff manning the clinics should ensure that they are in time so that patients are not kept waiting for long before they are seen.
3. Overloading of clinics should be avoided.
4. There should be a laid down policy on how to schedule current cases.
5. Staff working in the appointment area should be familiar with the layout of the hospital so that they can give proper directions to the patients/clients.

\section*{Purpose of Scheduling and Follow up}
1. To reduce patients' waiting time.
2. To provide an even spread of work over the whole clinic session. An appointment provides for even spread of work among the medical staff running the clinic.
3. To allow the hospital to prepare each and every patient in an advance so that delay for registration at the time of the clinic can be reduced.
4. To provide special clinic arrangements, for example recording of social history, weighing of patients, removal of plaster, pathological and radiological examinations.
5. To allow for distance and known transport difficulties. Allowance should be made by health records staff for such factors as the distance a patient has to travel, train and arrival and departure times, rural transport difficulties, availability of local ambulance to the health care facility. All these can consistently ease burden of attending the hospital.
6. To provide for teaching arrangements. A consultant may wish to select an interesting case to present to the medical students. This is simplified if an appointment system is well organized in the health institution.

\section*{Type of appointment systems}

There are 3 types:-
1. Centralized
2. Decentralized
3. Combined.

\section*{Centralized}

This means that all appointments for the various clinics are made in one central place.

\section*{Advantages}
1. The Master Index will be near the area for quick reference.
2. Control of staff, stationery and equipment by the health records/information officer is easy.
3. Each of the appointment clerks becomes familiar with the working systems of the various consultants.
4. All Enquiries concerning appointments are referred to one place.
5. Urgent cases are channelled quickly to the respective clinics.
6. When one clerk is sick or goes on leave the other clerks continue with the work since they are all familiar with the work.

\section*{Decentralized}

This is an appointment system which is carried on in different clinics.

\section*{Disadvantages}
1. The Master Index is far from the appointment area.
2. Control of available resources is difficult.
3. When the clerk who mans the clinic becomes sick or is on leave the work come to a standstill.
4. Enquiries concerning appointments are directed to different places.

\section*{Advantages}
1. The clerk dealing with the appointments becomes familiar with the patients and knows them by name.
2. The consultant in charge of the clinic will know the number of patients on his list without having to walk or ring the central area.

\section*{Combined System}

Some of the hospitals have the two systems combined. Return appointments being made in the various clinics and new bookings being done in the central area. It is the duty of health records/information officer to look at these systems critically to decide on which suits his hospital or health institution ,centralized appointment system should exist by considering disabled clients difficulties when it comes in moving from one place to another

\section*{Sources of request for appointments}
1. Patients telephoning personally to make appointments.
2. Physicians on private practice wanting to book appointments for their patients through telephone or writing.
3. Letter from other health institutions given to patients to come and book their own appointments.
4. Patients already discharged from the hospital making return appointments.
5. Patients referred from one clinic to another.

\section*{Equipment used to record appointments}

The choice of the equipment used will depend on whether the appointment is being made centrally or de-centrally.
(a) Loose leaf binder
(b) Visible edge sheets
(c) Diaries
(a) Loose leaf binders

Books vary in size and it is recommended that they be in loose leaf form to facilitate additions and removal of the sheets. The type used depends on local circumstances.

\section*{(b) Visible edge sheets}

Sheets are cut out and by the use of cardex these sheets are fixed on the cardex and the information written on them can easily be seen when the cardex is open.
(c) Diaries.

Books that are bound can be used to write all the appointments for one consultant. The disadvantage is that one keeps cancelling the list the diary becomes untidy. Another disadvantage is that one cannot photocopy the diary direct. He has to write out other list from the dairy.

\section*{Clinic Preparation}

Two days prior to the clinic all the clinic lists should be sent to the appropriate sections: - one to the clinic, one to the filing area, another to the consultant in charge of the clinical area. All the records and documents should be pulled out, all the pathological reports inserted in the correct files and kept in the pigeon holes for the clinic receptionist to come and collect. The clinic receptionist should make sure that all the documents such as $x$ - rays are ready for each and every patient attending the clinic. The clinics are prepared two days in advance to reduce the patients waiting time before he is seen by the physician.

At the end of the clinic the receptionist should ensure that all the files are returned to the central library ready for filing.

\section*{Queuing theory}

Queuing theory deals with one of the most unpleasant experiences of life and that's waiting. Queuing is quite common in many fields, for example, in telephone exchange, in a health facility waiting bay, at a petrol station, etc.
I have mentioned the telephone exchange first because the first problems of queuing theory was raised by calls and Erlang was the first who treated congestion problems in the beginning of 20th century
His works inspired engineers, mathematicians to deal with queuing problems using probabilistic methods. Queuing theory became a field of applied probability and many of its results have been used in operations research, also in monitoring and evaluation procedures

The following will assist the health records officer to come up with solutions:
a) The health records officer_should critically look at the existing appointment schedules:
b) Whether they have been altered (occasionally doctors do that.) This could result in crowded clinic waiting area.
c) Whether there exist instructions at the foot of the appointment schedules. Any proposed changes should be instantly notified to health records officer, and of which guards the appointment staff from interference.

The methodical checking of appointment systems should be a working routine for Health Records officer, by:
i. Indicating on the lists the time, the first and last patients were seen.

This will be a fair indication of whether clinics start and end consistently late. It may provide the means to put remedial actions; before you realise this when the patients complain.
ii. The health records officer should critically look at the existing appointment schedules: But sometimes things could be getting worse and you need to institute fullchecks by using the following steps:
- Whether they have been altered (occasionally doctors do that...) this could result in crowded clinic waiting area.
- Whether there exist instructions at the foot of the appointment schedules. Any proposed changes should be instantly notified to health records officer, and of which guards the appointment staff from interference.
- Check whether there was any last minute change_that could have affected the timing of appointments.
- If neither of the above checks show obvious cause of delay, then the next step is:
d) Conduct consultation with the clinic staff (both lay and nursing).
- They give an idea of "what happened" on that particular day.
- They could give opinion on how it normally works.

If it happens through the findings that has problems of "late ending", then the health records officer_seeks the following:
- Discuss with the consultant concerned so that: The consultants know there exist a problem.
- Suggest a better system
- Enhance co-operation on carrying out the investigation.
e) The next step is to prepare slips to record patients':
- Date for appointment
- Patient's name,
- hospital number,
- Time of appointment, time of arrival, time went in to see doctor and time left the clinic.
- Whether using hospital transport.
f) The slips will be put in each patient's notes/file for:
- The receptionist to indicate the time of arrival,
- Then as patient enters doctor's room, either the patient or the nurse indicates time and
- After the patient leaves the doctor's consultation etc.,
- The slip is taken back to reception; to enter the time of departure.
g) At the end of the clinic the slips will be handed over to health records officer (and it is a good idea to conduct this exercise for about two to three clinics)
h) The health records officer will work out the following from the data on the slips:
- The average time patients wait before being seen by consultant:
- Number of minutes between time of appointment and time of arrival, time seen by the doctor
- The aim of all investigations in queuing theory is to get the main performance measures of the system which are the probabilistic properties of the following random variables: number of customers/clients in the system, number of waiting customers, utilization of the server/s, consultants, response time of a customer, waiting time of a customer, idle time of the server/consultant, busy time of a server/consultant.
- Of course, the answers heavily depends on the assumptions concerning the distribution of inter-arrival times, service times, number of servers, capacity and
service discipline suggest appropriate changes where the system it is not working efficiently.....

\section*{ADMISSION PROCEDURES}

Patients/clients should be supplied with a booklet containing information about the hospital before they are admitted. If they are emergency patients then they should be supplied with the booklet after admission. The book should contain the layout of the hospital, visiting times for relatives and visitors. The wards should be easily be identified. Accommodation for relatives of very ill patients/clients, mothers, ill babies should be available. After admission patients/clients should be guided to the ward by a member of staff or the sister or nurse
responsible for reception and documentation of patients in the ward. This will ensure a feedback of information to the health records/information department.

\section*{SOURCES OF ADMISSION}

Admissions can come from different sources:-
(i) Accident and Emergency department
(ii) Outpatient clinic
(iii) Other hospitals
(iv) In-patient waiting list

\section*{DISCHARGE PROCEDURES}

Admissions and discharge registers should be maintained in all health institutions. The register should provide for full name of the patient, date of birth, admission date, discharge date, diagnosis and the length of stay at the hospital.

\section*{Editing and Auditing of the Health Record}

\section*{What is editing of the Health Record?}

Is a process of arranging of all the forms inside the unit folder in a prescribed manner. Editing is mostly done by wards clerks and can be either be done chronologically or in order of speciality.

After the unit folder has been edited in the ward, it should be returned to the health records department where the HRIO cross-checks with the daily bed returns to ensure that all records have been received in the records department.

After this, the unit folder will be coded and then indexed ready for filing back to the library. The discharge procedure cannot be complete until the patient folder is returned back to be filed.

The patient is then given a return appointment to a consultative clinic and this is recorded on his attendance card for future consultations.

\section*{What is a medical audit?}
- The Medical Audit has been defined as an "objective method for applying a yardstick to the quality of professional performance."
- When we do auditing, it means the auditing team is evaluating the quality of medical care given to patients.
- During audit, a special designed tool is used by the auditing team whose purpose is to uncover ineffective services and to enable improvement of standards of quality of healthcare in the health facilities in the ministry of Health.
- Some of the indicators that are used to measure quality of health services include, skilled delivery, lives saved, individuals rehabilitated back to the community, reduced perinatal deaths and maternal deaths.
- The whole process of evaluation is carried out by health records committee because they are the custodian of data both aggregated and individual data at the facility, subcounty, county and national level.

\section*{Accident and Emergency Records Procedure}

After a patient has been seen at the health centre he may be having some ailment which needs immediate and urgent attention. Definitely the doctor will refer him to a hospital for immediate attention. He will find himself in an accident and emergency department. Also patients with any type of accident will be brought to this department directly.

\section*{1. Records to be kept.}
(a) Firstly a register must be maintained at the Accident and Emergency department. The following information should be included in this register; name of patient, address, age, doctor referring him, time of arrival, brief description of injury, brief details of treatment, and the mode of disposal. The particulars of the person who has brought this patient to the accident and emergency departments must be taken also. If it is a police officer his number must be recorded in the register. The register may be in loose leaf form or in bound volumes. From the register statistics of attendance will be compiled.

\section*{(b) Clinical record}
(i) Single card measuring 8" $\times 5$ " or 6" $\times 4$ " on which the identification details are recorded. For an R.T.A (Road traffic accident) patient, time and place of accident must be given and the space left for the clinician to write on.

\section*{(ii) Two part card}

A card with carbonized part made from N.C.R material. The card is made up in an envelope from so that x- ray reports and any other correspondence may be filled in it.
(iii) Thick paper envelope four and an eighth by five and three quarters inches (half the size of A4 paper). The envelope will serve as a card and a pocket for reports.

\section*{2. Appointments}

Most patients attending this department rarely come back for return appointment. For those patients that need return appointments this can be carried out in two ways:-
(i) Appointment register may be retained by the receptionist and the appointment written on the patient's attendance card.
(ii) Pre-printed appointment cards for each day and time may be given to the patient. A different colour of the card could be kept for each day of the week and when a patient arrives seeking an appointment a card is simply pulled out and given to him.

\section*{3. Disposal of patients}

Disposal of patients attending this department could be in one of these categories:-
a) Treated to finality and discharged.
b) Treated initially and referred back to the nearest health centre.
c) Referred to an out-patient consultant clinic.
d) Referred to a consultant clinic in another hospital.
e) Admitted to the wards for further treatment. Here full documentation for admission will be carried out before the patient goes to the ward.
f) Transferred to another hospital for further treatment.
g) In the case of patient who has been brought dead (B.I.D) the doctor just goes to certify the death and the body is conveyed straight to the mortuary.

\section*{4. Legal requirements}

It is important to note that the same legal requirements that are applicable to other health records as far as retention is concerned still apply in accident and emergency records. They may be retained for a minimum of six years after the last attendance. The records may be filed numerically or alphabetically depending on the number of records created annually. At the beginning of the year, $1^{\text {st }}$ January, a new file is started. The records should be kept olin lock because most of these records are usually required in court and as much details as possible should be recorded. Most patients who have been involved in road traffic accidents need some claims in future. Therefore statistics for these patients may be sent to finance department so as to issue the necessary claims.

\section*{WAITING LIST FOR IN-PATIENT AND DAY CASE TREATMENT}

A waiting list is an index of all patients waiting admission to hospital or waiting treatment on a day case basis.

\section*{1. Functions of a waiting list.}

The waiting list must be organized that enquiries can be answered from individual patients wanting to know when they are supposed to be admitted in the health institution. Individual consultants would like to know how many patients are on their waiting list should immediately be furnished with such information. The main function of the waiting list is to be able to make full use of the available beds in a health institution.

\section*{2. Types of waiting list}

The waiting list may be maintained in various ways:-

\section*{(i) Centralized waiting list}

This waiting list is held in one office and contains the names of all patients awaiting admission under all the consultants in the hospitals.

\section*{(ii) Decentralized waiting list}

The decentralized waiting list will be maintained in several places possibly each consultant's secretary, or an individual wards or individual departments.

\section*{Advantages of centralized waiting list}
1. Gives a fair representation of all the demands being made on the in-patient facilities.
2. All enquiries are referred to one place.
3. Staffs dealing with the waiting list develop skills in dealing with enquiries, and in the maintenance of the waiting list.
4. Updating procedures such as change of address, death are easily carried out.
5. Checking admissions and discharges from the daily returns is easier.
6. When one staff falls sick or goes on leave another staff can carry on with the work.

\section*{Disadvantages of centralised waiting list}
1. Consultants need to walk to the central office to select their patients from the waiting list.
2. The list become so big so that some patients may be left out of the waiting list

\section*{Advantages of decentralised waiting list}
1. Consultants need not go to the central office to select their patients from the waiting list.
2. The secretaries get familiar with the patients and can call them by name.

\section*{Disadvantages of decentralised waiting list}
1. Several staff will be deployed in the maintenance of the waiting list in different areas.
2. It will be very expensive since each department will need to use its own equipment.
3. A clerk will have to walk to the central records department to check for admissions and discharges from the daily returns.

\section*{Creation of the waiting list record}

Most of the waiting list records are initiated at the out-patient clinics. Some other patients may come from another hospital and be put in the waiting list for another different hospital, where there are more beds or facilities. There are four ways in which information can be conveyed to the waiting list:-
(a) Card - The card is created for every patient who is to be put on the waiting list. This card will be filed and form part of the waiting list.
(b) The nurse or doctor may send a list of patients to be included in the waiting list to the records department for action.
(c) Letter - A consultant in one hospital may wish to include his patient's name in his waiting list, in another hospital for his name to be included in that waiting list. In this letter he will in clued diagnosis, and priority for admission. A case folder will then be created for this patient. The information to be included in this record are: the patient's name, address, title, telephone number, holiday dates, diagnosis, operation to be carried out, duration of stay in the hospital, name of the surgeon, or consultant.

\section*{Method of filing}

A waiting list contains dozen names and needs two files:-
1. Alphabetical index of the names of all patients on the waiting list. These cards should not be removed until the patient is admitted.
2. Consultants list will make provision for date, time, and ward. These lists will have priorities indicated - routine, soon, and urgent.

These two files should be able to answer an enquiry from a patient and consultant.

\section*{Filing equipment}

The type of filing to be used will depend on the size of the list.
(a) Visible edge card filed in trays

When this is used to maintain a waiting list may be in the form of manila flaps, with a rigid bar at the top and a transparent plastic pocket about half an inch deep at the lower edge of each flap. A card is inserted into this pocket and the flap is held in a metal tray in such a way that all the information in the plastics is visible. Date is put on the list, diagnosis, operation and admission priority is put to allow the consultant to select his patients.
(b) Strip index

A strip index is limited in space so that no space is left for change of address. It can only be used if the list is not too long. It has already been mentioned as one of the equipment used in the maintenance of the patient master index card.
(c) Diaries

Each consultant could have a diary for his patients put on the waiting list according to dates. Its danger is that a patient can easily be missed or overlooked on date which passed.
(d) Colour coding

Colour coding could be used to indicate soon, urgent and routine case.
Procedures for admitting patients from list
1. The patient is selected from the waiting list the consultants
2. The clerk writes to the patient or telephones him inviting the patient to the hospital
3. The records are got out from the files and sent to the documentation office.
4. The waiting list card is sent to the admission office so that the patient is expected on the day he comes in. the admission office checks the record before the patients comes. When he comes his details are checked and confirmed by the admission office.
5. Patient is admitted and sent to the ward.
6. When the patient has been admitted his name is removed from the waiting list.
7. Certain checks are made on the waiting list to remove the names of the patient who have died to remove their names from the waiting list.

\section*{Statistics}

Regular returns are compiled from the waiting list for hospital activity analysis. The procedures described above also apply to patients who come for day case treatment. Special letters are sent to these patients because of preparations needed if general anaesthesia is to be given.

\section*{Filing system}

Definition: it is an array of documents/records that conforms to a plan
N/B A system means that things/documents are already arranged in a certain way either considering alphabets, time/ date, or certain assigned numbers,

System: It is an array of things that conforms to a plan

\section*{Alphabetical filing system}

It is an array of documents, medical records considering / using letters of their names alphabetically...i.e. Medical records for the clients below are arranged in that order considering starting letters of their name
- Albert ,(1)

Beatrice,(2)
- Nassiuma(3)

\section*{Advantages of using alphabetical filing system}
- It is the suitable link between Master patient index card that is also filed alphabetically
- It is simple to use compared to terminal digit

\section*{Disadvantages of using alphabetical filing system}
- It grows unevenly thus interfering with expansion space setting
- It consumes a lot of time in filing and retrieving especially when they are a lot of medical records

\section*{Chronological filing system}

Chronological: it is an array of documents, medical records considering time or date when it was created

Mostly it is used in arranging documents, records in a case folder from downwards to upwards

\section*{Advantages of using chronological filing system}
- Simple to use in small number of medical records
- It saves in filing day to day created records

\section*{Disadvantages of chronological filing system}
- Not used in big libraries

Downloaded by Patrick Ngobiro (pngobiro@gmail.com)
- It is time consuming in retrieval of records especially in relatively large libraries

Numerical filing system
- Numerical filing system: it is an array of documents /medical records considering different specific assigned digits ,numeric numbers in a certain sequence
- It is the common system used where also it is in two ways mentioned below

\section*{Numerical Filing system}

\section*{(1)Straight Numerical filing system}

\section*{(2)Terminal digit filing system}
1) Straight numerical filing system

In this system documents are numbered and arranged in straight line sequence i.e. $1,2,3,4,5 \ldots \ldots$. or $00001,00002,00003$ in some facilities or institutions they might decide to add zero like in the second example above also they can use F or M indicating sex i.e. F/0003,M/0001
- Lastly they might decide to add an organization or institution name in abbreviated form i.e. kmtc/f/0002
Provided documents are from 1,2 , and $3 \ldots$ etc. that's straight line filing system
Advantages of straight numerical filing system
- Simple to implement and use compared to alphabetical
- Time saving in retrieval and filing of medical records
- Suitable being used in small libraries

Disadvantages in of using straight numerical system
- It is un economical to filing space due to growing in one direction
- It is used only in small libraries

Terminal digit filing system (TDF)

Terminal Digit Filing (TDF)

Terminal digit filing (TDF) systems is the most often utilized filing methodology within an HIM department or medical library. TDF is the only way to keep files expanding at an even rate
- When trying to maintain a straight numeric filing system it is impossible to predict how much space to allocate to the randomly based file numbers that come into the file room.
- In a TDF system the last two, three, or four digits of the number is treated as a single number. Since all numbers in the file are sorted by their ending digits, each section contains approximately the same number of folders, so the file shelves are divided
- In a TDF system the last two, three, or four digits of the number is treated as a single number. Since all numbers in the file are sorted by their ending digits, each section contains approximately the same number of folders, so the file shelves are divided for easy expansion.

\section*{The benefits of TDF include:}
- Files are equally distributed throughout the file room.
- File room staff productivity is increased.
- Shelf and space planning is more efficient.
- Pre-sorting is easier.
- Workload assignments are streamlined.
- Purging is easier.
- The process works in a large or small department and across specialties.
- Process reduces transposed numbers File location is immediate.

\section*{Primary/Secondary and Tertiary Numbers}
- To understand terminal digit filing, one must first understand the designation of primary, secondary, and tertiary numbers.
Diagram indicating primary, secondary and digital

\section*{Definitions:}
- Terminal digit order: A system of filing using a six-digit number (or higher) that is divided into three parts, whereby the last two digits are considered primary.
- Primary digits: The last two digits to the right in the number.
- Secondary digits: The middle two digits in the number.
- Tertiary digits: Any remaining digits.

\section*{Procedure:}
- 24-00-33 example 1
24

33

Tertiary
Secondary
Primary

1. Locate the primary digit first and proceed to the corresponding section. Using example \#1 above, the HRIO /clerk would proceed to section " 33 " first.
2. After locating the primary section, identify the secondary digits and proceed to the corresponding shelf within the primary section. Using example \#1 above, proceed to the shelf with the digits " 00 ."
3. After locating the correct secondary digit, identify the tertiary digits. These digits are filed in numerical order.

\section*{Disadvantages of terminal digit}
- It needs trained staffs

\section*{FILING EQUIPMENT}

Shelves
Elevator
Bound volume
Cabinets
mobile racking
suspended pocket filing
color coding
carousel
box filing
cartwheel

\section*{Shelves}
- These are rack-like structures made of wood or metal, either fixed on the wall or fixed in a way to stand upright with partitions where documents/x ray films are filed
- They are $\_\_\_\_$ feet high with paths between to allow movement of staffs
- These paths are called gangways

Main gangway should be 155 cm wide
Sub gangways $95-100 \mathrm{~cm}$ wide to allow movement of the trolley

\section*{Advantages}
- It is ideal for filing administrative records where files are slim
- Attractive

Disadvantages
- it is expensive
- Provide less filing space

\section*{Box filing}
- This is where boxes host records, either put on shelves or as well designed rack it is hardly necessary to point out access to a set of notes that is packed in one box at the bottom of a pile of several boxes which is not easy to get but transferring of records from one place to another it is easy

\section*{Bound volume}
- Records are put in a pile of a certain number with specific details then they are use a string or plastic fastener to tie them ,let's have a look on the diagram below

\section*{Diagram}

Pigeon hole used in sorting of case records
Kick stool /ladder stand on to access great heights while filing Preparation tables used during sorting
Trolleys used to carry case records, clip board, pad while filing or retrieving
- In this unit don't forget dividers that provides support in shelves and backs stops which support or holds case records in an upright manner without falling, they are placed after a certain interval (ref pg.)

\section*{TRACING AND RETRIVAL OF HEALTH}

There are three systems of tracing most commonly used in a records library.

\section*{(a) The common tracer card}

Enough supply of tracer cards is kept in the library. When a record is removed from the filing area it is replaced by a tracer card. When the record is returned to the file the tracer card is
removed and the notes filed back. The tracer card is cancelled and reused for another set of records-hence the adjective "common'. The common tracer card should be made of strong card as it may be used up to eighty times before it is full. The information to be recorded on the tracer card should be as follows:
- Date
- Destination (ward or clinic)
- Hospital Number
- Patient's full names
- Reasons for extraction
- Borrower's signature.

Some special mention should be made about the date. Where the notes are being extracted for an outpatient clinic the date recorded on the tracer card should be the date of the clinic not the date of extraction.

When the patient is being admitted, the date of admission should be included on the tracer card. If the notes are for research or for a letter to be written, the date should be the date of extraction. The tracer card should be one quarter inch larger that the notes so that it can guide the filing clerk of where the notes should be inserted.

\section*{Advantages of the common tracer card}
1. I can be used 80 times for different patients.
2. A clerk can prepare a whole clinic in advance while seated.

It tracer cards are used for x- rays envelopes size $15^{\prime \prime}$ x $18^{\prime \prime}$, the tracer card should be more than the envelope so that it can act as a guide to locating the correct place and filing the films back. The same information will be recorded as on the cases for record tracer cards.

\section*{(b) Library tracer system}

Each case record has a small pocket inside the cover in which is held a small card with the patients name and the hospital number at the top, and a series of lines below on which borrower and date may be entered, very much on the principle still being used by public libraries. When the notes are withdrawn from the file the card is marked with date and name of the borrower and filed in a small tracer card index. When notes are returned to file, the card is extracted from this index, the entry cancelled and the card filed into the pocket in the folder which is itself then re-filed.

\section*{Disadvantages}
- This system is recommended only for a small library.
- There is no object left in place of the file to show where the record is.

Misfiling is likely to occur.

\section*{Advantage}

Because the card is created permanently when the folder is created, the facts are always right.

\section*{(c) Personal Tracer Card}

This card is created the same time as the case folder and identified with the patient's name and hospital number. It is filed inside the folder and is only taken out of file when the notes are taken out of the file. The same details as the common tracer card are entered onto it.

\section*{Advantages}
- When the record cannot be traced the details of the previous destination may give a clue as to the destination of the record.
- No transposition of numbers since the number is created permanently on the card.

The importance of the tracer systems cannot be overstressed. It is no excuse that notes cannot be found because the tracer is out of date. This will not help the patient. Like any other procedure, the tracer must help to achieve instant availability of the patients' notes when they are needed.

They are not only three terms used but you will encounter others with their definitions on the spot

\section*{Acquisition procedure}

As a health records and information manager you are supposed to follow strictly the procurement cycle while ordering an equipment through the following steps
- Step 1 : need identification by the user
- Step 2 : approval it is sought from the (AIE) authority to incur expenditure
- Step 3: technical specifications are crafted by the user in conjunction with the personnel
- Step 4: identification of the supplier (520\&521)

Step 5: delivery of goods and services, equipment etc.

\section*{LEGAL ASPECTS OF HEALTH RECORDS AND VARIOUS ACTS RELATED TO}

THEM

\section*{Learning Objectives}

The learner should be able to:-
1. Analyse and interpret legal aspects concerning:-
- Confidentiality
- Disclosure
- Ownership
- Retention
- Security
- Consent of Operations
- Medical Records Ethics

\section*{Confidentiality}

Information concerning a patient is confidential and should not be released to any unauthorized persons. If a member of the hospital staff improperly discloses ay information
concerning a patient whereby that patient suffers material loss, the patient can easily sue the hospital and the officer who is in breach of his duty had made any improper disclosure. If a hospital authority is to minimize its risk in the matter, it is suggested that it should have a rule for strict secrecy about all information regarding patients, their diseases, their affairs, and the affairs of their families obtained by any officer in the course of his duties. Further it is recommended that:-
(a)No unauthorized information should be given concerning patients or former patients.
(b) Apart from normal replies, and enquiries concerning the progress of a patient's illness is to be given except from instruction of the consultant.
(c)Case notes are not produced to unauthorized members of staff.

\section*{Disclosure of information}

There are five main categories under which contents of patients records can be disclosed;-
Consent by the patient which could be expressed or implied.
- If there is a court order.
- If the interest of the doctor or hospital cannot be otherwise safeguarded.
- If transference between hospitals, clinics or doctors in the interest of the patient.
- If there exists a higher duty than the private duty e.g. notification of infectious diseases, notification of births and deaths registration, and notification of poisons.

\section*{Disclosure with patient's consent}

A patient can give his consent for disclosure either expressly or implicitly. Implies consent arises only in certain limited circumstances as, for instance, when records are disclosed to another medical agency for purpose of continued treatment. Express consent is obtained when the patient signs a document authorizing the hospital to disclose his medical history for some specific purpose.

In general the consent form should always indicate the reasons for disclosure, and no disclosure should be made except for that reason. If the reason and purpose change, specific consent should again be obtained. Where a consent form reaches the hospital, the hospital is at liberty to disclose and the patient would have no ground for complaint if the disclosure was wider than he intended.

In cases where requests for clinical information are received from solicitors claiming to be acting on behalf of the patient care should be taken to make sure that the solicitors really are acting on behalf of the patient, and not, in fact against him.

Requests from insurance companies and similar bodies should only be acceded to with the patient's written consent but should be referred to the hospital authorities.

\section*{Disclosure by an order of court}

A court in the pursuit of justice may make an "Order for Discovery" or a Subpoena to produce case records. There is no question but that such an order must be obeyed. Generally the appropriate person to attend court and produce the appropriate record would be the Records officer. It is the original document that should be produced in court but if the original document cannot be traced then the court may accept the photocopies but photocopies must be certified to be the true copy of the original document.

\section*{Disclosure to safeguard the interests of a doctor or hospital}

If an action is brought against a hospital or doctor, then the disclosure of a patient's record may be done. Of equal importance is the fact that disclosure is permissible if the hospital is to work effectively. Disclosure of the contents of a medical record is necessary between departments or between members of medical staff in the hospital and this is justifiable of course, as being in the patient's interests. Such disclosure if made publicly by any member of the hospital staff, resulting in the patient's interest being adversely affected could result in action for damages.

\section*{Disclosure in transfer of information between authorized medical agencies}

A doctor dealing with a patient has full rights of access to any clinical data made at the time (except of course, where patient has been referred for treatment who is acting for a third party). When a patient is seen subsequently by another, strictly speaking that doctor has no legal right of access to the notes made by the previous doctor.

\section*{Disclosure as a 'higher" duty}

The existence of the higher duty may be said to apply when the interests or needs of the public are better served if there is some relaxation of the private duty and in some cases there is a clear legal duty to give information which supersedes the doctrine of confidentiality. More common instances are in the following circumstances:-
(i) Notification of infectious diseases by medical doctors to local medical officers of health under the Public Health Act (1936).
(ii) Notification of the cause of death under the Births and Deaths registration Acts18361926.
(iii) Notification of the industrial poisonings under the Factory and Workshop Act 1901.
(i) to (iii) above represent statutory obligations, whereas (iv) below are good causes. A statutory obligation must be complied with, whereas although a good cause should be there, there is no breach of law if it is not.
(iv) Claims for sickness benefits under the National Insurance Acts.
(v) Exchange of records between doctors for research purposes.
(vi) Disclosure to a central body for collective statistical purposes e.g. hospital activity analysis.

In the foregoing instances, it is plain that the disclosure is in the public's interest.

\section*{Ownership}

The records do not belong to the patient even if fees have been paid. The records belong to the various health institutions which created them. In the case of government institutions they belong to the government. Case records of private institutions belong to the institutions because they have contributed to the creation of the records.

\section*{Retention}

The Public Records Act stipulates that authorities responsible for public records have a duty to make proper arrangements for selecting those records which should be permanently be preserved and for disposal of the rest. There are some records that were spelled out by that Act and they should not be destroyed.
(a) Post Mortem books
(b) Summaries of clinical notes
(c) Discharge registers containing diagnosis

The rest of the health records in the folder may be destroyed. This should be done six years after the patient's last attendance. Each hospital should be able to decide on which records to be destroyed depending on the institution's demands.

\section*{Security}

It is the responsibility of each and every health institution to ensure that there is security in storage and handling of health records. This security could be maintained by:-
(a) Providing adequate security in the departmental procedures and use of equipment.
(b) Instructing lay staff on the confidentiality of health records.
(c) Require all lay staff to sign a declaration of secrecy.
(d) Health records staff accepting responsibility for disclosure of contents of health records in their possession.

\section*{Consent for operations}

It is legal requirement that a health institution should obtain consent from patient/ client before an operation or anaesthesia is administered to him in order to safeguard it. This only becomes difficult in the case of children and unconscious patients. In the case of unconscious patient, the surgeon should carry on with the necessary procedures. In case of somebody under 16 years it is necessary for parent or guardian to give consent. In case of emergency, consent should not delay the procedure because this could increase the risk. In case the operation is to be done on the child the father is the right person to give the consent but if the father is not accessible, the mother's consent would be acceptable. Failing that of the father, mother and then, a legal guardian would be obtained.

Married women would give consent on their own right just as single women. It is wise to obtain the husband's consent particularly where sterility may follow an operation. For mentally disordered patient the consent of the nearest relative should be obtained.

\section*{Medical records ethics}

In Greece, Hippocrates, known as the "father of medicine" was born about 460 BC. He was the first to cast out superstition and to practice medicine on scientific principles. He was the author of the Hippocratic Oath, which is pledged by physicians and other health workers including health records personnel. It states in part: "whatsoever in my practice or not in my practice I shall or hear amid the lives of men which ought not to be noised abroad- as to this I will keep silence, holding such things unfitting to be spoken". That is how confidentiality of health records originated and should be maintained until today.

\section*{The special health records are:-}
- Psychiatric records
- Infectious disease diseases
- Tuberculosis records
- Radiotherapy records.
- HIV/ AIDS records
- Maternity records.
- anaesthesia

\section*{Psychiatric records}

The way psychiatric records are maintained is different from the way the general records are maintained. This is prescribed in the Mental Health Act. The admission of psychiatric patients may be "informal or formal". Informal means a patient is admitted without legal or other formalities and the hospital has no right to detain him in the hospital against his will.

Admissions are carried out in reference to the Mental Health Act. Discharge procedures are also carried out in the same act.

The records officer must ensure that the information inside the record is accurate. The same responsibility being carried out by the health records officer in a general hospital are the same ones carried out in a psychiatric hospital except for the addition to the special statutory work arising from the operation of the mental health act.

\section*{Tuberculosis records}

Tuberculosis is one disease (cancer is the other) for which an attempt is made to complete registration to identify that population. Since it is an infectious disease notification must be made to the "Medical Officer of Health. A register is maintained for this notification. Copies of the notification of new cases are sent to the chest clinic. A unit record is opened for this patient and the information contained in it should be very comprehensive.

The records belonging to these patients are supposed to be kept for long periods and therefore the case folder must be made for sturdy material to resist wear and tear. The notes should be written in foolscaps instead of a4 size papers.

\section*{Radiotherapy records}

Radiotherapy department present a special records problem. All radiotherapy cases are supposed to be registered nationally for perpetual follow-up. These records could be filed in a separate area but given the unit number, and copies of the notes for the same patient from other units in the hospital incorporated in the same unit file. This should be a radiotherapy number given to each patient to be used for National Cancer Registration. This number is prefixed by the year of first registration and is used in all follow-up correspondences, until the patient dies. The prefix to the year of registration number is a precaution against confusion with unit number which will be used for treatment and all other occasions in the hospital.

\section*{Security and control of special health records}

The special health records should be if possible locked in cabinets and the keys kept by the health records/ information officer.

\section*{ESTABLISHMENT OF A HEALTH RECORDS DEPARTMENT IN A HEALTH CARE FACILITY}

\section*{DEVELOPING \& DESIGNING OF HEALTH RECORDS FORMS}
- Health record officers are acutely aware of the need for proper facilities for the efficient and effective operation of the health record services. In fact, it has been recognized for some time that architects, health facility planners, administrators and heads of departments, should plan for construction of specialty areas together, as a team. Although in many instances this has in fact happened, for a number of departments there has been little participation by health record officers (HRIOs).
- The reasons for non-participation are varied and range from the MROs not being consulted or involved because the planning authorities do not realize their ability in this area, or the HIRO has not been interested or has felt incapable of involvement in such a daunting task.
- The planning of a health record department, whether for a new hospital or relocation within an existing hospital, should develop from the interaction of three people: the health record officer, the facility's planning coordinator and the architect. The HRIO contributes ideas especially on the detailed functions of the proposed department; the planning coordinator has an understanding of the total requirements within the facility and co-ordinates all departmental planning and the architect is responsible for defining, both verbally and graphically the building or complex to meet a specified objective.
- To design a department which will offer both efficient and effective services, the planning team must clearly define the functions of the department and the interrelationships of the proposed department with other departments/areas of the facility. For example, will the health record department be responsible for transporting health record, for ordering and storing health record forms, for cleaning the department or will these functions be the responsibility of another department. This involves looking at procedures to be performed, staff requirements for the performance of these procedures, the flow of work planned for the department and the hours of services offered. This information should be stated in clear, logical writing, with sufficient detail for an architect to understand what is required. (Greenlaw \& Biggs, 1979).

\section*{The six phases}

The six phases determined by the architects (Lindell, 1974) which they believe should be observed when designing a new hospital department are as follows:

Definition phase,
Brief phase,
Department phase,
Total facility phase
- Process phase
- Department design

\section*{DEFINITION PHASE}

When preparing for this first phase in the planning of a health record department, there are five major points to be considered. These are:
1. location of the department in regard to services and inter-relationship of service areas
2. space requirements for records, for personnel and for equipment
3. functional design and logical placement of key work areas
4. system of communication within the health record department and between the department and other areas of the facility
5. System to be used to transport health records within the department and to other departments and wards.

\section*{1. Location}

When determining location consideration must be given to the need for the department to be centrally located where it will provide:
- prompt service for all patients - inpatients, outpatients and emergency
- ready accessibility for medical officers and other users, and
- easy availability for administrative use.
- adjacent to the Admission Office, the Accident and Emergency Department (A\&E), the Outpatient Department (OPD)
- close to wards
- close to the administrative and business offices
- Close to other service departments, e.g. x-ray, pathology, etc.

While it is desirable to have the health record department centrally located, it is accepted that this is not always possible. If this is the case and the department cannot be logistically situated near all these areas, the first three should have top priority and, in most situations, the proximity to the outpatient and accident and emergency departments would have the highest priority, as these two areas usually have the greatest utilization of records with speed of access often essential.

\section*{2. Space}

Regardless of the type of facility, when planning for space requirements for records, personnel and equipment, the health record administrator must consider the following:

Catchment population (Population attracted to the facility)
- hospital services proposed
number and type of beds cots amenity beds \& ordinary
- current and projected number of discharges/deaths and outpatient and emergency registrations and attendances
- major functions to be performed in the department
- number of personnel required to perform proposed functions
- equipment most suitable for the work to be done
- extent of computerization anticipated
- type of filing system to be used
- Whether the record services are to be centralized or decentralized
- Whether emergency/casualty records are to be included in the main record
- Number of years of active storage
- Length of time original records are to be preserved and whether inactive records will be selectively culled or microfilmed,
- Type of secondary storage required
- Special services to be offered by the department.
a) Space for records
- Before calculating file space required, decide how many years of health records should be kept in active filing and estimate the number of records generated per year.
- The retention schedules recommended by the local health authority for health records should be considered when determining record activity. These retention schedules usually take into consideration:
- The statute of limitations for legal protection, and state regulations
- Retention for longer periods than determined by health authorities, however, could be influenced by:
- Available storage space, and
- The clinical and/or research value of the records.

Once the proposed number of records and the activity rate have been determined the estimated number of health records over the number of years of active filing can be calculated.

The steps required in calculating and estimate space required for the filing library
- Given the number of annual discharges/deaths and OPD registrations (+ A\&E new patients if to be filed in main health record) and the number of years required for active storage, e.g. 7 years, you can determine the number of records to be generated over a 7 year period, e.g.

Annual OPD registrations 3000
Annual discharges/deaths $\underline{23000}$
(No A\&E)
26000 records per year
- $\mathbf{2 6 0 0 0}$ per year for 7 years $=\mathbf{2 6 0 0 0} \times 7=\mathbf{1 8 2 0 0 0}$ health records in 7 years
- It should be noted that these figures overestimate the number of actual records as discharges will include readmissions. However, this is a better figure to use as it allows space for the expansion of the file with each re-admission plus the work space needed for efficient filing and retrieval.

The next step is to determine the average size of each health record e.g. one record $= \mathbf{2} \mathbf{c m s}$ of linear shelf space
- Determine how many records to $\mathbf{1}$ meter(cm) of linear shelf space, i.e. $\mathbf{1 0 0} \mathbf{~ c m}=\mathbf{5 0}$ records to $\mathbf{1}$ meter
- The total filing space required, therefore, for these health records can be calculated as follows:
- annual discharges/deaths + OPD registration storage years required records per meter
e.g. using the above example:
$\underline{23000}+3000 \times 7=\underline{182000}=3640$
50
50
Therefore for $\mathbf{1 8 2 , 0 0 0}$ health records, $\mathbf{3 , 6 4 0}$ meters of shelving is required.

As well as determining what is adequate to meet the needs of the present, the needs of the future, i.e. in 10 or even 20 years, should also be considered. This can be achieved by an estimate, for example a $10 \%$ increase in discharges/deaths and OPD registrations over the next 10 years. This will change the filing space required to:
- $\mathbf{1 0 \%}$ of $\mathbf{3 6 4 0}=\mathbf{3 6 4 0}+\mathbf{3 6 4}=\mathbf{4 0 0 4}$ meters required.
- To calculate the total number of units required:
- determine the number of meters of storage per unit,
e.g. each unit $=6$ shelves high $\times 2$ meters wide
=12 meters of storage per unit
$\underline{4004}=\mathbf{3 3 3 . 6 6}$ or 334 units of 6 shelves
12

\section*{(a) Secondary storage}
- If a secondary storage area is considered it should ideally be located within the department, or immediately adjacent to it, or directly underneath with its own stairway. There are a number of advantages for keeping non-active health records readily accessible and available, two of which are that:
- It is time saving for staff, and offers easy access for refiling.
- If storage space is a problem and microfilming of inactive records is being considered a special room for microfilming will need to be planned and data base entry i.e. Open EMRS,C-PAD, EDDIT ARVDatabase etc.
- To calculate the space required for secondary storage, divide the total number of records to be stored by the number of records to 1 meter, i.e. 150,000 inactive records to be stored and there are 50 records to 1 meter divide 150,000 by 50 . Health records, however, are generally filed in serial order in secondary storage allowing for shelves to be packed to capacity, and this could allow for 80 records to 1 meter.

The reason you can get more records/meters is
I. No need to allow for growth of individual record
II. No need for working space since there will be little movement.

\section*{The calculation would then be:}
$\underline{150000}=\mathbf{1 8 7 5}$ meters of shelving required for secondary

\section*{c) Patients' master index_}
- Consideration must be given to the space the patients' master index will occupy. When all or part of the PMI is on cards, the space requirements can be considerable. The steps to be followed in calculating the space needed to file the index cards and guides are the same as those for the health record files

\section*{d) Planning space for personnel and equipment}

When planning for personnel and equipment requirements, consideration must be given to the functions to be performed within the department and the services offered by the department to other areas.

The floor space is determined by the number of staff, desks, files and other equipment necessary, and ample room must be provided for each employee. Huffman (1994) recommends that the minimum space allocated for each office worker should be $\mathbf{5 . 5 7 m 2}$, although this estimation may vary, it is still a good guideline.

It is generally accepted that the staff of a health record department are responsible for the initiation, completion and maintenance of a health record for every person attending the facility as an inpatient, outpatient or accident/emergency patient.

\section*{The major functions of a health record department usually include:}
- preparation of new outpatient and accident \& emergency health records and the update of records of returning patients
- assembly, completion and control of incomplete records for discharged/died inpatients
- Classification of diseases and the collection of morbidity/ mortality statistics for all hospital discharges/deaths
- Collection of health facility statistics relating to discharges/deaths, length of stay, occupancy rates for administrative and health department use
- Filing and retrieval of all inpatient and outpatient health records with an inbuilt record control system
- Medical secretarial services covering discharge summaries, operation reports, outpatient letters and medico-legal correspondence (using word processing facilities)
- Services to medical and other health professionals for the retrieval of health records for research and teaching purposes
- In some situations the functions of the health record services includes patient reception and processing in the outpatient department, admission office and accident and emergency center.

\section*{3. Staff required}
- Once the functions of the department have been determined, consideration should be given to the number of staff required. Hospital policy regarding the number of hours in the work week and the hours of service for the health record department ( 24 hours a day, seven days a week versus some other schedule) will be a major factor in this determination along with the functions to be performed, the number of annual discharges/deaths, OPD and A\&E
- Attendances (if A\&E reports are incorporated in the unit record) and research undertaken by medical staff.

\section*{(a) Forecasting:_}
- Once the HRIO has:
- Determined the predicted number of discharges/deaths, and OPD/A\&E registrations and attendances, and predicted specialized work, e.g. research, quality assurance, etc.
- determined the functions of the department and services to other departments
- determined the hours of service e.g. 24 hours $x 7$ days per week or less
- defined each function and determined the tasks to be performed
- defined how each task is to be divided into manageable work units or jobs
- analyzed each job to determine the content, skills, knowledge and responsibilities, and
- prepared a job description and job specification for each job
e) Health record officer's office space
- Since privacy is desirable for the chief health record officer (for talks with personnel, doctors, lawyers, administrators), a private office may be necessary. However, in smaller hospitals the MRO may prefer to be with the staff in the main department area.

\section*{f) Other special areas}
- A section of the health record department should be provided away from the flow of traffic for the medical staff so that they can complete their records or review records for research in reasonable quiet and comfort.
- A special area is often required for typists/word processors. Medical transcription should be confined to one area because of noise - sound proof booths or partitions help reduce the noise of typewriters/printers.
- A special area is often required for typists/word processors. Medical transcription should be confined to one area because of noise - sound proof booths or partitions help reduce the noise of typewriters/printers.

\section*{4. Equipment}
- For the department the number of staff and the functions of the department will determine the equipment required.

As well as planning space requirements for records and personnel, consideration must also be given to the allocation of sufficient space for the equipment required to cover the defined functions.

The major areas for consideration are:

\section*{a) Filing}
- Type of shelving to be used is important and it is generally accepted that open shelving is the most practical. It utilizes less floor space than other forms of filing equipment, allows for faster filing and retrieval and lends itself to any type of filing system used. Once the amount of shelving required is calculated, the amount of floor space required for the shelving can also be calculated using the width and length measurements of each bay of shelving.
- The space should also be allocated for aisles and it is generally accepted that main aisles/gangways should be......to .....cm wide and secondary aisles ...... wide.

\section*{- b) Computer facilities}
- The level of initial computerization would have been defined in the determination of functions and job analysis and sufficient space must be planned for terminals and ergonomically sound work areas. If the entire department is not air conditioned, provision should be made to protect the computers from excessive heat and dust.

\section*{- c) Dictating/transcription}
- Appropriate space for dictating and transcription services needs to be carefully planned to allow for ergonomically sound facilities and work areas. The use of a dictating service with a central receiving unit encourages doctors to dictate reports and discharge summaries promptly. Word processors are now widely used in health care facilities and appropriate space must be allocated to ensure efficiency and also the health and wellbeing of the staff.

\section*{d) General}

The number and therefore, space requirements, of desks, chairs, typewriters, telephones, filing cabinets and other office equipment will be based on the jobs to be performed and the number of personnel required. Staff working different shifts can occupy the same work area.

Department personnel should have a place to store their belongings (handbags, umbrellas, coats, etc.) safely. A tea or lunch room should be available for staff to take their break so that they do not eat and drink at their desk. Convenient access to handwashing and toilet facilities is needed.

\section*{e) Special space}

Space requirements for a photocopier, storage cabinet (for supplies and folders, etc.), book shelves, and any other special equipment should also be defined at this stage. If microfilming is planned, space for the necessary equipment, e.g. microfilm camera, reader-printer, jacket-filler, filing cabinets and work area must be considered in the planning stage.

The predetermined departmental functions, job descriptions and number of proposed staff, however, will enable the HRIO to determine the equipment and furniture needed and the approximate space required for the work area.

\section*{5. Functional design and logistical placement of key work areas}

When considering functional design and layout, a key consideration is work flow. At this stage of definition, the HRIO should prepare work flow diagrams to indicate the work flow from procedure to procedure or desk to desk.

Keeping in mind that:
- desks should be arranged so that paper moves in a straight line and only a short distance at a time
- desks should be next to each other for procedures performed in sequential steps
- Amount of floor space required will depend largely on record activity and whether or not data processing or microfilm programs are established, and equipment should be chosen for reasons of both efficiency and appropriateness.

The use of a movement diagram (Stoner, Collins \& Yelton 1985) which is an overlay of the flow of work through the layout can assist with determining that furniture and equipment are placed effectively.

When preparing a layout for the architect, the HRIO should be able to use appropriate terminology and blueprint symbols to illustrate the essential features such as columns, lifts, doors, windows, furniture and equipment, etc. This will give everyone including the HRIO, a visual image of the proposed department.

\section*{6. System of communication}

During the definition stage, consideration must be given to the communication system to be used within the department and between the health record department and other departments or areas.

Most health record departments require numerous telephones placed at strategic points within the department. In addition, some hospitals also prefer intercom systems between A\&E and the MRD, or the OPD and the MRD (medical records department)

If computer terminals are to be used, both as communication devices between the MRD and other areas and for the input and output of data, the cabling for such devices is an important part of the planning process. If the entire department is not air conditioned, consideration must be given to air conditioning the area where the terminals are located not only to prevent them from overheating but also to protect them from excessive dust.

\section*{7. Transport}

Consideration must be given to how the health records are to be transported both within the MRD and to other areas. If trolleys are to be used within the department they have to be able to be pushed freely between desks and files. If a dumb waiter or pneumatic tube or other automated device is to be used, special space provision in the appropriate place must be made.

\section*{8. Layout}

In determining the physical layout the following points should also be considered (Wakely, 1974, Huffman, 1990).
- It is important that full use be made of available space. Desks and files must be arranged to provide maximum efficiency, light and air
- to eliminate the hazard of electrical cords, attention should be given to the most convenient placing of electrical outlets for the use of any electrical equipment
- temperature control and circulation of air, i.e. adequate ventilation, fans, windows
- Adequate lighting - i.e. well positioned lighting (experts should be consulted as to levels required and correct placement). Workers should not face glaring lights
use of color - walls, floors, furniture and equipment (light colors for walls - bright for accents and trims)
to keep traffic flow in the health record department to a minimum, it may be desirable in many hospitals to have a reception and/or waiting area where an employee may attend to requests
employees handling enquiries should be placed near the main entrance
equipment should be near user and the doors wide enough for record trolleys
- desks should face the same direction with 1 meters between desks
- supervisors should be at the back of the people she/he is supervising - should be able to see all employees without leaving desk
- it is best to place the file space to the back of the department - it should not be placed near the main entrance (for safe keeping)

\section*{B. THE BRIEF PHASE}
- At the completion of the definition phase the MRO should be ready to prepare a brief for the architects which will include the proposed functions and services of the department, the preferred location, the capacity with regard to space, staff and equipment, relationship to other departments, and any other design features to be considered. Requirements may be illustrated by drawing a plan.
- The brief should include work flow diagrams, and a proposed layout with specific reference to ergonomic consideration in all aspects of the design. If the MRO does not feel confident in making determinations on ergonomic issues an expert in this area should be consulted

\section*{UNIT}

\section*{FORM DESIGNING AND DEVELOPING}

At the end of this unit you are supposed to be well equipped with knowledge in the following:
-
- $\square$
-
-
-
-
What is a form?
Definition:

It is a piece of paper or a card with a format, arrangement of questions or blank spaces for data entry

Uses of the form
- To collect data
- Record data
- Stores data \& retrieves
- It brings simplicity in M\&E (monitoring \& evaluation procedures)
- Transit data
- Simplicity in data analysis

Basic principles to consider while designing and developing forms
a) When preparing to design a form one must :-
- Know the need for the form
- Purpose of the form within the construction that apply such as budget
- Type of paper available
- Ability of the printer and ability of the user
b) Form layout

Refers to a number of issues and can be summarized as follows
- How information is displayed on the form
- How material presented is constancy with efficiency and economy
- Attractive presentation is an important secondary purpose
- The order in which data will be requested must also be considered along in logical connections between entries ,columns boxes or highlighting, will be used to size and type of print They need to allow adequate space for entries

A well designed form is appropriate to the work in which it is used for, permits easy entry, conveys information, clear instructions and it efficient to use
c) Questions to ask before designing a form include:-
-What's the general purpose of the form?
- Is the form really necessary?
- What benefits will be derived from the introduction of a new form?
- What information is to be provided?
- What are the operations through which the form will pass for example data entry and sorting
- How is the form going to be filled?
- Where will be attached ...side or top?
- Who will be users of the form?
- Are there any other special features which need to be considered?
- If a signature is required or authentications

In summary the general principles to be considered when designing a form
1. All forms in health setup should be of standard size ,they should be readable , useful and allow for the standardization of information the kind and size of type face ,margins ,ink paper colour , and weight should be standard within the health system ,hospital , clinic or primary health care
2. All forms should have a standard format i.e. where necessary include date ,name of the patient ,name of the facility IP (inpatient)number OP(outpatient) number and the name of attending doctor
3. The person who will be required to use the form should understand the language used in the form (sometimes conduct a training session)
4. Each form should have a descriptive title e.g. nurse bed side note, clinical notes, laboratory report etc.
5. All forms should have simple printed instructions for the use to ensure uniformity in the collection of information
6. Captions should clearly indicate the data to be entered for example just a name is not sufficient ,usually on wants "full names of a patient"

\section*{Technical specialties in form designing}
- It is more of measurements used in designing forms to enhance standardization as indicated below
- printers allow 5 mm before they start printing
- Allow 20 mm margin of holes to be punched or the form to be bound ,recommended margins
- at the 8 mm
- other sides 5 mm , expect filing margins 20 mm
- Spacing for handwriting; in general hand written character to be 1 cm , however it is important to remember that too much space seems to encourage bad handwriting

\section*{Diagram showing measurements considered in for designing}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_17_60afc56b7f70eef0d001g-082.jpg?height=889&width=1528&top_left_y=248&top_left_x=291)

The diagram above it is a piece of form in target to illustrate standardization measurements
- N/B pitch or font size should be 12 or 10
- lines that are used in writing guides they should have breakups or dotted for example

Name............. ............ ................... (Dotted)
Name-----------------------------------------------------
- The use of check boxes it is also very good and saves time for example male and female categories may be set up in a check box arrangement as follows

Tick in the box appropriately
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_17_60afc56b7f70eef0d001g-082.jpg?height=84&width=601&top_left_y=2164&top_left_x=733)
7. If one piece of data depends on another, put the dependent data after the other in the order to be filled in ,for example date of birth ,age ... previous admission date
8. The use of colour is effective but remember that coloured ink will affecting photocopying, microfilming in different ways colour strips along outside edge are most effective and help of identification of the form but may be expensive
- For form management each form should have a reference or form numbered for identification and ordering purpose
- A form committee should be set up, (a subcommittee, the health information management /health professional should be a member of the forms committee and strict control of production of health records forms criteria should be established

\section*{Pretesting of medical/health records forms}
- It is a way of measuring effectiveness of a given new/revised form or data collection tool before putting it in use
- A pre-test is the use of a form (or observing form performance) on a trial basis in a small pilot study to determine how well the form /tool works or serves the purpose designed for

\section*{Should check the following:}
- form Format
- Is it necessary?
- Is it too long?
- Does it satisfy objectives
- Is it right for the method?
- Does it provide instruction?
- Accuracy in Data collected on Indicators
- Natural Flow
- Clarity and Ease of Understanding

Often a form which is badly implemented and introduced to the user it is worse than keeping an old form, therefore evaluation and testing is important part in form designing and development

The medical/health record form it is pretested in two ways before launched officially
Primary \& secondary, this is according to the users or consumers of data/information collected by the very form

Primary testing:
Testing a given form at the primary level it is gauging its capability of being used by clients / patients \&medical professional staffs to better health care

Secondary testing:
This is testing medical/health forms capability in being used by secondary users in health, these are:-
- administrative,
- management
- research and teaching

Various medical forms used in health records departments are:-
- Case folder

Should have the name of the hospital, the patient's name, the hospital number, and the information "highly confidential" enclosed printed on top of the folder.
- In-Patient summary sheet

Contains complete clinical summary of the individual's stay and treatment given during the stay.
- Letter of referral

This is a letter given to a patient by a doctor referring to a hospital or health institution for further management.
- Prescription sheet

This is used for recording treatment and drugs given by the medical staff.
- Mount sheet

This is for mounting x- rays, laboratory and other reports. It should be A4 size and made of heavy material.
- History and continuation sheet

The physician continues to write the history of the patient's illness, the continued treatment.
- Operation and anaesthetic record.

There could be special operation forms used for different operation purposes. The name of the surgeon and the anaesthetist should be recorded on this form.
- Temperature, pulse, respiration and blood pressure charts

These may be destroyed after the patient's discharge; they are transitory records unless one is marked for retention by the Medical officer of Health. Fluid and Diabetic charts. These once could also be destroyed unless otherwise stated.
- Nursing Record

It should be included in the unit record.
- Notification of discharge and discharge letter

A letter of discharge from a health institution should be given to him and his doctor notified as well. In this letter the drugs prescribed to him should be recorded.
- Report forms

The report forms should be gummed onto the mount sheets.
- Post-Mortem reports

This should be the final document and should be filed in the unit file.
- Medical social workers' report

This should be inserted in the case folder.
- Pre-testing of medical forms

Before the form is used it may be tested by the users to see whether it has been appropriately been designed for the work it is going to be used for.

\section*{REPRODUCTION AND COSTING OF MEDICAL FORMS}

Very often "document reproduction" is interpreted as "photocopying, This is only one method of document reproduction. When a machine is hired photocopying becomes more expensive than when it is bought.

\section*{Photocopying}

Manufacturing are now supplying new models of photocopying machines at ever increasing rates.

\section*{Spirit and wax stencil reproduction}

This is a very special yet versatile method of reproduction. The actual medium of reproduction is a sheet of paper with fine clay-like coating on the reverse side. This sheet is placed over the sheet of hectograph paper, the clay-like coating on the first sheet actually in contact with the carbon surface of the second sheet. These sheets are typed with the information or handwritten. From the master sheet copies are made clamping to a revolving drum moistened by a spirit solvent. As the machine and the dampened carbon impression on the master sheet is reproduced in mirror form on each sheet. From a well prepared master sheet 300 copies can be produced.
Mechanical documentation uses this method also.

\section*{Other means of document reproduction}

Other means of document reproduction are offset litho and typeset plates. Offset litho depends on reproduction by either metal or paper (plate). The plate is placed on the rotary press and copies are made. Typeset duplication equipment is the same as most professional printers still in use. It is expensive to install.

Before equipment for document reproduction is bought the following points should be considered:-
- What kind of documents need to be reproduced?
- Is the material likely to be done single or double sided?
- How many copies are required?
- At what speed are copies required?
- What quality of copy is required?
- What will be the capital and the running cost-(important to consider)

\section*{CONTROL PROCEDURES FOR MEDICAL FORMS}

There should be strict control of all forms and records routine to prevent wasteful duplication in inefficient procedures. Obsolete and redundant forms should be removed from circulation and unsatisfactory forms amended where necessary. There should not be duplication of any forms. Forms used for ad hoc investigations should be withdrawn as soon as investigation is over.

The records officer should maintain a list of all the forms with a similar function to be kept together. This will give the records officer an opportunity periodically to examine, combine, simplify or eliminate the forms if necessary.

\section*{UNIT 13}

\section*{ENSURING QUALITY ASSURANCE IN HEALTH CARE SERVICES}

The learner should be able to:-
- Define Quality assurance
- Explain the importance of quality assurance
- Describe the procedures in ensuring quality assurance.

Quality assurance is defined as the customer satisfaction process.
The importance of quality assurance is to be able to:-
- Identify cases of patients who may be discharged from a health institution before being diagnosed.
- Patient record documentation and management be clear and available when need respectively
- Identify those patients who may have died and why.
- The types and results of health care rendered.
- The frequency of consultations.
- The occurrence of infections on all cases.
- Any other trends in the work performed.

\section*{Procedures in ensuring quality assurance}

It is accepted that there are professional and consumer components in quality care.
The six dimensions of quality that need to be recognized separately and each requiring assessment skills are:-
- access to service

What is our response to emergencies?
- Relevance to need.

Do we adequately provide for the need of our community as a whole?
- Effectiveness

Do individual patients receive an adequate standard of treatment?
- Equity

Do all members of our community have access to facilities and services?
- Social acceptability

Do we provide for patients' privacy in wards and clinic?
- Efficiency and Economy

Have we developed adequate measures of cost and performance?

The assessment of quality is both complicated and multi-dimensional involving the news to individuals and the much under questions of community need. Patients should be allowed to air their views on the services provided to them. How do we come across to our patients?
(i) Do we show concern about their feelings and about their need to be kept informed about what is happening to them?
(ii) Do we provide even the basic amenities to ensure that they are reasonably comfortable when waiting for treatment?
(iii) Do we provide adequate reassurance about the progress of their treatment?
(iv) Do we take them though Patient rights?

\section*{Procedures in ensuring quality assurance in health records.}

The health records department may carry out its evaluation of the services rendered to the patients through the Health Records Committee. The committee should see that the health records are complete. The committee should meet regularly and report regularly to the Senior Medical committee in the health institution.

The functions of the health records committee are;-
- To recommend to the Senior Medical committee in the format of the health record.
- To recommend policies for maintenance of the health record.
- To ensure that proper filing, indexing, storage and availability of patients' records.
- To advice and guide the Health Records officer, Medical staff and administration of the institution on the release of information from the records.
- To ensure that the SOPs in the HRD is followed correctly

In order to evaluate the quality of the record, the Medical Records officer brings to the notice of the Senior Medical committee all records which do not meet the level of quality. The committee analyses these cases carefully, and check a sample of those analysed by the Medical Records officer as adequate. There will be selected at random from the discharges for the period, or specific types of cases, varying from month to month so that all types will eventually be analysed.

\section*{The medical Audit}

This has been discussed fully in the previous chapters. This is an "objective method for applying a yardstick to the quality of professional performance'. It is a method of evaluating quality of medical care given to the patient and it is used as a tool of management to enable the administrator and the medical staff to uncover inefficient service and try to raise the standards of care in health care institutions.

\section*{Ensuring Quality Assurance in Health Care Services}

\section*{Definition of Quality Assurance}

This is a customer satisfaction process

Over recent years, the quality of documentation in the medical record has become an important issue, not only with the need to promote better health care, but also, the need by governments to reduce health care costs. In some countries, when funding began to be based on medical record data, it was found that more attention should be paid to the quality of the medical record and documentation of the original health care data.

In many countries, some problems facing administrators and government authorities include:
-poor medical record documentation;
- poor documentation
-large backlogs of medical records waiting to be coded;
-poor coding quality; and
-Poor access to, and utilization of, morbidity data.
To address these problems and improve the quality of data collected, and the information generated from that data, quality control measures need to be implemented.

The Medical Record Department is often the first department in a hospital to introduce quality assurance. As the Medical Record Department has connections with most other departments within the facility, the medical record is the best place to check the medical care and treatment of the patient. It should be noted that quality checking of the medical record often results in action being required by staff outside the Medical Record Department.

One approach to quality checking is for the MRO to ask staff from other departments to check the services of the Medical Record Department using a check-list. The results of these quality checks (or audits) are kept on a chart (or graph) in the Medical Record Department. They should also be presented to the Medical Record Committee for review. As the results improve, the figures on the chart are a source of pride for the Medical Record Department staff. This process is often the beginning of a reciprocal quality-checking program with other departments, which could result in an improvement in the quality of procedures throughout the health care facility.

\section*{Areas in which the Health Records Officer can Evaluate Medical Records Procedures}

There are a number of procedures in the Medical Record Department that can and should be evaluated. Some study questions that could be used to evaluate the work of the Medical Record Department staff could include:
-Are medical records filed promptly?
-Is the file room clean and tidy?
-Are Master Patient Index cards filed promptly?

Are all discharges returned to the Medical Record Department the day after discharge?
-Are medical record forms filed in the correct order?
-Are all medical records completed within a specified time after discharge?
-Are medical records coded correctly?
-Are all discharges for last month coded by the middle of the next month?
-Are the monthly and yearly statistics collected within a specified time?
To conduct an evaluation study, the MRO should select a time period for the study (e.g., onemonth), prepare a questionnaire, and determine the standard or acceptable level of compliance considered appropriate for the work to be studied. The results can be used to improve the services in areas below the required standard of performance.

\section*{Evaluating the Content of the Medical Records}

The content of the medical record can be evaluated by reviewing to see if the following has been done:
-the consent form for treatment has been signed by the patient;
-patient identification details (name and medical record number) are correct and entered on all forms;
-doctors have recorded all essential information;
-doctors have signed and dated all clinical entries;
-the front sheet has been completed and signed by the attending doctor;
-nurses have recorded and signed all daily notes regarding the condition and care of the patient;
-all the orders for treatment have been recorded in the medication form and signed;
-medication administration has been recorded and signed;
-the anaesthetic form (if any) has been completed and signed;
-the operation form (if any) has been completed and signed;
-the main condition/principle diagnosis has been recorded on the front sheet;
-operations and/or procedures have been recorded on the front sheet; and the MRO or staff member responsible for coding has accurately coded the main condition/principle diagnosis and any other condition listed (if required).

Again, a study questionnaire should be prepared and a standard determined, e.g., $100 \%$ compliance.

\section*{CONCLUSION}

The on-going process of care delivery must not be disturbed by the quality assurance activities such 2 of physician's behaviour.
No simple measure of the quality of care given to the patient is available. We have to live with th relationship between process and outcome measures.
Health records officers and clinical epidemiologists acting as health accountants should play as assurance programmes without losing their neutrality.
More good health care trials and more efforts are needed to improve the effectiveness of the ex programmes.

Any countries now have a number of computerized applications as part of a Health Informatio the health care facility. The aim of health care authorities around the world is for the development of an aute service that will increase the efficient retrieval of information for patient care, statistics, research and teachin Systems are designed to integrate data collection, processing, reporting, and the use of information improving the effectiveness and efficiency of the health service through better management at all levels o 2000).

An important point to remember, however, is that the use of a fully computerized system may impro efficiency of a Medical Record Department, but ONLY where the basic manual procedures are already ir

The development and implementation of computer applications require detailed planning and cooperation between the medical record officer, computer staff and the hospital administration. The first step in such an undertaking would be to review the existing manual system to define the data needs and determine the proposed data flow. Once this has been accomplished, the next step would be to design the data collection and reporting tools and develop procedures. These would be followed with a detailed program of education for all staff, particularly the persons who will use the system.

Medical record procedures commonly computerized in many countries include the
- admission, transfer and discharge/death(ATD) system;
- disease and procedure index; and
- An automated record tracking system.

\section*{Devise strategies in preparation for an EHR}

When determining strategies in preparation for the introduction of an EHR system, it must be kept in mind that the institution/country is in the process of introducing a major change within the healthcare delivery system and managing that change effectively and efficiently will be crucial to a successful outcome.

\section*{Strategies should include the identification of critical factors to success.}

They could include, but may not be limited to, a strategy for:
a) Patient identification
b) Documentation standards - for the exchange of information
c) Incorporation of provider signatures
d) Education and training of all staff - medical, nursing, administration, and clerical
e) Storing electronic health records
f) Risk management
g) Quality assurance
h) Personal Health Records - with the current trend for patients to be more involved in their own healthcare personal health records are playing a greater role in healthcare in many countries
The Steering Committee will also need to determine how they will communicate the planned changes and market them to providers and consumers. In addition, work practice issues need to be addressed as well as possible issues and challenges that may cause problems and delay in implementation such as lack of available personnel with technical expertise to operate the system; lack of data processing facilities; and staff lacking computer skills.

\section*{a) Patient Identification}

As mentioned many times, an essential step to be taken when preparing for the introduction of an EHR is to ensure that all patients are uniquely identified at all times. Some form of Unique Patient Identifier is essential to provide the linking mechanism that underpins the EHR. In many countries, national patient identification numbers are already being used. If this is the case in your country, you are already on the first rung of the ladder to implementing an EHR. If it is not possible to have a national identification number, the current system used for patient identification should be used and adapted if required but if there are problems with patient identification that need to be solved before moving forward. As previously mentioned, identifying information should be stored in a Patients' Master Index (PMI) and would include demographic information such as:
- a unique patient identification number
- medical record/hospital number
- date of birth
- sex
- address
- and other specific demographic information.

Currently, many institutions have already automated their PMI. If this is not the case, an electronic patients' master index system is essential when considering implementing angelectronic health record. Automation would
patient care and other uses such as research and teaching. The Steering Committee should identify whether previous health records will be scanned and included as part of the system, how they will be stored, and if the system will include emergency attendances.
The strategy should include what type of media will be used to store the HER Primary storage is usually maintained in the central processing unit (CPU) with information readily available online. When developing a strategy for storage, it's important to remember that speed and backup are important considerations as it must fully support continuous and instantaneous access to data. Secondary storage also needs to be considered. An EHR system stores huge amounts of data and decisions need to be made on the type of storage device to be used. The better-known devices are magnetic tape, hard disk systems, and optical disks. The latter are well suited for storing multiple media including images such as x-rays. It may be on-line to the CPU for real time access or off-line requiring on-line loading.
Other questions and issues on storage to be addressed would include:
-What are the environmental conditions? Are there any physical hazards?
- What control will there be for equipment and media? Who may have access?
- What contingency plans are in place if the system is down - secondary or back-up copy?
- What will the storage period for each record type be? - Local laws need to be taken into consideration; and
- A plan is in place for the transfer of electronic health records to new media before degradation occurs.

\section*{f) Risk Management}

A risk management strategy should be in place to address any foreseeable barriers to the implementation of an EHR. Elements of this strategy should include plans to:
- Ensure adequate funding is available to provide the source applications, hardware infrastructure and implementation resources with a funding/financial management plan in place to incorporate ongoing needs
- Ensure sufficient skilled resources, both human and technical, are available to provide program management during implementation and to give on-going support
- Develop and implement a marketing strategy to promote the benefits of the proposed EHR to consumers and healthcare providers such as brochures or a newsletter to keep personnel up-to-date with developments

\section*{g) Quality Assurance}

This strategy should set out the aims of an EHR, which should include improving health outcomes, population health, and the management of health resources and services by:
- Providing better information for clinicians to make decisions about treatment and care planning
- Supporting a best practice, evidence-based health system
- Increasing access to information for medical audit purposes
- Providing decision-support to allow clinicians to make the best treatment decisions for their patients
- Ensuring the availability of medical alert and prescription decision-support to reduce adverse events
- Providing information to support an understanding of service utilization patterns and better service planning

\section*{h) Personal Health Records}

A decision as to whether a personal health record (PHR) will be an integral part of the EHR plus the form it will take should be determined during the planning stage. In some countries a personal health record is provided via a smart card, like a plastic credit card. It is used to store patient information including identification and demographic details, allergies, and blood type, as well as current health problems and medications. They may also include the patient's photograph for positive identification. Patients carry their smart card with them when they attend a healthcare facility and present it to the provide who processes it via an electronic card reader. The
card is not part of an electronic network and provides detailed accurate information that is readily available. Such personal health records are popular in some countries and contain varying levels of information.

\section*{Develop policies for use in an electronic health record system.}

Policy development is essential to ensure that existing policies have been revised and redeveloped to address the implementation of an electronic health record system. A policy is a basic guide of action that prescribes the boundaries within which activities are to take place. It is important to identify how the proposed automation of health records will affect existing policies and procedures and revise them accordingly. Some policies required may include:

\section*{a.) Information Flow}

In a simple EHR system the information flow for inpatients should be the same as for a manual system except that data will be entered at the nurses' or doctors' station in the ward via an electronic device with other data transmitted electronically from other departments where the patient has received tests, treatment, etc. An existing policy on information flow should be reviewed and revised to incorporate electronic data entry. The actual entering of clinical data at the time the provider visits a patient has been an important factor that has restricted the implementation of a fully electronic health record in many institutions.
To overcome this problem, data entry has been improved by using a structured format that prompts the provider.

\section*{b.) Work Flow}

Current work-flow policy needs to be reviewed and revised to meet the demands of the electronic system as there will be many changes particularly in theMRD. Work-flow varies from one healthcare setting to another and needs to be clearly understood and documented before implementation.

\section*{c.) Content and Format of the Health Record}

The current paper record content and format should be assessed to see if they are suitable for adaptation to the electronic system. Forms may need to be redesigned to enhance data entry. The record format needs to be of a kind that will ensure efficient retrieval of needed data. In a manual system, procedures should be in place to enable correction and amendments to data entry in health records with strict guidelines for correcting data and reports. The same will apply to electronic data entry. In paper records, corrections in a record entry are easily identified. This may not occur in an electronic record and the computer program should provide an audit trail that shows when changes were made and by whom. Policies on how data is to be validated also need to be in place as well as rules for the completion process following the discharge of an inpatient (that is, how clinicians complete their records). Completion of a health record by the attending physician should be done at the time of discharge.
A standard form of patient consent for treatment needs to be designed with detailed policies and guidelines for its use, including how the patient's signature will be incorporated. In many cases the signed Consent Form is scanned and included in the EHR.

\section*{d.) Downtime Policy}

A policy and procedure needs to be in place to address issues relating to downtime and backup. How the system is to be backed up is an important issue and implementation cannot take place until this has determined.

There needs to be a policy on printing documents. It must be determined for what purposes a record will be printed. Ideally, for patient care, all entries and retrieval of data would be via the computer. Copies will be printed and will be traced by an audit trail to identify users who have printed reports from the system. This is to ensure that the patient's privacy has been maintained.

\section*{f.) Retention Policy}

It is critical to determine the length of time documents and data is to be retained. Information will need to be culled and a policy needs to be developed to cover what data will be retained and for how long. Other policies and procedures that may be unique to your institution and should be in place before proceeding to implementation should be identified and addressed.

\section*{Next Steps in the Planning Process}

The next steps in planning for the introduction of an EHR would be to appoint a team to oversee implementation and establish a number of working groups to assist with the development of policies relating to specific tasks.

\section*{1. Appointment of an implementation coordinator and an implementation team}

Skilled information management personnel and a well-trained technology workforce are essential for successful implementation of an EHR. An appropriate organisational structure also needs to be in place and key users made ready.
The institution/country should determine whether the Steering Committee will be given the task of implementation or a team of dedicated staff delegated for the purpose. Some members of the Steering Committee may be ready to move on as their specific task has been completed; some may not feel able to be part of the implementation team, while others may be both willing and competent to participate in the implementation. Given the critical nature of the implementation phase, however, two groups may be required the
Steering Committee to see to the overall implementation and a dedicated team to undertake specific tasks as outlined in the plan. An implementation coordinator will lead the implementation team and may have a title such as Program Coordinator or Project Manager. This person may be a member of the Steering Committee, someone already on staff, or someone specifically employed for the task. Alternatively, the institution/country may wish to employ a consultant or outside advisor with abroad range of experience in health information management and electronic health record implementation to assist the Steering Committee.
The implementation team leader will be responsible for coordinating the implementation of the new system. The person appointed or contracted for this role must be respected and valued by his or her peers, be a good communicator, a strong leader with good negotiation and problem-solving skills.
The implementation team (whatever its form) should include skilled workforce with the expertise to support the Steering Committee, implementation coordinator, and potential users. Remember that it is extremely important that all potential users are involved in the formulation of policies and guidelines to foster participative decisionmaking - vital to the successful introduction of the new system.

\section*{2. Establishing a number of working groups for specific tasks}

A number of working groups need to be identified and appointed for each specific responsibility such as a/an:
a.) Information Security Group - to deal with medico-legal aspects including privacy and confidentiality issues
b.) Education and Training Group moaded by Patrick Ngobiro (pngobiro@gmail.com)

\section*{c.) Quality Assurance Group}

More groups may be required and the Steering Committee, in conjunction with the implementation coordinator and team, need to identify areas needing special attention.
a.) Information Security Group - medico-legal aspects including privacy and confidentiality

The Steering Committee should appoint a team to develop and maintain a medico-legal checklist, incorporating government regulations, to guide the implementation and on-going use of the EHR. Remember that measures need to be directed at ensuring appropriate security and storage of information to prevent improper disclosure. Within the institution/country an Information Security Policy should Executive Steering Committee Providers and users Implementation Coordinator Working groups Implementation be in place, with standards, implementation guidelines, and an action plan. Compliance with such a policy will safeguard the accuracy and completeness of information and ensure that:
- Only authorized persons have access to healthcare information
- Dependant privacy policy and related legislation are upheld
- Information is stored and handled in a secure manner

Implementation of an Information Security Policy will ensure that information related to health encounters will be protected from unauthorized access when the EHR is operational. It is important to remember that for a manual health record system the privacy and confidentiality of patient information in an electronic health record must be protected at all times.

\section*{b.) Education and Training Group}

A training team needs to be in place to develop education and training programs. As previously discussed, onsite training is required to address work practice issues and develop a group of competent users, confident in their knowledge of the proposed system and ready to accept the change. The Steering Committee may identify the need to have more trainers than staff on-site during early preparation for the introduction of an EHR system. Systems have been known to fail because individuals required to use the system have not been adequately trained and do not understand the system. They also may not have been involved from the beginning of discussions and negotiations. Training, however, should commence with the more interested users with keyboard skills and a better knowledge of computers who will subsequently be used to promote to the less interested, motivated or skilled persons.
Remember, a key ingredient for successful implementation is user-involvement from the beginning. It is critical to success so too is training.
The first step would be to conduct a needs assessment to determine the level of training required for all data providers and data users. From this assessment, the Education and Training Group will be able to identify the training needs of users, determine content of the training program and methods of teaching and set up a schedule for classes. When the above has been completed the group needs to determine the location where training will take place and what hardware and software will be needed. It is also important to estimate the costs of training and how the programs are to be evaluated.
From the needs assessment it may be found that not all users need training at the same level and that different levels of classes need to be conducted. The first group to be trained should be the trainers and a program (specifically to "train the trainers") needs to be designed and implemented. This group will then take on the responsibility to train the rest of the providers and other users.
Training will be an on-going function and will not stop when the system is up and running. There will always be new providers and users requiring training before using the system.
It may be wise to consider some one-on-one training sessions for clinicians who may be reluctant or too busy to attend group sessions.

This document is available on StUDOCU
The training group would need to: Downloaded by Patrick Ngobiro (pngobiro@gmail.com)
- Prepare a training program with clearly stated learning objectives. The program should aim at not only educating staff but also ensuring that the value of the EHR in healthcare delivery is understood.
- Start training sessions with a "train the trainers" program to enable the development of a training workforce.
- Present the programs clearly and enthusiastically enabling hands-on experience.
- Encourage members of the health services to commit to reviewing work practices and endorse the changes required to implement the EHR for maximum efficiency gains.
- Prepare staff to participate in defining the new work practices and developing policies and guidelines to promote user-ownership and increase compliance.

\section*{c.) Quality assurance group}

A quality assurance coordinator and team should be established to oversee that data collected and processed are accurate, reliable, and organized in such a way that they are both readily understood and available when needed by healthcare providers. To ensure that documentation meets the required standards, quality assessments must be undertaken beforehand and continued on an on-going basis.
Poor quality data is a major hindrance to planning and decision-making and data quality is an important concern for healthcare institutions and governments, regardless as to how data is recorded and processed.
As shown in the following diagram the working groups will be responsible to the Steering Committee and should report back to the Committee on a regular basis.
Remember that an essential requirement for the successful implementation of an electronic health record system is the cooperation and commitment of all staff to the new system, including administration, medical and nursing staff, other healthcare professionals, and computer and clerical staff. It also must be remembered that just selecting an electronic health record system that has been implemented elsewhere and expecting it to work for your institution / country could cause disappointment if it does not meet your perceived needs or available resources

\section*{Factors to be considered when developing an EHR Implementation Plan}

When the type of EHR system has been determined, goals identified, issues and challenges recognized and addressed, some strategies devised and documents relating to policies and procedures covering the proposed EHR System prepared the next step is the development of an implementation plan.
Some factors for consideration when developing a plan for implementation are outlined in this chapter. The implementation plan should show all steps required to move from a manual medical record system to an electronic health record system. A successfully implemented HER system should promote and meet the specific, stated EHR goals of the institution/country. Most importantly, it should also improve the overall performance of the institution and the services it provides.
A sound implementation plan can mean the difference between success and failure
A factor to be Considered It is extremely important when planning for a change to an EHR to anticipate the impact of the introduction of work-flow, productivity, users, and patients.
There are many factors to be considered when developing a plan for implementation for example:
1. What computer systems does the institution currently have?
2. What form will the implementation take? Will it be phased in? How?
3. How will past data be integrated and old data retained?

\section*{1.) What computer systems does the institution currently have?}

Determine if the proposed system would be compatible with electronic data systems (if any) already in use by the institution/country. They may include:
factor to consider when selecting each site and the order the EHR will be implemented. When the first unit has completed implementation the committee and implementation coordinator should be able to assess the impact on users and patients, work-flow, and productivity before the next phase is implemented. Once it is determined that the system is working well, the next unit or units should be phased in one-by-one until all departments/units are online.

\section*{3.) How will past data be integrated and old data retained?}

By this stage, the Steering Committee needs to have decided how past data will be integrated and old data retained. Questions and suggestions to consider include:
- Will all old records be scanned and made part of the electronic record when the patient first presents for care after the new system is introduced?
- Will old records be scanned and kept in a secondary storage device and brought into the new system if and when needed?
- Old records will not be scanned but summary information of a patient will be entered into the electronic health record when the patient attends for the first with the new system in place.
- Old records will be scanned and remain in manual storage for a prescribed time before being destroyed. It is important to note that scanning past records could be very costly and that there are other options stated above. If all old records are scanned, a percentage of them will be records of patients who will never return to the facility.

\section*{Development of a Comprehensive Implementation Plan}

When the form of implementation has been determined, the Steering Committee and implementation team need to ensure that the institution/government is ready to move forward. The next steps would be to:
a) Select the best system to meet the needs of the institution government
b) Determine that the required technological infrastructure is in place
c) Determine what clinical data capture and data retrieval is required and what current data collection is redundant
d) Ensure that important policies and procedures are clearly documented

\section*{a.) Select the Best System}

Know what you want. There are many commercial systems available but individual institution/country requirements are different and the system MUST be able to meet local needs or be able to be adjusted to do so. That is:

\section*{- Select the EHR system that is right for your institution/country}

What system will best meet the needs of the institution/government? The institution/government, through the Steering Committee, needs to determine whether they want to build their own EHR system, or buy or lease one from a reputable computer systems vendor. All have a significant cost attached. Building one's own system could be time-consuming and expensive but should enable the organisation to design one to meet their specific needs. This, however, would require a high level of expertise that may not be available in the institution/country.
Purchasing a system already developed and implemented elsewhere would have an initially high financial outlay. As there are many EHR systems on the market selecting the one most suitable would require detailed investigation to ensure that it will meet the anticipated definition, needs, and goals of your institution/country. Leasing the EHR system would enable access to software applications managed off-site. The initial costs would be less than for the other two options but may prove more costly over a long period of time. Whatever system is determined must be compatible with systems already installed and also with other institutions with whom the institution wishes to share information and needs to interface byith@gmail.com)

A thorough cost-benefit analysis should be conducted to compare the options against each other and the costs of any proposed system against the perceived benefits, so as to determine the value of the system to your institution/government.

\section*{- Look at the total picture before committing to a specific system}

What you also need to know in selecting a system are the clinical information needs of your institution/country. That is, determine what is to be captured, stored, and viewed to support the EHR objectives. Developing a framework defining how clinical information is to be captured and represented such as lists, views, or reports in the proposed EHR is essential. The purpose of the framework is to help people developing or selecting the system to decide:
- What information should be recorded?
- How this information is to be described and classified; and
- What are the collection and retention priorities for information?

\section*{b) Technological Infrastructure}

The technological infrastructure is how hardware and software work together. There are many types of computer system infrastructure and the Steering Committee should review the current (if any) infrastructure and determine what is needed to ensure that the right technical infrastructure is available for the proposed EHR system. Briefly, it should include:
-A Central Processing Unit or operating system - The central computer performs all processing and storage functions and sends and receives data to and from terminals and printers.
- Input/Output devices - Current devices, if any, need to be assessed to see if they will meet the needs of and are compatible with the proposed system. There are numerous devices available and the type to be used must be compatible with the proposed system
- Network - If the institution already has a set of computers, ensure that they are linked to enable the sharing of software and data. It may be a Local-area Network (LAN), a Wide-area Network (WAN), or a Wireless Localarea Network (WLAN). An efficient EHR system depends on linking information from many sources. With an EHR system, two other network configurations using internet technologies are used, intranets and extranets:

An intranet uses Internet technology that enables users to find, use, and share documents.
* Extranets are used to connect a given institution to its users and business associates outside the physical location of the institution - these would be necessary if a longitudinal health record was planned.
- Supporting software - These are programs or instructions that direct the processing of data in computers.

Operating system software identifies input from external devices, sending output to terminal screens, keeping track of files, and controlling peripheral devices such as printers.
- Application software makes applications perform their functions.

Application integration/interface is software designed to work together without any external intervention Interface facilitates the exchange of information across different systems.
Messaging standards are also called interoperability standards or data exchange standards.
c) Clinical Data Capture and Data Retrieval

What is required and what current data collection is redundant.
- Clinical Data Capture

This is where findings and actions are documented by providers healthcare and data obtained about a patient in
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_17_60afc56b7f70eef0d001g-104.jpg?height=67&width=1729&top_left_y=2792&top_left_x=102)
Decisions need to be made as to how data will be entered andgeould include free-text entry or structured data
entry from pull-down menus. Most clinicians would prefer 'free text' by keyboard, dictation, voice recognition, or handwriting recognition. Technology is available for all these methods but there are a number of issues involved with their use and the Steering Committee/implementation team will need to investigate all possibilities and make a decision that will best suit the needs of the institution/government.

\section*{- Clinical Data Retrieval}

When obtaining healthcare data in real-time, access menus and navigational devices are used, such as a mouse, keypad, and scroll keys and so on, used to move data through parts of a computer screen. They are important as they enable a healthcare provider to retrieve data directly from the system. This is another area that needs to be fully investigated so as to ensure that the system selected or developed will enable data to be readily retrieved for patient care.

\section*{d) Policies and Procedures}

As mentioned previously, policies and procedures may need to be revised to encompass the change to an electronic system. The readiness of the institution/country for the change is extremely important and a change management strategy must be in place to ensure a smooth transition. Change management techniques should be used to help health professionals adopt a different form of documenting and using health information.

\section*{- Confidentiality and Security setup}

As mentioned previously, security must be in place to ensure that all medico-legal issues including privacy, confidentiality, and security are addressed. Security arrangements should be clearly documented and communicated to all potential users.

\section*{- Education material prepared and training programs for users commenced}

Education programs should start as soon as possible, but not too early that information is forgotten before it can be applied, to ensure that all users are adequately trained by the time the system is ready to 'go-live'.

\section*{It is important to remember:}

The administration needs to plan, advice, and educate staff, and work with providers and patients to ensure a smooth transition. All the above factors need to be considered along with others that may identified and unique to your institution/country. The decision to go ahead cannot be rushed. The institution/country needs to ensure that all issues and challenges are addressed, policies revised, and staff trained. They also need to be clear as to where they are heading and confident that they are ready to move forward.

\section*{Implementation Plan}

The Steering Committee, implementation coordinator, and team should now have a thorough understanding of the environment in which the system will be functioning; the information needs of the institution, functional requirements to ensure the system will work, and most importantly be confident in their ability to effect change. They should understand the overall scope of the proposed system and have decided what information will be loaded into the system before going live.
The decision to convert to an EHR all at once or in stages will also have been made. Assuming the decision was made to phase-in the system by unit or department a timeframe for implementation for each unit should be prepared. The first unit may take longer to implement the system than subsequent units. As the first implementation will be a trial, the plan may need to be modified before proceeding to other units. It is important for the implementation team to ensure each phase is functioning well before moving to the next unit or department.

There may be some unit managers who are ready and very keen to start while others may not be fully confident and wish to see how it works in other places before implementing. This should be taken into account when determining the sequence of units for implementation. When overall phasing has been determined and timeframes established, detailed tasks should be plotted on a plan. Remember that the plan could cover hundreds of tasks. It is a huge undertaking so successful implementation is particularly important. Thoroughly addressing all the relevant issues beforehand will help guarantee success.

\section*{Timeline for Implementation}

The timeline for implementation will vary from institution to institution and will be dependent on whether the institution/country has decided to implement the EHR system all at once with a "big bang" or phase it in by unit/department over a longer period of time.
Each step of the implementation plan should have its own timeline to coincide with the overall project plan for implementation. The timeline or project plan should be mapped out on a large board. Quite often white boards are used to enable changes to be made if or when required. Items would include a detail list of EHR project tasks with a timeframe for each task. Implementation may take days, weeks, months or even years. A realistic timeline should be prepared if possible but everyone should be prepared for changes if problems or unidentified issues arise which may cause a delay in implementation
The plan should contain the steps previously discussed such as the:
1. Review of current medical record system
2. Identification and addressing of issues and challenges to be addressed prior to implementation
3. Establishment of a Steering Committee
4. Preparation of a clearly defined statement of the type of EHR to be implemented
5. Identification of perceived benefits to the institution with the introduction of an EHR system
6. Preparation of a list of clearly stated goals and strategies for implementation
7. Review of current medical record policies and procedures and develop them to cover proposed changes
8. Appointing of an implementation co-ordinator and team
9. Establishment of working groups
* Security and Confidentiality Group
* Prepare a confidentiality, security and privacy policy
- Education and Training Group
* Prepare education programs
* Prepare the education site
- Identify participants
- Commence training
- Quality Assurance Group
- Prepare quality assurance guidelines and policies
10. Determine record structure and content
* Ensure a patient identification system is in place
* Determine an effective means of obtaining the patient's informed consent
* Introduce data standards and the use of a common terminology
- Other
11. Determine technology infrastructure required
* Cabling
* Terminals
- Other
12. Determine telecommunications infrastructure required
13. Determine how system wilthbegqrased iquilable on studocu

1. Site preparation; and
2. System testing.

\section*{1. Preparing the Site}

The sites for implementation need to be prepared. The extent of the system will determine the number of areas needing preparation. For example, will there be terminals for data entry and retrieval in all wards in the hospital, all outpatient rooms, and other patient service areas? Before the system can "go live", the technological infrastructure needs to be in place with data entry facilities in all point-of-care areas. For inpatients, they would include the admission office, wards, and other areas at the point-of care. For outpatients, they would require the reception area and all consulting and treatment rooms. All required cabling for all devices need to be in place and operable.
If a longitudinal health record is planned, data entry facilities need to be in place in all community care centres and outlying clinics. A detailed plan showing the infrastructure needs to be prepared and displayed.

\section*{2. Pre-test the System}

When the site has been prepared with the appropriate infrastructure, the software in place, all issues relating to confidentiality and security addressed, and all users trained (including healthcare professionals, technicians and clerical staff), it is time to install and pre-test the system at a point-of-care area in conditions that closely reflect actual situations.
The decision as to where the system will be pre-tested should have been made using a set of selection criteria which include technical factors such as the level of expertise of the staff, infrastructure support, and staff support (WHO, 2004). In addition, different levels of staff need to participate in the pre-testing, especially health professionals who will be both providers and users of data. The length of time the system will be pretested needs to be determined. Finally, the system needs to be monitored during pre-testing to identify any problems and to enable informed decisions to be made with regard to further implementation.

\section*{Determine Readiness}

Questions which should have been asked to determine readiness include:
- Are there any barriers still to be overcome?
- Has everyone who will be involved been trained and are they ready?
- Have any problems identified in the pre-test of the system been reported and corrected?
- Are we ready?

If all these questions are answered positively the system is now ready to implement.

\section*{System Start-up}

The day selected to "go live" should be on a weekend or a day when there are few patients expected. The institution may be able to re-organise admissions and close some outpatient areas. This would need to have been decided much earlier. In addition, it is important that on the day all staff is available and ready with support personnel available to provide assistance as needed. If the system was purchased from a computer company, key members of their staff also need to be onsite. When all pre-requisites have been addressed, a detailed implementation plan in place, the site ready, all users and support staff trained and ready, and the system pre-tested, the next step is implementation.
It is now time to 'go live'! Correct course if needed, and enhance the system. As mentioned many times, a major change such as the implementation of an electronic health record system is an enormous task and the staffs needs to be on the alert for any problems which may arise. That is, expect the unexpected. When the first unit/department has gone live it is important to review and correct any identified problems or issues as soon as possible. If it is not what was expected, it is a signal for course correction. When problems are addressed and expectations met, the results can justify further enhangements to the system.

\section*{Conclusion}

The principal benefits identified for the introduction of an electronic health record system are supporting patient care and improving the quality of that care. Accurate and timely health information, which is accessible when needed by both providers/users and consumers has great advantages for the healthcare of all individuals and would enhance the health and welfare of the community. It will also enhance the productivity of healthcare providers in the delivery of care, and be a strong support to clinical and health service research. Implementation of EHRs has been said to revolutionise how we collect, store, and use health information. Patients are expected to become more involved in healthcare decisions when electronic systems provide them with easily accessible and accurate information about their health problems and care. It is often advocated that healthcare practitioners tend to deliver better healthcare by being able to more efficiently provide up-to-date details of a patient's healthcare to others involved in treating the patient and by having better access to best practice and the latest research findings.
