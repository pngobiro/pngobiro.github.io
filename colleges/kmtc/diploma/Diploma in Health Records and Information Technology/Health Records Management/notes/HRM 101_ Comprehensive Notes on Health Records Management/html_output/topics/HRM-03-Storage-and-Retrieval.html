                        <p><strong>Filing:</strong> It is a process of arranging documents in a systematic manner for easy retrieval.</p>
                        <p><strong>Importance of filing:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Easy retrieval of documents</li>
                            <li>Easy tracking of documents/records</li>
                            <li>To keep library, office neat</li>
                            <li>It makes (M&E) monitoring and evaluation simple</li>
                            <li>Increases efficiency in a given facility or organization</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Alphabetical filing system</h3>
                        <p>It is an array of documents, medical records considering / using letters of their names alphabetically.</p>
                        <h5>Advantages of using alphabetical filing system</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>It is the suitable link between Master patient index card that is also filed alphabetically</li>
                            <li>It is simple to use compared to terminal digit</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h5>Disadvantages of using alphabetical filing system</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>It grows unevenly thus interfering with expansion space setting</li>
                            <li>It consumes a lot of time in filing and retrieving especially when they are a lot of medical records</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Chronological filing system</h3>
                        <p>It is an array of documents, medical records considering time or date when it was created. Mostly it is used in arranging documents, records in a case folder from downwards to upwards.</p>
                        <h5>Advantages of using chronological filing system</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Simple to use in small number of medical records</li>
                            <li>It saves in filing day to day created records</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h5>Disadvantages of chronological filing system</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Not used in big libraries</li>
                            <li>It is time consuming in retrieval of records especially in relatively large libraries</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Numerical filing system</h3>
                        <p>It is an array of documents /medical records considering different specific assigned digits, numeric numbers in a certain sequence. It has two main types:</p>
                        
                        <h4>1. Straight Numerical filing system</h4>
                        <p>In this system documents are numbered and arranged in straight line sequence i.e. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5... or 00001, 00002, 00003.</p>
                        <h5>Advantages of straight numerical filing system</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Simple to implement and use compared to alphabetical</li>
                            <li>Time saving in retrieval and filing of medical records</li>
                            <li>Suitable being used in small libraries</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h5>Disadvantages of using straight numerical system</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>It is uneconomical to filing space due to growing in one direction</li>
                            <li>It is used only in small libraries</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>2. Terminal Digit Filing system (TDF)</h4>
                        <p>Terminal digit filing (TDF) systems is the most often utilized filing methodology within an HIM department or medical library. TDF is the only way to keep files expanding at an even rate. In a TDF system the last two, three, or four digits of the number is treated as a single number. Since all numbers in the file are sorted by their ending digits, each section contains approximately the same number of folders, so the file shelves are divided for easy expansion.</p>
                        <h5>The benefits of TDF include:</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Files are equally distributed throughout the file room.</li>
                            <li>File room staff productivity is increased.</li>
                            <li>Shelf and space planning is more efficient.</li>
                            <li>Workload assignments are streamlined.</li>
                            <li>The process works in a large or small department and across specialties.</li>
                            <li>Process reduces transposed numbers. File location is immediate.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h5>Primary/Secondary and Tertiary Numbers</h5>
                        <p>To understand terminal digit filing, one must first understand the designation of primary, secondary, and tertiary numbers. For a number like <strong>24-00-33</strong>:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Primary digits:</strong> The last two digits (33).</li>
                            <li><strong>Secondary digits:</strong> The middle two digits (00).</li>
                            <li><strong>Tertiary digits:</strong> The remaining digits (24).</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The filing procedure is: 1. Locate the primary section (33). 2. Within that section, locate the secondary shelf (00). 3. File the record in numerical order based on the tertiary digits (24).</p>
                        <h5>Disadvantages of terminal digit</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>It needs trained staffs</li>
                        </ul>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>There are three systems of tracing most commonly used in a records library.</p>
                        
                        <h4>(a) The common tracer card</h4>
                        <p>When a record is removed from the filing area it is replaced by a tracer card. When the record is returned, the tracer card is removed, cancelled and reused. The information on the card includes: Date, Destination, Hospital Number, Patient's full names, Reason for extraction, and Borrower's signature. The tracer card should be slightly larger than the notes to act as a guide for re-filing.</p>

                        <h4>(b) Library tracer system</h4>
                        <p>Each case record has a small pocket inside with a card containing the patient's name and number. When the notes are withdrawn, the card is marked with the date and borrower's name and filed in a separate tracer index. This system is recommended only for a small library as there is no object left in the file to show where the record is, increasing the risk of misfiling.</p>

                        <h4>(c) Personal Tracer Card</h4>
                        <p>This card is created at the same time as the case folder and is identified with the patient’s name and hospital number. It is filed inside the folder and is only taken out when the notes are removed. An advantage is that if the record cannot be traced, the details of the previous destination may provide a clue. Also, there is no transposition of numbers since the number is created permanently on the card.</p>

                        <aside class="callout note" role="note">
                            <h4 class="callout-title"><span class="callout-icon"></span>Importance of Tracing</h4>
                            <p>The importance of the tracer systems cannot be overstressed. It is no excuse that notes cannot be found because the tracer is out of date. This will not help the patient. Like any other procedure, the tracer must help to achieve instant availability of the patients' notes when they are needed.</p>
