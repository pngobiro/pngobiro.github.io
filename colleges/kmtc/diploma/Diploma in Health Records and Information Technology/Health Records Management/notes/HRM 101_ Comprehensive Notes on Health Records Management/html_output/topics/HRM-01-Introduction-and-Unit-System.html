                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The health record is a written collection of information about a patient. It originates from the patient's first encounter or treatment at a hospital, health post or other primary health care centre.</p>
                        <p>The health record is thus a record of all the procedures carried out on that patient, while he is in the hospital or under treatment at a clinic or centre. It should contain the past medical history of the patient, including opinions, investigations and other details relevant to the health of the patient.</p>
                        <p>You might also hear patients referred to as 'clients' in certain settings. Sometimes these words are used interchangeably.</p>
                        <p>As a document it may appear in many shapes and sizes with varied information related to the care of the patient recorded by many health care professionals in many ways. In physical appearance, it consists of a number of sheets of paper or cards and may be placed in a cover or envelope.</p>
                        <p>In more advanced health care facilities, the information may be recorded digitally in a computer; the sheets of paper scanned onto optical media or the actual sheets may be microfilmed. (Microfilming is similar to taking a picture of the paper and storing it on a film strip.)</p>
                        <p>Also through data entry on a database where they are different types of databases i.e. MySQL and access</p>
                        <p>Edna Huffman (1994), one of the first medical record professionals in the U.S., defined a health record as "a compilation of pertinent facts of a patient's life and health history, including past and present illness (es) and treatment(s), written by the health professionals contributing to that patient's care. The health record must be compiled in a timely manner and contain sufficient data to identify the patient, support the diagnosis, justify the treatment, and accurately document the results."</p>
                        <p>The actual physical record should be of an acceptable size and standardized on suitable forms, as far as possible to enable interchange of information, from hospital to hospital, hospital to health centre, hospital to general practitioner or other primary health worker.</p>
                        <p>The record must contain forms approved by the facility and the folder itself should be of a standard weight.</p>
                        <p>It is also important to note difference between a medical record and a health record</p>
                        <p><strong>Medical record:</strong> it is a document created by a health profession concerning diagnostic procedures done on any client visiting the health facility</p>
                        <p>Examples:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>X-ray films,</li>
                            <li>Temperature pulse respiration chart - filled by a nurse / clinician monitoring those elements above either four times per day or thrice,</li>
                            <li>Cardiograph</li>
                            <li>Encephalogram record</li>
                            <li>C-T scan image (computer tomography image)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Health record:</strong> it is a general term referring to all documents created in a health facility concerning clients / patients visiting the health facility including:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Counselling documentations</li>
                            <li>Maternity records where the B1 are generated</li>
                            <li>X-ray films</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Point to note: all pregnant mothers attending check-ups clinics are not patients This is where health professionals prefer to call all people visiting the health facility for one reason or another as a client before undergoing any diagnostic procedure for approval to be called a patient.</p>
                        <p>The hospital or facility health professionals assist in creating any health record by extracting information from clients thus the owner of information on a medical he or she is the client but the physical health record it is for the government, but in private hospitals it is for the hospital</p>

                        <p>The learner should be able to:-</p>

                        </ol>
                        <h3>Definition:</h3>
                        <p>A health record is any written document about a patient in a professional relationship with a doctor.</p>
                        <p>It is a single repository data of a patient.</p>
                        <h3>Historical Background</h3>
                        <p>The history of Health Records runs parallel with the history of medicine. Records are necessary for the practice of medicine as medications are for effective treatment, and they seem to have been made from earliest antiquity.</p>
                        <p>The first real physician of health records in Egypt is Imhotep. He lived in the pyramid age (about $3,000-2500 \mathrm{BC}$) and was grand vizier, chief architect, and royal medical adviser to a Pharaoh of the $29^{\text {th}}$ century before Christ. Imhotep has been credited with the authorship of the Edwin Smith Papyrus. This papyrus is one of the most valuable ancient medical documents that has come down to us and appears to have been copied about 1600 BC from an earlier original. This papyrus is a roll over 15 feet by about 3 inches wide and is made up of 12 sheets of the usual size. It is written on both sides and consists of 48 cases of Clinical Surgery.</p>
                        <p>It had information on conditions like gout and tumours</p>
                        <p>In Greece Hippocrates, known as the "father of medicine" was born about 460 BC. He was the first to cast out superstition and to practice medicine on scientific principles. He was the author of the Hippocratic Oath, which is pledged by physicians and which, states in part:<br>"Whatsoever in my practice or not in my practice, I shall see or hear amid the lives of men which ought not to be noised abroad- as to this I shall keep silence, holding such things unfitted to be spoken".</p>
                        <p>It was short but it captured many things that surround patient care information i.e. health records professional ethics, confidentiality, disclosure, security of patient information, ownership of a health record etc.</p>
                        <p>Thus originated the privacy of all information given to physicians by patients, eventually the Health Records per see was, also considered as privileged communication. Hippocrates kept detailed case reports of his patients.</p>
                        <p>In the $18^{\text {th}}$ Century, Benjamin Franklin was one of the first leaders in the movement to establish the first incorporated hospital within the United States. This institution was known as Pennsylvania in 1751. Franklin served as secretary of the hospital, and many of its earliest records are in his handwriting.</p>
                        <p>In the $19^{\text {th}}$ Century in 1821 the famous Massachusetts General Hospital Boston opened. Is has the distinction of having a complete file of clinical records, with all cases catalogued, dating from the day it opened.</p>
                        <p>In the $20^{\text {th}}$ Century, it was not until the beginning of this era that medical records received serious consideration by other types of hospitals and especially by hospitals and medical associations.</p>
                        <p>In 1902 the American Hospital Association discussed Health Records for the first time at a convention.</p>
                        <p>In 1948 Health Records Association was started in Britain.<br>In 1967 the Department of Health Records was started in Kenya at Kenyatta National Hospital, Nairobi.</p>
                        <p>In 1978 the Health Records and Information Technician Program was started at the Medical Training College, Nairobi.</p>
                        <p>In 1990, the Health records and information officers program was started at the medical training college, Nairobi.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>As indicated above a good complete health record should encompass all information about a patient's health, ill health, treatment over a period of time and patient status at discharge. Health records are kept for:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>communication purposes</li>
                            <li>continuity of patient care/ treatment</li>
                            <li>evaluation of patient care</li>

                            <li>Education.</li>
                            <li>historical purposes</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4>Communication purposes</h4>
                        <p>Health records are kept initially for communication between persons responsible for the care of the patients present and future needs. Many health professionals often see a patient. In a hospital the registration entails collection of identification information which also includes the patient's financial status. Only those people that actually treat the patient should document in the patient record. Some of these people include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>consultants, physicians, surgeons, obstetricians</li>
                            <li>nurses</li>
                            <li>physiotherapist</li>
                            <li>occupational therapists</li>
                            <li>medical social workers</li>
                            <li>laboratory technologists</li>
                            <li>dieticians</li>
                            <li>medical students</li>
                            <li>Radiologists, etc.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Medical record staff will have access to the record to ensure that all documents are appropriately filed and organized and may also perform quality audits or research as requested by the facility or other agency.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Continuity of patient care / Treatment</h4>
                        <p>The patient may be readmitted to the same or another hospital or visit a clinic where all his past medical history should be available for assessment in the light of their current problem. It is vital that the primary health worker, who is responsible for the patient as a whole, should receive information about a patient's hospitalisation as soon as possible after the patient is discharged from hospital.</p>
                        <p>The main function of the health record department in a hospital or clinic, in this context, is as a service area, that is, medical records should be produced for patient care at all times and as quickly as possible. Also, discharge summaries and letters must be processed so that people outside the hospital may be informed of the patient's progress and their continued management after discharge.</p>

                        <h4>Evaluation of patient care</h4>
                        <p>In any setting in which an individual puts the responsibility for their health and well-being into the hands of others, there should be some mechanism that enables evaluation of the standard of care being given. In some countries, hospital medicine is evaluated by an 'accreditation' system. Surveys of each hospital are made and hospitals given 'accreditation' by a Board for a limited number of years, depending on the standard which they reach. Also, in some countries, the health record services of a hospital must meet predetermined standards. The health records is first and foremost of value in the present and future treatment of the patient.</p>

                        <h4>Medico-legal</h4>
                        <p>Occasionally, health or medical records are used to substantiate substandard care and are then used to find justice and fair judgement in court rulings. This happens with regularity in the U.S., England and Australia, Kenya and others.</p>
                        <p>The record also, however, protects the patients by documenting all injuries and diseases or conditions in the record so that there is no confusion about what happened to the patient.</p>

                        <h4>Statistical purposes</h4>
                        <p>Statistics are collected in hospitals, clinics and in primary health care centres. They may be used to tabulate numbers of diseases, surgical procedures and incidence of recovery after certain treatments; to assess areas which the hospital or clinic serves by collecting demographic details; or for public health or epidemiology. The morbidity and mortality statistics collected are used in planning health services activities, decision making, supply of drugs & equipment ,staffing and day today running of the institutions.</p>

                        <h4>Research</h4>
                        <p>In the past, accurate recording of observation in the health record would lead to accurate information required for research, but demographic and epidemiological information contained in the record is more often used today for purposes. The MOH (Ministry of Health) will use data reported from medical records through the current HMIS reporting structure to compare diseases and conditions across hospitals in the country and, in turn, will report data to the World Health Organization for comparisons throughout the world. The facility where the data is collected should also use the information to improve patient's care and also to monitor their progress closely for example:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The cohort registers to monitor clients progress in quarters especially the HIV infected and HIV Exposed infants (HEI) ,</li>
                            <li>Inpatient master index etc.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Education</h4>
                        <p>Health records can be used as an education tool or instrument. When the quality of health records is high the task of a learner is simplified and verse visa when the quality is poor the learners task is made more difficult and his progress is there for impended. The physician interested in a case may use the information from the records teach his students especially records created through clinophotography: these photographs taken during collecting information on physical changes and appearance especially when a client undergoes a plastic surgery ,unique skin diseases and other abnormalities encountered etc. .</p>
                        <p>Photos are stored for education purposes</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_11_17_60afc56b7f70eef0d001g-009-1.jpg" alt="A photograph showing a patient with a large ovarian cystadenoma." class="content-image">

                        <h4>Historical purposes</h4>
                        <p>The record acts as a sample of the type of patient care and method of treatment used at a particular point in time. Because all information is recorded in the record, those treating the patient can go back to earlier visits to see previous methods of treatment. Patients themselves can also access their records to verify dates of visits and treatments they have received.</p>

                        <h4>Administrative Purposes</h4>
                        <p>Complete health records mean increased and deficient to the patient and to the public, these will help to avoid vexation, litigation, fair settlement of claims and capacity to answer enquiries on how the institution work. Equally complete health records will assist the administrators in the smooth running of the institution.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Since the department has a variety of functions, it is necessary to organize the department into functions with employees assigned to each function. Or in small facilities, several of the functions may be performed by one or two employees. However, an organization chart for a medical record department may look like this:</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_11_17_60afc56b7f70eef0d001g-010-1.jpg" alt="An organizational chart for a Medical Records department, showing the Director at the top, followed by Assistant Director, Supervisors for various sections like Outpatient, Inpatient, and Transcription, and employees under each supervisor." class="content-image">

                        </figure>
                        <p>The person in charge of the department may be called a "director," "manager," or "coordinator." The number of staff or employees in each department will vary by the size of the facility and the numbers of patients seen in the facility. Some departments may have thirty (30) employees including managers and supervisors and others may have ten (10) or even fifty (50). Some large hospitals in other countries have as many as 100 employees. The number of employees may also vary based on whether the facility has a computer system or is using paper medical records. In a computerized system, manual retrieval of records is not necessary.</p>
                        <p>Organization charts will also look different in different facilities but it is recommended that the director or manager of the department report to an administrative official. It is also recommended that patient/client registration function report to the Director of Medical Records.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
                        <p>This is a Health Records system where one patient is given one number for the rest of his stay or attendance in one hospital.</p>
                        <h3>Learning objectives</h3>
                        <p>Students should be able to:-</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Define the unit systems</li>
                            <li>Describe the health unit system</li>
                            <li>Initiate the unit record</li>
                            <li>Prevent the duplication of the unit number</li>
                            <li>Describe the contents of the unit health records.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>The unit system is a health records system in which all health records notes relating to one patient are contained in one case folder- the patient is the unit.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Initiation of the unit system</h4>
                        <p>The change from the old system of numbering to the unit system presents no difficulties. From any given day it is simply necessary to assign a unit number to every patient attending for the first time. Thereafter, a six digit range of numbers is normally used ranging from 1 to 999,999 . Some health records officers prefer to insert zeroes at the beginning i.e. 000,001 but this arrangement is quite optional. When an old patient attends or is admitted at the first time his old notes are filed at the back of his new unit folder under the new unit number. Only the old records of the patients who present themselves after the appointed day are brought forward in this way the others, remaining in the old file under their original identification number. A tracer card should be replaced where the old record was indicating the new unit number.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Prevention of duplication</h4>
                        <p>Duplication in the use of unit numbers can be prevented:-<br>a) Either by not giving the same number to two patients<br>b) Not giving the same patient more than one number</p>
                        <p>In addition to the above the patient can be asked whether he has attended the hospital previously during registration. Whether the patient says yes or no a cross checking can be done through the patient master index to ascertain this.</p>
                        
                        <h4>The unit number register</h4>
                        <p>From the foregoing comments the importance of the unit system will be appreciated if the unit number register is maintained. In the unit number register the following information will be included:-<br>a) Full names of patients<br>b) Addresses<br>c) Dates of birth<br>d) Registration dates<br>e) Specialty to which they have been referred</p>

                        <h4>The contents of the unit health record</h4>
                        <h5>1. The folder</h5>
                        <p>When selecting a folder the following points should be noted:-<br>i. Strength of manila<br>ii. Method of fastening documents<br>iii. Clarity of numbering on the outside cover<br>iv. Cost of the folder</p>
                        <p>The folder should be made of tough manila with a gusset and single or double fold inside, through which are threaded metal or plastic prongs with which the loose sheets may be fastened into the folder.</p>
                        
                        <h5>2. The front sheet of identification sheet</h5>
                        <p>This is the area where all the patients' social details are transcribed from the pre-registration form. The inside front cover of the folder is sometimes used for this purpose. Space should be provided to record several changes of address and change of a doctor. A section is often provided here to list the consultants whose clinics the patient has attended or to whose wards he has been admitted.</p>
                        <p>It is important that all these facts should be readily visible to the doctor who is in charge of the patient, and who may wish to remind himself at a glance at the personal facts about the patient without hunting through sheaves of documents. Is also important that the information should be complete and accurate so that the person writing a letter to the doctor will address this correctly, or anyone writing to the patient will send the letter to the correct address.</p>
                        
                        <h5>3. Clinical history sheet</h5>
                        <p>Two types of clinical history are in common use. In one, each consultant has his individual history sheets on which he only will write. A patient currently attending three different clinics will have three separate history sheets although these are likely to be filled next to each other. An alternative way is the continuous history sheet on which each doctor writes as he sees the patient. This achieves a chronological statement about the patient which would seem to have many advantages. If the continuous history sheet is used, it is important that different clinics that the patient has attended should be easily identifiable - perhaps by using different coloured rubber date / clinic stamps.</p>
                        
                        <h5>4. Continuation sheet</h5>
                        <p>Some patients' attendance may be so short that their entire hospital episode is contained on one history sheet. This is not very usual, and continuation sheets are similar to history sheets but without any special printed identification of consultant or clinic which enables them to be used by all consultants.</p>
                        
                        <h5>5. Prescription chart</h5>
                        <p>This chart makes formal provision for the doctor to prescribe drugs for in or out-patients. The form must always find its way back to the case folder from the pharmacy so that the doctor treating the patient can see what previous medication has been prescribed.</p>
                        
                        <h5>6. Surgical operation sheet</h5>
                        <p>Special forms are provided on which operations may be recorded. They normally contain sections in which the names of all surgeons and anaesthetists taking part in the operation are to be recorded, and special remarks about drainage, blood loss, special recovery treatment etc.</p>
                        
                        <h5>7. Anaesthetic record</h5>
                        <p>As aesthetic techniques become increasingly sophisticated and complicated, the need for a special form on which to record the relevant facts has been rendered ineffective. Most anaesthetic record forms contain considerable amount of detail, filled in by the anaesthetist during the operation and immediate post-operative period</p>
                        
                        <h5>8. Temperature, pulse and respiration (TPR) chart</h5>
                        <p>There are two usual versions of this chart. One is the b.d twice daily chart for the recording of the routine observations. Urine and stool details are usually recorded at the foot of the T.P.R chart. A separate chart is often used for 4 hourly recordings for more seriously ill patients. This is frequently printed on coloured paper, or in coloured ink, to make it noticeable.</p>
                        
                        <h5>9. Report mount sheets</h5>
                        <p>Many reports which are smaller than the size of most forms have to be filed in the folder. They are usually mounted on a report mount sheet. These mount sheets vary in designs and methods of gumming. There are two possibilities, all reports may have a gummed edge and be stuck on the mount sheet itself, or may have a series of gummed strips on to which all reports will be stuck. Several versions of the mount sheet with gummed strips are available. The most popular and the most expensive has strips of self-adhesive gum protected with greased paper. The protective paper is peeled off and the edge of the report pressed on to the exposed gum. This procedure is so much agreeable than having to moisten the edge of a form as is usually done, unhygienic ally, with the tongue-that its introduction is extremely popular with all members of staff who have fasten reports into notes. The forms are filed one above the other, but with approximately one quarter inch or one third inch of the lower edge left visible so that the date and type of report can immediately be seen. In this way, a dozen or more reports will be file on one mount sheet.</p>
                        
                        <h5>10. Consent Forms</h5>
                        <p>Written consent has to be obtained for all operative procedures (which are technically an assault on the patient). For sterilization procedures, for post mortem examination-the consent has to be obtained from the patient, relative or parent (if the child is under 18 years) but in other countries it is 16 years. These forms are usually fastened onto a mount sheet, often separate one from those used for laboratory or other report forms.</p>
                        
                        <h5>11. Report Forms</h5>
                        <p>All investigations-laboratory (Haematology, biochemistry, bacteriology, histology) cardiology, radiological results in some sort of report form that will have to be fastened into patients' notes. These reports are becoming rapidly a very special problem, as they swell the bulk of the folders in rapidly increasing numbers. Some laboratories issue cumulative report forms each on which in turn replaces all the reports that have been issued previously but unless the previous reports are conscientiously removed there is no reduction in bulk. Computerized laboratory reports have not yet provided an easy answer to this problem as storage space is within the folder.</p>
                        
                        <h5>12 Clinical photographs</h5>
                        <p>When a patient has an unusually interesting condition, a clinical photograph may be taken. In plastic surgery, where the patient may pass through several stages of treatment, a photograph is often taken at intervals to record progress. Photographs may be kept centrally in the Medical Photograph Department, but they are frequently filed in the case folder, either mounted on card or in a special plastic folder with pockets for the storage of a series of smaller photographs or slides.</p>
                        
                        <h5>13. In-Patient Summaries</h5>
                        <p>After a patient has been discharged from hospital, it is usual for the registrar or consultant to dictate a "summary" (though this is frequently a substantial document) of salient points of the patient's progress while as an in-patient carried out operations or other treatment and condition on discharge are always included. A copy of this summary is often used as the hospital's full report to the general practitioner. The summary usually forms the document on which diagnostic coding is carried out.</p>
                        
                        <h5>14. Correspondences</h5>
                        <p>Copies or originals of all communications from the general practitioner to the hospital doctor, and from hospital to the general practitioner must be returned. These will include copies of the discharge note, which is traditionally written by the junior hospital doctor on the day of the patient's discharge, to keep the doctor informed of the most important points about the patient's stay in the hospital until he receives full discharge summary.</p>
                        <p>These are some of the more important documents normally included in the case folder, but there will be literally hundreds more in use in most hospitals, their number and use depending on the type of hospital. Students will become familiar with these forms as with the case notes.</p>
