                        <h3>Learning Objectives</h3>

                        <h3>Define</h3>
                        <p><strong>Communication</strong>- Is the transmission and reception of messages or Any means by which a thought may be transferred</p>

                        <h3>Objectives of communication</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>To get others to think or act the way we want them to think or act</li>
                            <li>To inform others</li>
                            <li>To ask and answer question</li>
                            <li>To listen to others (Listening is one of the most important communication skills)</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Communication Process</h3>
                        <p>We spend most of our lives communicating in to someone or another even when we are alone. We are picking up communication through our senses. The average manager or supervisor spends up to 80% of his time communicating during the working day.</p>

                        <span class="heading-text">Methods and Media of Communication</span>
                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>There are at least nine different ways in which we can communicate or receive a message. They are;-Speech, Sight, Sound, Action, Mannerisms, Taste, Smell, Touch, Silence.</p>
                        <h3>Speech</h3>
                        <p>Is an obvious method of communication usually is the one we think of first.</p>
                        <h3>Sight</h3>
                        <p>Is the most effective of all methods of communication because the mind thinks in pictures. The average person is able to remember a mental picture of up to 80% of what he has seen. Usually he can only remember or grasp 20% of what he has heard. This is why visual aids (Pictures, diagrams, charts, and films) are such valuable aids to teaching and why practical demonstrations are essential.</p>
                        <h3>Sound</h3>
                        <p>It plays quite a part in communicating a message too (a whistle, a car horn, a bomb blast military, music a love song)</p>
                        <h3>Actions</h3>
                        <p>Speaks louder than words, so it is said and it is often how he reacts physically, conveys a clear message both to the communicator and the receiver.</p>
                        <h3>Mannerisms</h3>
                        <p>Covers facial expression and other behavioural signals (a smile, a nod) to show understanding, a frown or head scratching to show lack of understanding. Look for mannerism when to communicate with a receiver.</p>
                        <h3>Taste, Smell & Touch</h3>
                        <p>All convey message to the receiver. For example there is no sugar in our today. The bearing in that machine smells hot.</p>
                        <h3>Silence</h3>
                        <p>We sometimes forget that we can also communicate through silence. This could show deep understanding of a speaker's words and unwillingness to interrupt him, but it could also show our strong disapproval of what he said.</p>

                        <span class="heading-text">Barriers to Effective Communication</span>
                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>There are many barriers which makes it difficult for the communicator to reach his goal. Some of the important barriers are;-</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Age</li>
                            <li>Socio-economic status</li>
                            <li>Language Vocabulary</li>
                            <li>Attitude- Senders or Receivers</li>
                            <li>Competition for attention</li>
                        </ol>
                        <h3>I. Age-The age difference between the sender and the receiver</h3>
                        <p>These age barrier almost always exist when two people of different age brackets are communicating with each other. A common language has to be found that will suit both the sender, who may happen to be a sophisticated middle-aged executive and the receiver and upcoming recent college graduate.</p>
                        <h3>II. Socio-economic status</h3>
                        <p>The economic gap between two different income groups is another barrier. For example a two car owner is not communicating when he tells someone who cannot even afford to take a taxi hat safety belt should be installed in the car.</p>
                        <h3>III. Language Vocabulary</h3>
                        <p>Barriers exist when the sender uses technical language to a group of laymen who have had no previous experiences in the area.</p>
                        <h3>IV. Attitude-Senders or Receivers</h3>
                        <p>Men of different political persuasions belonging to different schools of thought of political ideology or parties seldom communicate effectively of influence each other.</p>
                        <h3>V. Competition for attention</h3>
                        <p>There is much competition for attention of the audience at any given time. To be an effective communicator, you must be able to catch the audience's attention and hold it throughout the period of the presentation. A good communicator should recognize and remove all communication barriers before starting to communicate.</p>
                        
                        <h3>How to Overcome Barriers</h3>
                        <p>The sender must know his audience's</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Background</li>
                            <li>Interest</li>
                            <li>Language</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>As a communicator you must remember that your audience is a human not a machine or mere cogs in a machine. Every audience is unique. Each responds to the sender's message according to his/her own drive, attitude, motivation, his education or lack of it, his social background and his interests.</p>
                        <p>As a communicator, it should be remembered that knowing your audience is not as simple as it sounds. One must understand human nature and human needs. Study your audience thoroughly and use language that your audience understands in order to minimize communication barriers. Secondly the message must be timely, Meaningful and applicable to the situation.</p>
