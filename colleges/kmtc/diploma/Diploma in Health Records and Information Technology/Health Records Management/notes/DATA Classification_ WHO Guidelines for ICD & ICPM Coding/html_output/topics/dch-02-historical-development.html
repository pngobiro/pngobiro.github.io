                        <p>For all practical purposes, the statistical study of disease began a century earlier with the work of John Graunt on the London Bills of Mortality. The kind of classification envisaged by this pioneer is exemplified by his attempt to estimate the proportion of live born children who died before reaching the age of six years, no records of age at death being available. He took all deaths classed as thrush, convulsions, rickets, teeth and worms, abortive, chrisoms, infants, liver grown, and overlaid and added to them half the deaths classed as smallpox, swinepox, measles, and worms without convulsions. Despite the crudity of this classification his estimate of 36% mortality before the age of six years appears from later evidence to have been a good one.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>While three centuries have contributed something to the scientific accuracy of disease classification, there are many who doubt the usefulness of attempts to compile statistics of disease, or even causes of death, because of the difficulties of classification. To these, one can quote Major Greenwood: "The scientific purist, who will wait for medical statistics until they are nosologically exact, is no wiser than Horace's rustic waiting for the river to flow away".</p>
                        <p>Fortunately for the progress of preventive medicine, the General Register Office of England and Wales, at its inception in 1837, found in William Farr (1807-1883) its first medical statistician. He is well known for his initiative in making the best possible use of the imperfect classifications of disease available at the time. He labored to secure better classifications and international uniformity in their use and wrote principles that should govern them.</p>
                        <p>Farr found the classification of Cullen in use in the public services of his day. It had not been revised to embody the advances of medical science, nor was it deemed by him to be satisfactory for statistical purposes. In the first Annual Report of the Registrar General, therefore, he discussed the principles that should govern a statistical classification of disease and urged the adoption of a uniform classification as follows:</p>
                        <blockquote>"The advantages of a uniform statistical nomenclature, however imperfect, are so obvious, that it is surprising no attention has been paid to its enforcement in Bills of Mortality. Each disease has, in many instances, been denoted by three or four terms, and each term has been applied to as many different diseases: vague, inconvenient names have been employed, or complications have been registered instead of primary diseases. The nomenclature is of as much importance in this department of inquiry as weights and measures in the physical sciences, and should be settled without delay."</blockquote>
                        <p>Both nomenclature and statistical classification received constant study and consideration by Farr in his annual "Letters" to the Registrar General published in the Annual Reports of the Registrar General.</p>

                        <p>The utility of a uniform classification of causes of death was so strongly recognized at the first International Statistical Congress, held in Brussels in 1853, that the Congress requested William Farr and Marc d'Espine, of Geneva, to prepare an internationally applicable, uniform classification of causes of death. At the next Congress, in Paris in 1855, Farr and d'Espine submitted two separate lists which were based on very different principles.</p>
                        <p>Farr's classification was arranged under five groups:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Epidemic diseases,</li>
                            <li>Constitutional (general) diseases,</li>
                            <li>Local diseases arranged according to anatomical site,</li>
                            <li>Developmental diseases</li>
                            <li>Diseases that are the direct result of violence.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>D'Espine classified diseases according to their nature (gouty, herpetic, haematic, etc.). The Congress adopted a compromise list of 139 rubrics. In 1864, this classification was revised in Paris on the basis of Farr's model and was subsequently further revised in 1874, 1880, and 1886. Although this classification was never universally accepted, the general arrangement proposed by Farr, including the principle of classifying diseases by anatomical site, survived as the basis of the International List of Causes of Death.</p>

                        <h3>Jacques Bertillon (1851-1922)</h3>
                        <p>The International Statistical Institute, the successor to the International Statistical Congress, at its meeting in Vienna in 1891, charged a committee, chaired by Jacques Bertillon (1851-1922), Chief of Statistical Services of the City of Paris, with the preparation of a classification of causes of death. It is of interest to note that Bertillon was the grandson of Achille Guillard, a noted botanist and statistician, who had introduced the resolution requesting Farr and d'Espine to prepare a uniform classification at the first International Statistical Congress in 1853.</p>
                        <p>The report of this committee was presented by Bertillon at the meeting of the International Statistical Institute in Chicago in 1893 and adopted by it. The classification prepared by Bertillon's committee was based on the classification of causes of death used by the City of Paris, which, since its revision in 1885, represented a synthesis of English, German, and Swiss classifications.</p>
                        <p>The classification was based on the principle, adopted by Farr, of distinguishing between general diseases and those localized to a particular organ or anatomical site. In accordance with the instructions of the Vienna Congress made at the suggestion of L. Guillaume, the Director of the Federal Bureau of Statistics of Switzerland, Bertillon included three classifications, also known as the Bertillon classification causes of death:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>An abridged classification of 44 titles</li>
                            <li>A classification of 99 titles</li>
                            <li>A classification of 161 titles.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The Bertillon Classification of Causes of Death, as it was first called, received general approval and was adopted by several countries, as well as by many cities. The classification was first used in North America by Jesus E. Monjaras for the statistics of San Luis de Potosi, Mexico. In 1898, the American Public Health Association (APHA), at its meeting in Ottawa, Canada, recommended the adoption of the Bertillon Classification by registrars of Canada, Mexico, and the United States of America. The Association further suggested that the classification should be revised every ten years.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>At the meeting of the International Statistical Institute at Christiania in 1899, Bertillon presented a report on the progress of the classification, including the recommendations of the American Public Health Association for decennial revisions. The International Statistical Institute then adopted the following resolution/recommendations;</p>
                        <blockquote>The International Statistical Institute convinced of the necessity of using in the different countries comparable nomenclatures:
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Learns with pleasure of the adoption by all the statistical offices of North America, by some of those of South America, and by some in Europe, of the system of cause of death nomenclature presented in 1893;</li>
                                <li>Insists vigorously that this system of nomenclature be adopted in principle and without revision, by all the statistical institutions of Europe;</li>
                                <li>Approves, at least in its general lines, the system of decennial revision proposed by the American Public Health Association at its Ottawa session (1898):</li>
                                <li>Urges the statistical offices that have not yet adhered, to do so without delay, and to contribute to the comparability of the cause of death nomenclature.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p>The French Government therefore convoked in Paris, in August 1900, the first International Conference for the Revision of the Bertillon or International List of Causes of Death. Delegates from 26 countries attended this Conference. A detailed classification of causes of death consisting of 179 groups and an abridged classification of 35 groups were adopted on 21 August 1900. The desirability of decennial revisions was recognized, and the French Government was requested to call the next meeting in 1910. In fact the next conference was held in 1909, and the Government of France called succeeding conferences in 1920, 1929, and 1938.</p>
                        <p>Bertillon continued to be the guiding force in the promotion of the International List of Causes of Death, and the revisions of 1900, 1910, and 1920 were carried out under his leadership. As Secretary-General of the International Conference, he sent out the provisional revision for 1920 to more than 500 people, asking for comments. His death in 1922 left the International Conference without a guiding hand.</p>
                        <p>At the 1923 session of the International Statistical Institute, Michel Huber, Bertillon's successor in France, recognized this lack of leadership and introduced a resolution for the International Statistical Institute to renew its stand of 1893 in regard to the International Classification of Causes of Death and to cooperate with other international organizations in preparation for subsequent revisions. The Health Organization of the League of Nations had also taken an active interest in vital statistics and appointed a Commission of Statistical Experts to study the classification of diseases and causes of death, as well as other problems in the field of medical statistics. E. Roesle, Chief of the Medical Statistical Service of the German Health Bureau and a member of the Commission of Expert Statisticians, prepared a monograph that listed the expansion in the rubrics of the 1920 International List of Causes of Death that would be required if the classification was to be used in the tabulation of statistics of morbidity. This careful study was published by the Health Organization of the League of Nations in 1928. In order to coordinate the work of both agencies, an international commission, known as the "Mixed Commission", was created with an equal number of representatives from the International Statistical Institute and the Health Organization of the League of Nations. This Commission drafted the proposals for the Fourth (1929) and the Fifth (1938) revisions of the International List of Causes of Death.</p>

                        <p>The Fifth International Conference for the Revision of the International List of Causes of Death, like the preceding conferences, was convened by the Government of France and was held in Paris in October 1938. The Conference approved three lists:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>a detailed list of 200 titles</li>
                            <li>an intermediate list of 87 titles</li>
                            <li>And an abridged list of 44 titles.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Sixth Revision of the International Lists</h3>
                        <p>The International Health Conference held in New York City in June and July 1946 entrusted the Interim Commission of the World Health Organization with the responsibility of reviewing the existing machinery and of undertaking such preparatory work as may be necessary in connection with:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>The next decennial revision of "The International Lists of Causes of Death" (including the lists adopted under the International Agreement of 1934, relating to Statistics of Causes of Death); and</li>
                            <li>the establishment of International Lists of Causes of Morbidity</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>The Sixth Decennial Revision Conference marked the beginning of a new era in international vital and health statistics. Apart from approving a comprehensive list for both mortality and morbidity and agreeing on international rules for selecting the underlying cause of death, it recommended the adoption of a comprehensive programme of international cooperation in the field of vital and health statistics.</p>

                        <h3>The Seventh and Eighth Revisions</h3>
                        <p>The International Conference for the Seventh Revision of the International Classification of Diseases was held in Paris under the auspices of WHO in February 1955. In accordance with a recommendation of the WHO Expert Committee on Health Statistics, this revision was limited to essential changes and amendments of errors and inconsistencies.</p>
                        <p>The Eighth Revision Conference convened by WHO met in Geneva, from 6 to 12 July 1965. This revision was more radical than the Seventh but left unchanged the basic structure of the Classification and the general philosophy of classifying diseases, whenever possible, according to their etiology rather than a particular manifestation. During the years that the Seventh and Eighth Revisions of the ICD were in force, the use of the ICD for indexing hospital medical records increased rapidly and some countries prepared national adaptations which provided the additional detail needed for this application of the ICD.</p>
