                        <p>Morbidity usually relates to a single episode of health care. An episode of health care may be defined as:</p>

                        <h4>Morbidity Coding Rule MB1: Example 1</h4>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>A patient who has a history of Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) was admitted for a biopsy of the prostate. Patient was evaluated for COPD. Biopsy was performed and the final diagnosis from pathology results was benign prostatic hypertrophy.</li>
                            <li>Main condition as per the patient discharge summary:<br>
                            Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), hypertrophy of prostate.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Answer</strong></p>
                        <p>Main condition: GA90 Hyperplasia of prostate</p>
                        <p><strong>Other condition(s):</strong></p>
                        <p>CA22.Z Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, unspecified<br>
                        In this example, one condition was determined to be the reason for admission, established at the end of the episode of care. That is, benign prostatic hypertrophy.</p>
                        <p>COPD is coded as an 'other condition', as the physician documented that it had affected the management of the patient</p>

                        <h4>Example 2</h4>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>A patient is admitted to the hospital with pneumonia and congestive heart failure.</li>
                            <li>Main condition as per the patient discharge summary: Pneumonia and congestive heart failure.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Answer</strong></p>
                        <p>Main condition: CA40.Z Pneumonia, organism unspecified<br>
                        Other condition(s): BD10.Z Congestive heart failure, unspecified<br>
                        In this example, two conditions have been recorded as the main condition and querying the health care practitioner is not possible. There are no other details on the record that point to one of the conditions as being the main condition.</p>
                        <p>In this instance, the coder should assign a code for the first listed condition, that is, pneumonia. Congestive heart failure is coded as the 'other condition'.</p>

                        <h3>Morbidity Coding Rule MB2: Condition recorded as 'main condition' is presenting symptom of diagnosed, treated condition</h3>
                        <p>If a symptom or sign or a problem is recorded as the 'main condition', and this is obviously the presenting sign, symptom or problem of a diagnosed condition recorded elsewhere and care was given for the latter, reselect the diagnosed condition as the 'main condition'.</p>

                        <h4>Morbidity Coding Rule MB2: Example 3</h4>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>The patient presents to hospital with abdominal pain. Investigations reveal acute appendicitis with localised peritonitis and the patient undergoes an appendicectomy.</li>
                            <li>Main condition as per the patient discharge summary: Abdominal pain</li>
                            <li>Other condition(s) as per the patient discharge summary: Acute appendicitis with localised peritonitis</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Answer</strong></p>
                        <p><strong>Main condition:</strong></p>
                        <p><strong>DB10.01 Acute appendicitis with localised peritonitis</strong></p>
                        <p>In this example, the symptom 'abdominal pain' was recorded as the main condition, however it was determined to be caused by the appendicitis.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, the coder should reselect and code acute appendicitis with localised peritonitis as the 'main condition'.</p>

                        <h3>Morbidity Coding Rule MB3</h3>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Signs and symptoms recorded as 'main condition' with alternative conditions recorded as the cause</li>
                            <li>Where a symptom or sign is recorded as the 'main condition' with documentation that it may be due to either one condition or another, select the symptom or sign as the 'main condition'.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Morbidity Coding Rule MB3: Example 4</h4>
                        <p>A patient is admitted to the hospital with a headache.<br>
                        * Main condition as per the patient discharge summary:</p>
                        <p>Headache due to tension or acute sinusitis.</p>
                        <p><strong>Answer</strong></p>
                        <p>Main condition: MB6Y Other specified symptoms or signs involving the nervous system<br>
                        In this example, the symptom 'headache' is recorded as the main condition, with two possible causes. Therefore, the coder should code headache as the 'main condition'.</p>

                        <p>Type 1 extension codes allow the user to add detail to a stem code. The category refers to the same diagnosis with or without the Type I extension code. These extension codes provide important additional information, such as whether a condition is acute or chronic - and where it is located.</p>
                        <p>Type 2 extension codes represent diagnosis code descriptors. The meaning of the code refers to the same condition, but the use of type 2 - diagnosis code descriptor extension code alters its interpretation.</p>
