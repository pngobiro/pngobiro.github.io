                        <h3>Outpatient records</h3>
                        <p>In the outpatient we have information on preventive, curative, health promotion and rehabilitative services. We have information on vertical programs such as</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Patient support centre</li>
                            <li>KEPI currently DVI</li>
                            <li>Maternal and Child Health</li>
                            <li>Family planning.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Each of these vertical programs has its own health information system. Each information system gives different health statistics for example from DVI we can get immunization coverage and the number of mothers who have received tetanus toxoid.</p>
                        <p>The information can be used for planning and management of the health facility.</p>
                        <p>Several reports are prepared at the outpatient department such as;</p>

                        <h3>Inpatient records</h3>
                        <p>In the inpatient department we collect information on curative services from all patients stay in the health facilities. Upon discharge the health records personnel collects patients records and calculates the following hospital statistics, Bed occupancy, ALOS, TOI, VBD etc.</p>
                        <p>The statistics are used to monitor the operational efficiency of the health facility.</p>

                        <h3>Notification of infectious diseases</h3>
                        <p>These are limited to infectious diseases. They are important indicators that show the presence of communicable diseases in the community. It helps to identify the need for control and prevention action.</p>

                        <h3>Registration of births and deaths</h3>
                        <p>The information on births and deaths is a vital element of vital statistics. Health begins at birth and end in death.</p>
                        <p>This information is important in projecting population growth rate and mortality rates.</p>

                        <h3>Surveys</h3>
                        <p>They are periodic methods of collecting health care data using sample population. There are two types;</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Formal surveys; they are sample based surveys. They are scientific in design.</li>
                            <li>Informal surveys; they are like home visits conducted by health workers.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Community based health care projects</h3>
                        <p>They are run by NGO's. Its main aim is to stimulate individuals and local communities to determine their own health care needs. They also initiate interventions.</p>
                        <p>In the CBHCP, people determine their own needs and decide on PHC activities to solve their health problems on a self help basis. Individuals, families and community members should be encouraged to participate in health promotion activities.</p>

                        <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
                        <p>The inability to generate reliable information needed to make decisions based on evidence is a major obstacle to public health services. Public health decision-making is critically dependent on the timely availability of sound data. The role of the Health Information System is to generate, analyze and disseminate such data. "Nothing exists until it is measured" the physicist Niels Bohr famously stated in 1930. The work of John Snow during the Cholera epidemics that ravaged London in the mid 1800s is an early example of an epidemiological investigation. Snow's groundbreaking work was made possible by the registers of births and deaths maintained by local authorities in every English parish from the early 1800s. Without information on numbers of deaths from cholera and the street address of each victim, Snow's mapping of mortality in relation to the sitting of water pumps would not have been possible.</p>
                        <p>Counting deaths is one component of the health information system, an integrated effort to collect, process, report and use health information and knowledge to influence policy-making, programme action and research.</p>
                        <p>The critical elements in Health Information System (HIS) are usually to turn raw data into useful form and extrapolate this through sector indicators. The main components are:-</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Data collection</li>
                            <li>Data processing</li>
                            <li>Data reporting</li>
                            <li>Data dissemination and use.</li>

                            <li>At the district, once all the reports from the health facilities have been received, summaries should be promptly made.</li>
                            <li>The district MUST maintain a checklist of all reports and all facilities and check the reports against the facilities to ensure completeness and timeliness.</li>
                            <li>Using a copy of the summaries made, districts MUST analyze and share the information at their level.</li>
                            <li>Districts should submit the summaries to the province or national level on or before 15th of the following month and give feedback to the health facilities.</li>
                            <li>The province collects all the district reports, make copies (manual or electronic) do the analysis and use the information as they make arrangement to transmit the summaries to the national level before 21st of the following month if data flows through the province inform of hard copies.</li>
                            <li>Likewise, provinces should make and maintain a checklist of the reports and districts to ensure timeliness and completeness. They must give feedback to the districts and share the report at that level.</li>
                            <li>To maintain accuracy in recording data collected through tally sheets, health workers should tally from the registers on daily basis.</li>
                            <li>The national level data repository (HIS) should acknowledge receipt, process and analyze the data and give feedback to the lower levels and share the information horizontally and vertically.</li>

                          <p>Tally sheets are working sheets on which data is recorded to facilitate ease of count at the time of making summaries.</p>
                          <p>Proper understanding of the content of each tally sheet is essential. The proper way of making a tally is to slash a zero with forward slash (Killing one zero at ago) for example 0</p>
                          <p>Tallies are normally made immediately a clinician is through with a patient/ client before attending to the next and at the end of the day or early next morning from the register. This depends on circumstances at the facility.</p>

                          <h3>How to handle the Summary sheets</h3>
                          <p>Summary sheets will be completed at the end of the specified period, either from tally sheet or registers or any other source documents. As the health facility submits the summaries to the next level, a copy must remain in the health facility.</p>

                          <h3>Summaries:</h3>
                          <p>If the health information system forms are so complicated that those who are to complete them cannot understand them or the forms are not available all the time, data will not be collected properly. Therefore, every effort must be made to simplify forms and to ensure that there is a constant supply of them. Such forms can have a space for some simple on the spot analysis e.g. total numbers or percentage to be calculated.</p>
