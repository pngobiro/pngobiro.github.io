                        <p>The linkage Community unit levels of institution may Community unit it in principle the flow of information is bottom top bottom. Data is collected, processed, analyzed, interpreted and a report written.</p>
                        <p>The principle that needs to be emphasized about health information collection and use is that data flows in systems and is made up of individuals and departments. If one link is weak, the entire system suffers.</p>
                        <p>Data collection is closely related to data use. Any improvement in collection of data is not enough without a corresponding improvement in its use.</p>
                        <p>Managers who use data are likely to encourage its collection.</p>
                        <p>Health information is a vital resource for health planning, implementation and evaluation. Data users include everyone in the delivery system, ranging from individuals, patients, clients, county planners, national planners and international donor agencies.</p>
                        <p>Uses of data likewise range from monitoring of individual health, nutritional programs, evaluation and long term policy development.</p>
                        <p>It is absolutely essential to be selective and identify priority areas for data collection, since data collectors have limited capacity and data users have limited interests. The collection of data that will not be useful is wasteful.</p>

                                <h4>What is a Community Health Unit?</h4>
                                <p>This is a health service delivery structure within a defined geographical area covering a population of approximately 5,000 people.

                                <p>It is governed by a Community Health Committee (CHC) and each Community Health unit is linked to a specific Health facility.</p>
                                <h4>Why Community Health Units?</h4>
                                <p>To bring services closer to the people using innovative approaches that empowers them to be responsible for their own health.</p>
                                <h4>Services Available at Community Health Units (CHUs)</h4>

                                <p>The network of health centers provides many of the ambulatory health services. Health centres generally offer preventive and curative services, mostly adapted to local needs.</p>
                                <p>Dispensaries are meant to be the system's first line of contact with patients, but in some areas, health centres or even hospitals are effectively the first points of contact. Dispensaries provide wider coverage for preventive health measures, which is a primary goal of the health policy.</p>

                                <strong>Tier 3: County Level</strong> - Provision of primary referral services - previous KEPH level 4 District hospitals concentrate on the delivery of health care services and generate their own expenditure plans and budget requirements based on guidelines from headquarters through the provinces.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Tier 4: National Level:</strong> Provision of secondary and specialized services - previous KEPH Level's 5 and 6
                                <p>Provincial hospitals act as referral hospitals to their district hospitals. They also provide very specialized care. The provincial level acts as an intermediary between the national central level and the districts. They oversee the implementation of health policy at the district level, maintain quality standards, and coordinate and control all district health activities. Similar private hospitals at the provincial level include Aga Khan Hospitals in Kisumu and Mombasa.</p>
                                <p>National referral hospitals are at the apex of the health care system, providing sophisticated diagnostic, therapeutic, and rehabilitative services. The two national referral hospitals are Kenyatta National Hospital in Nairobi and Moi Referral and Teaching Hospital in Eldoret. The equivalent private referral hospitals are Nairobi Hospital and Aga Khan Hospital in Nairobi.</p>
