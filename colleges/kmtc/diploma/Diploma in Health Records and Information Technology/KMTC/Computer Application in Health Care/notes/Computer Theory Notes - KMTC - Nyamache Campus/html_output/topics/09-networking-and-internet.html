                        <p>A network is an arrangement that enables two or more computers to communicate (talk) to each other.</p>
                        <h3>Types of Networks</h3>
                        <p>Networks can range from a small group of computers linked together in a class room to thousands of computers linked together across the globe. Depending on the geographical location, networks can be classified as:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>a. LAN ( Local Area Network)</li>
                            <li>b. MAN ( Metropolitan Area Network)</li>
                            <li>c. WAN (Wide Area Network)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Local Area Network (LAN):</strong> If a network is confined to a single location, typically a building, it is called a LAN. Example: Set of interconnected computers within an office.</p>
                        <p><strong>Metropolitan Area Network (MAN):</strong> A metropolitan area network is a network that is larger than a LAN, it connects the computers distributed across multiple buildings. Example: the computers in all branches of an office within a city.</p>
                        <p><strong>Wide Area Network (WAN):</strong> When a network is located over wide areas such as cities, states, countries or even continents, it is called a WAN. Example: Computers in different branches of a Globalised company.</p>

                        <p>The internet is a global connection of computers. These computers are connected via a huge network of telecommunication links. The internet allows you to access to a whole resource of data and information stored at different sites (called hosts) and locations around the world. The communication links which inter connect each host computer use a common method of transmission known as TCP/IP, which stands for Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Internet connection helps us to:</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Read information on a wide range of topics</li>
                            <li>Send or receive E-mail</li>
                            <li>Down load useful programs such as virus detectors, file compression, decompression utility etc.,</li>
                            <li>Share your opinions and your knowledge on a variety of topics through various new groups.</li>
                            <li>Chat with other people anywhere in the world</li>
                            <li>View interesting video's listen to music or wander through a 3-D world.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3>Requirements for connecting to the Internet:</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>a) Modem:</strong> A modem is a peripheral device that allows a computer to connect and communicate with other computers. Modem stands for Modulator Demodulator.</li>
                            <li><strong>b) Web Browser:</strong> A browser is a software program that is necessary in order to view web pages on the web. Ex: Internet Explorer, Netscape Navigator, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft outlook express etc.</li>
                            <li><strong>c) Telephone line:</strong> A telephone line is required to transfer data from one computer to another. The computer is connected to a modem, which, in turn, connected to a telephone line.</li>
                            <li><strong>d) Subscription with Internet service provider (ISP):</strong> ISP's are companies that provide access to the internet. We need subscription with any ISP to get an Internet connection. Some of the ISPs in India are VSNL, MTNL, Sify, Specrta Net etc.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>World Wide Web (WWW):</h3>
                        <p>It refers to the collection of information accessible on the internet. The web is similar to a library. It consists of millions and millions of pages of text, pictures, sounds and animation on various topics. These pages, called web pages are stored on different computers that are connected to the internet. The web pages have links between them i.e when we click a certain word or picture in a page, it will take us to another page. These words or pictures that help to move from one page to another are called hyperlinks. A collection of related web pages is known as a web site. A web site can be accessed by means of a unique name assigned to it.</p>
                        <p>Internet was initially designed for the transmission of text basing on the protocols mentioned. In order to transmit a graphically designed web page complete with pictures, embedded sound and animation a special language was designed which is referred to as <strong>Hyper Text Mark up Language (HTML)</strong>. HTML uses special text codes to define the various elements of a web page. The WWW support a protocol called <strong>Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP)</strong>. All internet servers cannot support HTTP and so the web can be regarded as a subset of the larger internet. HTTP provides a method of transmitting a professionally laid out page over the text based internet.</p>
                        <p><strong>Uniform Resource Locator (URL):</strong> Each web site has a unique address commonly referred to as a URL. A URL specifies the exact location of the web page on the internet.</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>It is much faster than the normal mail. Messages can be sent within a matter of seconds to any part in the world.</li>
