                        <p>Medical records in most health care institution are filed numerically according to patients' medical records numbers. In the past some hospitals have filed records according to patients' names, discharge numbers, or diagnostic code number. Alphabetic filling by discharge numbers are more cumbersome and subject to more errors than numerical filling. Filing by discharge number and diagnostic code number is generally unsatisfactory because other important records or registers in the facility are concerned exclusively with medical records numbers</p>
                        
                        <h3>1. NUMBERING SYSTEM</h3>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Most of the information contained so far in this section is related being admitted from the W/L, although similar steps have been taken when a patient is admitted as an emergency. The bed bureau is the section of the medical records departments arranges admission for emergency patients. The functions of the bureau is to receive the telephone calls from the GPS who wish a patient to be admitted in emergency, To pass the information to the accident and emergency departments or to whichever department which receives the emergency admission to initiate the retrieval of the old (notes) case records.</p>
                        <p>The actual decision as to whether a patient is finally admitted rests with the doctor, who examines the patient when he comes to hospital. The bed bureau as mentioned is a method by which it can keep up to date with the bed state of the hospital. This board may consist of a series of looks, slotted racks, peg hard .etc. divided into as many sections as there wards within each section will be as many divisions as there are beds in that ward. Each section is headed with the name or number of the ward and the number of beds. It contains when a patient is admitted something will be put into its slot or onto the look to represent that patient, in that ward. Using this card in the slot, will give the patients details indicating the occupied bed.</p>
                        <p>A bed bureau can save a great deal of medical and nursing time in locating empty beds in emergency admissions. They can help to make bed use what is one of the hospitals most expensive item. The inpatient bed and assist GPs and hospital staffs to arrange emergency admission as quickly as possible. A bed bureau may act for one large hospital or a group of hospitals, if it is dealing with emergency admission to several hospitals some of the procedures suggested would have to be modified but, the general principle would be similar. The key note of success is good liaison with wards, GPs Accident and Emergency departments' admission office and the medical records department. All these sections are involved in some parts of the admission procedures for emergency patients and must be aware of the functions of the bureau.</p>

                        <h3>Location of a bed bureau</h3>
                        <p>It is possible to combine the function of admission office and the bed bureau so that the same are dealing with waiting list and emergency admission. In this instance, the office must be reasonably near the ward which is also convenient when staff make their visits to the wards. It may however be situated some distance from the wards. Accident and Emergency department and admissions office and still function satisfactory provided liaison and good personal relationship with all the departments concerned.</p>

                        <p>Daily ward statement is a return made by each ward at the same time each day relating to the movement of the patients in to the ward and out of the ward. Some hospitals check/take the daily counts at 12.00 mid night and others at 8.00 am . The advantage of an 8.00 am count is that all the nights emergency admission will be included and various departments convened will automatically have more up to date information at the start of the working day. Whatever time is chosen it must be the same time for all wards in the hospitals and the time of the count must appear on the form itself the statement made in the separate pile of paper, one being completed each day.</p>
                        <p>The statement must include the following information;</p>
                        <ul>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h3>STATISTICS INCLUDING H.A.A</h3>
                        <p>The daily ward statement provides figures that are the basis of hospital economics and the management as far as inpatients are concerned. It is the source document for many financial and administrative that gives the statistics on which planning of resources will be based e.g. The number of beds that are likely to be needed in any future development of patients in a certain speciality. It can indicate the use which is being made of the beds for examples whether a high occupying rate is being achieved or whether beds are lying empty for several days before the next patient is admitted. It is evident, therefore that 100% accuracy must be achieved each day. The return must balance. The medical records officer will probably arrange that the admission steps for the patients admitted during the provision ( 24 hrs ) are checked against the daily statement to see that there is a slip for every patient whose name appears on the statement and also to see that there is a name on the form for every slip held.</p>

                        <h3>DISCHARGE LIST</h3>
                        <p>The same section that wishes to know when a patient was admitted will also know that he was (has been) discharged. List of patients discharged will probably have to be prepared to notify at least reception clerk on the telephone switch board and of course the medical records department. It is possible to pass the actual ward statement to these section so that they may remove the admission slips of those patients who have been discharge or died and amend the ward for the patients who have been transferred. If computer documentation is used, it is possible to prepare a discharge list and print out those discharged or died patients so that the daily ward statement will not leave the medical records department.</p>

                        <h3>FOLLOWUP APPOINTMENT</h3>
                        <h4>A. INITIATION BY WARD</h4>
                        <p>Each hospital will have its own way of making follow up appointment for patients leaving the ward. It is most satisfactorily if the appointment card can be given to the patient before he/she leaves the hospital bed this may always not be possible. The wards should hold stock of special request forms on which appointments can be requested. One of this forms plus the patients appointment card should be sent down to the appointment section preferably the afternoon before the patient is being discharged. If it is anticipated that the patients will used hospital transport this should be ordered at the same time.</p>
                        <h4>B. CHECK BY WARD CLERK/DISCHARGE CLERK</h4>
                        <p>Whoever is responsible for putting the patient list in order after he has left the ward should check that if a further appointment is needed it has been made.</p>
                        
                        <h3>COLLECTION & PROCESSING OF NOTES</h3>
                        <h4>A. COLLECTION BY DAILY WARD STATEMENT</h4>
                        <p>The medical records department may be responsible for collecting notes and x-ray films from the ward, if so the clerk concerned should take with her/him the daily ward statement and check that she has a set of notes for each patient who is no longer in the ward. This is to safeguard against notes being retained in errors so delaying further process or procedures.</p>
                        <h4>B. COLLATION</h4>
                        <p>The notes should be put in order by the ward clerk but they frequently arrive in the wards department with many loose papers. The clinical notes investigations and reports relating to the admission are to be filled in the agreed order in the folder and any transitory documents that do not have to be retained by law such as 4 hourly temperature charts may be discarded at the stage of that is the hospital policy.</p>
                        <h4>C. DISCHARGE SUMMARY</h4>
                        <p>The ordered notes are then taken to the medical secretary who will be responsible for typing the discharge summary of formal report to the patients G.P</p>
                        <h4>D. CODING</h4>
                        <p>When the discharge summary has been dictated and typed the notes now containing a list of diagnosis made while the patient was in hospital will be passed to the coding and indexing section so that the relevant details may be extracted to form the disease index. Coding may be carried out by a trained clerk. It is at this stage that forms for hospital activity analysis and the hospital inpatient will almost certainly be completed. The coding clerk will also note that diagnosis which relate to malignant diseases and either pass the notes or a list of names and hospital numbers of the patients concerned to the follow up department as indicated in the section dealing with follow up procedure.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h3>PHYSICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR ADMISSION OFFICE</h3>
                        <p>The admission office should be as near to the entrance to the main wards as possible, but should also be near the main entrance of the hospital so that patients brought by means. Other than hospital means will easily find their way.</p>
                        <p>Sign posting should be clear and unambiguous in the letter ensuring the patient to come to he hospital. The office should be described by the same name that appear not be asked to report to the admission office if sign posting to if records in patient reception office.</p>
                        <p>There should be good provisions of comfortable chairs one magazines. If patients are likely to have to wait before being escorted to the ward. Flowers and pictures will make it cheerful and welcoming. Most important of all these should be a receptionist on duty at any time patients are likely to report for admission. The receptionist should have a list of patients who are expected and know what to do with minimum fuss e.g. of a patient arrives who she is not expecting.</p>

                        <h3>PROCEDURES</h3>
                        <h4>A. PROCEDURES RELATED TO PATIENTS</h4>
                        <p>The waiting list office will have sent down full information about patients who are expected from this a admission form will be prepared in the admission office. The admission for will usually be a multi set and will contain patients social data including next of keen and telephone number at which his relative would be contacted. This is the information contained in the pre-registration slip which forms part of the letter to the patient.</p>
                        <p>When patient arrives, details on the form are checked and any missing items are completed. If pre-registration has been sufficiently done it will barely be necessary to ask patients any questions but this is a good opportunity to have a brief conversation to make the patient feel welcome. The patient may be given information about the hospital visiting time etc. If he may not have had a question often asked at this stage "can I keep my clothes or must I send it home" The receptionist must have an answer to this and to many other questions that the patient may ask. These questions may seem and sound very simple and familiar in the receptionist but they mean good deal to the patient.</p>
                        <p>The patient should be escorted to the ward. It may be possible for admission office staff to accompany the patient or the pothering staff to accompany him. If both of them are not possible, most hospitals have voluntary workers who are willing to carry out this escort task. It gives patients a poor impression of hospital if the patient is left to find his way through what to him will certainly seem a maze of corridors.</p>

                        <h4>B. MEDICAL RECORDS PROCEDURES</h4>
                        <p>The multi part admission for already referred to the will need splitting in to several parts. These copies form an information bulletin that tells interested departments that the patients have been admitted. It is useful if different copies are coloured differently so that the ward e.g. has a pink copy etc. The departments that will need to be notified in most hos pitals will include;</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>The ward:</strong> The top copy of the form has gone with the patient. The ward known by received are on the x-ray hence not been received are on the way. Wards must know that if a patient arrives in the ward without this form then admission office must be informed at once. They should be encouraged never to admit a patient without one.</li>
                            <li><strong>Records department:</strong> There will be several uses for this form. It may be used to check alphabetical index to waiting list to take out waiting card. It may then be filed on alphabetical order to form a list of all patients in the hospital an anytime hence taking place of admission register. This will facilitate enquiries forms should be removed and discarded on a patients discharge.</li>
                            <li><strong>Main Hospital Reception:</strong> These files will be filled in an alphabetical order so that if relatives arrive and do not know which ward the patient is they can be divided.</li>
                            <li><strong>Medical Social Workers department:</strong> Medical social worker department should also have a copy of this list that if any of their special patient comes in unexpectedly, they will be able to visit them as quickly as possible in some hospitals of social worker will automatically visit every patient who has been admitted in this case of the consultant whose patient she should look after.</li>
                            <li><strong>The Chaplain:</strong> Most hospitals will have resident or visiting clergy in the main denominations. There should be arrangements do that there are several kooks or pigeon holes where forms relating to patients of different denomination may be put. Some arrangements must be reached as to which chaplain will be given form of those patients with no religion.</li>
                            <li><strong>Telephone switchboard (Hospital):</strong> Hospital switchboard should have a set of their own so that any telephone enquiries can be dealt with appropriately and promptly.
