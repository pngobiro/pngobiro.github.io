                        <p>II. Give historical background of health records</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Definition of Health records:</strong> Any written document about a patient in a professional relationship with a doctor.</p>
                        <p>-The history of health records runs parallel with the history of medicine. Records are necessary for practice of medicine as medications are for effective treatment, and they seem to have been made from earliest antiquity</p>
                        <p>- The first real physician of health records in Egypt is Imhotep. He lived in the pyramid age (about 3000-2500 BC) and was grand vizier, chief architect and royal medical adviser to pharaoh of the $29^{th}$ century BC . Imhotep has been credited with the authorship of the Edwin Smith Papyrus. This Papyrus is one of the most valuable ancient medical documents that has come down to us and appears to have been copied about 1600BC from an earlier original. This papyrus is a roll over 15 feet by about 3 inches wide and is made up of 12 sheets of the usual size. It is written on both sides and consists of 48 cases of clinical surgery.</p>
                        <p>-In Greece Hippocrates known as the "Father of Medicine" was born about 460 BC. He was the first to cast out superstition and to practice medicine on scientific principles. He was the author of the Hippocratic Oath, which is pledge by physicians and which states in part "Whatsoever in my practice or not in my practice, I shall see or hear amid the lives of men which ought not to be noised abroad as to this I shall keep silence, holding such things unfitted to be spoken". Thus originated the privacy of all information given to physicians by patients, eventually the Health Records per see was also considered as privileged communication Hippocrates kept detailed case reports of his patients.</p>
                        <p>- In the $18^{th}$ Century, Benjamin Franklin was one of the first leaders in the movement to establish the first incorporated hospital within the United States. This institution was known as Pennsylvania in 1751. Franklin served as secretary of hospital, and many of its earliest records are in his handwriting. In $19^{th}$ Century in 1821 the famous Massachusetts General Boston Opened it has the distinction of having a complete file of clinical records, with all cases catalogued dating from the day it opened.</p>
                        <p>- In the $20^{th}$ Century, it was not until the beginning of this era that medical records received serious consideration by other types of hospitals and especially by hospitals and medical associations. In 1902 the American Hospital Association discussed health records for the first time at a convention. In 1948 Health Records Association was started in Britain. In 1967 the Department of Health Records was started in Kenya at Kenyatta National Hospital- Nairobi.</p>
                        <p>In 1978 the Health Records and Information Technician Program was started at the Medical Training College, Nairobi. In 1990, the Health records and information officers program was started at the medical training college, Nairobi.</p>
