                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h4>Learning Objectives</h4>
                        <p>The learner should be able to analyse and interpret legal aspects concerning:-</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Confidentiality</li>
                            <li>Disclosure</li>
                            <li>Ownership</li>
                            <li>Retention</li>
                            <li>Security</li>
                            <li>Consent of Operations</li>
                            <li>Medical Records Ethics</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Confidentiality</h4>
                        <p>Information concerning a patient is confidential and should not be released to any unauthorized persons. If a member of the hospital staff improperly discloses any information concerning a patient whereby that patient suffers material loss, the patient can easily sue the hospital and the officer who is in breach of his duty had made any improper disclosure.</p>

                        <h4>Disclosure of information</h4>
                        <p>There are five main categories under which contents of patients records can be disclosed;-</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Consent by the patient which could be expressed or implied.</li>
                            <li>If there is a court order.</li>
                            <li>If the interest of the doctor or hospital cannot be otherwise safeguarded.</li>
                            <li>If transference between hospitals, clinics or doctors in the interest of the patient.</li>
                            <li>If there exists a higher duty than the private duty e.g. notification of infectious diseases, notification of births and deaths registration, and notification of poisons.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h5>Disclosure with patient's consent</h5>
                        <p>A patient can give his consent for disclosure either expressly or implicitly. In general the consent form should always indicate the reasons for disclosure, and no disclosure should be made except for that reason. Requests from insurance companies and similar bodies should only be acceded to with the patient's written consent but should be referred to the hospital authorities.</p>

                        <h5>Disclosure by an order of court</h5>
                        <p>A court in the pursuit of justice may make an "Order for Discovery" or a Subpoena to produce case records. There is no question but that such an order must be obeyed. It is the original document that should be produced in court.</p>

                        <h5>Disclosure to safeguard the interests of a doctor or hospital</h5>
                        <p>If an action is brought against a hospital or doctor, then the disclosure of a patient's record may be done. Disclosure of the contents of a medical record is necessary between departments or between members of medical staff in the hospital and this is justifiable of course, as being in the patient's interests.</p>

                        <h4>Ownership</h4>
                        <p>The records do not belong to the patient even if fees have been paid. The records belong to the various health institutions which created them. In the case of government institutions they belong to the government. Case records of private institutions belong to the institutions because they have contributed to the creation of the records.</p>

                        <h4>Retention</h4>
                        <p>The Public Records Act stipulates that authorities responsible for public records have a duty to make proper arrangements for selecting those records which should be permanently be preserved and for disposal of the rest. Some records should not be destroyed, such as Post Mortem books, summaries of clinical notes, and discharge registers containing diagnosis. The rest of the health records in the folder may be destroyed. This should be done six years after the patient's last attendance.</p>

                        <h4>Security</h4>
                        <p>It is the responsibility of each and every health institution to ensure that there is security in storage and handling of health records. This security could be maintained by: (a) Providing adequate security in the departmental procedures and use of equipment. (b) Instructing lay staff on the confidentiality of health records. (c) Require all lay staff to sign a declaration of secrecy.</p>

                        <h4>Consent for operations</h4>
                        <p>It is legal requirement that a health institution should obtain consent from patient/ client before an operation or anaesthesia is administered. In case of somebody under 16 years it is necessary for parent or guardian to give consent. In case of emergency, consent should not delay the procedure. Married women would give consent on their own right just as single women. For mentally disordered patient the consent of the nearest relative should be obtained.</p>

                        <h4>Medical records ethics</h4>
                        <p>In Greece, Hippocrates, known as the "father of medicine" was born about 460 BC. He was the author of the Hippocratic Oath, which is pledged by physicians and other health workers including health records personnel. It states in part: "whatsoever in my practice or not in my practice I shall or hear amid the lives of men which ought not to be noised abroad- as to this I will keep silence, holding such things unfitting to be spoken". That is how confidentiality of health records originated and should be maintained until today.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The special health records are:-</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Psychiatric records</li>
                            <li>Infectious disease diseases</li>
                            <li>Tuberculosis records</li>
                            <li>Radiotherapy records.</li>
                            <li>HIV/ AIDS records</li>
                            <li>Maternity records.</li>
                            <li>Anaesthesia</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Psychiatric records</h4>
                        <p>The way psychiatric records are maintained is different from the way the general records are maintained. This is prescribed in the Mental Health Act. The admission of psychiatric patients may be "informal or formal". Informal means a patient is admitted without legal or other formalities and the hospital has no right to detain him in the hospital against his will.</p>

                        <h4>Tuberculosis records</h4>
                        <p>Tuberculosis is one disease (cancer is the other) for which an attempt is made to complete registration to identify that population. Since it is an infectious disease notification must be made to the "Medical Officer of Health. A register is maintained for this notification. The records belonging to these patients are supposed to be kept for long periods and therefore the case folder must be made for sturdy material to resist wear and tear.</p>

                        <h4>Radiotherapy records</h4>
                        <p>Radiotherapy department present a special records problem. All radiotherapy cases are supposed to be registered nationally for perpetual follow-up. These records could be filed in a separate area but given the unit number. A radiotherapy number is given to each patient to be used for National Cancer Registration. This number is prefixed by the year of first registration and is used in all follow-up correspondences, until the patient dies.</p>

                        <h4>Security and control of special health records</h4>
                        <p>The special health records should be if possible locked in cabinets and the keys kept by the health records/ information officer.</p>
