                        <h3>Coding Procedure: Basic Guidelines</h3>
                        <p>The Alphabetical Index contains many terms not included in Volume 1, and coding requires that both the Index and the Tabular List should be consulted before a code is assigned. Before attempting to code, the coder needs to know the principles of classification and coding and to have carried out practical exercises. The following is a simple guide intended to assist the occasional user of the ICD.</p>
                        <ol class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Identify the type of statement to be coded and refer to the appropriate section of the Alphabetical Index. (If the statement is a disease or injury or other condition classifiable to Chapters I-XIX or XXI, consult Section I of the Index. If the statement is the external cause of an injury or other event classifiable to Chapter XX, consult Section II.)</li>
                            <li>Locate the lead term. For diseases and injuries this is usually a noun for the pathological condition. However, some conditions expressed as adjectives or eponyms are included in the Index as lead terms.</li>
                            <li>Read and be guided by any note that appears under the lead term.</li>
                            <li>Read any terms enclosed in parentheses after the lead term (these modifiers do not affect the code number), as well as any terms indented under the lead term (these modifiers may affect the code number), until all the words in the diagnostic expression have been accounted for.</li>
                            <li>Follow carefully any cross-references ("see" and "see also") found in the Index.</li>
                            <li>Refer to the tabular list to verify the suitability of the code number selected. Note that a three-character code in the Index with a dash in the fourth position means that there is a fourth character to be found in Volume 1. Further subdivisions to be used in a supplementary character position are not indexed and, if used, must be located in Volume 1.</li>
                            <li>Be guided by any inclusion or exclusion terms under the selected code or under the chapter, block or category heading.</li>
                            <li>Assign the code.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Specific guidelines for the selection of the cause or condition to be coded, and for coding the condition selected, are given in subsequent sections.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h3>Inclusion and Exclusion Terms</h3>
                        <p><strong>Inclusion terms:</strong> Within the three- and four-character rubrics, there are usually listed a number of other diagnostic terms. These are known as "inclusion terms" and are given, in addition to the title, as examples of the diagnostic statements to be classified to that rubric. They may refer to different conditions or be synonyms. They are not a subclassification of the rubric.</p>
                        <p><strong>Exclusion terms:</strong> Certain rubrics contain lists of conditions preceded by the word "Excludes". These are terms which, although the rubric title might suggest that they were to be classified there, are in fact classified elsewhere. Following each excluded term, in parentheses, is the category or subcategory code to which the excluded term should be allocated.</p>

                        <h3>The "Dagger and Asterisk" System († and *)</h3>
                        <p>ICD-10 uses a dual-coding system for diagnostic statements that contain information about both an underlying generalized disease and a manifestation in a particular organ or site. The primary code is for the underlying disease and is marked with a dagger (†); an optional additional code for the manifestation is marked with an asterisk (*). It is a principle of the ICD that the dagger code is the primary code and must always be used. The asterisk code must never be used alone.</p>

                        <h3>Optional Dual Coding</h3>
                        <p>There are other situations that permit two ICD codes to be used to describe a condition fully. These are identified by the note "Use additional code, if desired...". Examples include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Identifying the infecting organism for local infections.</li>
                            <li>Indicating the type of functional activity for neoplasms.</li>
                            <li>Identifying the cause of organic mental disorders (F00-F09).</li>
                            <li>Identifying the toxic agent in conditions caused by it.</li>
                            <li>Describing both the nature of an injury (Chapter XIX) and its cause (Chapter XX).</li>
                        </ul>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h4>Parentheses ()</h4>
                        <p>Used to enclose supplementary words that do not affect the code number, to enclose the code for an exclusion term, to enclose the codes in block titles, and for dagger/asterisk codes.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Square brackets []</h4>
                        <p>Used for enclosing synonyms, alternative words, or explanatory phrases, and for referring to previous notes or sets of subdivisions.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Colon :</h4>
                        <p>Used in listings when the words preceding it are not complete terms and require one of the modifying words indented under them.</p>

                        <h4>Brace }</h4>
                        <p>Used in listings to indicate that neither the words that precede it nor the words after it are complete terms. Any term before the brace must be qualified by a term that follows it.</p>
                        
                        <h4>"NOS"</h4>
                        <p>An abbreviation for "not otherwise specified", implying "unspecified" or "unqualified". Coders should be careful not to code a term as unqualified unless it is clear that no more specific information is available.</p>
                        
                        <h4>"Not elsewhere classified" (NEC)</h4>
                        <p>This phrase serves as a warning that certain specified variants of the listed conditions may appear in other parts of the classification.</p>
                        
                        <h4>"And" in titles</h4>
                        <p>Stands for "and/or". For example, "Tuberculosis of bones and joints" includes "tuberculosis of bones", "tuberculosis of joints", and "tuberculosis of bones and joints".</p>
                        
                        <h4>Point dash (.-)</h4>
                        <p>Indicates that a fourth character exists and should be sought in the appropriate category in the tabular list.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Asterisk Categories</h3>
                        <p>The following asterisk categories are not to be used alone; they must always be used in addition to a dagger code:</p>
                        <pre class="code-block"><code>D63*, D77*, E35*, E90*, F00*, F02*, G01*, G02*, G05*, G07*, G13*, G22*, G26*, G32*, G46*, G53*,

N74*, N77*, P75*</code></pre>

                        <h3>Cross-references</h3>
                        <p>Used to avoid unnecessary duplication of terms in the Index. "See" requires the coder to refer to the other term; "see also" directs the coder to refer elsewhere if the statement contains other information not found under the current term.</p>
