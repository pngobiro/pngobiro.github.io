                        <p>General appearance and condition of the skin are clinically important because they may provide clues to body conditions or dysfunctions. Pale skin may indicate shock; red, flushed, very warm skin may indicate fever and infection. A rash may indicate allergies or local infections. Even chewed fingernails may be a clue to emotional problems. For diagnosis, treatment, and management of skin disorders, the medical services of a specialist may be warranted. Dermatology is the medical specialty concerned with diseases that directly affect the skin and systemic diseases that manifest their effects on the skin. The physician who specializes in diagnosis and treatment of skin diseases is known as a dermatologist.</p>
                        
                        <h3 id="skin-lesions">Skin Lesions</h3>
                        <p>Lesions are areas of tissue that have been pathologically altered by injury, wound, or infection. Lesions may affect tissue over an area of a definite size (localized) or may be widely spread throughout the body (systemic). Evaluation of skin lesions, injuries, or changes to tissue helps establish the diagnosis of skin disorders. Lesions are described as primary or secondary. Primary skin lesions are the initial reaction to pathologically altered tissue and may be flat or elevated. Secondary skin lesions are changes that take place in the primary lesion due to infection, scratching, trauma, or various stages of a disease. Lesions are also described by their appearance, color, location, and size as measured in centimeters.</p>
                        
                        <h3 id="burns">Burns</h3>
                        <p>Burns are tissue injuries caused by contact with thermal, chemical, electrical, or radioactive agents. Although burns generally occur on the skin, they can also affect the respiratory and digestive tract linings. Burns that have a local effect are not as serious as those that have a systemic effect.</p>
                        <p>Systemic effects are life threatening and may include dehydration, shock, and infection. Burns are usually classified as first-, second-, or third-degree burns. The extent of injury and degree of severity determine a burn's classification. First-degree (superficial) burns are the least serious type of burn because they injure only the top layers of the skin, the epidermis. These burns are most often caused by brief contact with either dry or moist heat (thermal burn), spending too much time in the sun (sunburn), or exposure to chemicals. Injury is restricted to local effects, such as skin redness (erythema) and acute sensitivity to sensory stimuli (hyperesthesia), such as touch, heat, or cold. Generally, blisters do not form and the burn heals without scar formation. Second degree (partialthickness) burns are deep burns that damage both the epidermis and part of the dermis. These burns may be caused by contact with flames, hot liquids, or chemicals. Symptoms mimic those of firstdegree burns, but fluid-filled blisters (vesicles or bullae) form and the burn may heal with little or no scarring. In third-degree (full-thickness) burns, the epidermis and dermis are destroyed and some of the underlying connective tissue is damaged, leaving the skin waxy and charred with insensitivity to touch. The underlying bones, muscles, and tendons may also be damaged. These burns may be caused by corrosive chemicals, flames, electricity, or extremely hot objects; immersion of the body in extremely hot water, or clothing that catches fire. Because of the extensiveness of tissue destruction, ulcerating wounds develop and the body attempts to heal itself by forming scar tissue. Skin grafting (dermatoplasty) is commonly required to protect the underlying tissue and assist in recovery. A formula for estimating the percentage of adult body surface area affected by burns is to apply the Rule of Nines. This method assigns values of 9% or 18% of surface areas to specific regions. The formula is modified in infants and children because of the proportionately larger head size. To determine treatment, it is important to know the amount of the burned surface area because IV fluids for hydration are required to replace fluids lost from tissue damage.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Neoplasms are abnormal growths of new tissue that are classified as benign or malignant. Benign neoplasms are noncancerous growths composed of the same type of cells as the tissue in which they are growing. They harm the individual only insofar as they place pressure on surrounding structures. If the benign neoplasm remains small and places no pressure on adjacent structures, it commonly is not removed. When it becomes excessively large, causes pain, or places pressure on other organs or structures, excision is necessary. Malignant neoplasms are composed of cells that are invasive and spread to remote regions of the body. These cells show altered function, altered appearance, and uncontrolled growth. They invade surrounding tissue and, ultimately, some of the malignant cells from the primary tumor may enter blood and lymph vessels and travel to remote regions of the body to form secondary tumor sites, a process called metastasis. The presence of a malignant growth (tumor) is the disease called cancer. The ability to invade surrounding tissues and spread to remote regions of the body is a distinguishing feature of cancer. If left untreated, cancer is usually progressive and generally fatal. Cancer (CA) treatment includes surgery, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and radiation therapy. Immunotherapy, also called biotherapy, is a recent treatment that stimulates the body's own immune defenses to fight tumor cells. To provide the most effective treatment, the physician may prescribe one of the above treatments or use a combination of them (combined modality treatment).</p>

                        <h3 id="grading-staging">Grading and Staging Systems</h3>
                        <p>Pathologists' grade and stage tumors for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. A tumor grading system is used to evaluate the appearance and maturity of malignant cells in a tumor. Pathologists commonly describe tumors by four grades of severity based on the microscopic appearance of their cells. A patient with a grade I tumor has the best prognosis; one with grade IV tumor has the poorest prognosis. The tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) system of staging is used to identify the invasiveness of the malignant tumor. It also helps the oncologist determine the most effective method of treatment.</p>
                        <p>The TNM system stages tumors according to three basic criteria:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li><strong>T</strong>-size and invasiveness of the primary tumor</li>
                            <li><strong>N</strong>-nodal involvement</li>
                            <li><strong>M</strong>-spreading of the primary tumor to remote regions of the body (metastasis).</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Numbers are used to indicate size or spread of the tumor. The higher the number, the greater the extent or spread of the malignancy. For example, T2 designates a small tumor; M0 designates no evidence of metastasis.</p>

                        <p>Basal cell carcinoma, the most common type of skin cancer, is a malignancy of the basal layer of the epidermis, or hair follicles. This type of cancer is commonly caused by overexposure to sunlight. These tumors are locally invasive but rarely metastasize. Basal cell carcinoma is most prevalent in blond, fair-skinned men and is the most common malignant tumor affecting white people. Although these tumors grow slowly, they commonly ulcerate as they increase in size and develop crusting that is firm to the touch. Metastases are uncommon with this type of cancer; however, the disease can invade the tissue sufficiently to destroy an ear, nose, or eyelid. Depending on the location, size, and depth of the lesion, treatment may include curettage and electrodesiccation, chemotherapy, surgical excision, irradiation, or chemosurgery.</p>

                        <h3 id="squamous-cell">Squamous Cell Carcinoma</h3>
                        <p>Squamous cell carcinoma arises from skin that undergoes pathological hardening (keratinizing) of epidermal cells. It is an invasive tumor with potential for metastasis and occurs most commonly in fair-skinned white men over age 60. Repeated overexposure to the sun's ultraviolet rays greatly increases the risk of squamous cell carcinoma. Other predisposing factors associated with this type of cancer include radiation therapy, chronic skin irritation and inflammation, exposure to cancer causing agents (carcinogens), including tar and oil, hereditary diseases (such as xeroderma and pigmentosum and albinism), and the presence of premalignant lesions (such as actinic keratosis or Bowen disease). There are two types of squamous cell carcinoma: those that are confined to the original site (in situ) and those that penetrate the surrounding tissue (invasive). Treatment may consist of surgical excision; curettage and electrodesiccation, which provide good cosmetic results for smaller lesions; radiation therapy, usually for older or debilitated patients; and chemotherapy, depending on the location, size, shape, degree of invasion, and condition of underlying tissue. A combination of these treatment methods may be required for a deeply invasive tumor.</p>

                        <p>Malignant melanoma is a neoplasm composed of abnormal melanocytes that commonly begin in a darkly pigmented mole. Although malignant melanoma is relatively rare, the incidence is rising more rapidly than any other malignancy.</p>
                        <p>It is the most lethal of the skin cancers and can metastasize extensively to the liver, lungs, or brain. Several factors may influence the development of melanoma, but persons at greatest risk have fair complexions, blue eyes, red or blonde hair, and freckles. Excessive exposure to sunlight and severe sunburn during childhood are believed to increase the risk of melanoma in later life. Avoiding the sun and using sunscreen have proved effective in preventing the disease.</p>
                        <p>Melanomas are diagnosed by biopsy along with histological examination. Treatment requires surgery to remove the primary cancer, along with adjuvant therapies to reduce the risk of metastasis. The extent of surgery depends on the size and location of the primary tumor and is determined by staging the disease.</p>

Skin test that identifies suspected allergens by subcutaneously injecting small amounts of extracts of the suspected allergens and observing the skin for a subsequent reaction. Intradermal skin tests are used to determine immunity to diphtheria (Schick test) or tuberculosis (Mantoux test). Skin test that identifies suspected allergens by topical application of the substance to be tested (such as food, pollen, and animal fur), usually on the forearm, and observing for a subsequent reaction. After the patch is removed, a lack of noticeable reaction indicates a negative result; skin reddening or swelling indicates a positive result. Skin test that identifies suspected allergens by placing a small quantity of the suspected allergen on a lightly scratched area of the skin.
