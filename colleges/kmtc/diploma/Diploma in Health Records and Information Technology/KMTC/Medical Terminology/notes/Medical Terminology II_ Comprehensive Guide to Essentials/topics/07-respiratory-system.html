                <section id="pathology" class="content-section">
                    <h2 class="section-heading">Pathology</h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Common signs and symptoms of many respiratory disorders include cough (dry or productive), chest pain, altered breathing patterns, shortness of breath (SOB), cyanosis, and fever. Many disorders of the respiratory system, including bronchitis and emphysema, begin as an acute problem but become chronic over time. Chronic respiratory diseases are usually difficult to treat. Their damaging effects are commonly irreversible.</p>
                        <p>For diagnosis, treatment, and management of respiratory disorders, the medical services of a specialist may be warranted. Pulmonology is the medical specialty concerned with disorders of the respiratory system. The physician who treats these disorders is called a pulmonologist.</p>
                        
                        <h3 id="copd">Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease</h3>
                        <p>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) includes respiratory disorders that produce a chronic partial obstruction of the air passages. The patient finds it difficult to breath (dyspnea) especially upon exertion and usually exhibits a chronic cough. The three major disorders included in COPD are asthma, chronic bronchitis, and emphysema.</p>

                        <h3 id="asthma">Asthma</h3>
                        <p>Asthma produces spasms in the bronchial passages (bronchospasms) that may be sudden and violent (paroxysmal) and lead to dyspnea. Asthma is commonly caused by exposure to allergens or irritants. Other causes include stress, cold, and exercise. During recovery, coughing episodes produce large amounts of mucus (productive cough). Over time, the epithelium of the bronchial passages thickens, and breathing becomes more difficult. Treatment includes agents that loosen and break down mucus (mucolytics) and medications that expand the bronchi (bronchodilators) by relaxing their smooth muscles. If usual measures do not reverse the bronchospasms, the condition is referred to as status asthmaticus.</p>

                        <h3 id="chronic-bronchitis">Chronic Bronchitis</h3>
                        <p>Chronic bronchitis is an inflammation of the bronchi caused mainly by smoking and air pollution. However, other agents, such as viruses and bacteria may also cause the disorder. Bronchitis is characterized by swelling of the mucosa and a heavy, productive cough, commonly accompanied by chest pain. Patients usually seek medical help when they suffer exercise intolerance, wheezing, and shortness of breath (SOB). Bronchodilators and medications that aid in the removal of mucus (expectorants) help to widen air passages. Steroids may be prescribed if the disease progresses or becomes chronic.</p>

                        <h3 id="emphysema">Emphysema</h3>
                        <p>Emphysema is characterized by decreased elasticity of the alveoli. The alveoli expand (dilate) but are unable to contract to their original size. The air that remains trapped in the chest results in a characteristic "barrel-chested" appearance. This disease commonly occurs with another respiratory disorder, such as asthma, tuberculosis, or chronic bronchitis. It is also found in long-term heavy smokers. Most emphysema sufferers find it easier to breathe when sitting upright or standing erect (orthopnea).As the disease progresses, relief even in the orthopneic position is not possible. Treatment for emphysema is similar to that of chronic bronchitis.</p>

                        <h3 id="influenza">Influenza</h3>
                        <p>Influenza (flu) is an acute infectious respiratory viral disease. Three major viral types are responsible: type A, type B, and type C. Type A is of primary concern because it is associated with worldwide epidemics (pandemics) and its causative organism is highly infectious (virulent).Influenza type A epidemics occur about every 2 to 3 years. Type B is usually limited geographically and tends to be less severe than type A . Both viruses undergo antigenic changes; consequently, new vaccines must be developed in anticipation of outbreaks. Type C is a mild flu and is not associated with epidemics. The onset of the flu is usually rapid. Symptoms include fever, chills, headache, generalized muscle pain (myalgia), and loss of appetite, but recovery occurs in about 7 to 10 days. The flu virus rarely causes death. If death occurs, it is usually the result of a secondary pneumonia caused by bacteria or viruses that inyade the lungs. Children should not use aspirin for relief of symptoms caused by viruses because there appears to be a relationship between Reye syndrome and the use of aspirin by children 2 to 15 years of age.</p>

                        <h3 id="pleural-effusions">Pleural Effusions</h3>
                        <p>Any abnormal fluid in the pleural cavity, the space between the visceral and parietal pleura, is called a pleural effusion. Normally, the pleural cavity contains only a small amount of lubricating fluid. However, some disorders may cause excessive fluid to collect in the pleural cavity. Two initial techniques used to diagnose pleural effusion are auscultation and percussion. Auscultation is the listening of sounds made by organs of the body using a stethoscope. Percussion is the gentle tapping the chest with the fingers and listening to the resultant sounds to determine the position, size, or consistency of the underlying structures. Chest x-ray (CXR) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirms the diagnosis.</p>
                        <p>Effusions are classified as transudates and exudates. A transudate is a non-inflammatory fluid that resembles serum but with slightly less protein. It results from an imbalance in venous arterial pressure or decrease of protein in blood. Both of these conditions allow serum to leak from the vascular system and collect in the pleural space. Common causes include left ventricular heart failure and liver disorders. An exudate is usually high in protein and often contains blood and immune cells. Common causes include tumors, infections, and inflammation. Various types of pleural effusions include serum (hydrothorax), pus (empyema orpyothorax), and blood (hemothorax). Although not considered a pleural effusion, air can enter the pleural space (pneumothorax), resulting in a partial or complete collapse of a lung.</p>
                        <p>Treatment consists of correcting the underlying cause of the effusion. Often a surgical puncture of the chest using a hollow-bore needle (thoracocentesis, thoracentesis) is undertaken to remove excess fluid for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes. Sometimes chest tubes are inserted to drain fluid or remove air in pneumothorax.</p>

                        <h3 id="tuberculosis">Tuberculosis</h3>
                        <p>Tuberculosis (TB) is a communicable disease caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis. TB spreads by droplets of respiratory secretions (droplet nuclei) from an infected individual when he/she coughs, laughs, or sneezes. The waxy coat of the TB organism keeps it alive (viable) and infectious for 6 to 8 months outside the body. It also makes laboratory staining of this organism more challenging. Hence TB is also known as the acid-fast bacillus (AFB), a reference to its more complex method of laboratory staining.</p>
                        <p>The first time the TB organism enters the body (primary tuberculosis), the disease develops slowly. It eventually produces typical inflammatory nodules (granulomas) called tubercles. These granulomas usually remain dormant for years, during which time the patient is asymptomatic. When the immune system becomes impaired (immunocompromised) or when the patient is reexposed to the bacterium, a full-blown disease may develop. Although primarily a lung disease, TB can infect the bones, genital tract, meninges, and peritoneum.</p>
                        <p>Some TB strains that infect AIDS patients have become resistant and do not respond to standard medications. Treatment may include using several antibiotics (combination therapy) at the same time.</p>

                        <h3 id="pneumonia">Pneumonia</h3>
                        <p>Pneumonia is any inflammatory disease of the lungs that may be caused by bacteria, viruses, or fungi. Chemicals or other agents can cause the lungs to become inflamed. A type of pneumonia associated with influenza is sometimes fatal. Other potentially fatal pneumonias may result from food or liquid inhalation (aspiration pneumonias).Some pneumonias affect only a lobe of the lung (lobar pneumonia),but some are more diffuse (bronchopneumonia).Chest pain, mucopurulent sputum, and spitting of blood (hemoptysis) are common signs and symptoms of the disease. If the air in the lungs is replaced by fluid and inflammatory debris, the lung tissue loses its spongy texture and become swollen and engorged (consolidation).Consolidation is associated primarily with bacterial pneumonias, not viral pneumonias. Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) is a type of pneumonia closely associated with AIDS. Recent evidence suggests that it is caused by a fungus that resides in or on most people (normal flora) but causes no harm as long as the individual remains healthy. When the immune system begins to fail, this organism becomes infectious (opportunistic). Diagnosis relies on examination of biopsied lung tissue or bronchial washings (lavage).</p>

                        <h3 id="cystic-fibrosis">Cystic Fibrosis</h3>
                        <p>Cystic fibrosis is a hereditary disorder of the exocrine glands that causes the body to secrete extremely thick (viscous) mucus. This thickened mucus clogs ducts of the pancreas and digestive tract. As a result, digestion is impaired and the patient may suffer from malnutrition. It also blocks ducts of the sweat glands, causing the skin to become highly "salty." In the lungs, mucus blocks airways and impedes natural disease-fighting mechanisms, causing repeated infections. Medication in the form of mists (aerosols) along with postural drainage provides relief.</p>
                        <p>An important diagnostic test called the sweat test measures the amount of salt excreted in sweat. When elevated, it indicates cystic fibrosis. Although the disease is fatal, improved methods of treatment have extended life expectancy, and patient survival is approximately 30 years.</p>

                        <h3 id="ards">Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome</h3>
                        <p>Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a condition in which the lungs no longer function effectively, threatening the life of the patient. It usually occurs as a result of very serious lung conditions, such as trauma, severe pneumonia, and other major infections that affect the entire body (systemic infections) or blood (sepsis).In ARDS, the alveoli fill with fluid (edema) caused by inflammation, and then collapse, making oxygen exchange impossible. Mechanical ventilation is commonly required to save the life of the patient.</p>
                        <p>Hyaline membrane disease (HMD), sometimes called infant respiratory distress syndrome (IRDS), is a form of respiratory distress syndrome. It is most commonly seen in preterm infants or infants born to diabetic mothers. It is caused by insufficient surfactant, a phospholipid substance that helps keep alveoli open. With insufficient surfactant, the alveoli collapse and breathing becomes labored. Clinical signs may include blueness (cyanosis) of the extremities. Flaring of the nostrils (nares) and central cyanosis are typically present. Other signs include rapid breathing (tachypnea), intercostal retraction, and a characteristic grunt audible during exhalation. Radiography shows a membrane that has a ground-glass appearance (hyaline membrane), bilateral decrease in volume, and alveolar consolidation. Although severe cases of HMD result in death, some forms of therapy are effective.</p>

                        <h3 id="oncology">Oncology</h3>
                        <p>The most common form of lung cancer is bronchogenic carcinoma; also called primary pulmonary cancer. This cancer is usually associated with tobacco use. Cells of the bronchial epithelium divide repeatedly until the entire epithelium is involved. Within a short time, the epithelium begins to invade underlying tissues. As masses form, they block air passages and alveoli. Bronchogenic carcinoma spreads (metastasizes) rapidly to other areas of the body, including the lymph nodes, liver, bones, brain, and kidneys. Only about 10% of lung cancers are found in the early stages when the cure rate is high. Treatment of lung cancer includes surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy or a combination of these methods depending on specific cell type, how far the disease has spread, and the general health of the patient. Nevertheless, lung cancer is difficult to control and survival rates are very low.</p>

                        <p>In addition to antibiotics used to treat respiratory infections, there are several classes of drugs that treat pulmonary disorders. Bronchodilators are especially significant in the treatment of COPD and exercise-induced asthma. They relax smooth muscles of the bronchi, thus increasing airflow. Some bronchodilators are delivered as a fine mist directly to the airways/via aerosol delivery devices, including nebulizers and metered-dose inhalers (MDIs).</p>
                        <p>Another method of delivering medications directly to the lungs is dry-powder inhalers (DPIs) that dispense medications in the form of a powder. Steroidal and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are important in the control and management of many pulmonary disorders.</p>
