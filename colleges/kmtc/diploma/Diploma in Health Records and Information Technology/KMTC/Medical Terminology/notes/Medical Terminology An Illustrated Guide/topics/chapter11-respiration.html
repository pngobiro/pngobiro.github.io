                        <p>The main function of the respiratory system is to provide <strong>oxygen</strong> to body cells for energy metabolism and to eliminate <strong>carbon dioxide</strong>, a byproduct of metabolism. Because these gases must be carried to and from the cells in the blood, the respiratory system works closely with the cardiovascular system to accomplish gas exchange.</p>
                        <p>Exchange of gases between the atmosphere and the blood takes place in the <strong>lungs</strong>, two cone-shaped organs located in the thoracic cavity. A double membrane, the <strong>pleura</strong>, covers the lungs and lines the thoracic cavity. The outer layer that is attached to the wall of the thoracic cavity is the parietal pleura; the inner layer that is attached to the surface of the lungs is the visceral pleura. The very thin, fluid-filled space between the two layers of the pleura is the <strong>pleural space</strong>.</p>

                        <h3>Upper Respiratory Passageways</h3>
                        <p>Air is carried to and from the lungs in a series of tubes in which no gas exchange occurs. Refer to Figure 11-1 as you read the following description of the respiratory tract. Air enters through the <strong>nose</strong>, where it is warmed, filtered, and moistened as it passes over the hair-covered mucous membranes of the nasal cavity. Cilia, microscopic hairlike projections from the cells that line the nose, sweep dirt and foreign material toward the throat for elimination. Material that is eliminated from the respiratory tract by coughing or clearing the throat is called <strong>sputum</strong>.</p>
                        <p>In the bones of the skull and face near the nose are air-filled cavities lined with mucous membranes that drain into the nasal cavity. These chambers lighten the bones and provide resonance for speech production. Each of these cavities is called a <strong>sinus</strong>, and they are named specifically for the bones in which they are located, such as the sphenoid, ethmoid, and maxillary sinuses. Together, because they are near the nose, these cavities are referred to as the paranasal sinuses (see Fig. 11-1).</p>
                        <p>Receptors for the sense of smell are located within bony side projections of the nasal cavity called <strong>turbinate bones</strong> or conchae.</p>
                        <p>Inhaled air passes into the throat, or <strong>pharynx</strong>, where it mixes with air that enters through the mouth and also with food destined for the digestive tract. The pharynx is divided into three regions: (1) an upper portion, the nasopharynx, behind the nasal cavity; (2) a middle portion, the oropharynx, behind the mouth; and (3) a lower portion, the laryngeal pharynx, behind the larynx. The <strong>palatine tonsils</strong> are on either side of the soft palate in the oropharynx; the pharyngeal tonsils, or <strong>adenoids</strong>, are in the nasopharynx.</p>

                        </figure>

                        <h3>Lower Respiratory Passageways and Lungs</h3>
                        <p>The pharynx conducts air into the <strong>trachea</strong>, a tube reinforced with C-shaped rings of cartilage to prevent its collapse (you can feel these rings if you press your fingers gently against the front of your throat). Cilia in the lining of the trachea move impurities up toward the throat, where they can be eliminated by swallowing or by <strong>expectoration</strong>. At the top of the trachea is the <strong>larynx</strong> (Fig. 11-2). The larynx is shaped by nine cartilages, the most prominent of which is the thyroid cartilage at the front that forms the "Adam's apple." The opening between the vocal cords is the <strong>glottis</strong>. The small leaf-shaped cartilage at the top of the larynx is called the <strong>epiglottis</strong>. When one swallows, the epiglottis covers the opening of the larynx and helps to prevent food from entering the respiratory tract.</p>
                        <p>The larynx contains the <strong>vocal cords</strong>, folds of tissue that are important in speech production (Fig. 11-3). Vibrations produced by air passing over the vocal cords form the basis for voice production, although portions of the throat and mouth are needed for proper articulation of speech.</p>
                        <p>The trachea is contained in a region known as the <strong>mediastinum</strong>, which consists of the space between the lungs together with the organs contained in this space (see Fig. 11-1). In addition to the trachea, the mediastinum contains the heart, esophagus, large vessels, and other tissues.</p>

                        </div>

                        <p>At its lower end, the trachea divides into a right and a left main stem <strong>bronchus</strong> that enter the lungs. The right bronchus is shorter and wider; it divides into three secondary bronchi that enter the three lobes of the right lung. The left bronchus divides into two branches that supply the two lobes of the left lung. Further divisions produce an increasing number of smaller tubes that supply air to smaller subdivisions of lung tissue. As the air passageways progress through the lungs, the cartilage in the walls gradually disappears and is replaced by smooth (involuntary) muscle.</p>
                        <p>The smallest of the conducting tubes, the <strong>bronchioles</strong>, carry air into the microscopic air sacs, the <strong>alveoli</strong>, through which gases are exchanged between the lungs and the blood. It is through the ultrathin walls of the alveoli and their surrounding capillaries that oxygen diffuses into the blood and carbon dioxide diffuses out of the blood for elimination (see Fig. 11-1).</p>

                        <h3>Breathing</h3>
                        <p>Air is moved into and out of the lungs by the process of breathing, technically called <strong>ventilation</strong>. This consists of a steady cycle of <strong>inspiration</strong> (inhalation) and <strong>expiration</strong> (exhalation), separated by a period of rest. The cycle begins when the <strong>phrenic nerve</strong> stimulates the <strong>diaphragm</strong> to contract and flatten, thus enlarging the chest cavity. The resulting decrease in pressure within the thorax causes air to be pulled into the lungs (Fig. 11-4). The intercostal muscles between the ribs aid in inspiration by pulling the ribs up and out. Muscles of the neck and thorax are used in addition for forceful inhalation. The measure of how easily the lungs expand under pressure is <strong>compliance</strong>. Fluid produced within the lung, known as <strong>surfactant</strong>, aids in compliance by reducing surface tension within the alveoli. Expiration occurs as the breathing muscles relax, the lungs spring back to their original size, and air is forced out. Muscles of the rib cage and abdomen can be called on for forceful exhalation.</p>
                        <p>Breathing is normally regulated unconsciously by centers in the brainstem. These centers adjust the rate and rhythm of breathing according to changes in the composition of the blood, especially the concentration of carbon dioxide.</p>

                        <h3>Gas Transport</h3>
                        <p>Oxygen is carried in the blood bound to hemoglobin in red blood cells. The oxygen is released to the cells as needed. Carbon dioxide is carried in several ways but is mostly converted to an acid called <strong>carbonic acid</strong>. The amount of carbon dioxide that is exhaled is important in regulating the acidity or alkalinity of the blood, based on the amount of carbonic acid that is formed. Dangerous shifts in blood pH can result from too much or too little carbon dioxide being exhaled.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Pulmonary function is affected by conditions that cause resistance to air flow through the respiratory tract or that limit expansion of the chest. These may be conditions that affect the respiratory system directly, such as infection, injury, allergy, <strong>aspiration</strong> (inhalation) of foreign bodies, or cancer. They also may be conditions that result from disturbances in other systems, such as in the skeletal, muscular, cardiovascular, or nervous systems.</p>
                        <p>As noted above, changes in ventilation can affect the acidity and alkalinity of the blood. If too much carbon dioxide is exhaled by <strong>hyperventilation</strong>, the blood tends to become too alkaline, a condition termed <strong>alkalosis</strong>. If too little carbon dioxide is exhaled as a result of <strong>hypoventilation</strong>, the blood tends to become too acidic, a condition termed <strong>acidosis</strong>.</p>

                        <h3>Infections</h3>
                        <p><strong>Pneumonia</strong> is caused by several different microorganisms, most commonly bacteria and viruses. Viral pneumonia is more diffuse and is commonly caused by influenza virus, adenovirus and, in young children, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Bacterial agents are most commonly <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em> and <em>Klebsiella pneumoniae</em>. <strong>Bronchopneumonia</strong> (bronchial pneumonia) begins in terminal bronchioles, which become clogged with exudate and form consolidated (solidified) patches. <strong>Lobar pneumonia</strong> is an acute disease that involves one or more lobes of the lung (Fig. 11-5). Pneumonia usually can be treated successfully in otherwise healthy people, but in debilitated patients it is a leading cause of death. Immunocompromised patients, such as those with AIDS, are often subject to a form of pneumonia called <em>Pneumocystis carinii</em> pneumonia (PCP), which is caused by a protozoon.</p>
                        <p>The term <em>pneumonia</em> is also applied to inflammation of the lungs caused by noninfectious causes, such as asthma, allergy, or inhalation of irritants. In these cases, however, the more general term <strong>pneumonitis</strong> is often used.</p>

                        </figure>

                        <p>The incidence of <strong>tuberculosis</strong> (TB) has increased in recent years, along with the increase of AIDS and the appearance of antibiotic resistance in the organism that causes the disease, <em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em> (MTB). (This organism, because of its staining properties, also is referred to as AFB, meaning acid-fast bacillus.) The name tuberculosis comes from the small lesions, or tubercles, that appear with the infection. The symptoms of TB include fever, weight loss, weakness, cough and, as a result of damage to blood vessels in the lungs, <strong>hemoptysis</strong>, the coughing up of sputum containing blood. Sputum analysis is used to isolate, stain, and identify infectious organisms. Accumulation of exudate in the alveoli may result in consolidation of lung tissue. The <strong>tuberculin test</strong> is used to test for tuberculosis infection. The test material that is used, tuberculin, is made from byproducts of the tuberculosis organism. PPD (purified protein derivative) is the form of tuberculin commonly used.</p>
                        <p><strong>Influenza</strong> is a viral disease of the respiratory tract. Different strains of the influenza virus have caused serious epidemics throughout history.</p>

                        <h3>Emphysema</h3>
                        <p><strong>Emphysema</strong> is a chronic disease associated with overexpansion and destruction of the alveoli. Common causes are exposure to cigarette smoke and other forms of pollution as well as chronic infection. Emphysema is the main disorder included under the heading of <strong>chronic obstructive pulmonary disease</strong> (COPD) (also called COLD, chronic obstructive lung disease). Other conditions included in this category are asthma, chronic bronchitis, and <strong>bronchiectasis</strong>.</p>

                            <p>Some laypersons' terms for respiratory symptoms and conditions are so old-fashioned and quaint that you might see them today only in Victorian novels. Catarrh (ka-TAR) is an old word for an upper respiratory infection with much mucus production. Quinsy (KWIN-zē) referred to a sore throat or tonsillar abscess. Consumption was tuberculosis, and dropsy referred to generalized edema. The grip meant influenza, which we more often abbreviate as "flu."</p>
                            <p>Some unscientific words are still in use. These include whooping cough for pertussis, croup for laryngeal spasm, cold sore for a herpes lesion, and phlegm for sputum.</p>
                            <p>Many informal terms are used instead of scientific words by the general public. Health professionals should be familiar with the slang or colloquialisms that are used to describe symptoms so that they can better communicate with their patients.</p>
                        </aside>

                        <h3>Asthma</h3>
                        <p>Attacks of <strong>asthma</strong> result from narrowing of the bronchial tubes. This constriction, along with edema (swelling) of the bronchial linings and accumulation of mucus, results in wheezing, extreme <strong>dyspnea</strong> (difficulty in breathing), and <strong>cyanosis</strong>. Asthma is most common in children. Although its causes are uncertain, a main factor is irritation caused by allergy. Heredity may also play a role. Treatment of asthma includes removal of allergens, administration of bronchodilators to widen the airways, and administration of steroids.</p>

                        <h3>Pneumoconiosis</h3>
                        <p>Chronic irritation and inflammation caused by inhalation of dust particles is termed <strong>pneumoconiosis</strong>. This is an occupational hazard seen mainly in people involved in the mining and stoneworking industries. Different forms of pneumoconiosis are named for the specific type of dust inhaled: silicosis (silica or quartz), anthracosis (coal dust), asbestosis (asbestos fibers).</p>
                        <p>Although the term pneumoconiosis is limited to conditions caused by inhalation of inorganic dust, lung irritation may also result from inhalation of organic dusts, such as textile or grain dusts.</p>

                        <h3>Disorders of the Pleura</h3>
                        <p><strong>Pleurisy</strong>, also called pleuritis, is an inflammation of the pleura, usually associated with infection. Pain is the common symptom of pleurisy. Because this pain is intensified by breathing or coughing, as the inflamed membranes move, breathing becomes rapid and shallow. Analgesics and anti-inflammatory drugs are used to treat the symptoms of pleurisy.</p>
                        <p>As a result of injury, infection, or weakness in the pleural membrane, substances may accumulate between the layers of the pleura. When air or gas collects in this space, the condition is termed <strong>pneumothorax</strong> (Fig. 11-6). Compression may result in collapse of the lung, termed <strong>atelectasis</strong>.</p>
                        <p>In <strong>pleural effusion</strong>, other materials accumulate in the pleural space (Fig. 11-7). Depending on the substances involved, these are described as <strong>empyema</strong> (pus), also termed pyothorax; <strong>hemothorax</strong> (blood); or <strong>hydrothorax</strong> (fluid). Causes of these conditions include injury, infection, heart failure, and pulmonary embolism. <strong>Thoracentesis</strong>, needle puncture of the chest to remove fluids (Fig. 11-8), or fusion of the pleural membranes (pleurodesis) may be required.</p>

                        <h3>Lung Cancer</h3>
                        <p>Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in both men and women. The incidence of this form of cancer has increased steadily over the past 50 years, especially in women. Cigarette smoking is a major risk factor in this as well as other forms of cancer. The most common form of lung cancer is squamous carcinoma, originating in the lining of the bronchi (bronchogenic). Lung cancer usually cannot be detected early, and it metastasizes rapidly. The overall survival rate is low.</p>
                        <p>Methods used to diagnose lung cancer include radiographic studies, computed tomography (CT) scans, and examination of sputum for cancer cells. A <strong>bronchoscope</strong> can be used to examine the airways and to collect tissue samples for study. Surgical or needle biopsies may also be taken.</p>

                        <h3>Respiratory Distress Syndrome (RDS)</h3>
                        <p><strong>Respiratory distress syndrome</strong> of the newborn, also called <em>hyaline membrane disease</em>, occurs in premature infants and is the most common cause of death in this group. It results from a lack of surfactant in the lungs, which reduces compliance. <strong>Acute respiratory distress syndrome</strong> (ARDS), also known as <em>shock lung</em>, may result from trauma, allergic reactions, infection, and other causes. It involves edema that can lead to respiratory failure and death if untreated.</p>

                        <h3>Cystic Fibrosis</h3>
                        <p><strong>Cystic fibrosis</strong> (CF) is the most common fatal hereditary disease among white children. The flawed gene that causes CF affects glandular secretions by altering chloride transport across cell membranes. Thickening of bronchial secretions leads to infection and other respiratory disorders. Other mucus-secreting glands, sweat glands, and glands of the pancreas are also involved, causing electrolyte imbalance and digestive disturbances.</p>
                        <p>CF is diagnosed by the increased amounts of sodium and chloride in the sweat, and the gene that results in CF can be identified by DNA analysis. There is no cure at present for CF. Patients are treated to relieve their symptoms, such as by postural drainage, aerosol mists, bronchodilators, antibiotics, and mucolytic agents, which dissolve mucus.</p>

                        <h3>Diagnosis</h3>
                        <p>In addition to chest radiographs, CT scans, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, methods for diagnosing respiratory disorders include <strong>lung scans</strong>, bronchoscopy, and tests of pleural fluid removed by thoracentesis. <strong>Arterial blood gases</strong> (ABGs) are used to evaluate gas exchange in the lungs by measuring carbon dioxide, oxygen, bicarbonate, and pH in an arterial blood sample. <strong>Pulse oximetry</strong> is routinely used to measure the oxygen saturation of arterial blood by means of a simple apparatus, an oximeter, placed on a thin part of the body, usually the finger or the ear (Fig. 11-9).</p>
                        <p><strong>Pulmonary function tests</strong> are used to assess breathing, usually by means of a <strong>spirometer</strong>. They measure the volumes of air that can be moved into or out of the lungs with different degrees of effort. Often used to monitor treatment in cases of allergy, asthma, emphysema, and other respiratory conditions, they are also used to measure progress in cessation of smoking. The main volumes and capacities measured in these tests are given in Display 11-1. A capacity is the sum of two or more volumes.</p>

                        <h3>Case Study 11-1: Preoperative Testing in a Patient With Asthma</h3>
                        <p>A.D., 15 years old, was seen in the preadmission testing unit in preparation for her elective spinal surgery. She has a history of mild asthma since age 4, with at least one attack per week. In an acute attack, she will have mild dyspnea, diffuse wheezing, yet an adequate air exchange that responds to bronchodilators. She was sent to pulmonary health services for a consult with a specialist and pulmonary function studies to clear her for surgery. The anesthesiologist reviewed the pulmonologist's report.</p>
                        <p>Her prebronchodilator spirometry showed a mild reduction in vital capacity but with a moderate to severe decrease in FEV<sub>1</sub> and FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC ratio. After bronchodilator administration, there was a mild but insignificant improvement in FEV<sub>1</sub>. The postbronchodilator FEV<sub>1</sub> was 55% of predicted and was considered moderately abnormal. The flow volume loops and spirographic curves were consistent with airflow obstruction.</p>

                        <h3>Case Study 11-2: Giant Cell Sarcoma of the Lung</h3>
                        <p>L.E., a 68-year-old man, was admitted to the pulmonary unit with chest pain on inspiration, dyspnea, and diaphoresis. He had smoked 1½ packs of cigarettes per day for 52 years and had quit 3 months ago. L.E. was retired from the advertising industry and admitted to occasional alcohol use. He was treated for primary giant cell sarcoma of the left lung 3 years ago with a lobectomy of the left lung followed by radiation and chemotherapy.</p>
                        <p>Physical examination was unremarkable except for a thoracotomy scar in the left hemithorax, decreased breath sounds, and dullness to percussion of the left base. There was no hemoptysis. Radionucleotide bone scan showed increased activity in the left upper posterior hemithorax. Chest and upper abdomen CT scan showed findings compatible with recurrent sarcoma of the left hemithorax. Abnormal mediastinal nodes were evident. Thoracentesis was attempted but did not yield fluid. L.E. was scheduled for a left thoracoscopy, mediastinoscopy, and biopsy.</p>

                        <h3>Case Study 11-3: Terminal Dyspnea</h3>
                        <p>N.A., a 76-year-old woman, was in the ICU in the terminal stage of multisystem organ failure. She had been admitted to the hospital for bacterial pneumonia, which had not resolved with antibiotic therapy. She had a 20-year history of COPD. She was not conscious and was unable to breathe on her own. Her ABGs were abnormal, and she was diagnosed with refractory ARDS. The decision was made to support her breathing with endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. After 1 week and several unsuccessful attempts to wean her from the ventilator, the pulmonologist suggested a permanent tracheostomy and family consideration of continuing or withdrawing life support. Her physiologic status met the criteria of remote or no chance for recovery.</p>
                        <p>N.A.'s family discussed her condition and decided not to pursue aggressive life-sustaining therapies. N.A. was assigned DNR status. After the written orders were read and signed by the family, the endotracheal tube, feeding tube, pulse oximeter, and ECG electrodes were removed and a morphine IV drip was started with prn boluses ordered to promote comfort and relieve pain and other symptoms of dying. The family sat with N.A. for many hours while her breaths became shallow with Cheyne-Stokes respirations. She died surrounded by her family, joined by the hospital chaplain.</p>
