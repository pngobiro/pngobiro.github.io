                        <p>A disease is any alteration from the normal structure or function of any part of the body. Diseases can be grouped into a number of different but often overlapping categories. These include:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li><strong>Infectious diseases</strong>—caused by microorganisms and other <strong>parasites</strong> that live at the expense of another organism. Any disease-causing organism is described as a <strong>pathogen</strong>.</li>
                            <li><strong>Degenerative diseases</strong>—resulting from wear and tear, aging, or <strong>trauma</strong> (injury) that can result in a <strong>lesion</strong> (wound) and perhaps <strong>necrosis</strong> (death) of tissue. Common examples include arthritis, cardiovascular problems, and certain respiratory disorders such as emphysema. Structural malformations such as congenital malformations, <strong>prolapse</strong> (dropping), or <strong>hernia</strong> (rupture) may also result in degenerative changes.</li>
                            <li><strong>Neoplasia</strong>—abnormal and uncontrolled growth of tissue.</li>
                            <li><strong>Immune disorders</strong>—failures of the immune system, allergies, and autoimmune diseases, in which the body makes antibodies to its own tissues, fall into this category. (Immune disorders are discussed in more detail in Chapter 10.)</li>
                            <li><strong>Metabolic disorders</strong>—resulting from lack of enzymes or other factors needed for cellular functions. Many hereditary disorders fall into this category. Malnutrition caused by inadequate intake of nutrients or inability of the body to absorb and use nutrients also upsets metabolism. (Metabolic disorders are discussed in more detail in Chapter 12, and hereditary disorders are discussed in Chapter 15.)</li>
                            <li><strong>Hormonal disorders</strong>—caused by underproduction or overproduction of hormones or by inability of the hormones to function properly. One example is diabetes mellitus. (Hormonal disorders are discussed in more detail in Chapter 16.)</li>
                            <li><strong>Mental and emotional disorders</strong>—disorders that affect the mind and adaptation of an individual to his or her environment. (Behavioral disorders are discussed in more detail in Chapter 17.)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The cause of a disease is its <strong>etiology</strong> (<em>ē-tē-OL-ō-jē</em>), although many diseases have multiple interacting causes. An <strong>acute</strong> disease is sudden and severe and of short duration. A <strong>chronic</strong> disease is of long duration and progresses slowly.</p>

                            <h4 class="callout-title"><span class="callout-icon">ℹ️</span> BOX 6-1 Name That Disease</h4>
                            <p>Diseases get their names in a variety of ways. Some are named for the places where they were first found, such as Lyme disease for Lyme, Connecticut; West Nile disease and Rift Valley fever for places in Africa; and hantavirus fever for a river in Korea. Others are named for people who first described them, such as Cooley anemia; Crohn disease, an inflammatory bowel disease; and Hodgkin disease of the lymphatic system.</p>
                            <p>Many diseases are named on the basis of the symptoms they cause. Tuberculosis causes small lesions known as tubercles in the lungs and other tissues. Skin anthrax produces lesions that turn black, and its name comes from the same root as anthracite coal. In sickle cell anemia, red blood cells become distorted into a crescent shape when they give up oxygen. Having lost their smooth, round form, the cells jumble together, blocking small blood vessels and depriving tissues of oxygen.</p>
                            <p>Bubonic plague causes painful and enlarged lymph nodes called buboes. Lupus erythematosus, a systemic autoimmune disorder, is named for the Latin term for wolf because the red rash that may form on the face of people with this disease gives them a wolf-like appearance. Yellow fever, scarlet fever, and rubella (German measles) are named for colors associated with the pathology of these diseases.</p>

                        <p>Infectious diseases are caused by viruses, bacteria, fungi (yeasts and molds), protozoa (single-celled animals), and worms (Display 6-1). In shape, bacteria may be round (cocci, Fig. 6-1), rod-shaped (bacilli, Fig. 6-2), or curved (vibrios and spirochetes, see Fig. 6-2). They may be named according to their shape and by the arrangements they form (see Fig. 6-1). They also are described according to the dyes they take up when stained in the laboratory. The most common laboratory bacterial stain is the <strong>Gram stain</strong>, with which gram-positive organisms stain purple and gram-negative organisms stain red (see Fig. 6-1).</p>
                        <p>Microorganisms often produce disease by means of the <strong>toxins</strong> (poisons) they release. The presence of harmful microorganisms or their toxins in the body is termed <strong>sepsis</strong>.</p>

                        <h3>Inflammation</h3>
                        <p>A common response to infection and to other forms of disease is <strong>inflammation</strong>. When cells are injured, they release chemicals that allow blood cells and fluids to move into the tissues. This inflow of blood results in the four signs of inflammation: heat, pain, redness, and swelling. The suffix <em>-itis</em> indicates inflammation, as in appendicitis (inflammation of the appendix) and tonsillitis (inflammation of the tonsils).</p>

                        <h3>Phagocytosis</h3>
                        <p>The body uses <strong>phagocytosis</strong> to get rid of invading microorganisms, damaged cells, and other types of harmful debris. Certain white blood cells are capable of engulfing these materials and destroying them internally (Fig. 6-3). Phagocytic cells are found circulating in the blood, in the tissues, and in the lymphatic system (see Chapters 9 and 10). The remains of phagocytosis consist of fluid and white blood cells; this is called <strong>pus</strong>.</p>

                        <h3>Immunity</h3>
                        <p>The immune system mounts our specific responses to disease. Cells of the immune system recognize different foreign invaders, and get rid of them by direct attack and with circulating antibodies that immobilize and help to destroy the cells (see Chapter 10). The immune system also monitors the body continuously for abnormal and malfunctioning cells, such as cancer cells. The system may also overreact to produce allergies, and may react to one's own tissues to cause autoimmune diseases.</p>

                        <p>As noted above, a <strong>neoplasm</strong> is an abnormal and uncontrolled growth of tissue—a tumor or growth. A neoplasm that does not spread, that is, <strong>metastasize</strong>, to other tissues is described as <strong>benign</strong>, although it may cause damage at the site where it grows. A neoplasm that metastasizes to other tissues is termed <strong>malignant</strong>, and is commonly called <em>cancer</em>. A malignant tumor that involves epithelial tissue is a <strong>carcinoma</strong>. If the tumor arises in glandular epithelium, it is an adenocarcinoma (the root <em>aden/o</em> means "gland"); a cancer of pigmented epithelial cells (melanocytes) is a melanoma. A neoplasm that involves connective tissue, muscle, or bone is a <strong>sarcoma</strong>. Cancers of the blood, lymphatic system, and nervous system are classified according to the cell types involved and other clinical features. These are described in Chapters 10 and 17.</p>
                        <p>Often mistaken for a malignancy is a <strong>cyst</strong>, a sac or pouch filled with fluid or semisolid material that is usually abnormal but not cancerous (Fig. 6-4). Common sites for cyst formation are the breasts, the sebaceous glands of the skin, and the ovaries. Causes of cyst formation include infection or blockage of a duct.</p>

                        <p>Some words pertaining to disease are used as suffixes in compound words. As previously noted, the term <em>suffix</em> is used in this book to mean any word part that consistently appears at the end of words. This may be a simple suffix (such as <em>-y</em>, <em>-ia</em>, <em>-ic</em>), a word, or a root–suffix combination (such as <em>-megaly</em>, <em>-rhagia</em>, <em>-pathy</em>).</p>
                        <p>The words <em>toxic</em>, <em>toxin</em>, and <em>sclerosis</em> are also used as suffixes in compound words. The words <em>carcinoma</em> and <em>sarcoma</em> are used as suffixes to indicate malignant tumors, as in <em>adenocarcinoma</em> and <em>fibrosarcoma</em>.</p>

                        <h3>Case Study 6-1: Esophageal Spasm</h3>
                        <p>B.R., a 53-year-old woman, consulted with her primary physician because of occasional episodes of dysphagia with moderate to severe tight, gripping pain in her midthorax. She reported that the onset was sudden after ingestion of certain foods or beverages, beginning retrosternally and radiating to the cervical and dorsal regions. The pain was not relieved by assuming a supine position or holding her breath. B.R. also stated that she felt like her heart was racing and that she might be having a heart attack. She denied any dyspepsia, vomiting, or dyspnea. Her doctor suspected acute esophageal spasm or possibly a paraesophageal hiatal hernia and referred B.R. to a gastroenterologist for a gastroscopy and esophageal manometry study (pressure measurement). She also underwent a barium swallow study under fluoroscopic imaging.</p>

                        <h3>Case Study 6-2: HIV Infection and Tuberculosis</h3>
                        <p>T.H., a 48-year-old man, was an admitted intravenous (IV) drug user and occasionally abused alcohol. Over 4 weeks, he had experienced fever, night sweats, malaise, a cough, and a 10-lb. weight loss. He was also concerned about several discolored lesions that had erupted weeks before on his arms and legs.</p>
                        <p>T.H. made an appointment with a physician assistant (PA) at the neighborhood clinic. On examination, the PA noted bilateral anterior cervical and axillary lymphadenopathy and pyrexia. T.H.'s temperature was 39°C. The PA sent T.H. to the hospital for further studies.</p>
                        <p>T.H.'s chest radiograph (x-ray image) showed paratracheal adenopathy and bilateral interstitial infiltrates, suspicious of tuberculosis (TB). His blood study results were positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and showed a low lymphocyte count. Sputum and bronchoscopic lavage (washing) fluid were positive for an acid-fast bacillus (AFB), and a PPD (purified protein derivative) skin test result was also positive. Based on these findings, T.H. was diagnosed with HIV, TB, and Kaposi sarcoma related to past IV drug abuse.</p>

                        <h3>Case Study 6-3: Endocarditis</h3>
                        <p>D.A., a 37-year-old alcoholic man, sought treatment after experiencing several days of high fever and generalized weakness on return from his vacation. D.A.'s family doctor suspected cardiac involvement because of D.A.'s history of rheumatic fever. The doctor was concerned because D.A.'s brother had died of acute malignant hyperpyrexia during surgery at the age of 12. D.A. was referred to a cardiologist, who scheduled an electrocardiogram (ECG) and a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE).</p>
                        <p>D.A. was admitted to the hospital with subacute bacterial endocarditis (SBE) and placed on high-dose IV antibiotics and bed rest. He had also developed a heart murmur, which was diagnosed as idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis (IHSS).</p>
