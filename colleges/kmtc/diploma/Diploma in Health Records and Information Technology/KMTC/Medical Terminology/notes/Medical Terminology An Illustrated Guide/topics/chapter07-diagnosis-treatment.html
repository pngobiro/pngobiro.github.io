                        <p>Medical <strong>diagnosis</strong>, the determination of the nature and cause of an illness, begins with a patient history. This includes a history of the present illness with a description of symptoms, a past medical history, and a family and a social history.</p>
                        <p>A physical examination, which includes a review of all systems and observation of any signs of illness, follows the history taking. Practitioners use the following techniques in performing physicals:</p>

                            <li><strong>Inspection</strong>: visual examination.</li>
                            <li><strong>Palpation</strong>: touching the surface of the body with the hands or fingers.</li>
                            <li><strong>Percussion</strong>: tapping the body and listening to the sounds produced (Fig. 7-1).</li>
                            <li><strong>Auscultation</strong>: listening to body sounds with a stethoscope (Fig. 7-2).</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Vital signs</strong> (VS) are also recorded for comparison with normal ranges. Vital signs are measurements that reflect basic functions necessary to maintain life and include:</p>

                        <p>The skin, hair, and nails provide easily observable indications of a person's state of health. Such features of the skin as color, texture, thickness, and presence of lesions (local injuries) are noted throughout the course of the physical examination. Chapter 21 contains a discussion of the skin and skin diseases.</p>
                        <p>Diagnosis is further aided by laboratory test results. These may include tests on blood, urine, and other body fluids, and the identification of infectious organisms. Additional tests may include study of the electrical activity of tissues such as the brain and heart, examination of body cavities by means of an <strong>endoscope</strong> (Fig. 7-6), and imaging techniques. <strong>Biopsy</strong> is the removal of tissue for microscopic examination. Biopsy specimens can be obtained by needle withdrawal (aspiration) of fluid, as from the chest or from a cyst; by a small punch, as of the skin; by endoscopy, as from the respiratory or digestive tract; or by surgical removal, as of a tumor or node.</p>

                        <p>Imaging techniques are the use of various physical forces to produce visual images of the body. The most fundamental imaging method is <strong>radiography</strong>, which uses x-rays to produce a picture (radiograph) on sensitized film. Radiography is best at showing dense tissues, such as bone, but views of soft tissue can be enhanced by using a contrast medium, such as a barium mixture, to outline the tissue. Other forms of energy used to produce diagnostic images include sound waves, radioactive isotopes, radio waves, and magnetic fields. See Display 7-1 for a description of imaging methods.</p>

                            <p>The science of medicine never stands still, nor does its terminology. One can never say that his or her work in learning medical terminology is complete because vocabulary is constantly being added as new diagnoses, treatments, and technologies are discovered or developed.</p>
                            <p>A generation ago, gene therapy, genetic engineering, in vitro fertilization, cloning, and stem cell research were unknown to the public. PET scans, MRI, DNA fingerprinting, radioimmunoassay, bone density scans for identifying osteoporosis, and other diagnostic techniques were not in use. Some of the new categories of drugs, such as statins for reducing cholesterol, antiviral agents, histamine antagonists for treating ulcers, ACE inhibitors for treating hypertension, and breast cancer preventives were undiscovered. The genes associated with certain forms of cancer and with certain hereditary abnormalities had yet to be isolated.</p>
                            <p>Each of these advances brings new terminology into use. Anyone who wants to keep current with medical terminology has a lifetime of learning ahead.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p><strong>Surgery</strong> is a method for treating disease or injury by manual operations. Surgery may be done through an existing body opening, but usually it involves cutting or puncturing tissue with a sharp instrument in the process of <strong>incision</strong>. (See Display 7-2 for descriptions of surgical instruments and Figure 7-9 for pictures of surgical instruments.) Some form of <strong>anesthesia</strong> to dull or eliminate pain is usually required. After surgery, incisions must be closed for proper healing. Conventionally, this is done using stitches or <strong>sutures</strong>, but adhesive strips, staples, and skin glue also are used.</p>
                        <p>Many types of operations are now performed using a <strong>laser</strong> beam. This is an intense beam of light that can be used for surgery and for diagnosis. Some procedures require destruction of tissue by a harmful agent, such as by heat or a chemical, in the process of <strong>cautery</strong> or cauterization.</p>
                        <p>Some of the purposes of surgery include:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li><strong>Treatment:</strong> For <strong>excision</strong> (cutting out) of diseased or abnormal tissue, such as a tumor or an inflamed appendix. Surgical methods are also used to repair wounds or injuries, as in skin grafting for burns or realigning broken bones. Surgical methods are used to correct circulatory problems and to return structures to their normal position, as in raising a prolapsed organ, such as the bladder, in a surgical fixation procedure.</li>
                            <li><strong>Diagnosis:</strong> To remove tissue for laboratory study in a biopsy, as described above. Exploratory surgery to investigate the cause of symptoms is performed less frequently now because of advances in noninvasive diagnostic and imaging techniques.</li>
                            <li><strong>Restoration:</strong> Surgery may compensate for lost function, as when a section of the intestine is redirected in a colostomy, a tube is inserted to allow breathing in a tracheostomy, a feeding tube is inserted, or an organ is transplanted. Plastic or reconstructive surgery may be done to accommodate a prosthesis, to restore proper appearance, or for cosmetic reasons.</li>
                            <li><strong>Relief:</strong> <strong>Palliative</strong> treatment is any therapy that provides relief but is not intended as a cure. Surgery is done to relieve pain or discomfort, as by cutting the nerve supply to an organ or reducing the size of a tumor to relieve pressure.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Surgery may be done in an emergency or urgent situation under conditions of acute danger, as in traumatic injury or severe blockage. Other procedures, such as cataract removal from the eye, may be planned when convenient. Elective or optional surgery would not cause serious consequences if delayed or not done.</p>
                        <p>Over time, surgery has extended beyond the classic operating room of a hospital to other hospital areas and to private surgical facilities where people can be treated within 1 day as outpatients. Preoperative care is given before surgery and includes examination, obtaining the patient's informed consent for the procedure, and preadmission testing. Postoperative care includes recovery from anesthesia, follow-up evaluations, and instructions for home care.</p>

                        <p>During the last century, the leading causes of death in industrialized countries gradually shifted from infectious diseases to chronic diseases of the cardiovascular and respiratory systems and cancer. In addition to advancing age, these conditions are greatly influenced by life habits and the environment. As a result, many people have begun to consider healing practices from other philosophies and cultures as alternatives and complements to conventional Western medicine. Some of these philosophies include osteopathy, naturopathy, homeopathy, and chiropractic. Techniques of acupuncture, biofeedback, massage, and meditation may also be used, as well as herbal remedies (see Chapter 8) and nutritional counseling on diet, vitamins, and minerals.</p>
                        <p>With complementary and alternative therapies, emphasis is placed on maintaining health rather than treating disease and on allowing the body opportunity to heal itself. The U.S. government has established the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) within the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to study these therapies.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Methods used in the diagnosis of cancer include physical examination, biopsy, imaging techniques, and laboratory test results for abnormalities, or "markers," associated with specific types of malignancies. Some cancer markers are byproducts, such as enzymes, hormones, and cellular proteins, that are abnormal or are produced in abnormal amounts. Researchers are also linking specific genetic mutations to certain forms of cancer.</p>
                        <p>Two methods, grading and staging, are used to classify cancers to select and evaluate therapy and estimate the outcome of the disease. <strong>Grading</strong> is based on histologic changes observed in the tumor cells when they are examined microscopically. Grades increase from I to IV with the increasing abnormality of the cells.</p>
                        <p><strong>Staging</strong> is a procedure for establishing the clinical extent of tumor spread, both at the original site and in other parts of the body (metastases). The TNM system is commonly used. These letters stand for primary tumor (T), regional lymph nodes (N), and distant metastases (M). Evaluation in these categories varies for each type of tumor. Based on TNM results, a stage ranging from I–IV in severity is assigned. Cancers of the blood, lymphatic system, and nervous system are evaluated by different standards.</p>
                        <p>The most widely used methods for treatment of cancer are surgery, radiation therapy, and <strong>chemotherapy</strong> (treatment with chemicals). Newer methods of <strong>immunotherapy</strong> use substances that stimulate the immune system as a whole or vaccines prepared specifically against a tumor. Hormone therapy may also be effective against certain types of tumors. When no active signs of the disease remain, the cancer is said to be in <strong>remission</strong>.</p>

                        <p>C.F., a 46-year-old married Asian woman, works as an office manager for an insurance company. This morning, she had a follow-up visit with her oncologist and was sent to the hospital for immediate admission for possible recurrence or sequelae of her ovarian cancer. She is alert, articulate, and a reliable reporter.</p>
                        
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li><strong>CC:</strong> C.F. presents with mild, low, aching pelvic pain and low abdominal fullness. She states, "I feel like I have cramps and am bloated. I've even gained 6 pounds. Sometimes I'm so tired I cannot do my work without a short nap."</li>
                            <li><strong>HPI:</strong> C.F. has been in remission for 14 months from aggressively treated ovarian carcinoma. She presents with mild abdominal distention and tenderness on deep palpation of the lower pelvis. C.F. claims a feeling of fullness in the lower abdomen, loss of appetite, and inability to sleep through the night. She is afraid that her cancer was not cured. Sometimes her heart races and she cannot catch her breath, but with two children in college, she cannot afford to miss work.</li>

                            <li><strong>PMH:</strong> C.F. was diagnosed with ovarian CA 4 years ago and treated with surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. A total abdominal hysterectomy (removal of the uterus) with bilateral removal of the oviducts and ovaries was performed. At the time of surgery, the pelvic lymph nodes tested negative for disease. Chemotherapy and radiation therapy occurred after surgical recovery. C.F. has been well and capable of full ADL until 4 weeks ago. Childhood history is unremarkable, with normal childhood diseases, including measles, mumps, and chicken pox. C.F. was born and raised in this country. She has no other adult diseases, surgery, or injuries.</li>
                            <li><strong>CURRENT HEALTH Hx:</strong> Denies tobacco, ETOH, or recreational drugs or substances. She exercises 3 to 5 times per week with aerobic exercise class and treadmill. She is a vegetarian and drinks 1 to 5 cups of green tea per day.

                            <li><strong>DIAGNOSTIC IMPRESSION:</strong> Possible recurrence of ovarian CA, ascites</li>
                            <li><strong>TREATMENT PLAN:</strong> Send blood for CA-125 (genetic marker for ovarian cancer). Schedule abdominal paracentesis and second-look diagnostic laparoscopy with biopsy and tissue staging. D/C all herbal supplements.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Case Study 7-2: Diagnostic Laparoscopy</h3>
                        <p>For a laparoscopy, C.F. was given general anesthesia and her trachea was intubated. She was placed in lithotomy position with arms abducted. Her abdomen was insufflated with carbon dioxide (CO2) through a thin needle placed below the umbilicus. Three trocar punctures were made to insert the telescope with camera and the cutting and grasping instruments. Biopsies were taken of several pelvic lymph nodes and sent to the pathology laboratory. There were many adhesions from prior surgery, which were lysed to mobilize her organs and enhance visualization. A loop of small bowel, which had adhered to the anterior abdominal wall, had been punctured when the trocar was introduced. The surgeon repaired the defect with an endoscopic stapler and irrigated the abdomen with 3 L of NSS mixed with antibiotic solution.</p>

                        <h3>Case Study 7-3: Postoperative Care</h3>
                        <p>After surgery, C.F. complained of numbness, tingling, and paralysis in her right arm and bilateral subscapular pain when she stood. The retained CO2 was eventually absorbed, and the subscapular pain diminished. A consult with a neurologist confirmed that she sustained a nerve injury during surgery from hyperabduction of the arm.</p>
                        <p>Biopsy results were negative, there was no fluid found on paracentesis, and the CA-125 was below 35U/mL, which is negative for recurrence. She was referred to physical therapy to strengthen and maintain range of motion (ROM) in her arm. Occupational therapy was scheduled to help her gain independence with ADL, along with psychological counseling to help her verbalize her fears and gain a sense of control.</p>
