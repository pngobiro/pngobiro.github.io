                        <p>Medical terminology is a special vocabulary used by health care professionals for effective and accurate communication. Because it is based mainly on Greek and Latin words, medical terminology is consistent and uniform throughout the world. It is also efficient; although some of the terms are long, they often reduce an entire phrase to a single word. The one word <em>gastroduodenostomy</em>, for example, stands for "a communication between the stomach and the first part of the small intestine" (Fig. 1-1).</p>

                        </figure>

                        <p>The medical vocabulary is vast, and learning it may seem like learning the entire vocabulary of a foreign language. Moreover, like the jargon that arises in all changing fields, it is always expanding. Think of the terms that have been added to our vocabulary with the development of computers, such as software, megabyte, search engine, e-mail, chat room. The task seems overwhelming, but there are methods that can aid in learning and remembering words and can even help in making informed guesses regarding the meanings of unfamiliar words. Most medical terms can be divided into component parts—roots, prefixes, and suffixes—that maintain the same meaning whenever they appear. By learning these meanings, you can analyze and remember many words.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Word Parts</h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The fundamental unit of each medical word is the <strong>root</strong>. This establishes the basic meaning of the word and is the part to which modifying prefixes and suffixes are added.</p>
                        <p>A <strong>suffix</strong> is a short word part or series of parts added at the end of a root to modify its meaning. In this book suffixes are indicated by a dash before the suffix, such as <em>-itis</em>.</p>
                        <p>A <strong>prefix</strong> is a short word part added before a root to modify its meaning. In this book prefixes are indicated by a dash after the prefix, such as <em>pre-</em>. Shown diagrammatically:</p>
                        
                        <div style="text-align: center; margin: 1rem 0; padding: 1rem; background: #f8f9fa; border-radius: 8px;">
                            <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; gap: 1rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
                                <span style="padding: 0.5rem 1rem; background: #e3f2fd; border: 1px solid #2196f3;">Prefix</span>

                                <span style="padding: 0.5rem 1rem; background: #e3f2fd; border: 1px solid #2196f3;">Suffix</span>
                            </div>
                            <p><em>Words are formed from roots, prefixes, and suffixes.</em></p>
                        </div>

                        <p>The simple word <em>learn</em> can be used as a root to illustrate. If we add the suffix <em>-er</em> to form <em>learner</em>, we have "one who learns." If we add the prefix <em>re-</em> to form <em>relearn</em>, we have "to learn again."</p>
                        <p>Not all roots are complete words. In fact, most medical roots are derived from other languages and are meant to be used in combinations. The Greek word <em>kardia</em>, for example, meaning "heart," gives us the root <em>cardi</em>. The Latin word <em>pulmo</em>, meaning "lung," gives us the root <em>pulm</em>. In a few instances, both the Greek and Latin roots are used. We find both the Greek root <em>nephr</em> and the Latin root <em>ren</em> used in words pertaining to the kidney (Fig. 1-2).</p>
                        
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/page-18-01.jpg" alt="Diagram of the urinary system highlighting the kidney to illustrate the roots nephr and ren." class="content-image">
                            <figcaption>FIGURE 1-2. The Greek root nephr and the Latin root ren are used to refer to the kidney, an organ of the urinary system.</figcaption>
                        </figure>

                        <p>Note that the same root may have different meanings in different fields of study. The root <em>myel</em> means "marrow" and may apply to either the bone marrow or the spinal cord. The root <em>scler</em> means "hard" but may also apply to the white of the eye. <em>Cyst</em> means "a filled sac or pouch" but also refers specifically to the urinary bladder. You will sometimes have to consider the context of a word before assigning its meaning.</p>
                        <p>Compound words contain more than one root. The words <em>eyeball</em>, <em>bedpan</em>, <em>frostbite</em>, and <em>wheelchair</em> are examples. Some compound medical words are <em>cardiovascular</em> (pertaining to the heart and blood vessels), <em>urogenital</em> (pertaining to the urinary and reproductive systems), and <em>lymphocyte</em> (a white blood cell found in the lymphatic system).</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>When a suffix beginning with a consonant is added to a root, a vowel (usually an o) is inserted between the root and the suffix to aid in pronunciation.</p>
                        
                        <div style="text-align: center; margin: 1rem 0;">

                        </div>

                        <p>Thus, when the suffix <em>-logy</em>, meaning "study of," is added to the root <em>neur</em>, meaning "nerve or nervous system," a combining vowel is added:</p>
                        <p style="text-align: center; font-weight: 500;">neur + o + logy = neurology (study of the nervous system)</p>
                        
                        <p>Roots shown with a combining vowel are called <strong>combining forms</strong>.</p>

                            <span style="padding: 0.5rem; background: #f0f0f0;">Root</span> — <strong>O</strong>
                            <p style="margin-top: 0.5rem;"><em>A root with a combining vowel is often called a combining form.</em></p>
                        </div>

                        <p>In this text, roots are given with their most common combining vowels added after a slash and are referred to simply as roots, as in <em>neur/o</em>. A combining vowel usually is not used if the ending begins with a vowel. The root <em>neur</em> is combined with the suffix <em>-itis</em>, meaning "inflammation of," in this way:</p>
                        <p style="text-align: center; font-weight: 500;">neur + itis = neuritis (inflammation of a nerve)</p>
                        
                        <p>There are some exceptions to this rule, particularly when pronunciation or meaning is affected, but you will observe these as you work.</p>

                        <p>As mentioned, most medical word parts come from Greek (G) and Latin (L). The original words and their meanings are included in this text only occasionally. They are interesting, however, and may aid in learning. For example, <em>muscle</em> comes from a Latin word that means "mouse" because the movement of a muscle under the skin was thought to resemble the scampering of a mouse.</p>
                        <p>The coccyx, the tail end of the spine, is named for the cuckoo because it was thought to resemble the cuckoo's bill (Fig. 1-3). For those interested in the derivations of medical words, a good medical dictionary will provide this information. Several such books are listed in the bibliography at the end of this text.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Phonetic pronunciations are provided in the text at every opportunity, even in the answer keys. Take advantage of these aids. Repeat the word aloud as you learn to recognize it in print. Be aware that word parts may change in pronunciation when they are combined in different ways. The following pronunciation guidelines apply throughout the text.</p>
                        
                        <p>A vowel (a, e, i, o, u) gets a short pronunciation if it has no pronunciation mark over it, such as:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>a as in hat</li>
                            <li>e as in met</li>
                            <li>i as in bin</li>
                            <li>o as in some</li>
                            <li>u as in run</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>A short line over the vowel gives it a long pronunciation:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>ā as in say</li>
                            <li>ē as in tea</li>
                            <li>ī as in lie</li>
                            <li>ō as in hose</li>
                            <li>ū as in sue</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>The accented syllable in each word is shown with capital letters.</p>
                        <p>Note that pronunciations may vary from place to place. Only one pronunciation for each word is given here, but be prepared for differences.</p>

                            <p>When pronunciations are included in a text, it is sometimes difficult to know which pronunciation of a term to use. Pronunciations may vary from country to country, even in different regions of the same country. Think how easy it is to distinguish a southern accent and one from the midwest or northeastern United States. The general rule is to include the most common pronunciation.</p>
                            <p>The word gynecology is usually pronounced with a hard g in the United States, but in many areas a soft g is used, as in jin-e-KOL-o-jē. Words pertaining to the cerebrum (largest part of the brain) may have an accent on different syllables. The adjective is usually pronounced with the accent on the second syllable (se-RE-bral), but in cerebrum (SER-e-brum) and cerebrospinal (ser-e-brō-SPĪ-nal), the accented syllable differs.</p>
                            <p>The name for the first part of the small intestine (duodenum) is often pronounced dū-o-DĒ-num, although the pronunciation dū-OD-e-num is also acceptable. When extreme, some alternate pronunciations can sound like a foreign language. The word we pronounce as SKEL-e-tal is pronounced in some other English-speaking countries as ske-LĒ-tal.</p>
                        </aside>

                        <h3>Soft and Hard c and g</h3>
                        <p>A soft c, as in racer, will be written as s (RĀ-ser). A hard c, as in candy, will be written as k (KAN-dē). A soft g, as in page, will be written as j (pāj). A hard g, as in grow, will be written as g (grō).</p>

                        <h3>Silent Letters and Unusual Pronunciations</h3>
                        <p>A silent letter or unusual pronunciation can be a problem, especially if it appears at the start of a word that you are trying to look up in the dictionary. See Table 1-1 for some examples.</p>

                        <p>Like symbols, abbreviations can save time, but they can also cause confusion if they are not universally understood. Usage varies in different institutions, and the same abbreviation may have different meanings in different fields. An <strong>acronym</strong> is an abbreviation formed from the first letter of each word in a phrase. Some everyday acronyms are ASAP (as soon as possible) and ATM (automated teller machine). In computerese, RAM stands for "random access memory." Acronyms have become popular for saving time and space in naming objects, organizations, and procedures. Only the most commonly used abbreviations are given. These are listed at the end of each chapter, but a complete alphabetical list appears in Appendix 2. An abbreviation dictionary also is helpful.</p>

                        <h3>Case Study 1-1: Multiple Health Problems Secondary to Injury</h3>
                        <p>D.S., a 28-year-old woman, was treated for injuries sustained in a train derailment accident. During the course of her treatment, she was seen by several specialists. For pain in her knee and hip joints, she was referred to an orthopedist. For migraine headaches and blurry vision, she consulted a neurologist. For pain on urination and occasional bloody urine, she saw a urologist. Later, for a persistent dry cough and problems resulting from a fractured nose, she was referred to an otorhinolaryngologist. During her initial course of treatment, she had a CT scan of her abdomen and brain and an MRI of her hip and knee. Both imaging studies required her to lie motionless on her back for 45 minutes.</p>
                        <p>Several months after the accident, D.S. was still experiencing some discomfort, and she decided to investigate alternative therapies. She made an appointment with a naturist practitioner who specialized in homeopathy and herbal medicine. Before her appointment, she browsed in the Nutra-Medica Shop, which carried nutritional supplements, vitamin and mineral products, homeopathic remedies, and herbal formulas. She planned to ask the therapist about some of the products that she saw there, which included remedies with the trade names Pneumogen, Arthogesia-Plus, Renovite, Nephrostat, and Hematone.</p>
