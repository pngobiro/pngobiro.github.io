                        <p>A <strong>drug</strong> is a substance that alters body function. Traditionally, drugs have been derived from natural plant, animal, and mineral sources. Today, most are manufactured synthetically by pharmaceutical companies. A few, such as certain hormones and enzymes, have been produced by genetic engineering.</p>
                        <p>Many drugs, described as over-the-counter (OTC) drugs, are available without <strong>prescription</strong>. Others require a health care provider's prescription for use. Responsibility for the safety and <strong>efficacy</strong> of all drugs sold in the United States lies with the Federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which must approve all drugs before they are sold.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Adverse Drug Effects</h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Most drugs have potential adverse effects or <strong>side effects</strong> that must be evaluated before being prescribed. In addition, there may be <strong>contraindications</strong>, or reasons not to use a particular drug for a specific individual based on that person's medical conditions, current medications, sensitivity, or family history. Also, while a patient is under treatment, it is important to be alert for signs of adverse effects such as digestive upset, changes in the blood, or signs of allergy, such as hives or skin rashes. <strong>Anaphylaxis</strong> is an immediate and severe allergic reaction that may be caused by a drug. It can lead to life-threatening respiratory distress and circulatory collapse.</p>
                        <p>Because drugs given in combination may interact, the prescriber must know of any drugs the patient is taking before prescribing another. In some cases, a combination may result in <strong>synergy</strong> or <strong>potentiation</strong>, meaning that the drugs together have a greater effect than either of the drugs acting alone. In other cases, one drug may act as an <strong>antagonist</strong> of another, interfering with its action. Drugs may also react adversely with certain foods or substances used socially, such as alcohol and tobacco.</p>
                        <p>Drugs that act on the central nervous system may lead to a psychological or physical <strong>substance dependence</strong>, in which a person has a chronic or compulsive need for a drug regardless of its bad effects. With repeated use, a person may develop a drug <strong>tolerance</strong>, whereby a constant dose has less effect and the dose must be increased to produce the original response. Cessation of the drug then leads to symptoms of substance <strong>withdrawal</strong>, a state that results from reduction or removal of a drug. Certain symptoms are associated with withdrawal from specific drugs.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Drug Names</h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Drugs may be cited by either their generic or their trade names. The <strong>generic name</strong> is usually a simple version of the chemical name for the drug and is not capitalized. The <strong>trade name</strong> (brand name, proprietary name) is a registered trademark of the manufacturer and is written with an initial capital letter. The same drug may be marketed by different companies under different trade names.</p>

                            <h4 class="callout-title"><span class="callout-icon">ℹ️</span> Box 8-1 Where Do They Get Those Names?</h4>
                            <p>Drug names are derived in a variety of ways. Some are named for their origin. Adrenaline, for example, is named for its source, the adrenal gland. Even its generic name, epinephrine, informs us that it comes from the gland that is above the kidney. Pitocin, a drug used to induce labor, is named for its source, the pituitary gland, combined with the chemical name of the hormone, oxytocin. Botox, currently injected into the skin for cosmetic removal of wrinkles, is the toxin from the organism that causes botulism, a type of food poisoning. Aspirin (an anti-inflammatory agent), Taxol (an antitumor agent), digitalis (used to treat heart failure), and atropine (a smooth muscle relaxant) are all named for the plants they come from. For example, aspirin is named for the blossoms of Spiraea, from which it comes. Taxol is named for the genus <em>Taxus</em>, of the yew from which it comes. Digitalis comes from purple foxglove, genus <em>Digitalis</em>. Atropine comes from the plant <em>Atropa belladonna</em>.</p>
                            <p>Some names tell about the drug or its actions. The name for Humulin, which is a form of insulin made by genetic engineering, points up the fact that this is human insulin and not a hormone from animal sources. Lomotil reduces intestinal motility and is used to treat diarrhea. The name belladonna is from Italian and means "fair lady," because this drug dilates the pupils of the eyes, making women appear more beautiful.</p>

                        <p>In the United States, the standard for drug information is the <em>United States Pharmacopeia</em> (USP). This reference is published by a national committee of pharmacologists and other scientists. It contains formulas for drugs sold in the United States and standards for testing the strength, quality, and purity of drugs and standards for the preparation and dispensing of drugs. There is also the <em>Hospital Formulary</em>, published by the American Society of Health System Pharmacists, and the <em>Physicians' Desk Reference</em>, published yearly by Medical Economics Books, with information supplied by the manufacturers. Another excellent source of up-to-date information on drugs is a community or hospital pharmacist.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>For hundreds of years, people have used plants to treat diseases, a practice described as herbal medicine or <strong>phytomedicine</strong>. Many people in industrialized countries are now turning to herbal products as alternatives or complements to conventional medicines. Although plants are the source of many conventional drugs, the active ingredients in these drugs usually are purified, measured, and often modified or synthesized rather than being used in their natural state.</p>
                        <p>Some issues have arisen with the increased use of herbals, including questions about their purity, safety, concentration, and efficacy. Another issue is drug interactions. Health care providers should ask about the use of herbal remedies when taking a patient's drug history, and patients should report any herbal medicines they take when under treatment. The FDA does not test or regulate herbal medicines, and there are no requirements to report adverse effects. There are, however, restrictions on the health claims that can be made by the manufacturers of herbal medicines. The U.S. government has established the Office of Dietary Supplements (ODS) to support and coordinate research in this field.</p>
                        <p>Displays 8-1 through 8-5 (after the word exercises) summarize information on drugs. Display 8-1 outlines the major categories of drugs, with examples cited by both generic and trade names. Display 8-2 lists some common herbal medicines and their uses. Displays 8-3 through 8-5 have information on routes of administration, drug preparations, and injectable drugs. Refer to these displays as needed as you work through Part 3 of the text.</p>

                        <h3>Case Study 8-1: Cardiac Disease and Crisis</h3>
                        <p>P.L., who has a 4-year history of heart disease, was brought to the emergency room by ambulance with chest pain that radiated down her arm, dyspnea, and syncope. Her routine meds included: Lanoxin to slow and strengthen her heart beat, Inderal to support her heart rhythm, Lipitor to decrease her cholesterol, Catapres to lower her hypertension, nitroglycerin prn for chest pain, Hydro-DIURIL to eliminate fluid and decrease the workload of her heart, Diabinese for her diabetes, and Coumadin to prevent blood clots. She also took Tagamet for her stomach ulcer and several OTC preparations, including an herbal sleeping potion that she mixed in tea, and Metamucil mixed in orange juice every morning for her bowels. Shortly after admission, P.L.'s heart rate deteriorated into full cardiac arrest. Immediate resuscitation was instituted with cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), defibrillation, and a bolus of IV epinephrine. Between shocks she was given a bolus of lidocaine and a bolus of diltiazem plus repeated doses of epinephrine every 5 minutes. P.L. did not respond to resuscitation. On the death certificate, her primary cause of death was listed as cardiac arrest. Multiple secondary diagnoses were listed, including polypharmacy.</p>

                        <h3>Case Study 8-2: Inflammatory Bowel Disease</h3>
                        <p>A.E., a 19-year-old college student, was diagnosed at the age of 13 with Crohn disease, a chronic inflammatory disease that can affect the entire gastrointestinal tract from mouth to anus. A.E.'s disease is limited to his large bowel. During a 9-month period of disease exacerbation, he took oral corticosteroids (prednisone) to reduce the inflammatory response. He experienced many of the drug's side effects, but has been in remission for 4 years. Currently, A.E.'s condition is managed on drugs that reduce inflammation by suppressing the immune response. He takes Pentasa (mesalamine) 250mg 4 caps po bid. Pentasa is of the 5-ASA (acetylsalicylic acid or aspirin) group of anti-inflammatory agents, which work topically on the inner surface of the bowel. It has an enteric coating, which dissolves in the bowel environment. He also takes 6-mercaptopurine (Purinethol) 75 mg po qd and a therapeutic vitamin with breakfast. A.E. may take acetaminophen for pain but must avoid NSAIDs, which will irritate the intestinal mucosa (inner lining) and cause a flare-up of the disease.</p>

                        <h3>Case Study 8-3: Asthma</h3>
                        <p>E.N., a 20-year-old asthmatic woman, visited the preadmission testing unit one week before her cosmetic surgery to meet with the nurse and anesthesiologist. Her current meds included several bronchodilators, which she takes by mouth and by inhalation, and a tranquilizer that she takes when needed for nervousness. She sometimes receives inhalation treatments with Mucomyst, a mucolytic agent. On E.N.'s preoperative note, the nurse wrote:</p>
                        <ul style="list-style: none; padding-left: 1rem;">
                            <li>Theo-Dur 1 cap tid.</li>
                            <li>Flovent inhaler 1 spray (50 mcg) each nostril bid.</li>
                            <li>Ativan (lorazepam) 1 mg po bid.</li>
                            <li>Albuterol—metered dose inhaler 2 puffs (180 mcg) prn q4-6h for bronchospasm and before exercise.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>E.N. stated that she has difficulty with her asthma when she is anxious and when she exercises. She also admitted to occasional use of marijuana and ecstasy, a hallucinogen and mood-altering illegal recreational drug. The anesthesiologist wrote an order for lorazepam 4 mg IV 1 hour preop. The plastic surgeon recommended several herbal products to complement her surgery and her recovery. He ordered a high-potency vitamin 3 tabs with breakfast and dinner to support tissue health and healing. He also prescribed Bromelain, an enzyme from pineapple, to decrease inflammation, 1 po qid 3 days before surgery and postoperatively for 2 weeks. Arnica Montana was prescribed to decrease discomfort, swelling, and bruising; 3 tabs sublingual tid the evening after surgery and for the following 10 days.</p>
