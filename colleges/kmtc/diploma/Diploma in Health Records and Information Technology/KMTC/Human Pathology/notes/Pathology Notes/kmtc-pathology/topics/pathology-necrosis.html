                        <ol class="enhanced-list" type="i">
                            <li>Diabetes mellitus-this leads to excess cellular glycogen especially prominent in the renal and liver cells. The cells are distended and show nuclear ballooning or clear vacuoles of glycogen</li>
                            <li>Tumour- some tumour cells are rich in glycogen e.g. seminoma, renal cell carcinoma, Squamous cell carcinoma and chondroma</li>
                            <li>Glycogen storage-disease e.g. von Gierkes' disease inherited genetic disorders of glycogen metabolism</li>

                        <h3 class="section-heading">Fatty change</h3>
                        <p>This is the presence of demonstrable fat within paranchymal cells especially those of the liver, kidney and head. Usually excess fat in the body is stored in special storage tissue cell called adipose tissue. It is due to imbalance of fat and fatty acid entering the cell and the rate of utilization or release of fat by the cell. All paranchymal cells that accumulate an abnormal amount of fat are injured.</p>

                        <h4 class="section-heading">Microscopic appearance</h4>
                        <p>Fat may be seen in the form of multiple small droplets or in a single fat globule that may displace the nucleus.</p>

                        <h4 class="section-heading">Causes:</h4>
                        <ol class="enhanced-list" type="i">
                            <li>Hypoxia e.g. chronic venous congestion as in anaemia</li>

                            <li>Clinical and bacterial toxins e.g. phosphorus, carbon tetrachloride and alcohol</li>
                            <li>Fatty change is also a feature of severe infections e.g. typhoid fever, small pox, septicaemia</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h4 class="section-heading">Microscopic appearance</h4>
                        <p>The affected organs show pallor and on cross section give a greasy feel especially the liver; the kidney shows linear pallor streaks due to fat in the renal tubules.</p>

                        <h4 class="section-heading">Results</h4>
                        <p>Fatty change is a reversible process and if the cause is removed, the cells usually revert to normal but prolonged fatly change with evidence of nuclear degeneration eventually becomes irreversible and progresses to necrosis and fibrous replacement.</p>

                        <h4 class="section-heading">Nature</h4>
                        <p>Amyloids are predominantly extracellular fibrillar material which is due to a number of diseases. Extensive deposits are visible by the naked eye and cause enlargement of the affected tissue or organ.</p>

                        <h4 class="section-heading">In histological: examination</h4>
                        <p>Haematoxylin and Eosinophil sections of amyloid show homogenous pink material.On electron microscopy, amyloid is seen to consist of filaments twisted together in pairs</p>

                        <h4 class="section-heading">Demonstrations of amyloid in gross specimen of tissues using lugol's iodine method</h4>
                        <p>Amyloid has a high affinity for lodine. This forms the basis for useful macroscopic test when lugols lodine solution is poured over a tissue the amyloid is stained deep brown in contrast to normal tissues that is stained very lightly.</p>
