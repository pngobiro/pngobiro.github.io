# UNIT 1: INTRODUCTION TO CELL PATHOLOGY
- Pathology - from latin; Pathos= suffering (disease); Logos= study

Study of suffering (diseases) by scientific methods
- Pathology is the bridging discipline between basic science and clinical practice.
- Pathology deals with the structural and functional changes in the cells, tissues and organs that underlie disease.
- Pathology attempts to explain the why and wherefore and of signs and symptoms manifested by the patients by use of molecular, microbiologic, immunologic, and morphologic techniques.

## Branches of pathology
- Traditionally, the study of pathology is divided into;
- General pathology
- Systemic pathology
- General pathology is concerned with basic reactions of cells and tissues to abnormal stimuli that underlie all diseases.
- Systemic pathology or special pathology deals with the specific responses of specialized organs and tissues to more or less well defined stimuli.

## Aspects of disease process that forms the core of pathology
- Pathology gives explanations of a disease by studying the following aspects of disease
i. Etiology - cause of disease
ii. Pathogenesis - mechanism of diseases
iii. Pathological (morphological) changes - structural alterations - lesion
iv. Clinical feature - functional consequences of morphologic changes; Leads to signs and symptoms of patients
v. Complication
vi. Prognosis - prediction of the future of the victim

## Normal cell homeostasis
- The normal cell is confined to a fairly narrow range of function and structure by its genetic programs of metabolism, differentiation, and specialization, by constraints of neighboring cells and by the availability of metabolic substrates. It is able to handle normal physiologic demands which are called normal homeostasis.

## General main causes of diseases
- Can be divided into;

### A) congenital causes
- Genetic - inherited =cystic fibrosis;
- Spontaneous = Down's syndrome
- Non genetic causes - environmental.

Accidental - cerebral palsy (birth hypoxia).

### B) Acquired causes
i. Inflammation (bodies response to injury) e.g. appendicitis, TB
ii. Injury/trauma, disordered repair e.g. fracture, ASA induced PUD
iii. Hemodynamic disorder e.g. shock
iv. Growth disorders e.g. neoplasia
v. Immune disorders e.g. AIDS, Graves disease
vi. Metabolic disorders e.g. Diabetes
vii. Degeneration disorders e.g. osteoarthritis
viii. Iatrogenic diseases e.g. Cushing syndrome - excess steroids; Aplastic Anemia - chloramphenicol.

## Diagnostic techniques used in pathology
- The pathologist uses the following techniques to diagnose diseases:
i. Histopathology
ii. Cytopathology
iii. Hematopathology
iv. Immunohistochemistry
v. Microbiological examination
vi. Biochemical examination
vii. Cytogenetics
viii. Molecular techniques
ix. Autopsy

## Histopathological techniques
- Histopathological examination studies tissues under the microscope. During this study, the pathologist looks for abnormal structures in the tissue.
- Tissues for histopathological examination are obtained by biopsy. Biopsy is a tissue sample from a living person to identify the disease. Biopsy can be either incisional or excisional.
- Once the tissue is removed from the patient, it has to be immediately fixed by putting it into adequate amount of 10% Formaldehyde (10% formalin) before sending it to the pathologist.
- The purpose of fixation is:
1. To prevent autolysis and bacterial decomposition and putrefaction
2. To coagulate the tissue to prevent loss of easily diffusible substances
3. To fortify the tissue against the deleterious effects of the various stages in the preparation of sections and tissue processing.
4. To leave the tissues in a condition which facilitates differential staining with dyes and other reagents.
- Once the tissue arrives at the pathology department, the pathologists will exam it macroscopically (i.e. naked-eye examination of tissues).
- Then the tissue is processed to make it ready for microscopic examination. The whole purpose of the tissue processing is to prepare a very thin tissue (i.e. five to seven $\mu$m or one cell thick tissue) which can be clearly seen under the microscope. The tissue is processed by putting it into different chemicals. It is then impregnated (embedded) in paraffin, sectioned (cut) into thin slices, & is finally stained. The stains can be Hematoxylin/Eosin stain or special stains such as PAS, Immunohistochemistry, etc.
- The Hematoxylin/Eosin stain is usually abbreviated as H&E stain. The H&E stain is routinely used. It gives the nucleus a blue color & the cytoplasm & the extracellular matrix a pinkish color. Then the pathologist will look for abnormal structures in the tissue.
- And based on this abnormal morphology he/she will make the diagnosis. Histopathology is usually the gold standard for pathologic diagnosis.

Cytopathologic techniques: Cytopathology is the study of cells from various body sites to determine the cause or nature of disease.

## Applications of cytopathology:
- The main applications of cytology include the following:
1. Screening for the early detection of asymptomatic cancer. For example, the examination of scrapings from cervix for early detection and prevention of cervical cancer.
2. Diagnosis of symptomatic cancer. Cytopathology may be used alone or in conjunction with other modalities to diagnose tumors revealed by physical or radiological examinations.

It can be used in the diagnosis of cysts, inflammatory conditions and infections of various organs.
3. Surveillance of patients treated for cancer. For some types of cancers, cytology is the most feasible method of surveillance to detect recurrence. The best example is periodic urine cytology to monitor the recurrence of cancer of the urinary tract.

## Advantages of cytologic examination
- Compared to histopathologic technique it is cheap, takes less time and needs no anesthesia to take specimens. Therefore, it is appropriate for developing countries with
limited resources like Kenya. In addition, it is complementary to histopathological examination.

## Cytopathologic methods
- There are different cytopathologic methods including:

### 1. Fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC)
- In FNAC, cells are obtained by aspirating the diseased organ using a very thin needle under negative pressure. Virtually any organ or tissue can be sampled by fine-needle aspiration.
- The aspirated cells are then stained & are studied under the microscope. Superficial organs (e.g. thyroid, breast, lymph nodes, skin and soft tissues) can be easily aspirated. Deep organs, such as the lung, mediastinum, liver, pancreas, kidney, adrenal gland, and retroperitoneum are aspirated with guidance by fluoroscopy, ultrasound or CT scan.
- FNAC is cheap, fast, & accurate in diagnosing many diseases.

### 2. Exfoliative cytology
- Refers to the examination of cells that are shed spontaneously into body fluids or secretions. Examples include sputum, cerebrospinal fluid, urine, effusions in body cavities (pleura, pericardium, peritoneum), nipple discharge and vaginal discharge.

### 3. Abrasive cytology
- Refers to methods by which cells are dislodged by various tools from body surfaces (skin, mucous membranes, and serous membranes). E.g. preparation of cervical smears with a spatula or a small brush to detect cancer of the uterine cervix at early stages. Such cervical smears, also called Pap smears, can significantly reduce the mortality from cervical cancer.

Hematological examination: This is a method by which abnormalities of the cells of the blood and their precursors in the bone marrow are investigated to diagnose the different kinds of anemia & leukemia.

Immunohistochemistry: This is a method is used to detect a specific antigen in the tissue in order to identify the type of disease.

Microbiological examination: This is a method, by which body fluids, excised tissue, etc. are examined by microscopical, cultural and serological techniques to identify micro-organisms responsible for many diseases.

Biochemical examination: This is a method by which the metabolic disturbances of disease are investigated by assay of various normal and abnormal compounds in the blood, urine, etc.

Clinical genetics (cytogenetics): This is a method in which inherited chromosomal abnormalities in the germ cells or acquired chromosomal abnormalities in somatic cells are investigated using the techniques of molecular biology.

Molecular techniques: Different molecular techniques such as fluorescent in situ hybridization, Southern blot, etc. can be used to detect genetic diseases.

Autopsy: Autopsy is examination of the dead body to identify the cause of death. This can be for forensic or clinical purposes.

The relative importance of each of the above disciplines to our understanding of disease varies for different types of diseases. For example, in diabetes mellitus, biochemical investigation provides the best means of diagnosis and is of greatest value in the control of the disease, whereas in the diagnosis of tumors, FNAC & histopathology contribute much.

However, for most diseases, diagnosis is based on a combination of pathological investigations.

# CELLULAR INJURY AND ADAPTATION
- These are the visible changes that occur in cells as a result of exposure to causative agents of disease; the degree of these changes varies according to the severity and duration of the damaging process.
- Cellular adaptation is a state that lies intermediate between the normal, unstressed cell and injured overstressed cells. Cells must continuously adapt, even under normal conditions, to changes in their environment.
- Somewhat more excessive physiologic stress or some pathologic stimuli can bring about a number of physiologic and morphologic changes in which a new but altered steady state is achieved while preserving the viability of the cells is cell adaptation.
- Cell injury can be divided into:
i. Reversible cell injury; indicating that the changes will regress and disappear when the injurious agent is removed and the cell will return to the normal morphologically and physiologically.
ii. Irreversible cell injury; occur when the injury is persistent or when it is severe from the onset. Here the cell alterations reach the point of no return and progression to cell death is inevitable.

## Classification of injurious agents
- Injurious agents can be classified into;
- Hypoxia (oxygen deprivation)
- Physical agents
- Chemical agents
- Infectious agents
- Immunological reactions
- Genetic derangements
- Nutritional imbalance

## Hypoxia
- Refers to a decrease in oxygen supply to the cells. It acts through interference with oxidative respiration of cells.
- Hypoxia results from;
- Loss of blood supply (ischaemia), which is the most common cause and occur when arterial flow is interfered with by e.g. narrowing of the lumen of an artery by atherosclerosis, thrombi or emboli.
- Inadequate blood oxygenation due to, for example, cardiac failure and /or respiratory failure.
- Decrease in oxygen carrying capacity of the blood e.g. Anaemia and carbon monoxide poisoning.
- Depending on the severity and duration of hypoxia, the cells may show one of the following;
- Adaptive atrophy (shrink in size)
- Injury
- Necrosis (the morphological expression of cell death)

## Physical agents
- That include;
- mechanical trauma
- Extremes of temperature; Deep cold and Extreme heat
- Radiation
- Electric shock
- Sudden change in atmospheric pressure
- These agents apply excess physical energy, in any form, to the body.

## Chemical agents

That include;
- Simple chemicals such as glucose and salt in hypertonic solution
- Oxygen in high concentration
- Poisons such as arsenic or cyanide
- Air pollutions
- Insecticides
- Occupational exposures e.g. Asbestos
- Social poisons such as Alcohol and narcotic drugs

## Infectious agents and infestations

That includes viruses, bacteria, fungi, parasites

## Immunological factors

These are primarily protective defense mechanisms against, for example, infectious agents; however they are sometimes harmful and injurious e.g.
- Hypersensitivity reactions - (exaggerated immune response to an antigen which may be triggered e.g. by drugs)
- Autoimmune disease - Directed to self antigens E.g. type 1 diabetes.
- Immunodeficiency - this is due to a deficiency component of the immune system which leads to increased susceptibility to different diseases e.g. HIV/AIDS.

## Genetic derangements

Exemplified by the wide range of hereditary diseases that range from those that are the result of gross chromosomal defects leading to severe congenital malformations e.g. Down's syndrome, to those that are caused by a single amino acid substitution in the structure of the haemoglobin leading to the synthesis of abnormal Hb e.g. Hbs in sickle cell.

## Nutritional factors

Deficiency of nutrients; these arise as a result of poor supply, interference with absorption, inefficient transport within the body, or defective utilization as of proteins - calorie malnutrition or vitamin deficiency.

Excesses as of lipids that leads to obesity with all its consequences including fatty changes in cells and predisposition to atherosclerosis.

## Course of disease
- The course of disease is shown with a simplified diagram as follows:

Exposure - Biological onset - Clinical onset -Permanent damage- Death

## Latency period
- The course of disease in the absence of any intervention is called the natural history of disease. The different stages in the natural history of disease include:
i. Exposure to various risk factors (causative agents).
ii. Latency, period between exposure and biological onset of disease
iii. Biological onset of disease; this marks the initiation of the disease process, however, without any symptom sign of disease. Following biological onset of disease, it may remain asymptomatic or subclinical (i.e. without any clinical manifestations) or may lead to overt clinical disease.
iv. Incubation (induction) period refers to variable period of time without any obvious signs and symptoms from the time of exposure.
v. The clinical onset of disease is when the signs and symptoms become apparent. The expression of the disease may variable in severity or in terms of range of manifestations.
vi. The onset of permanent damage, and
vii. Death.

Natural recovery, i.e. recovery without any intervention, can occur at any stage in the progression of the disease.

## Outcome and consequences of disease
- Resolution can occur without any sequelae.
- The disease can settle down, but sequelae are left.
- It may result in death.

## Clinical and biological death
a) Clinical death
- Clinical death is the reversible transmission between life and biologic death. Clinical death is defined as the period of respiratory, circulatory and brain arrest during which initiation of resuscitation can lead to recovery.
- Clinical death begins with either the last agonal inhalation or the last cardiac contraction.
- Signs indicating clinical death are;
- The patient is without pulse or blood pressure and is completely unresponsive to the most painful stimulus.
- The pupils are widely dilated.
- Some reflex to external stimulation is preserved. For example, during intubations, respiration may be restored in response to stimulation of the receptors of the superior laryngeal nerve, the nucleus of which is located in the medulla oblongata near the respiratory centre.
- Recovery can occur with resuscitation.
b) Biological death
- Biological death (sure sign of death), which sets in after clinical death, is an irreversible state of cellular destruction. It manifests with irreversible cessation of circulatory and respiratory functions, or irreversible cessation of all functions of the entire brain, including brain stem.

# CELLULAR RESPONSES (REACTIONS) TO INJURIOUS STIMULI

Include;
1. Cellular adaptations
- Atrophy
- Hypertrophy
- Hyperplasia
- Metaplasia
2. Acute cell injury
- Reversible cell injury; cellular swelling and fatty change
- Irreversible cell injury (cell death); necrosis and apoptosis
3. Other patterns
- Intracellular accumulation; occurs as a result of derangement in metabolism or excessive storage.
- Pathologic calcification; a common consequence of cell and tissue injury
- Subcellular alteration and cell inclusions; occur as a response to more chronic or persistent injurious stimuli

# MECHANISMS OF CELL INJURY

Injurious agents induce cell injury through their effects on one or more of the following cellular targets;
a) Aerobic respiration
b) Cell membrane
c) Protein synthesis
d) Cytoskeleton
e) Genetic apparatus (chromosomes and their contents of genes)

## Factors influencing the severity of cell injury
- Type, duration, and severity of the injurious agents
- Type of the cells affected; cells differ in their susceptibility to the effects of injurious agents, for example;

## Types of cell and tissue damage

## 1. Cell death;
- This is irreversible process
- It is of two types;
- Apoptosis
- Necrosis

## 2. Degeneration;

This is reversible process. It includes all the changes in the cells which is short of necrosis (i.e. before the stage of cell death and necrosis); e.g.
- Fatty changes
- Pigmentation

## APOPTOSIS
- Is programmed cell death; it is a physiological process by which cells are eliminated when they are no longer required by the body. It is part of normal turnover of body cells.
- Here, there is no inflammatory reaction against apoptosis because it is a normal physiological process.
- The cells become shrunk and compact and become eosinophilic in colour. Later it is fragmented and then other cells in the body will come and eat these fragments by a process called phagocytosis.
- Apoptosis is an irreversible process e.g. include;
- During embryogenesis i.e. it is responsible for shaping various organs and structures (morphogenesis).
- Hormone - dependent innovation e.g.
a) Physiological e.g. involution of endometrium during the menstrual cycle or lactating breast after weaning.
b) Pathological e.g. atrophy of prostate after castration.

## NECROSIS
- Is a morphological change that follows cell death in living tissues or organs.
- Necrosis represents cell death while still forming a part of the living body.
- It is always pathological and it occurs as a result of severe cell damage.
- It is always associated with inflammatory reactions.
- Necrosis results from the degrading actions of enzymes on irreversibly damaged cells with denaturation of cellular protein.
- In necrosis, there is cytoplasmic as well as nuclear changes.
a) Cytoplasmic changes
- In the haematoxylin - Eosin stain (H&E), the haematoxylin stain acidic materials (including the nucleus) blue, where as eosin stains alkaline materials (including cytoplasm) pink. The necrotic cells are more eosinophilic than viable cells (i.e. more intensely pinkish). This is due to:
- Loss of cytoplasmic RNA
- Increase of binding of eosin to the denatured protein
- The cells may have more glass homogenous appearance than normal cells; this is due to loss of glycogen particles (which normally give the granular appearance to the cytoplasm).

## a) Nuclear changes

The earliest change is chromatin dumping which is followed by one of the following two changes;
1. The nucleus may shrink and get transformed into small wrinkled mass (pyknosis). With time, there is progressive disintegration of chromatin with subsequent disappearance of nucleus together (karyolysis) or ;
2. The nucleus may break into many clumps (karyorrhexis).

## Types of necrosis

Macroscopically, there are five types of necrosis;
1) Coagulative necrosis
2) Liquefactive necrosis
3) Fat necrosis
4) Caseation (gaseous) necrosis
5) Gangrenous necrosis

## Coagulative necrosis
- Results from sudden severe ischaemia in such organs as the heart, kidneys etc.
- Microscopically, the fine structural details of the affected tissues and cells are lost but their outlines are maintained.
- The nucleus is lost.
- The cytoplasm is converted into homogenous deeply eosinophilic and structurally less material.
- The outlines of the affected cells are still discernible.

## Liquefactive necrosis
- This type of necrosis is usually seen in two situations;
- Brain infarctions i.e. ischaemic destruction of the brain tissues
- Abscess i.e. suppurative bacterial infections.
- Liquefactive necrosis is characterized by complete digestion of dead cells by enzymes and thus necrotic area is eventually liquefied i.e. converted into a cyst filled with debris and fluid.

## Fat necrosis
- This is a specific pattern of cell deaths seen in adipose tissue due to action of lipase.
- It is more commonly seen in acute pancreatitis. The released fatty acids from necrotic cells, complex with calcium to create calcium soaps. These are grossly seen as chalky white deposit.
- Fat necrosis can also be induced by mechanical trauma as in female breast (traumatic fat necrosis).

## Caseation (Gaseous) necrosis
- This combines the features of coagulative and liquefactive necrosis
- It is encountered principally in the centre of tuberculous granuloma
- The body responds to tuberculous infections in a specific form of chronic inflammation; the morphologic unit of this is called granuloma.
- Grossly, the caseous material is soft, friable, whitish-gray cheesy material.
- Microscopically, the area is surrounded by granulomatous inflammation. It has distinctive amorphous granular pinkish debris.

## Gangrenous necrosis
- It describes the limb (usually the lower limb) that has lost its blood supply and has subsequently been attacked by bacteria; so it is a combination of coagulative necrosis modified by liquefactive action of enzymes derived from bacteria and inflammatory cells.
- When coagulative pattern dominates, the affected parts shrink and appear contracted (dry), the process is termed dry gangrene. Conversely, when the affected parts are swollen (oedematous) the process is termed wet gangrene.

## TYPES OF CELLULAR ADAPTATION

Include;

## 1) Physiologic adaptation

Usually represents responses of cells to normal stimulation by hormones or endogenous chemical substances e.g. enlargement of breast and induction of lactation by pregnancy.

## 2) Pathologic adaptation

Many share the same underlying mechanism but they provide the cells with the ability to survive in their environment and perhaps escape injury.

## General mechanism of cellular adaptation
- Up and down - regulation of specific cellular receptor involved in metabolism of certain components, e.g. in regulation of cell surface receptors involved in the uptake and degradation of low density lipoproteins (LDL).
- Induction of new protein synthesis by the target cells, e.g. heat shock response.
- Production of one type of a family of proteins to another or markedly overproducing one protein e.g. cells producing various types of collagens and extra cellular matrix (ECM) proteins in chronic inflammation and fibrosis.

NB: Adaptation involves all steps of cellular metabolism of proteins;
- Receptor binding
- Signal transduction
- Transcription or regulation of protein packaging
- Release

## Morphological types of cellular adaptation

There are numerous types of cellular adaptation but four are common;
1) Atrophy
2) Hypertrophy
3) Hyperplasia
4) Metaplasia

## HYPERPLASIA
- Is one type of cellular adaptation in which there is an increase in number of cells in an organ or tissue which may cause increased volume/size.
- Hyperplasia takes place if the cellular population is capable of synthesizing DNA, permitting mitotic division.

Types of hyperplasia
- Physiologic hyperplasia
- Hormonal hyperplasia
- Compensatory hyperplasia
- Pathologic hyperplasia

## Hormonal physiologic hyperplasia

It occurs due to hormonal stimulation in response to physiologic demand, e.g. proliferation of glandular epithelium of the female breast at puberty and during pregnancy and hyperplasia of pregnant uterus.

## Compensatory physiologic hyperplasia

It occurs when a part of an organ is removed, e.g. hyperplasia that occurs when a portion of liver is removed.

## Pathologic hyperplasia

Most forms of pathologic hyperplasia are instances of excessive hormonal stimulation or are effects of growth factors on target cells, e.g. hyperplasia of endometrium, hyperplasia of prostate, hyperplasia of connective tissue cells in wound healing, skin warts.

## HYPERTROPHY

Is one type of adaptive response in which there is an increase in size of cells resulting from synthesis of more structural components in response to increased functional demand or by specific hormonal stimulation.

## Types of hypertrophy
i. Physiologic hypertrophy
ii. Pathologic hypertrophy

Examples:
- Physiologic hypertrophy
- Hypertrophy of myometrium during pregnancy stimulated by oestrogen
- Hypertrophy of skeletal muscle of muscle-builders induced by workload
- Pathologic hypertrophy
- Hypertrophy of cardiac muscles induced by increased workload in hypertension or chronic haemodynamic overload.

## ATROPHY
- Is an adaptive response in which there is shrinkage of the size of cells by loss of cell substances.
- When sufficient numbers of cells are involved, the entire tissue or organ diminishes in size or becomes atrophic.

## Causes of atrophy

Include;
1. Disuse/Decreased workload
2. Denervation/Loss of innervations
3. Diminished blood supply
4. Inadequate nutrition
5. Loss of endocrine stimulation
6. Aging

Examples of atrophy
- When a limb is immobilized in plaster cast or when muscle becomes paralyzed from loss of innervations, as in poliomyelitis, atrophy of the muscle occur
- In late adult life, the brain undergoes progressive atrophy, presumably due to atherosclerosis, narrows its blood supply and the sex glands shrinks with depletion of endocrine stimulation.

## Types of atrophy
- Physiologic atrophy
- Loss of endocrine stimulation following menopause
- Pathologic atrophy
- Due to loss of nerve

## Mechanisms of atrophy
- Atrophy represents a reduction in structural components of cells.
- The cell contains fewer mitochondria and microfilaments and lesser amounts of endoplasmic reticulum.
- There is a finely regulated balance between protein synthesis and degradation in normal cells. Either decreased synthesis or increased catabolism or both may cause atrophy.
- Slight increase of degradation over a long period of time may result in atrophy.
- Intracellular non-lysomal proteinases play a role in such protein degradation.
- Atrophy also accompanied by marked increases in number of autophagic vacuoles within the cell that contain fragments of cell components (e.g. mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum), which are destined for destruction, into which the lysosome discharge their hydrolytic contents. The cellular components are then digested.

## METAPLASIA

Is one type of adaptive response in which one adult cell type (epithelial or messenchymal) is replaced by another cell type. It represents an adaptive substitution of cells more sensitive to stress by cell types better able to withstand the adverse environment.

## Examples of metaplasia
1. Epithelial metaplasia
a) Columnar to squamous metaplasia;
- Occurs in respiratory tract in response to irritation. In habitual cigarette smoker, the normal columnar ciliated epithelial cells of the trachea and bronchi are often replaced focally or widely by stratified squamous epithelial cells.
- Stone in the excretory duct of salivary glands, pancreas and bile ducts may cause replacement of normal columnar epithelium by non-functioning stratified squamous epithelial cells.
- Deficiency of vitamin A induces squamous metaplasia in the respiratory epithelium.
- Squamous metaplasia of endocervical epithelium in response to chronic inflammation.

NOTE: In all instances, the more rugged stratified squamous epithelium is able to survive under circumstances in which more fragile specialized epithelium most likely would have succumbed.

The influences that predispose to such metaplasia, if present, may induce cancer transformation of metaplastic epithelium. Thus common cancer in respiratory tract is composed of squamous cells.
b) Squamous to columnar metaplasia

Barret's oesophagus, in which the squamous oesophageal epithelium is replaced by gastric columnar cells. The resulting cancers that may arise are glandular (adeno) carcinoma.

## 2. Messenchymal metaplasia

Fibrous connective tissue cells may become transformed to osteoblasts or chondroblasts to produce bone or catillage where it is normally not encountered. This occurs particularly in the foci of injury but occasionally with no cause.

## Pathogenesis of metaplasia

Metaplasia is thought to arise from genetic reprogramming of stem cells that are known to exist in most epithelium or undifferentiated messenchymal cells present in connective tissue. Chemical, vitamins or growth factors most likely play a role in such metaplasia.

## Reversible cellular changes & accumulations

Even though there are many different kinds of reversible cellular changes & accumulations, here we will only mention fatty change & accumulation of pigments.
1. Fatty change This is accumulation of triglycerides inside parenchymal cells. It is caused by an imbalance between the uptake, utilization, & secretion of fat. Fatty change is usually seen in the liver, heart, or kidney. Fatty liver may be caused by alcohol, diabetes mellitus, malnutrition, obesity, & poisonings.

These etiologies cause accumulation of fat in the hepatocytes by the following mechanisms:
i. Increased uptake of triglycerides into the parenchymal cells.
ii. Decreased use of fat by cells.
iii. Overproduction of fat in cells.
iv. Decreased secretion of fat from the cells.

## 2. The accumulations of pigments
- Pigments can be exogenous or endogenous. Endogenous pigments include melanin, bilirubin, hemosiderin, & lipofuscin. Exogenous pigments include carbon. These pigments can accumulate inside cells in different situations.
a. Melanin: Melanin is a brownish-black pigment produced by the melanocytes found in the skin. Increased melanin pigmentation is caused by suntanning & certain diseases e.g. nevus, or malignant melanoma. Decreased melanin pigmentation is seen in albinism & vitiligo.
b. Bilirubin: Bilirubin is a yellowish pigment, mainly produced during the degradation of hemoglobin. Excess accumulation of bilirubin causes yellowish discoloration of the sclerae, mucosae, & internal organs. Such a yellowish discoloration is called jaundice.

Jaundice is most often caused by
i. Hemolytic anemia: Hemolytic anemia is characterized by increased destruction of red blood cells.
ii. Biliary obstruction: This is obstruction of intrahepatic or extrahepatic bile ducts. It can be caused by gallstones.
iii. Hepatocellular disease: This is associated with failure of conjugation of bilirubin.
C. Hemosiderin: Hemosiderin is an iron-containing pigment derived from ferritin. It appears in tissues as golden brown amorphous aggregates & is identified by its staining reaction (blue color) with the Prussian blue dye. Hemosiderin exists normally in small amounts within tissue macrophages of the bone marrow, liver, & spleen as physiologic iron stores. It accumulates in tissues in excess amounts in certain diseases. This excess accumulation is divided into 2 types:
- Hemosiderosis; When accumulation of hemosiderin is primarily within tissue macrophages & is not associated with tissue damage, it is called hemosiderosis.
- Hemochromatosis; when there is more extensive accumulation of hemosiderin, often within parenchymal cells, which leads to tissue damage, scarring & organ dysfunction, it is called hemochromatosis.

# UNIT 2: INFLAMMATION AND HEALING

## INFLAMMATION

Inflammation is a physiological response of living tissue to injury. The response to injury is divided into:
- General body response
- Local body response

## General body response
- This involves the nervous and hormonal adjustments and result in considerable metabolic alteration.
- At the same time the lymphoreticular system will respond by proliferation to provide more phagocytic cells and antibody forming cells.

## Local body response
- Initially, the adjacent living tissue will undergo changes which enable phagocytic cells and circulating antibodies to enter the area of damage. This phase is called acute inflammation which continues as long as tissue damage goes on.
- When the causative agent is eliminated, the debris of inflammatory reaction is removed by the scavenger cells. The tissue may return to normal, but when tissue loss is substantial, there is a final stage of healing by regeneration, repair or both.

## General features of inflammation
- Inflammation is a beneficial host response to foreign invaders and necrotic tissue, but it is itself capable of causing tissue damage.
- The main components of inflammation are a vascular reaction and a cellular response; both are activated by mediators that are derived from plasma proteins and various cells.

1) Recognition of the injurious agent
2) Recruitment of leucocytes
3) Removal of the agent
4) Regulation (control) of the response

## 5) Resolution (repair)
- Inflammation accomplishes its protective mission by diluting, destroying or otherwise neutralizing harmful agents.
- There are three types of inflammation;
- Acute inflammation
- Sub-acute inflammation
- Chronic inflammation

## ACUTE INFLAMMATION
- Acute inflammation is a rapid response to injury or microbes and other foreign substances that is designed to deliver leucocytes and plasma proteins to sites of injury.
- The major local manifestations of acute inflammation are;
a) vascular dilatations (causing erythema and warmth)
b) extravasation of plasma fluid and protein (oedema)
c) leucocytes emigration and accumulation at site of injury

## i. Vascular changes
1. Changes in blood flow and caliber

These begin early after tissue injury but develop but develop at varying rates depending on the severity of injury. They are characterized by;
a) Transient vasoconstriction of arterials.
- This is an inconstant finding and in mild injury it disappears within 3-5 seconds but in severe injury such as burns, it may last several minutes.
- The mechanism is unknown; it may be neurogenic due to axonal reflex.
b) Persistent vasodilatation;
- Which firstly involves arterials and then results in opening of new micro-vascular beds in the area. Mediators include prostaglandins and nitric oxide.
- The blood flow thus will increase in injured and the volume of blood there will be 10 fold the normal level, this called active hyperaemia, which is the hallmark of the early haemodynamic changes in acute inflammation and it is the cause of hotness and redness which is observed clinically in acute inflammation.
- This stage of increased blood flow will last for 10-15 minutes and is caused by chemical mediators such as histamine and serotonin (5-HT); these are liberated from the tissues during their damage.
2. Changes in vascular permeability
- Once the vasodilatation has started, plasma proteins which include fibrinogen will pass through the gaps between the endothelial cells.
- Increased vascular permeability is caused by;
- Endothelial gap formation
a) Endothelial cell contraction
- Which is irreversible process elicited by chemical mediators e.g. histamine, bradykinin, leukotriens and others. These bind to specific receptors on endothelial cell surface.
- It lasts 15-30 minutes and only affects venules.
b) Junctional retraction
- Which is a reversible process caused by chemical mediators like TNF and IL1, which induce structural reorganization of the cytoskeleton of cells.
- It lasts for 4-6 hours.
- Endothelial cell injury
- Direct
- Leucocyte mediated
- Direct endothelial cell injury is caused directly e.g. by burn or infection; it lasts for 2-12 hours.
- Leucocyte dependent injury results from accumulation of leucocytes during inflammation; leucocytes will be activated and release toxic oxygen metabolites and proteolytic enzymes.
c) Increased transcytosis (vesicular trafficking).
d) Angiogenesis

## Cellular response
- Normal blood flow is characterized by axial flow in which the plasma is seen near vessel wall and cellular components (RBC, WBC, platelets) occupying the central column.
- In case of acute inflammation, the red cells and more importantly, white cells will become more closely packed near the vessel wall especially in the venules, this is
called margination of leucocytes. Some of the leucocytes may pass through the vessel wall and migrate into the extra vascular space of an inflamed area.
a) Sticking
- The WBC adheres in great number to endothelial surface of blood vessels. The binding is due to presence of the adhesion moelecules on the leucocytes and endothelial cell surface.
b) Emigration
- This is the process by which mobile WBC escape from the blood vessels into the peri-vascular space and tissues (PMN).
- They pass by their amoeboid movement into the endothelial junctions.
c) Chemotaxis
- This refers to the directional movement of cells towards an attractant.
- Chemotactic agents include:
- Exogenous or endogenous substance like soluble bacterial product
- Component of complement system
- Cytokines as IL-8
d) Phagocytosis
- Phagocytosis and release of lysosomal enzymes are two of the major benefits occurring from the accumulation of the leucocytes at the site of inflammation.
- There are three distinct steps in phagocytosis:
- Recognition and attachment
- Engulfment
- Killing/degradation/digestion.

## 1). Recognition and attachment of the particle to be ingested by the leukocytes:

Phagocytosis is enhanced if the material to be phagocytosed is coated with certain plasma proteins called opsonins. These opsonins promote the adhesion between the particulate material and the phagocyte's cell membrane. The three major opsonins are:
- The Fc fragment of the immunoglobulin, components of the complement system
- C3b and C3bi, and
- The carbohydrate-binding proteins - lectins.

Thus, IgG binds to receptors for the Fc piece of the immunoglobulin (FcR) whereas
C3b and C3bi are ligands for complement receptors CR1 and CR2 respectively.
2). Engulfment: During engulfment, extension of the cytoplasm (pseudopods) flow around the object to be engulfed, eventually resulting in complete enclosure of the particle within the phagosome created by the cytoplasmic membrane of the phagocytic cell.

As a result of fusion between the phagosome and lysosome, a phagolysosome is formed and the engulfed particle is exposed to the degradative lysosomal enzymes.
3) Killing or degradation: The ultimate step in phagocytosis of bacteria is killing and degradation. There are two forms of bacterial killing
a). Oxygen-independent mechanism: This is mediated by some of the constituents of the primary and secondary granules of polymorphonuclear leukocytes. These include:
- Bactericidal permeability increasing protein (BPI)
- Lysozymes
- Lactoferrin
- Major basic protein
- Defenses

It is probable that bacterial killing by lysosomal enzymes is inefficient and relatively unimportant compared with the oxygen dependent mechanisms. The lysosomal enzymes are, however, essential for the degradation of dead organisms within phagosomes.
b) Oxygen-dependent mechanism: There are two types of oxygen- dependent killing mechanisms
i) Non-myeloperoxidase dependent

The oxygen - dependent killing of microorganisms is due to formation of reactive oxygen species such as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), super oxide (O2) and hydroxyl ion (HO-) and possibly single oxygen (1O2). These species have single unpaired electrons in their outer orbits that react with molecules in cell membrane or nucleus to cause damages. The destructive effects of H2O2 in the body are gauged by the action of the glutathione peroxidase and catalase.
ii) Myloperoxidase dependent

The bactericidal activity of H2O2 involves the lysosomal enzyme myeloperoxidase, which in the presence of halide ions converts H2O2 to hypochlorous acid (HOCI). This H2O2 - halide myeloperoxidase system is the most efficient bactericidal system in neutrophils. A similar mechanism is also effective against fungi, viruses, protozoa and helminths.

Like the vascular events, the cellular events (i.e. the adhesion, the transmigration, the chemotaxis, & the phagocytosis) are initiated or activated by chemical mediators.

## Cardinal signs of acute inflammation
1) Swelling (tumor) - this is due to oedematous fluid accumulation.
2) Redness (rubor) - this is due to hyperaemia because of vasodilation.
3) Hotness (calor) - this is due to because of vasodilatation and slowing of the blood, so it will give heat locally to the affected area.
4) Pain (dalor) this is due to stimulation of nerve ending of the affected area by bacteria or tissue toxin.
5) Loss of function (functio laesa).

## Cells of acute inflammation
a) Neutrophils : are the main cells of acute inflammation. Their main functions include;
i. Phagocytosis of bacteria and tissue fragment of necrotic cells.
ii. Release of proteolytic enzymes lead to digestion of necrotic cells.
iii. Release of mediators.
iv. Stimulation of leucocytosis.
v. Release of substances.
vi. Release of substances that cause fever.
b) Eosinophils: seen in allergic and sub-acute inflammation. Their granules contain antihistamine which is a histamine neutralization substance.
c) Basophils: are seen in peripheral blood and when they are seen in the tissues they are called mast cells. They secret heparin and histamine.

## Morphology of acute inflammation
- Characteristically, the acute inflammatory response involves production of exudates.
- An exudate is an edema fluid with high protein concentration, which frequently contains inflammatory cells.
- A transudate is simply a non-inflammatory edema caused by cardiac, renal, under nutritional, & other disorders.
- The differences between an exudate and a transudate are:

There are different morphologic types of acute inflammation:

## 1) Serous inflammation
- This is characterized by an outpouring of a thin fluid that is derived from either the blood serum or secretion of mesothelial cells lining the peritoneal, pleural, and pericardial cavities.
- It resolves without reactions

## 2) Fibrinous inflammation
- More severe injuries result in greater vascular permeability that ultimately leads to exudation of larger molecules such as fibrinogens through the vascular barrier.
- Fibrinous exudate is characteristic of inflammation in serous body cavities such as the pericardium (butter and bread appearance) and pleura.
- Course of fibrinous inflammation include:
i. Resolution by fibrinolysis
ii. Scar formation between perietal and visceral surfaces i.e. the exudates get organized
iii. Fibrous strand formation that bridges the pericardial space.

## 3) Suppurative (Purulent) inflammation
- This type of inflammation is characterized by the production of a large amount of pus.
- Pus is a thick creamy liquid, yellowish or blood stained in colour and composed of :
i. A large number of living or dead leukocytes (pus cells)
ii. Necrotic tissue debris
iii. Living and dead bacteria
iv. Edema fluid
- There are two types of suppurative inflammation:
a) Abscess formation: An abscess is a circumscribed accumulation of pus in a living tissue. It is encapsulated by a so-called pyogenic membrane, which consists of layers of fibrin, inflammatory cells and granulation tissue.
b) Acute diffuse (phlegmonous) inflammation: This is characterized by diffuse spread of the exudate through tissue spaces. It is caused by virulent bacteria (eg. streptococci) without either localization or marked pus formation. Example: Cellulitis (in palmar spaces).

## 4) Catarrhal inflammation

This is a mild and superficial inflammation of the mucous membrane. It is commonly seen in the upper respiratory tract following viral infections where mucous secreting glands are present in large numbers, eg. Rhinitis.

## 5) Pseudomembranous inflammation
- The basic elements of pseudomembranous inflammation are extensive confluent necrosis of the surface epithelium of an inflamed mucosa and severe acute inflammation of the underlying tissues. The fibrinogens in the inflamed tissue coagulate within the necrotic epithelium. And the fibrinogen, the necrotic epithelium, the neutrophilic polymorphs, red blood cells, bacteria and tissue debris form a false (pseudo) membrane which forms a white or colored layer over the surface of inflamed mucosa.
- Pseudomembranous inflammation is exemplified by Dipthetric infection of the pharynx or larynx and Clostridium difficille infection in the large bowel following certain antibiotic use.

## Effects of acute inflammation:

## A. Beneficial effects
1. Dilution of toxins: The concentration of chemical and bacterial toxins at the site of inflammation is reduced by dilution in the exudate and its removal from the site by the flow of exudates from the venules through the tissue to the lymphatics.
2. Protective antibodies: Exudation results in the presence of plasma proteins including antibodies at the site of inflammation. Thus, antibodies directed against the causative organisms will react and promote microbial destruction by phagocytosis or complement-mediated cell lysis.
3. Fibrin formation: This prevents bacterial spread and enhances phagocytosis by leukocytes.
4. Plasma mediator systems provisions: The complement, coagulation, fibrinolytic, & kinin systems are provided to the area of injury by the process of inflammation.
5. Cell nutrition: The flow of inflammatory exudates brings with it glucose, oxygen and other nutrients to meet the metabolic requirements of the greatly increased number of cells. It also removes their solute waste products via lymphatic channels.
6. Promotion of immunity: Micro-organisms and their toxins are carried by the exudates, either free or in phagocytes, along the lymphaics to local lymph nodes where they stimulate an immune response with the generation of antibodies and cellular immune mechanisms of defense.

## B. Harmful effects
1. Tissue destruction Inflammation may result in tissue necrosis and the tissue necrosis may, in turn, incite inflammation.
2. Swelling: The swelling caused by inflammation may have serious mechanical effects at certain locations. Examples include acute epiglottitis with interference in breathing; Acute meningitis and encephalitis with effects of increased intracranial pressure.
3. Inappropriate response: The inflammatory seen in hypersensitivity reactions is inappropriate (i.e. exaggerated).

## Fate of acute inflammation
1) Resolution this means complete restoration of injured area to normal. Usually only single cells or small group of cells are killed, removed and replaced by newly regenerated cells.
2) Healing by fibrosis - fibrosis and scarring may result from:
- Heavy fibrin deposition
- Death of large amounts of tissues
- Progression of acute inflammation to chronic inflammation
3) Suppuration with abscess formation e formation of pus is a common sequel of acute inflammation. However, if it is left untouched, it may result in
- Sinus formation - when an abscess cavity makes contact with only one epithelial lining.
- Fistula formation: when an abscess tract connects two epithelial surface.
- Or very rarely to septicemia or Pyemia with subsequent metastatic abscess in heart, kidney, brain
4) Progression to chronic inflammation.

## CHRONIC INFLAMMATION

Definition: Chronic inflammation can be defined as a prolonged inflammatory process (Weeks or months) where an active inflammation, tissue destruction and attempts at repair are proceeding simultaneously.

## Causes of chronic inflammation:
- Persistent infections
- Certain microorganisms associated with intracellular infection such as tuberculosis, leprosy, certain fungi etc characteristically cause chronic inflammation.
- These organisms are of low toxicity and evoke delayed hypersensitivity reactions.
- Prolonged exposure to nondegradable but partially toxic substances either endogenous lipid components which result in atherosclerosis or exogenous substances such as silica, asbestos.
- Progression from acute inflammation: Acute inflammation almost always progresses to chronic inflammation following Persistent suppuration as a result of uncollapsed abscess cavities, foreign body materials (dirt, cloth, wool, etc), sequestrum in osteomylitis, or a sinus/fistula from chronic abscesses.
- Autoimmuniy: Autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosis are chronic inflammations from the outset.

## Morphology:

## Cells of chronic inflammation:
- Monocytes and Macrophages are the prima Dona (primary cells) in chronic inflammation. Macrophages arise from the common precursor cells in the bone marrow, which give rise to blood monocytes. These cells are then diffusely scattered in various
parts of the body, in the liver (Kupffer cells), spleen, lymph nodes (sinus histiocytes), lungs (alveolar macrophages), bone marrow, brain (microglia), skin (Langerhans cells), etc.
- These cells constitute the mononuclear- phagocytic system.
- Macrophages are scavenger cells of the body.

## Other cells in chronic inflammation:
1. T-Lymphocytes are primarily involved in cellular immunity with lymphokine production, and they are the key regulator and effector cells of the immune system.
2. B-lymphocytes and Plasma cells produce antibody directed either against persistent antigen in the inflammatory site or against altered tissue components.
3. Mast cells and eosinophils appear predominantly in response to parasitic infestations & allergic reactions.

Though neutrophils are hallmarks of acute inflammatory reactions, large numbers of neutrophils may be seen in some forms of chronic inflammation, notably chronic osteomylitis, actinomycosis, & choric lung diseases induced by smoking and other stimuli.

Thus, the overall differentiation points between acute and chronic inflammations include:
