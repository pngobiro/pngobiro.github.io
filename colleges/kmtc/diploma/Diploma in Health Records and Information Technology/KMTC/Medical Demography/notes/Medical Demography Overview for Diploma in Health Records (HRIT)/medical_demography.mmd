\section*{UNIT 1: INTRODUCTION AND CONCEPTS OF DEMOGRAPHY}

\section*{INTRODUCTION}

This module is designed to equip the learner with the knowledge and skills for collection, analysis, interpretation, presentation and dissemination of health demographic information.

\section*{MODULE OUTCOMES}

At the end of the module, the learner will be able to:
1. Apply the concepts of demography
2. Demonstrate understanding of the characteristics of population composition
3. Demonstrate techniques of standardizing mortality and fertility measures

\section*{INTRODUCTION TO DEMOGRAPHY}

\section*{Definition of Terms}
1. Median age- the age which divides the population into two equal-size groups, one of which is younger and the other older than the median
2. Crude birth rate- the number of live births registered in a year per 1,000 mid-year population
3. General fertility rate- the number of live births occurring in a year per 1,000 women aged 15-49 years at mid-year
4. Total fertility rate- the average number of children born to an average woman assuming that she survives to the end of her child-bearing age and is subjected to a fixed schedule of age-specific fertility rates
5. Gross reproduction rate- the average number of daughters born to an average woman assuming that she survives to the end of her child-bearing age and is subjected to a fixed schedule of age-specific fertility rates
6. Net reproduction rate- the extent to which an average woman will replace herself assuming a fixed schedule of age-specific mortality and fertility rates prevail through her reproductive span of life
7. Crude death rate- the number of deaths in a year per 1,000 mid-year population
8. Infant death- death of an infant aged under one year
9. Infant mortality rate- the number of infant deaths in a year per 1,000 live births during the year
10. Under 5 mortality rate- the number of deaths of children aged under 5 years in a year per 1,000 live births during the year
11. Still birth- a child born after the twenty eighth $\left(28^{\text {th }}\right)$ week of pregnancy and not breathing or showing any signs of life at any time after being completely expelled from the mother
12. Maternal mortality rate- the number of deaths due to pregnancy, childbirth and the puerperium per 1,000 live births during that year
13. Marriage rate- the number of persons married in a year per 1,000 mid-year population
14. Divorce rate- the number of persons divorced in a year per 1,000 mid-year population
15. Enrolment rate
i- Primary- the number of students (including students of less than 6years or greater than 11 years) enrolled per 100 population aged 6-11 years
ii- Secondary- the number of students enrolled per 100 population aged 12-19years
16. Juveniles- persons aged 12-17years
17. Juvenile delinquency rate- the number of juveniles in offences per 1,000 mid-year population aged 12-17
18. Economically active- the economically active population is made up of the employed and the unemployed populations. The employed population consists of persons who are working while the unemployed population consists of persons who are not working but who are looking for work and are available for work
19. Not economically active population- the inactive population is neither employed nor unemployed and consists mainly of students, homemakers, retired persons and the disabled
20. Government services- total government services include both central and local governments but exclude extra budgetary

\section*{Demography is the scientific study of human populations with respect to their size, distribution, composition, structure and change caused by fertility, nuptiality, mortality and migrations}

Size- the number of persons in the population
Distribution- the arrangement of the population in space at a given time or geographically among various residential areas or occupations

Structure- the distribution of the population among its sex and age grouping
Change- the growth or decline of the total population or one of its structural units

Demography is a scientific study of human population primary to their size, structure and their development.

\section*{Branches of demog ${ }^{\text {raphy }}$}
"Formal Demography" is the study of components of variation and change in demographic variables and the relationships between them

This is also called demographic analysis or demographic methods and is also defined as the treatment of quantitative relations among demographic phenomena in abstraction with other phenomena.

On the other hand, population studies is the study of the relationships between demographic variables and other variables such as social and economic variables

This is constructed with the broader term "population studies" which also includes the treatment of relations between demographic events and socioeconomic and other phenomena.

Demography studies the size of a group of people, how the number has changed in the past and the likelihood of changing in future.

Factors determining the changes and the composition structure of the population in terms of age, sex, tribe or nationality, birth place, previous residence, education, marital status e.t.c

\section*{Major topics covered under demography include;}
i. Fertility
ii. Mortality
iii. Migration

Fertility, mortality and migration are components of population changes and affect its geographical distribution. Knowledge about them is used in population estimations and projections among other uses. One of the most important tools in Demographic studies is a life table which is computed using the 3 variables.

NUPTIALITY varies with the age of first marriage common in a society and with the age structure of the population. It will be lower in an ageing population than in a very young one. It is a major factor in fertility, although less so now with a large proportion of children born out of wedlock. The most basic rates express the number of marriages per thousand populations, or the number of people per thousand marrying in a given year

MORTALITY - the number of people in a population dying in a year, related to two other terms: life span and life expectancy. Life span is the life-length of the person who has lived longer than any other, and that is now 122 years. Life expectancy - the average longevity in a population (75 for men and 81 for women)
MIGRATION - movement of people in and out of an area or society. Immigration is movement into an area. Emigration is movement out. Push factors compel/force people to emigrate. Pull
factors induce them to immigrate. Depending on these factors migrations can be more or less voluntary or not. Factors determining migrations are: economic, primarily in terms of opportunity; political, such as persecution or subjugation/suppression; environmental or natural, like disaster or famine. Immigration rate - the number of people entering an area. Emigration rate is a number of people leaving an area. Gross migration rate is immigration plus emigration rate. Net migration rate is immigration minus emigration. Migrants are people who moved - and they can be internal or external to an area.

\section*{Origins of Demography}

\section*{DESCRIPTION OF MEASURES}

\section*{IMPORTANCE AND USES OF DEMOGRAPHY}

\section*{i. Economic planning}

Population size, growth and available labor force are useful factors in planning the economy of the country to sustain the population

\section*{ii. Policy making}

Taking population growth rate into account, the government may make a policy to encourage family planning

\section*{iii. Political administrative purposes}

Whether or not to sub-divide an administrative area mainly depends on the population to be served. The number of constituencies in a given district depends on the population of a district

\section*{iv. Distribution of social welfare}

Institutions, facilities and services e.g health, education, security, water supplies, transport e.t.c depend on the population of a given area
- The numbers of health institutions to be established in a given district depend on the population to be served
- The number of primary schools to be established in a district depends on the number of children of primary school going age
- The capacity of water supply installation to provide an urban center depends mainly on the population of the center apart from other factors

\section*{v. Health indicators}

The health status of a community is easily portrayed by various rates calculated in demography e.g mortality rate, fertility rates, morbidity rates, birth rates and life expectancy

\section*{vi. Social research}

Any social research must make use of some demographic information. Demographic information is also useful in the formulation of health policies and medical research

\section*{vii. Distribution of communal burdens}

A country like Kenya which has relied on fund-raising (harambee) for development of most of the social infrastructures like schools and health institutions has to allocate quotas to divisions, locations, sub-locations or villages mainly according to their population

\section*{viii. Distribution of human resources}

Demographic information is used to determine human resources in terms of labor as a factor of economic production, its potential and actual exploitation (labor force, employed, underemployed, unemployed)

\section*{SOURCES OF DEMOGRAPHIC DATA}

The raw materials of formal demography are data collected from:-
1. Population census
2. Demographic sample surveys
3. Registration of vital events (births, deaths, migration and marriages). Also called civil registration
History- it is a relatively modern concept in its present format. However, churches have long maintained baptism and burial registries. They have provided insight on the demographic situation since the late Middle ages
Purpose- primarily administrative
To collect data on the vital events happening in a population (generally concerned with live births, deaths, marriages and divorces)
Help understand demographic characteristics of different populations at different points in time

\section*{Advantages}
1. It enables continuous monitoring of vital rates
2. May provide both numerator and denominator data for some rates (e.g Infant Mortality Rate-IMR)
3. Small area data available
4. It forms base for testing the accuracy of censuses and surveys

\section*{Disadvantages}
i. Uncertain coverage: difficult to ensure registration of all the events
ii. Limited background information
iii. Time reference often inconsistent with denominator definition
iv. Information may come from third party
v. Easily disrupted by political/economic events
vi. Literacy/numeracy
vii. Costly

\section*{Points to watch in Data}
i. Coverage (always evaluate for developing countries)
ii. Delayed registration
iii. Classification done by place of residence or place of occurrence?
iv. Treatment of non-response
v. Other issues
4. Registration of persons e.g ID
5. Hospital records
6. Various publications e.g UN statistical year book
7. National social security scheme

\section*{POPULATION POLICY}

A population policy is a deliberately constructed arrangement or program "through which governments influence, directly or indirectly, demographic change" (Demeny, 2003).

These arrangements typically are "legislative measures, administrative programs and other governmental actions intended to alter or modify existing population trends in the interest of national survival and welfare" (Eldridge, 1968).

The demographer John May wrote that "population policies are designed to regulate and, if possible, mitigate the problems [of too rapid growth or decline] by adjusting population size and structure to the needs and aspirations of the people" (John May, 2005)

Population policies usually represent strategies for governments or sometimes, albeit less frequently, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to attain specific goals. The procedures or programs are put into place to ensure that the policy goals are attained. A policy is generally intended to either reduce or increase population levels. Policies are developed "in interest of the greater good ...... in order to address imbalances between demographic changes and other social, economic and political goals" (May, 2005).

\section*{THE THREE WORLD POPULATION CONFERENCES}

Even though the issue of human population growth as a problem or concern is really a $20^{\text {th }}$ century phenomenon, the concern with overpopulation is not new.

Malthus declared that overpopulation was bound by nature to occur. He and others wrote about population growth and its problems. But it was not until the 1960s and the early 1970s that the public became acutely aware of them. Several high-profile books such as The Population Bomb (Ehrlich, 1968), The Limits to Growth (Meadows et al, 1974) and Small is Beautiful (Schumacher, 1975) brought the issue of overpopulation to the attention of millions of readers. Unlike Malthus, however, many of these authors gave special attention to the degradation of the environment by larger and larger numbers of humans (Poston, DeSalvo and Meyer, 2009; Russell and Poston, 2008). To this day, there is still some discussion of the issue of overpopulation. Friedman (2005) has noted, for instance, that aspects of these themes of overpopulation and environmental degradation are reflected in the contemporary anti-globalization movement.

Starting in the 1970s, there was considerable debate in academic circles with many advocating voluntary family planning. The position among the so-called birth controllers and many population specialists was that inducing women in developing countries to practice contraception would simultaneously improve their social and economic situation and alleviate the societal problems of their countries (Connelly, 2008; Hodgson and Watkins, 1997). Rich countries such as the United States, along with private foundations and other organizations, provided large amounts of financial assistance to the population-control movement and the worldwide endeavor to limit population growth.

In 1965, President Lyndon Johnson established an Office of Population in the Department of State and the US Agency for International Development (USAID). The goal of USAID was to convince governments in developing countries to foster contraceptive usage among its citizens. In many countries, this was a politically charged issue that ran against (or contradicted) traditional pronatalist cultural norms (those advocating increases in fertility). The USAID sent teams of demographers and other specialists to countries all over the world to inform their leaders and officials about the impacts of continued rapid population growth.

The attempts by the United States to promote family planning overseas in countries not yet "ready" for this message inevitably met with cries of imperialism. Officials in the host countries
asked why the United States was promoting family planning instead of more pressing needs like assistance in relieving the millions of people suffering from malaria. In order to defuse this issue, the US worked with the United Nations to help create in 1969 the United Nations Fund for Population Activities (UNFPA) which then served as a major source of funds for population initiatives in developing countries.

Since the United Nations came in existence in 1945, it has sponsored and conducted three world population conferences, held in 1974, 1984 and 1994. These conferences framed the story of international family planning that has unfolded since the 1970s.

The first World Population Conference was held in Bucharest, Romania, in 1974. It was an attempt to bring together government officials from around the world and to illustrate for them the facts and consequences of rapid population growth. It was expected by the developed nations in attendance that the rest of the world would recognize the so-called population problem and join the growing movement to curb population growth. To the surprise of many, there was no such endorsement. Rather, most developing nations stressed their preoccupation with the importance of socioeconomic development, both in its own right and as a catalyst for lowering fertility. They called for a "New Economic Order," whose position was encapsulated in the expression "Development is the best contraceptive."

The second conference was held in Mexico City in 1984. During the ten years since the first conference, many developing countries had changed their opinions about population growth and were now interested in assistance directed toward their fledgling family planning programs. (A family planning program is a systematic effort to promote modern fertility control). African countries, especially, were seeing the benefits of more widespread family planning programs, if not for demographic reasons, then at least for the health of women and children. However, by this time, the political atmosphere in the United States had changed dramatically. The official US delegation to the conference under the administration of President Ronald Reagan asserted that "population is a neutral phenomenon" in the development process, and that excessive state control of the economy was more responsible for economic stagnation than population growth.

This unexpected US position stunned the other delegates. Instead of rallying the world community behind population issues, the US introduced to the world its controversial Mexico City policy. The US administration, over strong Congressional objection, decided to police the actions of developing countries with respect to abortion services by refusing to fund the family planning activities of local organizations that also provided abortion, even if abortion was legal in that country and paid for by private funds.

One of the first acts of President Bill Clinton's administration when he took office in 1993 was to reverse this policy of President Reagan. But when the administration of George W. Bush came into power in 2001, the Reagan policy was once again restored. With the inauguration of Barack Obama in 2009, the Bush-Reagan policy was changed back to the policy of the Clinton
administration regarding the providing of funds for family planning. When President Obama reversed the Bush-Reagan policy on January 23, 2009, he remarked that "for the past eight years [the Bush-Reagan restrictions] have undermined efforts to promote safe and effective voluntary family planning in developing countries. For these reasons it is right for us to rescind this policy and restore critical efforts to protect and empower women and promote global economic development".

The 1994 International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) was held in Cairo, Egypt. This conference radically altered the international population movement. Its major outcome was a new definition of population policy, giving prominence to reproductive health and downplaying the demographic rationale for population policy. Two radically diverse groups, feminists and neo-Malthusians, joined forces to create a new manifesto that included the following stipulations;
1) Population stabilization is a desirable, ultimate goal, although not one warranting the use of compulsion
2) National programs enhancing access to contraception are justified in terms of individual human rights, not in terms of their development advantages for populations
3) The empowerment of women is a prerequisite for the enduring low fertility that population stabilization requires.

The Cairo conference was considered to be very successful mainly because it allowed historically opposed and oppressed groups to identify a unified position. Later, however, many officials and scholars working on population matters were surprised that, apparently, discussions of aggregate demographic concerns were being seen as politically incorrect. Indeed, some argued that "programs that are demographically-driven, and are intended to act directly on fertility, are inherently abusive of women's rights to choose the number and timing of their children". Others argued that there is nothing inherently abusive or intrusive about demographically driven population policy.

In sum, Cairo "stressed the importance of individual choices and the necessity to further empower women". An action program was prepared with the consensus and support of 179 governments that "individual human rights and dignity, including the equal rights of women and girls and universal access to sexual reproductive health and rights, are a necessary precondition for sustainable development". More recent international conferences have largely agreed with this preoccupation. It was the main theme of follow-up meetings of the International Conference on Population and Development, "which included a meeting in the Netherlands and a meeting of the U.N General Assembly in 1999".

There was no world population conference in 2004 although one had been planned for. But when the U.S under the administration of President George W. Bush, withdrew its funding of the

UNFPA, it was decided to simply incorporate the goals of earlier conferences for the present and the immediate future.

In 2014, the United Nations reviewed the action program and stated that achievements since 1994 have been remarkable. Noted in particular were the worldwide "gains in women's equality, population health and life expectancy, educational attainment, and human rights protection systems," along with the fact that "an estimated 1billion people (have been moved) out of extreme poverty" (UNFPA, 2014). Also emphasized was the improvement around the world in the dignity of women and adolescent girls, especially their empowerment "to exercise their reproductive rights". Moreover, it was stressed that "sexual and reproductive health and rights and understanding the implications of population dynamics are foundational to sustainable development".

\section*{Summary}

Population policy is made by national governments in an effort to either limit or expand the number of people in their country. For countries with high population growth rates, population policy generally includes programs to encourage family planning, birth spacing, and delaying the birth of a woman's first child. In the 1990s, many countries began to include improvements in women's reproductive health as part of their population policies. The national family planning programs begun in various African countries are good examples of this aspect of population policy. Countries with very low or negative population growth rates have sometimes encouraged families to have more children through policies such as extended maternity leave with pay and family support payments. Population policy can also include measures to increase or decrease immigration. For Example:
a) The population policy in China is a law stating that each couple is only allowed one child.
b) Kenya's 4th Development Plan (1979-1983) states under the Population Policy (p. 61 para 2.156) that: "In Kenya decisions on family size rest with parents. These decisions taken together determine the rate of population growth in the nation. While the government is concerned about the rapid rate of population growth in Kenya, it is also convinced that as these concerns come to be understood in terms of effects on family welfare and quality of life, parents will adjust their decisions in favour of smaller families". The current Development Plan 1984-1988 states further: "Since the rate of population growth is mainly determined by decisions taken by parents on family size, during this Plan period the government, in co-operation with non-government organizations, will intensify its programme of informing and educating actual and potential parents regarding the benefits of smaller family sizes, particularly since the fertility of less-educated women is found to be higher. Family planning services will be made available mainly in the rural areas, by increasing the number of health facilities offering family planning services and also the number of trained personnel to provide these services".

\section*{Population Policy Goals:}

The goals to guide Demographic policy and programme planning are:
(i) To reduce population growth rate
(ii) To encourage people to have a small family
(iii) To reduce fertility level that sustains the high rate of population growth and at the same time assist those couples, as well as individuals, who desire but are unable to have children,
(iv) To reduce mortality further, particularly the infant and child mortality, because such reductions would ultimately lead to lowering the fertility,
(v) To reduce rural-urban and rural-to-rural migration which help to create the unplanned settlements in marginal lands and to help ease the pressure on basic need services in both the rural and urban areas.
(vi) To motivate Kenya males to adopt and practice family planning.
(vii) Others include Educational and Clinical Services Goals

\section*{UNIT 2: POPULATION}

\subsection*{1.2.1 The Definition of Population}

The term population is used differently in demography and in statistics. In demography it relates to the number of people in a given area, while in statistics it is means the universe of units under consideration, which may be people or items.
However there are numerous ways of defining population in demographic way. This depends on whether one includes or excludes groups such as visitors, seamen, armed forces, diplomats, institutional population, those temporarily away or those missed by census.
Broadly there are two types of population counts; de facto and de Jure.
De jure- individuals are enumerated according to usual place of residence. This may be difficult in high mobility population. Residents temporarily away may be missed. This type of enumeration is free from influence of short term or seasonal mobility or migration hence may not reflect population actually present in area at a given time

De facto- this is enumeration of population where they are found on the census day. It avoids distinction between temporary or permanent residence

Population pyramids comprises of age sex composition;
There are about four population shapes:-
1. Pyramidal - indicating high growth
2. Rectangular - indicating slow growth
3. Oval - indicating decline
4. Hourglass - indicating increased pandemic e.g. AIDS driven decline

\section*{Characteristics of population}

\section*{The population has the following characteristics:}

\section*{1. Population Size and Density:}

Total size is generally expressed as the number of individuals in a population. Population density is defined as the numbers of individuals per unit area or per unit volume of environment.

\section*{2. Population dispersion or spatial distribution:}

Dispersion is the spatial pattern of individuals or arrangement in space of individuals in a population relative to one another. In nature, due to various interactions and influence of different factors, the following three basic population distributions can be observed:

\section*{(a) Regular dispersion:}

In this type of dispersion/distribution, the individuals are more or less spaced at equal distance from one another. This is rare in nature but in common is cropland. It is also common among animals with territorial behavior

\section*{(b) Random dispersion:}

In this type of Here the position of one individual is unrelated to the positions of its neighbors. This is also relatively rare in nature.

\section*{(c) Clumped dispersion:}

Most populations exhibit this dispersion to some extent, with individuals aggregated into patches interspersed with no or few individuals. Such aggregations may result from social aggregations, such as family groups or may be due to certain patches of the environment being more favorable for the population concerned.

\section*{3. Age structure:}

In most types of populations, individuals are of different age. The proportion of individuals in each age group is called age structure of that population. The ratio of the various age groups in a population determines the current reproductive status of the population, thus anticipating its future.

\section*{4. Natality (birth rate):}

Population increase because of natality. It is simply a broader term covering the production of new individuals through births. In human population, the natality rate is equivalent to the birthrate.

\section*{5. Mortality (death rate):}

Mortality means the rate of death of individuals in the population.

\section*{Population distribution}

By October 2015, it was estimated that the size of the population of the world was nearly 7.3billon. But these billions of inhabitants are not equally distributed across the planet. Some areas are densely populated; others are not. Population distribution reflects levels of fertility, mortality and migration.

Population distribution is defined as the arrangement of the population on a certain area in accordance with conditions and requirements of the society.

Arithmetic/crude density- total number of people divided by total land area
Physiological/nutritional density- number of people supported by a unit of arable land (the number of people per unit area of arable land). A higher physiological density suggests that the available agricultural land is being used by many and may reach its output limit sooner than a country that has a lower physiological density

Agricultural density (Agro-density/real population density)- ratio of number of farmers to the amount of arable land

Nutritional density- this is another modified concept of population density. It is the measure of how much nutrition can be produced from land. It is a ratio between the total population and the amount of land under cultivation in a given area.

Arable land- cultivable, land fit for cultivation by one farming method or another

Population density- the number of people living in each unit of area such as a square mile or sq. km

Carrying capacity- the maximum number of users that can be sustained, over the long term, by a given set of natural resources

Ecumene- portion of the earth's surface occupied by permanent human settlement
Non-ecumene- area of the earth's surface that humans consider too harsh for occupancy (approx.. 35-40\%)

Population drift- a gradual movement of people that lowers the population in one area and increases it in another

There are five characteristics of a population namely;
1. Population size
2. Population density
3. Population distribution
4. Age structure

\section*{Population Census}

A population census can be defined as process of collection, reception, assessment, analysis, publication and distribution of demographic, economic and social data, which relate, at a given moment in time, to all the residents of a country or of a well-defined partial geographic area.

It is also the total process of planning, collecting, compiling, analyzing, and publishing or otherwise disseminating demographic, economic, and social data pertaining to all persons in a country or in a well-delineated part of a country at a specified time

Censuses are usually conducted every 10years in many countries. Population census provides information about age, sex, occupation, residence etc of people living in a particular country at a specific time.

Data collection procedures
a) Establish administrative tree (census officers, supervisors, enumerators)
b) Develop questionnaires (or the appropriate tool, usually census schedule)
c) Define enumeration areas
d) Cartography
e) Define enumeration areas
f) Pretest enumeration process
g) Design data processing system
h) Enumeration (postal with follow-up, general canvas)

\section*{Characteristics of a good population census}
1. Sponsorship-It must be conducted by government of the state or country where the census is taking place
2. Defined territory- must relate to a country or well-defined geographic area
3. Universality- the census provides data that covers all persons, households and dwellings in precisely defined territorial areas
4. Simultaneity- it must be conducted at the same time throughout the country or region
5. Individual enumeration- it must involve the physical counting of people and not by proxy
6. Compilation and publication
7. Small-area-data- the census allows data to be produced for the smallest geographic areas of a country and for small subpopulations, subject to the protection of confidentiality
8. It must reveal the population of a country at a specified period of time
9. Defined periodicity- it must involve counting at regular intervals eg. 10 years so that comparable information is made available in a fixed sequence
10. It must involve experts who are knowledgeable in population studies and they must be of high integrity

\section*{Contents of census}

A census contains:
- Demographic data (at least age and sex)
- Economic data (e.g occupation and income)
- Social (e.g education and housing)

De jure- individuals are enumerated according to usual place of residence. This may be difficult in high mobility population. Residents temporarily away may be missed. This type of enumeration is free from influence of short term or seasonal mobility or migration hence may not reflect population actually present in area at a given time

De facto- this is enumeration of population where they are found on the census day. It avoids distinction between temporary or permanent residence

\section*{Advantages/uses of census}
1. Population census is the primary source of basic national population data
2. Required for administrative purpose
3. For many aspects of economic and social planning and research
4. Universal, hence small area data available
5. National effort
6. Provides frame for later sample surveys
7. Provides population denominators

\section*{Limitations in census}
1. Size limits content and quality control efforts
2. Cost limits frequency
3. Lack of data for those unavailable during exercise
4. The 5 or 10 year data cannot be up to date for a growing mobile population
5. Takes a long time to analyze and disseminate results (delay between field work and results)
6. Most notably data for nomadic population unreliable
7. Sometimes politicized

\section*{Population growth}

The world's population grew from around 650 million in $\mathbf{1 6 5 0}$ to 1billion by $\mathbf{1 8 5 0}$. It then took less than eighty years to double again in 1927. As the Agricultural Revolution resulted in more density

\section*{Factors and effects of population growth}

Population growth is determined by fertility rates (the number of children per adult) and also death rates. Birth rates and mortality rates are in turn determined by a combination of factors. Often economic growth and economic development have led to a decline in population growth, but there are no hard and fast rules and other factors such as availability of family planning, social expectations and government intervention can play an important role.

The four main factors that influence population growth are;
i. Fertility (birth rates)
ii. Mortality
iii. Migration
iv. Life expectancy

The other factors that influence population growth include;
v. Cost of education. In developed countries, education is usually compulsory until the age of 16 . As education becomes compulsory, children are no longer economic assetsbut economic costs. In the US, it is estimated that a child can cost approximately $\$ 230,000$ by the time they leave college. Therefore, the cost of bringing up children provides an incentive to reduce family size.
vi. Economic growth/development. Countries which are in the early stages of economic development tend to have higher rates of population growth. In agriculturally based societies, children are seen as potential income earners. From an early age, they can help with household tasks and collecting the harvest. Also, in societies without state pensions, parents often want more children to act as an insurance for their old age. It is expected that children will look after their parents in old age. Because child mortality rates are often higher, therefore there is a need to have more children to ensure the parents have sufficient children to look after them in old age.
vii. Quality of children. Gary Becker produced a paper in 1973 with H. Gregg Lewis which stated that parents choose the number of children based on a marginal cost and marginal benefit analysis. In developed countries with high rates of return from education, parents have an incentive to have a lower number of children and spend more on their education- to give their children not just standard education but a relatively better education than others. To be able to give their children the best start in life, it necessitates smaller families. Becker noted that rising real GDP per capita was generally consistent with smaller families.
viii. Welfare payments/State pensions. A generous government pension scheme means couples don't need to have children to provide an effective retirement support when they are old. Family sizes in developing countries are higher because children are viewed as 'insurance' to look after them in old age. In modern societies, this is not necessary and birth rates fall as a result.
ix. Availability of contraception (family planning). Increased availability of contraception can enable women to limit family size closer to the desired level. In the developing world, availability of contraception is more limited, and this can lead to unplanned pregnancies and more rapid population growth. In Africa in 2015, it was estimated that only $33 \%$ of women had access to contraception. Increasing rates would play a role in limiting population growth.
x. Female labor market participation. In developing economies, female education and social mobility are often lower. In societies where women gain a better education, there is a greater desire to put work over starting a family. In the developed world, women have often chosen to get married later and delay having children (or not at all) because they prefer to work and concentrate on their career.
xi. Social norms/Cultural attitudes to family size (social and cultural factors). India and China (before the one child policy) had strong social attachments to having large families. In the developed world, smaller families are the norm.
xii. Net migration (immigration levels). In some countries biggest drivers of population growth come from net migration. In the UK from 2000 to 2013, around $50 \%$ of net population growth came from net international migration.
xiii.

Countries like Japan with very strict immigration laws have seen a stagnation of population.
xiv. Health care standards (death rates). Level of medical provision. Often death rates are reduced before a slowdown in birth rates, causing a boom in the population size at a certain point in country's economic development. In the $19^{\text {th }}$ and early $20^{\text {th }}$ century, there was a rapid improvement in medical treatments which helped to deal with many fatal diseases. Death rates fell and life expectancy increased.
xv. Government policy-pronatalist population policies will see an increase in the size of the population while an anti-natalist approach will be characterized by a decline in population size
xvi. Historical factors/wars. In the post-war period, western countries saw a 'boom' in population, as couples reunited at the end of the Second World War began having families. The 'baby-boomer' period indicates population growth can be influenced by historical events and combination of factors which caused a delay in having children until the war ended.

\section*{Consequences of population growth}

Rapid human population growth has a variety of consequences.
1. Depletion of natural resources
2. Degradation of the environment
3. Conflicts and wars
4. Rise in unemployment
5. High cost of living
6. Population grows fastest in the world's poorest countries. High fertility rates have historically been strongly correlated with poverty and high childhood mortality rates
7. Falling fertility rates are generally associated with improved standards of living, increased life expectancy and lowered infant mortality
8. Overpopulation and poverty have long been associated with increased death and disease. People tightly packed into unsanitary housing are inordinately vulnerable to natural disasters and health problems.
9. Poverty is a condition of chronic deprivation and need at the family level. Poor people lack access to enough land and income to meet basic needs deeper into poverty.

\section*{Population control}

The problem of population growth, whether positive or negative, can be controlled for using approaches such as;
i. Empower women
ii. Improve family planning
iii. Make education more interesting
iv. Government incentives
v. Government policies
vi. Empower people economically
vii. Knowledge of sex education

\section*{The Demographic Transition Theory Specific objectives}
1. Describe the demographic transition theory
2. Describe the stages of demographic transition theory
3. List the limitations of demographic transition theory
4. List the usefulness of the demographic transition theory

\section*{Introduction}

The most prominent explanation for the growth of human populations is demographic transition theory (DTT). Changes in the size of the world's population over a certain period of time are due entirely to changes during the same time period in fertility and mortality (migration, obviously, does not figure into the equation when the focus is on the world).

The world population changes its size over a given time interval by adding persons born during the period and subtracting persons dying.

Demographic transition emphasizes the strong interrelationship between population structure, fertility and mortality which lie at the heart of formal demography.

The DTT was first developed by an American demographer known as Warren S. Thompson (1929) and Frank W. Notestein (1945), Blacker (1947) and extended by Kingsley Davis (1963) among others.

There are a series of stages during which a population moves from a situation where both mortality and fertility rates are high to a position where both mortality and fertility are low. Both before and after the transition, population growth is very slow, but in between, during the transition population growth is very rapid, essentially because the decline in mortality occurs before the decline in fertility.

The theory is essentially a description of historical process that is thought to be a common experience of the industrialized nations in the west. The population growth in western countries is observed with a fall in mortality ahead of fertility.

The population change can be divided into five stages representing a process that can be looked at closely as to be related to stages in economic development of a country. The theory proposes that five stages of mortality and fertility change occur in the process of societal modernization.

\section*{Stage One}

It is also known as pre-modern or high stationary stage.
It presents the pre-transitional or pre-industrialization stage. Because of the high birth and death rates that occurred during this stage, it is sometimes referred to as the stage of high growth potential because of the great potential for population growth if mortality were ever to fall.

It is characterized by high birth and death rates and stable population growth. It shows high rates of fluctuating mortality and high fertility. The relative instability of the mortality rates means that during this stage, there were some periods of natural increase and some of natural decrease, but over the longer period, there was very little change in population size.

No countries in the world today are located in the first stage.
The high death rates are due to;
a) Lack of knowledge on disease prevention and cure
b) Occasional food shortages
c) Outbreak of infectious diseases such as influenza
d) Lack of clean water and efficient sewage disposal
e) Poor food hygiene that killed many especially children
f) Water and foodborne diseases such as cholera, typhoid and TB
g) Wars led to indiscriminate deaths of both adults and children

Birth rates were high due to;
✓ Societies depended heavily on agricultural productivity or unskilled manual labor. Due to that, larger families translated to a larger workforce.

✓ High birth rate could also be a response to a high death rate and so the population was striving to attain or maintain replacement level fertility.
✓ Lack of incentives in rural communities to control fertility

\section*{Stage Two}

It is referred to as early development stage.
For numerous reasons, mortality began to decline in many countries of the world.
There is a rise in population caused by a decline in the death rate while the birth rate remains high, or perhaps even rises slightly. The second stage of the demographic transition model is marked by the death rate rapidly falling. The decrease in death rate is attributable to;
1. Significant improvements in overall health specifically access to pediatric care which affects the life expectancy of newly born children and the under-five children (most atrisk demographic group).
2. There was also expanded education system meaning that people were equipped with the skills on healthy living and major disease risk factors. They could make better health choices.
3. Gender equality meant that there was improved awareness of the role of women in decision-making especially regarding seeking health services.
4. Technological advances in the areas of food production led to increased food production and storage for future use meaning that adverse effects of famine were mitigated. These improvements included;
+ Crop rotation
- Selective breeding
- Seed drill technology
+ Introduction of potato and maize from South America which increased food quantities especially in northern Europe
5. Improved sanitation- access to clean and potable water significantly reduced disease outbreaks. This coupled with improved hygiene reduced death attributed to poor environmental hygiene.
6. Improvements in food handling, sewage disposal and general personal hygiene

Another characteristic of Stage Two is a change in the age structure of the population. As more children survive, the age structure becomes increasingly youthful. This trend is intensified as this
increasing number of children enter into reproduction while maintaining the high fertility rate of their parents

Many of the least developed countries today are in Stage 2

\section*{Stage Three}

The population moves towards stability through a decline in birth rate.
Here birth rates gradually decrease as a result of;
- In rural areas continued decline in childhood death means that at some point parents realize they need not require so many children to be born to ensure a comfortable old age.
- Improved economic conditions- increasing urbanization changes the traditional values placed upon fertility and the value of children in rural society. Urban living also raises the cost of dependent children to a family
- Increasing female literacy and employment (increase in women's status)
- Improvements in contraceptive technology and access to contraception

Population growth continues but at a lower rate.
Most developing countries are in Stage 3.

\section*{Stage Four}

Birth and death rates are both low, stabilizing the population. In this stage the population age structure has become older.

Countries in this stage tend to have;
- Stronger economies
- Higher levels of education
- Better health care
- A higher proportion of working women
- Fertility rate of around 2 children per woman

Most developed countries are in Stage 4 but a few have moved into Stage 5

\section*{Stage Five}

This is characterized by a situation in which fertility rates have fallen significantly below replacement level ( 2 children) and the elderly population is greater than the youthful population

A country in Stage 5 experiences loss to the overall population as the death rate becomes higher than the birth rate. The negative population growth rate is not an immediate effect however. Based on demographic momentum (a situation in which total population growth increases even
while birth rates decline) it will take a generation or two before a negative population growth rate is observed.

Birth rates are low because of;
- Better family planning methods
- Improved economy
- Improved female education
- High costs of raising a family in cities
- Employment opportunities delay child bearing

\section*{Limitations/Disadvantages of Demographic Transition}
1. Derived from data in developed countries whose conditions greatly differ from developing countries
2. The impact of other demographic variables such as migration are not considered
3. It does not predict how long a country will be in each stage
4. In France and Europe (developed countries), fertility rates fell before death rates

\section*{Usefulness of Demographic Transition}
1. Influences the development of demography as a subject
2. Migration is thought not being part of demography

\section*{Population structure/composition}

Population structure means the 'make up' or composition of a population. Looking at the population structure of a place shows how the population is divided up between males and females of different ages (or age groups)

Age and sex composition provides a glimpse of a country's demographic history- reflecting past trends in births, deaths and migration- as well as a view toward its demographic future. The age and sex structure of a given population affects many of its characteristics for example knowing that some parts have high median ages and relatively few young people in their populations provides insight into the patterns of population decline

\section*{Sex composition}

Sex ratio is the ratio of males to females in a population. The primary sex ratio is the ratio at the time of conception, secondary sex ratio is the ratio at time of birth, and tertiary sex ratio is the ratio of mature organisms.
Sex between males and females of different ages (or age groups)
Sex structure is one of the most important and relevant features of human societies. Regarding demographic study, the interaction of sex structure with the three demographic processes is of
paramount importance. But the importance of sex structure extends far beyond demography. A society's sex structure has important implications for socioeconomic and demographic development, as well as for labor force participation and gender relations.
The overall sex ratio is simply the ratio of males to females in the population. It is normally expressed as the number of males per 100 females i.e. sex ratio $=$ males x 100 females. The overall sex ratio is entirely determined by: -
- The sex ratio at birth
- Sex differences in mortality
- Differential migration

Sex ratio is normally around 105 boys are born for every 100 girls but it does vary between population and subgroups.

Note that if the sex ratio at birth is 105 , then after every 205 births on average 100 are females i.e the proportion that are female is thus
$\underline{100}=0.488$
males $=0.512$
205
Sex difference in mortality and migration cause the sex ratio to very between ages. In most parts of the world, female mortality is lower than male mortality at all ages. Women live longer on average than men. Thus the sex ratio tends to decline with age
- Pattern by age

✓ Higher at very young ages
✓ Gap narrows with increasing age
✓ Goes below 100 by middle age
- Other characteristics

✓ Varies from one population to another
✓ Desirable to consider separately the sex ratio of important component subgroups (e.g. by race, by ethnicity)

\section*{Determinants of sex composition}

Case study:

\section*{Female foeticide: An evil in India}
"It is an extreme manifestation of violence against women."
Female fetuses are selectively aborted after pre-natal sex determination.

\section*{Reasons;}
- Caste system
- Economic oppressions
- Denial of right to property
- False sense of impurity
- Deprivation of education
- Social mentality
- Abortion-4-12million girls aborted over the last 3 decades
- First child and second child
- Female infanticide- deliberate killing of new born female children
- Sex determination

\section*{Steps taken by the government;}
- Banning sex determination
- Women empowerment
- Job reservation for women

\section*{Calculations of sex ratio}

\section*{Sex Ratio of Births}

Sex Ratio of Births-Number of male births per 100 female births =

Values: Ratio $<100 \rightarrow$ More female than male births
$=100 \rightarrow$ Same number of male and female births
$>100 \rightarrow$ More male than female births
In human populations, there are more male births than female births, with ratio generally between 104 and 107
Important characteristics which distinguish births with respect to their sex ratio are age of mother, order of birth, or race

Sex ratio =

\section*{Age composition}

Demographers' definition of age-Completed age, i.e. age of an individual at last birthday Most important variable in demographic analyses

\section*{Data Collection on Age}

Data on age may be secured by;
✓ Asking a direct question on age
✓ Asking a question on date of birth, or month and year of birth
✓ Or a combination of these

\section*{Measures of age}

Dependency Ratio
Proportion of population in each age or age group

\section*{Dependency Ratio}

One frequency used index summarizing on age distribution is known as the dependency ratio; strictly, this is the ratio of economically active to economically inactive persons in a population. However, because of lack of data or difficulties in defining economic activity in many countries a ratio of age group is used instead. Then the ratio is just:

Dependency ratio $=(\underline{\text { Children }+ \text { Elderly }}) \times 100$

\section*{Working Ages}

The praise age used depends very much on the population being studied, probably school leaving age 18 years in Kenya and retirement age of 55 years.

\section*{The determinants of age structure}

The age structure and age distribution in any given population is entirely determined by the levels of mortality, fertility and migration occurring in the past. These three ( 3 ) factors affect distribution in different ways and to different extent.
1. Changes in the levels of fertility will at first affect just younger age groups, and only over many years will it work through to affect older ages. The effect of fertility changes can thus be very dramatic, especially if the rise or fall is rapid.
2. Variations in the level of infant mortality tends to produce an effect very similar to that caused by change in fertility affecting initially the young ages, and only gradually working through to the whole age range.
3. A change in adult mortality has however, generally, a much less dramatic impact on the shape of an age distribution than either fertility or infant mortality. This is because it is largely not concentrated in one age group but is spread over all ages.
4. Migration can cause big distortion in age distributions because it is normally concentrated among young adults and is sometimes also sex selective. Areas from which substantial numbers have emigrated will in extreme cases have top heavy pyramids with a high proportion of the population in older age groups, few young adults and consequently, few children conversely areas where substantial numbers of immigrants have settled will have a young age structure, with many children and very few elderly.

Overall therefore, an age distribution is best regarded as being determined primarily by fertility and modified, to a greater or lesser extent, by mortality and migration.

\section*{Presentation of Age and Sex Composition}

The age and sex composition of a population is reflected by an age pyramid. These diagrams are drawn with age (ascending) on a central vertical axis, horizontal bars showing the number or proportion of males on the left, and bars showing the number or proportion of females on the right. They are an extremely useful means of depicting the age and sex composition of a population, and typically will provide a good deal of information about the past history of fertility and perhaps also mortality and migration in a population.

\section*{Population pyramids}

A population pyramid is a graph that allows us to see the gender and age structure of a population.

Population pyramids are graphical representations of the age and sex of a population. For this reason, population pyramids are also referred to as age-sex pyramids. We refer to these graphs as pyramids because they are usually shaped like triangles, although they can also take other shapes. There are different shapes of pyramids which tell us different things about the population of the country.

Population pyramids show the age-sex structure of a population. They are also potentially very informative about the history of a population and its future prospects.

There are a few simple rules for the construction of population pyramids:
- Population pyramids consist of two histograms placed on their side and back to back.
- They can show absolute numbers or percentages, but the x-axis must be labeled accordingly. When comparing populations, percentages should be used.
- If percentages are used, these must be calculated for each age-sex group from the total population (males and females), not just the total population of a single sex.
- Age is depicted on the y-axis, with the youngest at the bottom, and must be labelled accordingly.
- Age scale can be in single years, or five year age groups depending on the precision needed.
- The age groups used must be of equal width, apart from the final open ended age group.
- Statistics for males are plotted on the left, and females on the right.

Population pyramids are often useful to divide the population into 3 distinct age groups or cohorts:

0-15 or the young

16-65, the working age and
65+ as retired sectors of the population
Knowing the percentage of people in these sectors can allow us to calculate the Dependency Ratio. This is the ratio between those of working age and those of non-working age. The nonworking age are known as dependents because they depend upon the working age people to provide for their needs.

\section*{Describing population pyramids}

There are certain terms which are commonly used to describe age structures of populations, such as 'young', 'old', 'declining' etc. The table below shows the three most common types of population pyramid, with descriptions of the features of each.

\section*{Description \\ Example}

\section*{Young and growing}

Young populations have a typical 'pyramid' shape, with a broad base indicating high proportions of children. Indicates a population undergoing rapid growth.

\section*{Old and declining}

A top-heavy population pyramid with higher proportions in older age groups indicates a declining population. This may result from a long period of below replacement fertility, alongside low death rates.

\section*{Stationary}

A more rectangular population pyramid indicates a population which is neither growing nor declining. There are similar proportions in each age group, apart from at the oldest ages (due to mortality). The population pyramid to the right is just an approximation of what a stationary population would look like. The small fluctuations at age groups 4059 show that this is not truly a

Source: UN Population Division (2011)

These three population pyramids just show a few examples of shapes that age-sex structures can take, and the terms demographers use to describe them. However, there are many more forms which age-sex structures can take.

It is also possible to describe the age or sex structure of a population using a single summary measure. Summary measures provide a convenient way of comparing the age or sex structure of different populations.

Summary measures to describe the age structure of a population include:
- Proportion of the population under a certain age (often 15) or over a certain age (often 65)
- Median age of a population i.e. the age which half the population are younger and half the population is older
- Dependency ratios
- Child dependency ratio
- Old age dependency ratio

Summary measures to describe the sex structure of a population include:
- Sex ratio of the total population
- Sex ratio at age x
- Sex ratio at birth

\section*{Types of population pyramids}

There are three types of population pyramids: expansive, constrictive and stationary.

\section*{1. Expansive population pyramids}

They depict populations that have a larger percentage of people in younger age groups. Populations with this shape usually have high fertility rates with lower life expectancies. Many third world countries have expansive population pyramids.

\section*{2. Constrictive population pyramids}

They are named so because they are constricted at the bottom. There is a lower percentage of younger people. Constrictive population pyramids show declining birth rates, since each succeeding age group is getting smaller and smaller. The United States has a constrictive population pyramid.

\section*{3. Stationary population pyramids}

They are those that show a somewhat equal proportion of the population in each age group. There is not a decrease or increase in population; it is stable. Austria has a stationary population pyramid.

\section*{Stages of population pyramids}

There are five stages of population pyramids;
1. High fluctuating
2. Early expanding
3. Late expanding
4. Low fluctuating
5. Natural decrease

\section*{A. High fluctuating (first stage)}

High fluctuating population pyramids have wide bases and narrow tops which indicates that there are few older people in the population and a high percentage of young people.

These pyramids are also concave due to their high birth and death rates and low life expectancies.

They always represent least developed countries.

\section*{B. Early expanding (second stage)}

In this stage people are reproducing at a higher rate than they die.
Populations in this stage still have low life expectancies and high birth rates
Their pyramids are triangular shaped
They are called early expanding because the populations grow rapidly as many more children are added to the population than people dying

They always represent less economically developed countries (LEDCs)

\section*{C. Late expanding (third stage)}

The top is still shaped like a pyramid however the bottom begins to level out as the birth rates becomes more stable and life expectancy continues to increase.

\section*{D. Low fluctuating (fourth stage)}

These populations are stable and are growing slowly as the number of the young is just above the number of people dying.

The older people are living for a long time (high life expectancy) with a lot of workers and reasonable numbers of children.

They represent more economically developed countries.
Some economically developed countries (MEDCs) actually have declining populations where there are not enough children being born each year to replace those dying.

As negative growth in a country continues the population is reduced.

A population can shrink due to a low birth rate and a stable death rate.
Increased out-migration may also be a contributor to a declining population.

\section*{E. Natural decrease (fifth stage)}

The population is ageing and declining.
They have a very narrow base because birth rates are below the replacement level and people have very long life expectancies which explains the wide tops.

\section*{UNIT 3: DEMOGRAPHIC VARIABLES AND MEASURES}

The unit deals with basic Demographic Measurement Concepts, computation and interpretation. We will refer to a number of key demographic measures.

\section*{Unit Objective}
1. Describe fertility, its measurements, calculation, and interpretation
2. Explain mortality, its measurements, calculation and interpretation
3. Describe Standardization and methods used
4. Describe Life tables, terms and uses

\section*{DEFINITION OF MEASUREMENTS}

\section*{Measures of fertility}

\section*{Fertility}

\section*{Fertility and Fecundity}

Fertility relates to the number of live births a woman has actually had. Fertile means that a woman is or was a mother.

The physiological ability to bear children on the other hand is known as fecundity. Fecund is thus the opposite of sterile. It is thought that the maximum number of children an average woman can theoretically produce is about 15 if she starts child bearing as soon as possible after menarche, which occurs around ages 12-14 and continues until menopause in her middle or late forties.

\section*{Period Fertility}

This section defines the concept of fertility and fecundity. It then defined the commonly used measures of period fertility - the child/woman ratio, crude birth rate, general fertility rate and total fertility rate.

\section*{Child Woman Ratio}

This can be defined as
$\mathrm{C} / \mathrm{W}$ Ratio $\quad=\quad$ Children Aged 0-4
Woman aged 15-44/9
The usefulness of ratio arises from the fact that it requires only information on the age and sex structure of the population. No data on birth are needed at all. This makes it particularly useful when using census data.

Obviously it is an extremely crude measure but broadly if fertility is high, the child/woman ratio will be high while if fertility is low, the ratio will be low. It is however, quite sensitive to the level of infant mortality. So if it is dangerous to use the ratio to compare populations, with substantially different levels of infant and child mortality or where under reporting of young children is a problem.

\section*{Crude Birth Rate}

Crude birth rate: The crude birth rate (CBR or b) in a population during a given year is defined as the total number of births (B) divided by the midyear population (P). It is normally expressed per thousand population, so we have
$\mathrm{b}=1000 *(\mathrm{~B} / \mathrm{P})$.
This is the simplest and most frequently used as a measure of fertility. It is defined as: -
$\mathrm{CBR}=\quad$ Birth in year $\quad \times 1000$
Population at Midyear

It is always expressed per 1000 population. The reasons it is a "crude" rate is that it includes all ages and both sexes in the denominator.

No attempt is made to relate the births to the women at risk of having those births because of this it is strictly not a measure of fertility at all.

The range of CBR is from 10-50. A major problem is that it is affected very greatly by the composition of the population as regards age, sex and other characteristics. Thus it can be very misleading if it is used to compare different populations or the same population at different times because it may vary greatly in their composition. There are though 3 reasons why it is a useful measure: -

It is easy to understand
It requires few data and it is easy to calculate - all that is required is the total number of births and the total population.

It is possible to subtract the crude death rate from the crude birth rate to get the crude rate of natural increase, which along with the crude net migration rate can estimate, the present population. This refers to demographic equation.

\section*{General Fertility Rate}

This is a fertility rate rather than a birth rate because it expresses the births relative to the No. of women of the reproductive age. Sometimes the denominator includes women aged 45-49. Sometimes it doesn't. This is important because compiling a 15-44 GFR with 15-49 GFR could be misleading.
E.g. the Bangladesh 1974 ages 15-44.

GFR of age 15-44/9
$\mathrm{GFR}=\quad$ No. of Births during the year $\quad \mathrm{x} 1000$
Women aged 15-44/9 at midyear

GFR of age $15-49=3,253,480 \times 1000$
$13,224,700=246.02 / 1000$

Using the same data you now calculate the GFR $15-44$ and GFR 15-49. The possible value is roughly $50-300$. Note that more data are required to calculate the GFR than CBR. One has to know the age and sex composition of the population. The main advantage of GFR over CBR is that it substantially controls for age and sex structure by relating the births to roughly the women at risk of having them, but it does not control entirely for age structure since there may be substantial variations between populations within the reproductive age range. For example in one there may be a relatively large number of girls aged $15-19$ while in another there may be only a few. Because births are not spread evenly over the reproductive age range, comparisons using the GFR can be misleading. To overcome this it is necessary to move to a substantially more sophisticated level and consider fertility for each age group.

\section*{Age-specific fertility rate:}

The age-specific fertility rate (ASFR) for women of age group i in a population during a given year is defined as the total number of births to women age i during the year (Bi) divided by the total (midyear) number of women age i (Wi). Expressed per thousand, we have
$\mathrm{ASFRI}=1000 *(\mathrm{Bi} / \mathrm{Wi})$.

Often ASFR are expressed per 1000 women normally 7 age groups, which has a class interval of five years. They normally start with ages 15-19 and go on to 45-49. Table No. 3 shows the age groupings the women, births and ASFR for Bangladesh 1974. Note that there is a big jump over the measures considered so far. It is necessary to have births classified by age of mother.

\begin{figure}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Figure 1 Age Specific Fertility Rate Bangladesh}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_18_320387c6f9beb9aaa5c8g-46.jpg?height=736&width=1148&top_left_y=1566&top_left_x=487}
\end{figure}

ASFR can be graphed in figure 1. It shows features such as rapid rise into a peak in the early or mid 20s and a gradual decline to very low levels after age 40. It is conventional to include any births occurring to girls aged below 15 in the 15-19 age groups on the grounds that their ages are
being underestimated. Similarly births of women over 49 years are usually added into the 45-49 group. The effects of these are usually negligible since there are very few births in these ages. The great inconvenience of Age Specific Fertility Rate (ASFR) is that they are not a single number but a set of 7 (seven). This makes comparisons complex and tedious but fortunately it is possible to overcome this by using the Total Fertility Ratio (TFR).

\section*{Total Fertility Rate}

It is probably the measure of fertility that is most widely used by demographers. It is calculated by adding up the ASFRs. Each ASFR usually relates to 5 years. It is therefore necessary to multiply the 5 -year rate by five. The TFR is almost always expressed per one (1) woman where as ASFRs are often expressed per 1000 women. If that is the case then it is necessary to divide by 1000 .
$\mathrm{TFR}=\underline{\text { Sum of ASFR }} \times 5$ or $\underline{\underline{\text { ASFR }}} \times 5$
10001000
Example Bangladesh 1974
$\mathrm{TFR}=(\underline{200.4+337.3+310.9+261.5+197.0+95.4+13.5) \quad \mathrm{x} 5}$
1000
$$=7.08$$

Three points to note when computing TFR are: -
If single year ASFR are used then there is no need to multiply by 5 . The 5 are used because the age interval is 5 .

It makes no difference if you multiply the ASFRs by 5 and then add them or the other way round except that it is easier to add them first.

It is perfectly acceptable to include the ASFR for the age 10-14 or 50-54 or omit 45-49. However, they are so small that they make very little difference to the final figure.

The great value of the TFR is that it is single figure measure that is independent of age structure. The GFR only partially controls for age structure and the CBR doesn't do that at all. One problem with TFR however, is that it requires a lot of data - births by age of month and women
by age group which is usually only available where there are high quality registration and census systems.

Another problem is its interpretation. Formally, the TFR can be thought of as the number of children a woman would have if: -

She survived to age 50.
Throughout her reproductive life she experienced exact ASFR for the year in question.
To understand this considers a group of women in Bangladesh aged 15. While they are 15-19 they have an ASFR of 200.4 then 337.4 while they are $20-24$ and 13.5 from $45-49$. If they all survived to age 50 they will have had an average 7.08 children each.

\section*{Age Specific Fertility Rate}

Ordinary ASFR are calculated by dividing the births occurring to women aged x by the total No. of women aged x .

ASFR $=\quad$ Births occurring to women aged $x \quad$ X 1000
Total No. of women aged $x$
However it is also possible to define fertility rates that are specific to many other things, almost always in conjunction with total status. The following are the measures of marital status: -

General marital fertility rate
GMFR $=\quad$ All Births $\quad \times 1000$
Married women 15-44/49

General legitimate Fertility Rate
GLFR $=\quad$ Legitimate Births $\quad \times 1000$
Married women 15-44/49

General Illegitimate Births
$\mathrm{GIB}=\underline{\text { General Illegitimate Births }} \quad \times 1000$
Single, widowed, divorced, and separated
Women aged 15-44 or 49

These are the measures of marital fertility.

\section*{Marital Age Specific Fertility Rate:}

Sometimes is also called Age Specific Marital Fertility Rate. This is simply obtained by calculated Age Specific Fertility Rate. Just the way fertility rate was calculated.

\section*{Total Fertility Rate:}

Mathematically, the total fertility rate (TFR) equals the sum of age-specific fertility rates from the minimum to the maximum age at which childbearing occurs, multiplied by the number of years in each age group and divided by 1000 . Thus, for example, if age groups are for five-year intervals (15-19, 20-24, etc.), we have

TFR $=($ "SUM" ASFRI * 5)/1000.
The total fertility rate just described would be a period TFR, and it would tell us the average number of children a group of women would have if, throughout their reproductive lives, they were to bear children at the rates given by the ASFRS. Alternatively, we can also think about a cohort TFR. In demography, a cohort refers to a group of people all born at the same time (e.g., in a single year, like the birth cohort of 1970, or during a longer period, like the birth cohort from 1980-84). A cohort total fertility rate, then, would reflect the asfrs actually realized by a given cohort of women. (Matrix to be presented in class will highlight the difference between the period TFR and the cohort TFR.)

The preceding discussion provides a nice lead-in to the notion of age, period, and cohort effects. In brief, we can think of age effects as those specific to a particular age or age range. These may consist of biological processes related to aging, such as the onset of puberty, or social processes such as beginning schooling at age 6 .

Period effects pertain to events transpiring during a specific period (e.g., the high fertility manifested during the Baby Boom following WWII up to the mid-1960s), while cohort effects refer to phenomena particular to specific cohorts (e.g., the birth cohorts of women from the 1920s and the 1930s had relatively high TFRs). Note that these three kinds of effects are intertwined, in that there are only two degrees of freedom. A final useful fertility concept is the notion of replacement fertility, which can be defined as the level of fertility at which a population just replaces itself. In a world with no mortality, replacement fertility would exist with a TFR of 2.0. The low level of mortality in the U.S. and other industrialized countries means that our replacement TFR is about 2.1, while in countries with higher mortality the replacement TFR will be correspondingly higher (e.g., in much of sub-Saharan Africa the replacement TFR is about 2.7).

\section*{Family Planning}

\section*{Key facts}
- 214 million women of reproductive age in developing countries who want to avoid pregnancy are not using a modern contraceptive method.
- Some family planning methods, such as condoms, help prevent the transmission of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections.
- Family planning / contraception reduces the need for abortion, especially unsafe abortion.
- Family planning reinforces people's rights to determine the number and spacing of their children.
- By preventing unintended pregnancy, family planning /contraception prevents deaths of mothers and children.
Family planning allows people to attain their desired number of children and determine the spacing of pregnancies. It is achieved through use of contraceptive methods and the treatment of infertility.

\section*{Benefits of family planning / contraception}

Promotion of family planning - and ensuring access to preferred contraceptive methods for women and couples - is essential to securing the well-being and autonomy of women, while supporting the health and development of communities.

\section*{Preventing pregnancy-related health risks in women}

A woman's ability to choose if and when to become pregnant has a direct impact on her health and well-being. Family planning allows spacing of pregnancies and can delay pregnancies in young women at increased risk of health problems and death from early childbearing. It prevents unintended pregnancies, including those of older women who face increased risks related to pregnancy. Family planning enables women who wish to limit the size of their families to do so. Evidence suggests that women who have more than 4 children are at increased risk of maternal mortality.

By reducing rates of unintended pregnancies, family planning also reduces the need for unsafe abortion.

\section*{Reducing infant mortality}

Family planning can prevent closely spaced and ill-timed pregnancies and births, which contribute to some of the world's highest infant mortality rates. Infants of mothers who die as a result of giving birth also have a greater risk of death and poor health.

\section*{Helping to prevent HIV/AIDS}

Family planning reduces the risk of unintended pregnancies among women living with HIV, resulting in fewer infected babies and orphans. In addition, male and female condoms provide dual protection against unintended pregnancies and against STIs including HIV.

\section*{Empowering people and enhancing education}

Family planning enables people to make informed choices about their sexual and reproductive health. Family planning represents an opportunity for women to pursue additional education and participate in public life, including paid employment in non-family organizations. Additionally, having smaller families allows parents to invest more in each child. Children with fewer siblings tend to stay in school longer than those with many siblings.

\section*{Reducing adolescent pregnancies}

Pregnant adolescents are more likely to have preterm or low birth-weight babies. Babies born to adolescents have higher rates of neonatal mortality. Many adolescent girls who become pregnant have to leave school. This has long-term implications for them as individuals, their families and communities.

\section*{Slowing population growth}

Family planning is key to slowing unsustainable population growth and the resulting negative impacts on the economy, environment, and national and regional development efforts.

\section*{Who provides family planning / contraceptives?}

It is important that family planning is widely available and easily accessible through midwives and other trained health workers to anyone who is sexually active, including adolescents. Midwives are trained to provide (where authorised) locally available and culturally acceptable contraceptive methods. Other trained health workers, for example community health workers, also provide counselling and some family planning methods, for example pills and condoms. For methods such as sterilization, women and men need to be referred to a clinician.

\section*{Contraceptive use}

Contraceptive use has increased in many parts of the world, especially in Asia and Latin America, but continues to be low in sub-Saharan Africa. Globally, use of modern contraception
has risen slightly, from $54 \%$ in 1990 to $57.4 \%$ in 2015. Regionally, the proportion of women aged 15-49 reporting use of a modern contraceptive method has risen minimally or plateaued between 2008 and 2015. In Africa it went from 23.6\% to 28.5\%, in Asia it has risen slightly from $60.9 \%$ to $61.8 \%$, and in Latin America and the Caribbean it has remained stable at $66.7 \%$.

Use of contraception by men makes up a relatively small subset of the above prevalence rates. The modern contraceptive methods for men are limited to male condoms and sterilization (vasectomy).

\section*{Global unmet need for contraception}

214 million women of reproductive age in developing countries who want to avoid pregnancy are not using a modern contraceptive method.

The number or percent of women currently married or in union who are fecund and who desire to either terminate or postpone childbearing, but who are not currently using a contraceptive method

The total number of women with an unmet need for family planning (FP) consists of two groups of women: (a) those with an unmet need for limiting, and (b) those with an unmet need for spacing.

Women with an unmet need for limiting are those who desire no additional children and who do not currently use a contraceptive method. Women with an unmet need for spacing are those who desire to postpone their next birth by a specified length of time (for example, for at least two years from the date of a survey) and who do not currently use a contraceptive method.

The indicator is calculated as follows:
$\mathbf{U}_{\mathbf{L}}+\mathbf{U}_{\mathbf{S}}=\mathbf{U}$
Where:
$\mathbf{U}=$ the number or percent of women with unmet need for FP;
$\mathbf{U}_{\mathbf{L}}=$ the number or percent of women with an unmet need for limiting; and
$\mathbf{U}_{\mathbf{S}}=$ the number or percent of women with an unmet need for spacing.
Reasons for this include:
- limited choice of methods;
- limited access to contraception, particularly among young people, poorer segments of populations, or unmarried people;
- fear or experience of side-effects;
- cultural or religious opposition;
- poor quality of available services;
- users and providers bias
- gender-based barriers.
- Low literacy levels

The unmet need for contraception remains too high. This inequity is fuelled by both a growing population, and a shortage of family planning services. In Africa, $24.2 \%$ of women of reproductive age have an unmet need for modern contraception. In Asia, and Latin America and the Caribbean - regions with relatively high contraceptive prevalence - the levels of unmet need are $10.2 \%$ and $10.7 \%$, respectively (Trends in Contraception Worldwide 2015, UNDESA).

\section*{Contraceptive methods}

\section*{Modern methods \\ Combined oral contraceptives (COCs) or "the pill"}

It contains two hormones (estrogen and progestogen). It is more than $99 \%$ with correct and consistent use but only $92 \%$ as commonly used. It also reduces risk of endometrial and ovarian cancer

\section*{Progestogen-only pills (POPs) or "the minipill"}

Contains only progestogen hormone, not estrogen. It works by thickening cervical mucous to block sperm and egg from meeting and prevents ovulation. It is $99 \%$ effective in preventing pregnancy with correct and consistent use and $90-97 \%$ effective as commonly used. It can be used while breastfeeding but must be taken at the same time each day

\section*{Implants}

They are small, flexible rods or capsules placed under the skin of the upper arm. They contain progesterone hormone only. It works by thickening cervical mucous to block sperm and egg from meeting and also prevents ovulation. It is more than $99 \%$ effective in preventing pregnancy. Health-care providers must insert and remove them. They can be used for $3-5$ years depending on type of implant. Irregular vaginal bleeding is common but not harmful.

\section*{Progestogen only injectables}

It is injected into the muscle or under the skin every 2 or 3 months, depending on product. It thickens cervical mucous to block sperm and egg from meeting and prevents ovulation. More than $99 \%$ effective in preventing pregnancy with correct and consistent use and $97 \%$ as commonly used. There is delayed return to fertility (about 1-4 months on the average) after use; irregular vaginal bleeding common, but not harmful

\section*{Monthly injectables or combined injectable contraceptives (CIC)}

It is injected monthly into the muscle, contains estrogen and progestogen. It prevents the release of eggs from the ovaries (ovulation). More than $99 \%$ effective in preventing pregnancy with
correct and consistent use and $97 \%$ as commonly used. Irregular vaginal bleeding is common, but not harmful

\section*{Intrauterine device (IUD): copper containing}

It is small flexible plastic device containing copper sleeves or wire that is inserted into the uterus. The copper component damages sperm and prevents it from meeting the egg. It is more than $99 \%$ effective in preventing pregnancy. Longer and heavier periods during first months of use are common but not harmful; can also be used as emergency contraception

\section*{Intrauterine device (IUD) levonorgestrel}

A T-shaped plastic device inserted into the uterus that steadily releases small amounts of levonorgestrel each day. It thickens cervical mucous to block sperm and egg from meeting. It is more than $99 \%$ effective in preventing pregnancy. It decreases amount of blood lost with menstruation over time. It reduces menstrual cramps and symptoms of endometriosis; amenorrhea (no menstrual bleeding) in a group of users

\section*{Male condoms}

Sheaths or coverings that fit over a man's erect penis. It forms a barrier to prevent sperm and egg from meeting. It is $98 \%$ effective in preventing pregnancy with correct and consistent use but $85 \%$ as commonly used. It also protects against sexually transmitted infections, including HIV

\section*{Female condoms}

They are sheaths, or linings, that fit loosely inside a woman's vagina, made of thin, transparent, soft plastic film. It forms a barrier to prevent sperm and egg from meeting. It is $90 \%$ effective in preventing pregnancy with correct and consistent use and $79 \%$ as commonly used. It also protects against sexually transmitted infections, including HIV

\section*{Male sterilization (vasectomy)}

Permanent contraception to block or cut the vas deferens tubes that carry sperm from the testicles. Keeps sperm out of ejaculated semen. $>99 \%$ after 3 months semen evaluation $97-98 \%$ with no semen evaluation. 3 months delay in taking effect while stored sperm is still present; does not affect male sexual performance; voluntary and informed choice is essential

\section*{Female sterilization (tubal ligation)}

Permanent contraception to block or cut the fallopian tubes. Eggs are blocked from meeting sperm. More than $99 \%$ effective in preventing pregnancy. Voluntary and informed choice is essential

\section*{Emergency contraception pills (ulipristal acetate $\mathbf{3 0 ~ m g}$ or levonorgestrel $\mathbf{1 . 5 ~ m g}$ )}

Pills taken to prevent pregnancy up to 5 days after unprotected sex. Delays ovulation. If all 100 women used progestin-only emergency contraception, one would likely become pregnant. Does not disrupt an already existing pregnancy

\section*{Traditional methods}

\section*{Lactational amenorrhea method (LAM)}

Temporary contraception for new mothers whose monthly bleeding has not returned; requires exclusive or full breastfeeding day and night of an infant less than 6 months old. Prevents the release of eggs from the ovaries (ovulation). $99 \%$ effective in preventing pregnancy with correct and consistent use. $98 \%$ as commonly used. A temporary family planning method based on the natural effect of breastfeeding on fertility.

\section*{Standard Days Method or SDM}

Women track their fertile periods (usually days 8 to 19 of each 26 to 32 day cycle) using cycle beads or other aids. Prevents pregnancy by avoiding unprotected vaginal sex during most fertile days. $95 \%$ effective in preventing pregnancy with consistent and correct use. $88 \%$ effective in preventing pregnancy with common use. Can be used to identify fertile days by both women who want to become pregnant and women who want to avoid pregnancy. Correct, consistent use requires partner cooperation.

\section*{Basal Body Temperature (BBT) Method}

Woman takes her body temperature at the same time each morning before getting out of bed observing for an increase of 0.2 to 0.5 degrees C . Prevents pregnancy by avoiding unprotected vaginal sex during fertile days. $99 \%$ effective in preventing pregnancy with correct and consistent use. $75 \%$ with typical use of FABM. If the BBT has risen and has stayed higher for 3 full days, ovulation has occurred and the fertile period has passed. Sex can resume on the 4th day until her next monthly bleeding.

\section*{Two Day Method}

Women track their fertile periods by observing presence of cervical mucus (if any type color or consistency). Prevents pregnancy by avoiding unprotected vaginal sex during most fertile days. $96 \%$ effective in preventing pregnancy with correct and consistent use. $86 \%$ with typical or common use. Difficult to use if a woman has a vaginal infection or another condition that changes cervical mucus. Unprotected coitus may be resumed after 2 consecutive dry days (or without secretions)

\section*{Sympto-thermal Method}

Women track their fertile periods by observing changes in the cervical mucus (clear texture), body temperature (slight increase) and consistency of the cervix (softening). It prevents pregnancy by avoiding unprotected vaginal sex during most fertile days. The method is $98 \%$ effective in preventing pregnancy with correct and consistent use. It is reported to be $98 \%$ effective in preventing pregnancy with typical use. The method may have to be used with caution after an abortion, around menarche or menopause, and in conditions which may increase body temperature.

\section*{Calendar method or rhythm method}

In this method, women monitor their pattern of menstrual cycle over 6 months, subtracts 18 from shortest cycle length (estimated 1st fertile day) and subtracts 11 from longest cycle length (estimated last fertile day). The couple prevents pregnancy by avoiding unprotected vaginal sex during the 1st and last estimated fertile days, by abstaining or using a condom. The method is $91 \%$ effective in preventing pregnancy with correct and consistent use and $75 \%$ effective with common use. However, the couple may need to delay or use with caution when using drugs (such as anxiolytics, antidepressants, NSAIDS, or certain antibiotics) which may affect timing of ovulation.

\section*{Withdrawal (coitus interruptus)}

Man withdraws his penis from his partner's vagina, and ejaculates outside the vagina, keeping semen away from her external genitalia. The method tries to keep sperm out of the woman's body, preventing fertilization. The method is $96 \%$ in preventing pregnancy with correct and consistent use and $73 \%$ as commonly used. It is one of the least effective methods, because proper timing of withdrawal is often difficult to determine, leading to the risk of ejaculating while inside the vagina.

\section*{WHO response}

WHO is working to promote family planning by producing evidence-based guidelines on safety and service delivery of contraceptive methods, developing quality standards and providing prequalification of contraceptive commodities, and helping countries introduce, adapt and implement these tools to meet their needs.

\section*{MORTALITY}

\section*{Introduction}

The acceleration of population growth in the developing countries of the world has not been due to a change in the birth rates; but to the great reduction in death rate following improvements life
in the developing countries, the rate of natural increase was most unlikely to have been more, and may indeed have been much less than that of the more developed countries.

There is still considerable scope for reduction in death rates in the developing countries. If this should occur unaccompanied by any fall in birth rates; the populations of these countries would grow at even faster rates than at present. In short, there is no hope of any reduction in the rates of population growth until the fall in birth rates is faster than that of the rates of death. In any case, the population will go on increasing until or unless the Crude Birth Rate (CBR) = Crude Death Rate (CDR) when the natural increase becomes zero.

\section*{Measurements of Mortality}

\section*{Crude death rate:}

The crude death rate (cdr or d) in a population during a given year is defined as the total number of deaths (D) divided by the midyear population (P). It is normally expressed per thousand population, so we have
$\mathrm{d}=1000 *(\mathrm{D} / \mathrm{P})$.

\section*{Crude Death Rate}

This is the simplest measure, indicating the number of deaths in a particular year per 1,000 of the population.

Formula: $-\mathrm{CDR}=\underline{\mathrm{D}} \times 1,000$
$$\mathrm{P}$$

Where D = Deaths in a year
$$\mathrm{P} \quad=\quad \text { population at mid- year }$$

The mid- year population is used, ideally, as the best available approximate of the average number of people exposed to death, or "at risk", during the year. The term "crude" is used simply, since no allowance is made for often considerable differences between populations in those aspects of composition in particular age and rates increase with age from late childhood, and that at nearly all ages mortality is higher for males than females. Consequently, age and sex structure plays an important role in influencing crude death rates, regardless of factors like living standards and health programmes. This is why care has to be taken in interpreting international difference in crude death rates. There are some less developed countries (e.g. Costa Rica, Guyana, Jamaica, Malaysia, Sri Lanka) which have lower crude death rates (about 5-7 per 1,000), countries of North America and North Western Europe ( about 9-12 per 1,000). Clearly,
this is due to much younger age structures in less developed countries, resulting from their high fertility in the immediate past.

\section*{Age-Specific Death Rate:}

The age-specific death rate (asdr) for individuals age i in a population during a given year is defined as the total number of deaths to people age i during the year (Di) divided by the total (midyear) population age i (Pi). Expressed per thousand, we have

ASDRI $=1000 *(\mathrm{Di} / \mathrm{Pi})$.
Note that the crude death rate is simply a weighted average of age-specific death rates, with the weights equal to the proportion of the total population represented by those age i. That is,
"SUM" (asdri *(Pi/P)) = 1000 * (D/P).
This formulation highlights the importance of age composition as a factor influencing the crude death rate (cf., State College vs. St. Petersburg, FL).

To study mortality, it is necessary to use comparative measures or indices of mortality for periods and areas under consideration. The basic measures are essentially rates of incidence relating to the number of death to a unit of population, commonly 1,000 , in a particular interval of time. The interval is invariably one year, to avoid the complicated effect of seasonal mortality variations on comparability of rates.

\section*{Age and sex - specific Death Rates}

A more critical appreciation of mortality level can be derived from a table of mortality desegregated by age and sex. An age and sex specific death rate is the number of deaths during the year of persons of a given age and sex per 1,000 people of that age group and sex category.

Formula: A and $\mathrm{SSDR}=\quad \underline{\mathrm{D}(\mathrm{A} \mathrm{\& S})} \times 1,000$

\section*{P (A\&S)}

D (A\&S) = Deaths of a given age and sex in a year
P (A\&S) = population of a given age and sex in the middle of the year.
It is conventional to use five year or ten year age groups, as a compromise between unnecessarily detailed and tediously compiled larger age groups. However, because of the importance of infant mortality, separate rates are usually calculated for the under one and 1-4 age groups.

Examples of age and sex- specific death rates are given in the following table and figures for a developed and a less developed country. Although levels of mortality differ between England and Wales, and Mauritius, the overall pattern of mortality by age and sex is very similar. Mortality rates fall from high levels in the first one year of life to a minimum in 5-14 age group and then rise in successive age groups, although the mortality level in the first one year is not exceeded until old age. The lower mortality rate for females is found in all the England and Wales age groups and almost all in Mauritius. Traditional explanations include the greater exposure of men, in general to warfare, occupational and recreational hazards and to occupational stress. The excess male mortality at infant and even fetal stages suggests that biological difference is the decisive factor.

\section*{Infant mortality rate}

An aspect of mortality that receives special consideration from demographers is infant mortality. This is due to at least 2 reasons:
1. Few, if any, human experiences are more tragic or emotionally devastating as the death of an infant child
2. The death rate in the first year of life is much higher than in the succeeding several decades

Infant mortality rate- is the most common measure of infant death and is the number of deaths in a year to children under age 1 per 1,000 babies born in the year. It is expressed as:

\section*{Overall pattern of mortality rates}

Sets of age - and sex specific rates represent refined measures of mortality, but they are cumbersome and difficult to assimilate. It is desirable, therefore to have a summary measure which epitomizes a whole set of rates but which avoids the crudity of the crude death rate. Demographers have used their technical skills to produce several measures and two of the most widely used will now be discussed to illustrate the procedure known as standardization. By this procedure, death rates are adjusted or standardized for the age and sex composition of the population. Standardization can be regarded as a means of holding age and sex constant.

\section*{The six most preventable causes of death for children younger than $\mathbf{5}$ are:}
1. Premature birth ( 18 percent of deaths)
2. Pneumonia (16 percent of deaths)
3. Birth defects ( 13 percent of deaths)
4. Newborn infections, malaria, sepsis, measles ( 13 percent of deaths)
5. Birth complications ( 11 percent of deaths)
6. Diarrhea (9 percent of deaths)

Childhood malnutrition is an underlying cause of 45 percent of all deaths among children younger than 5, according to the WHO. So proper nutrition is foundational to helping prevent many deaths.

\section*{Solutions that save lives, reduce child mortality}

According to the World Health Organization, six solutions to the most preventable causes of under-5 deaths include:
1. Immediate and exclusive breastfeeding
2. Skilled attendants for antenatal, birth, and postnatal care
3. Access to nutrition and micronutrients
4. Family knowledge of danger signs in a child's health
5. Improved access to water, sanitation, and hygiene
6. Immunizations

These solutions are among the various interventions World Vision employs in its work to promote maternal and child health. World Vision works with communities to train and equip midwives and local health workers; with governments and corporate partners to provide supplies and resources to clinics and hospitals; and with parents to teach best practices in the care and nurture of their young children.

World Vision aims to ensure children grow up healthy in their communities, with access to basic health services, adequate nutrition, and disease prevention.

\section*{Standardized Death Rates and Indices}

A legitimate desire is often felt for a single mortality rate, summing up the rates to be made between one rate and another. For this purpose, standardized death rate is generally used. This is a hypothetical figure which indicates what the crude death rate would be if the population being studied had the same age and sex composition as a population (any real or assumed population).

You will find that while comparing rates between different geographical areas, different hospitals, population or experimental groups; there are other factors which should be considered in assessing the reliability of a crude death rate e.g. many diseases, age specific death rates are higher for infants and very old people and low for children and young adults as already shown. Therefore, if one population has a high proportion of very old and very young persons, the crude death rate will usually be higher that that of a population consisting of mainly children and young adults.

The following data shows the number of deaths in males by age of a population in country A and the resultant death rates (hypothesized) and her immigrants in a particular year.

\begin{table}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}

\hline C.D.R. & 132.1 & 65.7 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The crude death rate for country A is 132.1/100,000, and that of the immigrants is 65.7/100,000, although at every age group, age specific death rates were higher for immigrants than for country A. These results are explained by the relatively small number of people aged over 45 in country A, which gives much weight to the crude death rate. Here then is an example of crude death rate being a sample of misleading index of comparing the levels of death in these two populations. Death rates vary with many social conditions, age and many others. To make a single figure index of reliable we must take account of the different population structures. This is what we have called a "standardized death rate". There are two common methods of deriving standardized rates, known as direct and indirect standardization.

\section*{Direct Method of the Standardization}

In order to get over the problem of different population structure of the two populations to be compared, we choose a standard comparison. This we call the standard. The population to be standardized we call it the index population. We then apply the age (or characteristics) specific rates of the index population to the standard population. This gives us the number of cases for each age group that we would expect if the index population rates applied in the standard population. Adding these cases over the age groups and dividing by the number of persons in the standard population gives the standardized death rate for the index population. In detail the steps involved in calculating the direct standardized death rate for the index population.

Define the standard population
Apply the Age Specific Death Rates for the index population to the numbers in each age group of the standard population to obtain the deaths we would expect in the population if the index rates applied.

Add these expected deaths over the age groups to obtain the total number of the expected deaths.
The crude rate obtained by dividing the total expected deaths by the total in the standard population; gives the standardized death rate for the index population.

\begin{table}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Table Standard Population and Expected Deaths of Country A against the Immigrants (per 100,000)}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|}
\hline Age Group & Standard Population Country A & Index Rates Immigrants Per 100,000 & Expected Deaths \\
\hline 0-4 & 1,900,000 & 80.8 & 1,536 \\
\hline 5-14 & 3,100,000 & 6.7 & 208 \\
\hline 15-44 & 9,400,000 & 21.3 & 2,002 \\
\hline 45-64 & 4,900,000 & 168.0 & 8,232 \\
\hline 65+ & 2,000,000 & 960.0 & 19,200 \\
\hline CDR & 21,300,000 & 146.4 & 31,177 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\begin{table}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Table Immigrants Population and Expected Deaths}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|}
\hline Age Group & Immigrants & Index Rates Immigrants Per 100,000 & Expected Deaths \\
\hline 0-4 & 26000 & 74 & 19.24 \\
\hline 5-14 & 30000 & 6 & 1.8 \\
\hline 15-44 & 127000 & 19 & 24.13 \\
\hline 45-64 & 25000 & 150 & 37.5 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
\hline & & & \\
\hline $65+$ & 5000 & 870 & 43.5 \\
\hline $\mathbf{C D R}$ & 213000 & $\mathbf{5 9 . 2}$ & 126.17 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

The expected deaths are obtained by multiplying the standard population in each age group by the age specific death rate of the index population, e.g.
$1,900,000 \times 80.8=1,535$
100,000
The total expected deaths are $1,535+208+2,002+8,232$
$$+19,200=31,177$$

The standardized death rate for the immigrants is therefore:
$31,177 \times 100,000=146.4 / 100,000$
21,300,000

The standardized death rate for country a is equal to the crude death rate which is 132.1 per 100,000.

In the following table are the standardized age- sexes - specific death rates for England and Wales, and Mauritius, which we came across earlier in table 4 using the population of Japan as a standard population to calculate the direct method of standardization.

The standardized death rates are as follows:

\section*{Mauritius}
$\mathrm{SIR}=\quad$ Expected deaths $\times 1,000$
Standard population
$=\quad 518,314+445,676 \times 1,000$
121,008,000
$=7.97$ per 1,000

\section*{Choice of the Standard Population}

Whatever considerations are made in the choice of a standard population for application of the direct method, the final decision as to which population is used must be to some extent arbitrary. However, provided the standard population is in some sense appropriate for the problem at hand, the precise structure of the population is unlikely to affect the results of comparisons of an index population to a market extent. For example, if the problem is to compare several occupational groups in England and Wales an appropriate standard might be the adult population of Kenya. On the other hand, there is no good reason why the adult population of Kenya should be chosen as a standard if the problem is to compare several occupational groups in England and Wales an appropriate standard might be the adult population of Kenya. On the other hand, there is no good reason why the adult population of Kenya should be chosen as a standard if the problem is to make international comparisons, various suggestions have been made for the choice of standard populations and these are shown in the following table.

These standards vary from an African country with a low proportion of old people through an intermediate world population to a European population with a high proportion of old people.

\section*{Indirect standardization}

The direct method of standardization uses the population of each age group as the standard. The indirect method of standardization uses the age specific rates as the standard. In detail, the procedure is as follows:

Define the standard age specific mortality rates.
Apply the standard age specific rates to the index population to get the expected deaths in each age group.

Add the expected deaths of all the age groups to get the sum of the expected deaths. Divide the total observed deaths (real) by the total of the expected deaths to get the standardized mortality ratio

Multiply the standardized mortality ratio by the crude death rate of the standard population.
Applying the procedure mentioned above to the data shown in the following table the calculation would be as follows:

\begin{table}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Table Indirect Standardization of the Immigrants to Country A_}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|}
\hline Age Group & Standard Rate/1000 & Immigrant population & Expected Cases \\
\hline 0-4 & 74.0 & 26000 & 19.2 \\
\hline 5-14 & 6.0 & 30000 & 1.8 \\
\hline 15-44 & 19.0 & 127000 & 24.1 \\
\hline 45-64 & 150.0 & 25000 & 37.5 \\
\hline 65 + & 870.0 & 5000 & 43.5 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|}
\hline & & & \\
\hline & & & 126.1 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

The expected cases are obtained by multiplying the age specific rates by the number of persons in the immigrants (index) population e.g. $(74.0 \times 26,000)$ divide by $100,000=19.2$.

The standard rates are the age specific rates for country A. The total expected cases are arrived at by adding $19.2+1.8+24.1+37.5+43.5=126.1$, and hence the standard mortality ratio
(SMR) is $\underline{140}=1.11$ or $111 \%$
126.1

Where 140 are the actual or observed total number of deaths in the immigrants population.

The indirectly standardized rate for the immigrants is then obtained by multiplying the crude rate of the standard population by the standard mortality ratio that is $132.1 \times 1.11=146.6$ per 1,000 . The indirect standardized rate for country A remains 132.1 for purposes of comparison, because we chose country A's rates as the standard.

\section*{Choice between the Direct and Indirect Methods}

Advantages of the direct method:
The method is simple to understand and apply
If it is necessary to compare one index population with another index population, it is possible to simply take the ratio of the two comparative mortality indices, to obtained comparative mortality index

CMI = DIRCTLY STANDARDIXED RATE 1
DIRECTLY STANDARDIZED RATE 2

The ratio of the two SMR obtained through indirect standardization does not simplify to any meaningful expression. Indeed in extreme situations the ratio of the two Standardized Mortality Rates (SMRs) could yield a totally misleading comparison of the incidence/mortality in the two index population.

\section*{Advantages of the indirect method:}

It can be shown that assuming the index rates are small as indeed they are in most studies of mortality and incidence the standard error of indexing the indirectly standardized rates is less than the directly standardized rate. Thus, if the sample sizes in the index population are small, there may be an important gain in precision if the indirect method is used rather than the direct method.

In many situations, it may be impossible to apply the direct method because the distribution of cases or deaths in the index population is unknown. The indirect method does not require this information.

In summary, the indirect method is preferred because of its consistency provided the sample sizes in the index population are small.

\section*{LIFE TABLE}

A life table is a life history of a hypothetical group or cohort of people as it is diminished gradually by deaths.

\section*{Types of Life Tables:}

\section*{Life tables are of two types:}

Cohort or Generation Life Table, and Period Life Table. The Cohort or Generation Life Table "summarises the age specific mortality experience of a given birth cohort (a group of persons all born at the same time) for its life and thus extends over many calender years." On the other hand, the "Period Life Table summarises the age specific mortality conditions pertaining to a given or other short time period."

\section*{Assumptions of Life Table:}

\section*{A life table is based on the following assumptions:}
1. A hypothetical cohort of life table usually comprises of 1,000 or 10,000 or $1,00,000$ births.
2. The deaths are equally distributed throughout the year.
3. The cohort of people diminish gradually by death only.
4. The cohort is closed to the in-migration and out-migration.
5. The death rate is related to a pre-determined age specific death rate.
6. The cohort of persons die at a fixed age which does not change.
7. There is no change in death rates overtime.
8. The cohort of life tables are generally constructed separately for males and females.

\section*{The Uses Of A Life Table}

The construction and handling of a life table are matters of professional demographers.
Health and rural planners should however at least to be aware of the data that can be obtained from life tables so that they may be applied usefully in the course of their work.

In particular they should be aware that a life table can show:-
✓ The probability of dying within some specific time period of persons within some age groups.
✓ The average number of years a new born infant can be expected to live
✓ The average number of years remaining for any person of any age.
✓ The probability of surviving for any given age to any other age.
✓ The probability of surviving for any given number of years for persons of any age.

\section*{Importance of Life Table:}

Life tables have been constructed by Graunt, Reed and Merrell, Keyfitz, Greville and other demographers for estimating population trends regarding death rates, average expectation of life, migration rates, etc.

\section*{We detail below the uses of life tables:}
1. Life table is used to project future population on the basis of the present death rate.
2. It helps in determining the average expectation of life based on age specific death rates.
3. The method of constructing a life table can be followed to estimate the cause of specific death rates, male and female death rates, etc.
4. The survival rates in a life table can be used to calculate the net migration rate on the basis of age distribution at 5 or 10 year interval.
5. Life tables can be used to compare population trends at national and international levels.
6. By constructing a life table based on the age at marriage, marriage patterns and changes in them can be estimated.
7. Instead of a single life table, multiple decrement life tables relating to cause specific death rate, male and female death rates, etc. can be constructed for analysing socio-economic data in a country.
8. Life tables are particularly used for formulating family planning programmes relating to infant mortality, maternal deaths, health programmes, etc. They can also be used for evaluating family planning programmes.
9. Now a days, life tables are used by life insurance companies in order to estimate the average life expectancy of persons, separately for males and females. They help in determining the amount of premium to be paid by a person falling in a specific age group.

Besides, if an insured person dies before the policy matures, the life table provides economic support to the insurance company without facing financial loss and it is able to give the insured amount to the legal heirs of the deceased.

nlx last class i.e 85+=ndx (last)
nmx (last)

To get the last figure for the last class in the nlx column, you get figures for the last ndx and nmx for the last class and divide as above. The figure you will get is added cumulatively from the bottom i.e. the last figure of column nlx thus forming column Tx as shown on chart.
$$\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{Tx} & =\text { Cumulative total from bottom of } \mathrm{nlx} \\

\section*{Age Misreporting}

Distortion in age distribution may be real and is caused by past changes in the levels or patterns of mortality, fertility or migration or they may be due to errors. The errors may be caused either by some individuals being incorrectly omitted from a survey or by ones individuals ages being wrongly reported.

A great problem for formal demography, frequently prohibiting the use of conventional techniques is that people simply do not tell the truth.

This is not a problem in developed countries but in many parts of the world, age misreporting can take two basic forms:-
- Age heaping
- Age shifting

\section*{Age Heaping}

Age heaping or digit preference as it is often called. Too many people report ages ending with 0 or 5 while relatively few people give ages ending in $9,1,4$ or 6 . For example, if in this group ones age is 22 , the individual will report this age as 20 years or 25 years.

\section*{Age Shifting}

Age shifting is a more serious problem than age heaping largely because it is harder to detect and adjust. Typically older people tend to exaggerate their ages, particularly where age confers status. Young men may underrate their age to avoid state free services. While older unmarried women may underrate their age.

Numerous techniques exist both to estimate the extent to which ages are misreported and to correct age distributions. Techniques for adjusting and smoothing ages are often complex and will not be discussed at this level. Whipple's index is a measure of preferences for ages ending in 0 and 5 . It takes ages between 23 and 62 because outside this range shifting and other problems always tend to confuse the normal pattern of heaping. The index is calculated simply by expressing the population reporting age ending with 0 and 5 as a percentage of the total population age between $23 \& 62$ and multiplying by 5 .

The range of the index is then from 100 indicating no preference for 0 and 5 up to 500 indicating that only 0 and 5 were reported.

\section*{Whipples Index table of interpretation}

\begin{tabular}{|l|r|}
\hline Key & \\

\hline Rough & $125-175$ \\

\end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline Very rough & Above 175 \\

\end{tabular}

The Whipple's index measures preferences for ages ending in 0 or 5 as a percentage of the total population aged between 23 and 62 and multiplying by 100 and then by 5 .
