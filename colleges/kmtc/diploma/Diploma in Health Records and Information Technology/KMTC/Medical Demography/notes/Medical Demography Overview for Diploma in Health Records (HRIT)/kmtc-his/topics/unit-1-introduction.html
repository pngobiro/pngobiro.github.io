                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>"Formal Demography" is the study of components of variation and change in demographic variables and the relationships between them</p>
                        <p>This is also called demographic analysis or demographic methods and is also defined as the treatment of quantitative relations among demographic phenomena in abstraction with other phenomena.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, population studies is the study of the relationships between demographic variables and other variables such as social and economic variables</p>
                        <p>This is constructed with the broader term "population studies" which also includes the treatment of relations between demographic events and socioeconomic and other phenomena.</p>
                        <p>Demography studies the size of a group of people, how the number has changed in the past and the likelihood of changing in future.</p>
                        <p>Factors determining the changes and the composition structure of the population in terms of age, sex, tribe or nationality, birth place, previous residence, education, marital status e.t.c</p>
                        
                        <h3>Major topics covered under demography include;</h3>
                        <ol class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Fertility</li>
                            <li>Mortality</li>
                            <li>Migration</li>
                        </ol>
                        
                        <p>Fertility, mortality and migration are components of population changes and affect its geographical distribution. Knowledge about them is used in population estimations and projections among other uses. One of the most important tools in Demographic studies is a life table which is computed using the 3 variables.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>NUPTIALITY</strong> varies with the age of first marriage common in a society and with the age structure of the population. It will be lower in an ageing population than in a very young one. It is a major factor in fertility, although less so now with a large proportion of children born out of wedlock. The most basic rates express the number of marriages per thousand populations, or the number of people per thousand marrying in a given year</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>MORTALITY</strong> - the number of people in a population dying in a year, related to two other terms: life span and life expectancy. Life span is the life-length of the person who has lived longer than any other, and that is now 122 years. Life expectancy - the average longevity in a population (75 for men and 81 for women)</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>MIGRATION</strong> - movement of people in and out of an area or society. Immigration is movement into an area. Emigration is movement out. Push factors compel/force people to emigrate. Pull factors induce them to immigrate. Depending on these factors migrations can be more or less voluntary or not. Factors determining migrations are: economic, primarily in terms of opportunity; political, such as persecution or subjugation/suppression; environmental or natural, like disaster or famine. Immigration rate - the number of people entering an area. Emigration rate is a number of people leaving an area. Gross migration rate is immigration plus emigration rate. Net migration rate is immigration minus emigration. Migrants are people who moved - and they can be internal or external to an area.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h3>i. Economic planning</h3>
                        <p>Population size, growth and available labor force are useful factors in planning the economy of the country to sustain the population</p>

                        <h3>ii. Policy making</h3>
                        <p>Taking population growth rate into account, the government may make a policy to encourage family planning</p>

                        <h3>iii. Political administrative purposes</h3>
                        <p>Whether or not to sub-divide an administrative area mainly depends on the population to be served. The number of constituencies in a given district depends on the population of a district</p>

                        <h3>iv. Distribution of social welfare</h3>
                        <p>Institutions, facilities and services e.g health, education, security, water supplies, transport e.t.c depend on the population of a given area</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>The numbers of health institutions to be established in a given district depend on the population to be served</li>
                            <li>The number of primary schools to be established in a district depends on the number of children of primary school going age</li>
                            <li>The capacity of water supply installation to provide an urban center depends mainly on the population of the center apart from other factors</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>v. Health indicators</h3>
                        <p>The health status of a community is easily portrayed by various rates calculated in demography e.g mortality rate, fertility rates, morbidity rates, birth rates and life expectancy</p>

                        <h3>vi. Social research</h3>
                        <p>Any social research must make use of some demographic information. Demographic information is also useful in the formulation of health policies and medical research</p>

                        <h3>vii. Distribution of communal burdens</h3>
                        <p>A country like Kenya which has relied on fund-raising (harambee) for development of most of the social infrastructures like schools and health institutions has to allocate quotas to divisions, locations, sub-locations or villages mainly according to their population</p>

                        <h3>viii. Distribution of human resources</h3>
                        <p>Demographic information is used to determine human resources in terms of labor as a factor of economic production, its potential and actual exploitation (labor force, employed, underemployed, unemployed)</p>

                            <li>Population census</li>
                            <li>Demographic sample surveys</li>
                            <li>Registration of vital events (births, deaths, migration and marriages). Also called civil registration</li>
                        </ol>
                        
                        <h4>Civil Registration</h4>
                        <p>History- it is a relatively modern concept in its present format. However, churches have long maintained baptism and burial registries. They have provided insight on the demographic situation since the late Middle ages</p>
                        <p>Purpose- primarily administrative</p>
                        <p>To collect data on the vital events happening in a population (generally concerned with live births, deaths, marriages and divorces)</p>
                        <p>Help understand demographic characteristics of different populations at different points in time</p>
                        
                        <h4>Advantages</h4>
                        <ol class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>It enables continuous monitoring of vital rates</li>
                            <li>May provide both numerator and denominator data for some rates (e.g Infant Mortality Rate-IMR)</li>
                            <li>Small area data available</li>
                            <li>It forms base for testing the accuracy of censuses and surveys</li>

                        <h4>Disadvantages</h4>

                            <li>Uncertain coverage: difficult to ensure registration of all the events</li>
                            <li>Limited background information</li>
                            <li>Time reference often inconsistent with denominator definition</li>
                            <li>Information may come from third party</li>
                            <li>Easily disrupted by political/economic events</li>
                            <li>Literacy/numeracy</li>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>A population policy is a deliberately constructed arrangement or program "through which governments influence, directly or indirectly, demographic change" (Demeny, 2003).</p>
                        <p>These arrangements typically are "legislative measures, administrative programs and other governmental actions intended to alter or modify existing population trends in the interest of national survival and welfare" (Eldridge, 1968).</p>
                        <p>The demographer John May wrote that "population policies are designed to regulate and, if possible, mitigate the problems [of too rapid growth or decline] by adjusting population size and structure to the needs and aspirations of the people" (John May, 2005)</p>
                        <p>Population policies usually represent strategies for governments or sometimes, albeit less frequently, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to attain specific goals. The procedures or programs are put into place to ensure that the policy goals are attained. A policy is generally intended to either reduce or increase population levels. Policies are developed "in interest of the greater good ...... in order to address imbalances between demographic changes and other social, economic and political goals" (May, 2005).</p>

                        <h3>THE THREE WORLD POPULATION CONFERENCES</h3>
                        <p>Even though the issue of human population growth as a problem or concern is really a $20^{\text{th}}$ century phenomenon, the concern with overpopulation is not new.</p>
                        <p>Malthus declared that overpopulation was bound by nature to occur. He and others wrote about population growth and its problems. But it was not until the 1960s and the early 1970s that the public became acutely aware of them. Several high-profile books such as The Population Bomb (Ehrlich, 1968), The Limits to Growth (Meadows et al, 1974) and Small is Beautiful (Schumacher, 1975) brought the issue of overpopulation to the attention of millions of readers. Unlike Malthus, however, many of these authors gave special attention to the degradation of the environment by larger and larger numbers of humans (Poston, DeSalvo and Meyer, 2009; Russell and Poston, 2008). To this day, there is still some discussion of the issue of overpopulation. Friedman (2005) has noted, for instance, that aspects of these themes of overpopulation and environmental degradation are reflected in the contemporary anti-globalization movement.</p>
                        <p>Starting in the 1970s, there was considerable debate in academic circles with many advocating voluntary family planning. The position among the so-called birth controllers and many population specialists was that inducing women in developing countries to practice contraception would simultaneously improve their social and economic situation and alleviate the societal problems of their countries (Connelly, 2008; Hodgson and Watkins, 1997). Rich countries such as the United States, along with private foundations and other organizations, provided large amounts of financial assistance to the population-control movement and the worldwide endeavor to limit population growth.</p>
                        <p>In 1965, President Lyndon Johnson established an Office of Population in the Department of State and the US Agency for International Development (USAID). The goal of USAID was to convince governments in developing countries to foster contraceptive usage among its citizens. In many countries, this was a politically charged issue that ran against (or contradicted) traditional pronatalist cultural norms (those advocating increases in fertility). The USAID sent teams of demographers and other specialists to countries all over the world to inform their leaders and officials about the impacts of continued rapid population growth.</p>
                        <p>The attempts by the United States to promote family planning overseas in countries not yet "ready" for this message inevitably met with cries of imperialism. Officials in the host countries asked why the United States was promoting family planning instead of more pressing needs like assistance in relieving the millions of people suffering from malaria. In order to defuse this issue, the US worked with the United Nations to help create in 1969 the United Nations Fund for Population Activities (UNFPA) which then served as a major source of funds for population initiatives in developing countries.</p>
                        <p>Since the United Nations came in existence in 1945, it has sponsored and conducted three world population conferences, held in 1974, 1984 and 1994. These conferences framed the story of international family planning that has unfolded since the 1970s.</p>
                        
                        <h4>1. Bucharest, Romania (1974)</h4>
                        <p>The first World Population Conference was held in Bucharest, Romania, in 1974. It was an attempt to bring together government officials from around the world and to illustrate for them the facts and consequences of rapid population growth. It was expected by the developed nations in attendance that the rest of the world would recognize the so-called population problem and join the growing movement to curb population growth. To the surprise of many, there was no such endorsement. Rather, most developing nations stressed their preoccupation with the importance of socioeconomic development, both in its own right and as a catalyst for lowering fertility. They called for a "New Economic Order," whose position was encapsulated in the expression "Development is the best contraceptive."</p>

                        <h4>2. Mexico City (1984)</h4>
                        <p>The second conference was held in Mexico City in 1984. During the ten years since the first conference, many developing countries had changed their opinions about population growth and were now interested in assistance directed toward their fledgling family planning programs. (A family planning program is a systematic effort to promote modern fertility control). African countries, especially, were seeing the benefits of more widespread family planning programs, if not for demographic reasons, then at least for the health of women and children. However, by this time, the political atmosphere in the United States had changed dramatically. The official US delegation to the conference under the administration of President Ronald Reagan asserted that "population is a neutral phenomenon" in the development process, and that excessive state control of the economy was more responsible for economic stagnation than population growth.</p>
                        <p>This unexpected US position stunned the other delegates. Instead of rallying the world community behind population issues, the US introduced to the world its controversial Mexico City policy. The US administration, over strong Congressional objection, decided to police the actions of developing countries with respect to abortion services by refusing to fund the family planning activities of local organizations that also provided abortion, even if abortion was legal in that country and paid for by private funds.</p>
                        <p>One of the first acts of President Bill Clinton's administration when he took office in 1993 was to reverse this policy of President Reagan. But when the administration of George W. Bush came into power in 2001, the Reagan policy was once again restored. With the inauguration of Barack Obama in 2009, the Bush-Reagan policy was changed back to the policy of the Clinton administration regarding the providing of funds for family planning. When President Obama reversed the Bush-Reagan policy on January 23, 2009, he remarked that "for the past eight years [the Bush-Reagan restrictions] have undermined efforts to promote safe and effective voluntary family planning in developing countries. For these reasons it is right for us to rescind this policy and restore critical efforts to protect and empower women and promote global economic development".</p>

                        <h4>3. Cairo, Egypt (1994)</h4>
                        <p>The 1994 International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) was held in Cairo, Egypt. This conference radically altered the international population movement. Its major outcome was a new definition of population policy, giving prominence to reproductive health and downplaying the demographic rationale for population policy. Two radically diverse groups, feminists and neo-Malthusians, joined forces to create a new manifesto that included the following stipulations;</p>
                        <ol class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Population stabilization is a desirable, ultimate goal, although not one warranting the use of compulsion</li>
                            <li>National programs enhancing access to contraception are justified in terms of individual human rights, not in terms of their development advantages for populations</li>
                            <li>The empowerment of women is a prerequisite for the enduring low fertility that population stabilization requires.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>The Cairo conference was considered to be very successful mainly because it allowed historically opposed and oppressed groups to identify a unified position. Later, however, many officials and scholars working on population matters were surprised that, apparently, discussions of aggregate demographic concerns were being seen as politically incorrect. Indeed, some argued that "programs that are demographically-driven, and are intended to act directly on fertility, are inherently abusive of women's rights to choose the number and timing of their children". Others argued that there is nothing inherently abusive or intrusive about demographically driven population policy.</p>
                        <p>In sum, Cairo "stressed the importance of individual choices and the necessity to further empower women". An action program was prepared with the consensus and support of 179 governments that "individual human rights and dignity, including the equal rights of women and girls and universal access to sexual reproductive health and rights, are a necessary precondition for sustainable development". More recent international conferences have largely agreed with this preoccupation. It was the main theme of follow-up meetings of the International Conference on Population and Development, "which included a meeting in the Netherlands and a meeting of the U.N General Assembly in 1999".</p>
                        
                        <p>There was no world population conference in 2004 although one had been planned for. But when the U.S under the administration of President George W. Bush, withdrew its funding of the UNFPA, it was decided to simply incorporate the goals of earlier conferences for the present and the immediate future.</p>
                        <p>In 2014, the United Nations reviewed the action program and stated that achievements since 1994 have been remarkable. Noted in particular were the worldwide "gains in women's equality, population health and life expectancy, educational attainment, and human rights protection systems," along with the fact that "an estimated 1billion people (have been moved) out of extreme poverty" (UNFPA, 2014). Also emphasized was the improvement around the world in the dignity of women and adolescent girls, especially their empowerment "to exercise their reproductive rights". Moreover, it was stressed that "sexual and reproductive health and rights and understanding the implications of population dynamics are foundational to sustainable development".</p>

                        <h3>Summary</h3>
                        <p>Population policy is made by national governments in an effort to either limit or expand the number of people in their country. For countries with high population growth rates, population policy generally includes programs to encourage family planning, birth spacing, and delaying the birth of a woman's first child. In the 1990s, many countries began to include improvements in women's reproductive health as part of their population policies. The national family planning programs begun in various African countries are good examples of this aspect of population policy. Countries with very low or negative population growth rates have sometimes encouraged families to have more children through policies such as extended maternity leave with pay and family support payments. Population policy can also include measures to increase or decrease immigration. For Example:</p>
                        <p>a) The population policy in China is a law stating that each couple is only allowed one child.</p>
                        <p>b) Kenya's 4th Development Plan (1979-1983) states under the Population Policy (p. 61 para 2.156) that: "In Kenya decisions on family size rest with parents. These decisions taken together determine the rate of population growth in the nation. While the government is concerned about the rapid rate of population growth in Kenya, it is also convinced that as these concerns come to be understood in terms of effects on family welfare and quality of life, parents will adjust their decisions in favour of smaller families". The current Development Plan 1984-1988 states further: "Since the rate of population growth is mainly determined by decisions taken by parents on family size, during this Plan period the government, in co-operation with non-government organizations, will intensify its programme of informing and educating actual and potential parents regarding the benefits of smaller family sizes, particularly since the fertility of less-educated women is found to be higher. Family planning services will be made available mainly in the rural areas, by increasing the number of health facilities offering family planning services and also the number of trained personnel to provide these services".</p>

                        <h3>Population Policy Goals:</h3>
                        <p>The goals to guide Demographic policy and programme planning are:</p>
                        <ol class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>To reduce population growth rate</li>
                            <li>To encourage people to have a small family</li>
                            <li>To reduce fertility level that sustains the high rate of population growth and at the same time assist those couples, as well as individuals, who desire but are unable to have children,</li>
                            <li>To reduce mortality further, particularly the infant and child mortality, because such reductions would ultimately lead to lowering the fertility,</li>
                            <li>To reduce rural-urban and rural-to-rural migration which help to create the unplanned settlements in marginal lands and to help ease the pressure on basic need services in both the rural and urban areas.</li>
                            <li>To motivate Kenya males to adopt and practice family planning.</li>
                            <li>Others include Educational and Clinical Services Goals</li>
