                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>DEMOGRAPHY is a scientific study of human population primary to their size, structure and their development.<br>
                        "Formal Demography" is defined by the same as: - the treatment of quantitative relations among demographic phenomena in abstraction with other phenomena. This is constructed with the broader term "population studies" which also includes the treatment of relations between demographic events and social economic and other phenomena.<br>
                        Demography studies the size of a group of people, how the number has changed in the past and the likelihood of changing in future; factors determining the changes and the composition structure of the population in terms of age, sex, age, tribe or nationality, birth place, previous residence, education, marital status etc.<br>
                        Major topics covered under demography include:-</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Fertility</li>
                            <li>Mortality</li>
                            <li>Migration and immigration</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <p>Fertility, mortality and migration are components of population changes and affect its geographical distribution. Knowledge about them is used in population estimations and projections among other uses. One of the most important tools in Demographic studies is a life table.<br>
                        NUPTIALITY varies with the age of first marriage common in a society and with the age structure of the population; obviously it will be lower in an ageing population than in a very young one. It is a major factor in fertility, although less so now with a large proportion of children born out of wedlock. The most basic rates express the number of marriages per thousand populations, or the number of people per thousand marrying in a given year.<br>
                        MORTALITY - the number of people in a population dying in a year, related to two other terms: life span and life expectancy. Life span is the life-length of the person who has lived longer than any other, and that is now 122 years. Life expectancy - the average longevity in a population ( 75 for men and 81 for women).<br>
                        MIGRATION - movement of people in and out of an area or society. Immigration is movement into an area. Emigration is movement out. Push factors compel people to emigrate. Pull factors induce them to immigrate. Depending on these factors migrations can be more or less voluntary or not. Factors determining migrations are: economic, primarily in terms of opportunity; political, such as persecution or subjugation/suppression; environmental or natural, like disaster or famine. Immigration rate - the number of people entering an area.<br>
                        Emigration rate is a number of people leaving an area. Gross migration rate is immigration plus emigration rate. Net migration rate is immigration minus emigration. Migrants are people who moved - and they can be internal or external to an area.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The term population is used differently in demography and in statistics. In demography it relates to the number of people in a given area, while in statistical it is means the universe of units under consideration, which may be people or items.</p>
                        <p>However there are numerous ways of defining population in demographic way. This depends on whether one includes or excludes groups such as visitors, seamen, armed forces, diplomats, institutional population, those temporarily away or those missed by census.<br>
                        Broadly there are two types of population counts; de facto and de Jure.<br>
                        Population pyramids comprises of age sex composition;<br>
                        There are about four population shapes:-</p>

                            <li>Pyramidal - indicating high growth</li>
                            <li>Rectangular - indicating slow growth</li>
                            <li>Oval - indicating decline</li>
                            <li>Hourglass - indicating increased pandemic e.g. AIDS driven decline</li>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>De-Jure means the populations who belong to the area or have the legal right to be there through citizenship and have legal evidence. In order to try to obtain some comparability between nations, the united nations recommended that each country should produce from the census a population total which excludes foreign military and diplomatic staff currently in the country, but includes their own armed forces, merchants, seamen and diplomats who are currently abroad.</p>
                        <p>De facto means the populations who are present in a country at the time of census irrespective of the people's citizenship. It counts everybody so long as they are in an area at the time of counting.</p>

                        <p>Whether or not to sub-divide an administrative area mainly depends on the population to be served. The number of constituencies in a given district depends on the population of a district.</p>

                        <p>Institutions, facilities and services e.g. health, education, security, water supplies, transport, etc depend on the population of a given area.</p>

                            <li>The numbers of Health Institutions to be established in a given district depend on the population to be served.</li>
                            <li>The number of primary schools to be established in a district depends on the number of children of primary school going age.</li>
                            <li>The capacity of water supply installation to provide an urban centre depends mainly on the population of the centre apart from other factors.</li>

                        <p>The health status of a community is easily portrayed by various rates calculated in demography e.g. mortality rate, fertility rates, morbidity rates, birth rates and life expectancy.</p>

                        <p>Any social research must make use of some demographic information. Demographic information is also useful in the formulation of health policies and medical research.</p>

                        <p>A country like Kenya which has relied on fund raising (Harambee) for development of most of the social infrastructures like schools, and health institution has to allocate quotas to divisions, locations, sub-locations or villages mainly according to their population.</p>
