                            <p>A pathogen is defined as an organism causing disease to its host. The severity of the disease symptoms is referred to as virulence. Pathogens are taxonomically widely diverse and comprise viruses and bacteria as well as unicellular and multicellular eukaryotes. Every living organism is affected by pathogens, including bacteria, which are targeted by specialized viruses called phages.</p>
                            <p>A pathogen may also be referred to as an infectious agent, or simply a germ.</p>

                            <p>Host-pathogen interactions provide information that can help understand disease pathogenesis, the biology of one or many pathogens, as well as the biology of the host.</p>
                            <p>The interaction is referred to as symbiosis.</p>
                            <p>Symbiosis is a neutral, antagonistic or synergistic relationship between two dissimilar organisms (symbiotes, symbionts) living in close association with each other.</p>
                            <p>There are three forms of symbiotic relationships that can occur at an anatomical level.</p>

                            <p>Normal flora help to provide defenses against invading pathogens by covering adherence sites, producing compounds toxic to other organisms, and preventing pathogens from consuming available nutrients. For disease to occur there must be a change in the body's environment, which, in turn, allows the pathogen to overcome the normal flora. This can occur through a change in the pH of the body or elimination of normal flora due to antibiotics.</p>

                            <p>Pathogenesis is the method by which a disease can develop. This can occur through foodborne intoxication where the causative agent produces toxins in the body (e.g., botulism). Another route is the colonization of an invading pathogen on the host surface, which allows the pathogen to increase in numbers and produce toxins that are damaging to the host's cells (e.g., <em>Vibrio</em> and <em>Corynebacterium</em>).</p>
                            <p>Pathogenesis can also occur by pathogens invading and breaching the body's barrier in order to multiply. These organisms have mechanisms that will not allow macrophages (the body's defense against pathogens) to destroy them. They can also evade antibody detection (e.g., tuberculosis and plague). Finally, organisms can invade tissues within the body and produce toxins (e.g., <em>Shigella</em>).</p>
                            <p>The relationship between a host and pathogen is dynamic. Production of disease occurs through a process of steps. The first five mechanisms make up a pathogen's invasiveness (i.e., ability to invade tissues).</p>

                            <p>In order to begin infection and eventually cause disease, pathogens must find a transmission route. Transmission of an infectious agent can occur in many ways, but it is typically through exposed skin (e.g., a cut, abrasion, puncture, or wound) or mucous membranes (e.g., gastrointestinal tract, respiratory tract, or urogenital tract).</p>

                            <h3 id="adherence">Adherence</h3>
                            <p>Once the pathogen has gained access to the body, it must have some means of attaching itself to the host's tissues. This attachment is called adherence and is a necessary step in pathogenicity. Microbes contain ligands, which are projections that attach host receptors or surface proteins.</p>
                            <p>Pathogens may have specific adherence mechanisms to attach to cells or tissue surfaces. Examples of this include:</p>

                            <h3 id="invasion">Invasion</h3>
                            <p>At this point, microbes begin to invade the host and produce a bacteremia (i.e., presence of bacteria in the bloodstream) or viremia (presence of a virus in the bloodstream). Microorganisms are exposed to many barriers after introduction into the host. Some bacteria are able to cause disease while remaining on the epithelial barriers, while many need to penetrate that barrier.</p>
                            <p>Once this barrier has been penetrated, these pathogens can multiply without competition.</p>

                            <h3 id="colonization">Colonization</h3>
                            <p>Colonization is the multiplication of pathogenic organisms where toxins are produced and the normal flora are overcome. During this stage, pathogens compete with normal flora for space and nutrients. Pathogens usually colonize host tissues that are in contact with the external environment. During colonization, the host begins to show signs of septicemia (i.e., blood infection where bacteria are reproducing). For infection to proceed an infectious dose should be determined. This is the minimal number of microbes necessary to establish infection. Certain pathogens are less contagious and therefore require larger numbers of pathogens to cause disease (i.e., 10-100 for <em>Shigella</em> and 1,000,000 for <em>Salmonella</em>).</p>

                            <h3 id="evasion">Evasion of Host Defenses</h3>
                            <p>After colonization, pathogens circumvent the host's innate and adapted defenses by phagocytosis. Multiple mechanisms are used by pathogens to evade a host's immune system. For the innate system this includes:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">Intracellular pathogens that live inside a host cell</span></li>

                            </ul>
                            <p>Pathogens must also avoid adapted defenses. Pathogens can produce proteases (i.e., allow each pathogen to avoid antibodies) or catalases (i.e., prevents the digestion of an engulfed pathogen).</p>
                            <p>They can also utilize antigenic variation to alter the antigen structure. In addition, pathogens can mimic host molecules, which can cause disease-related damage.</p>

                            <h3 id="damage">Cause Damage or Disease to Host While Avoiding Host Defenses</h3>
                            <p>Damage can occur through direct or indirect pathways. Direct methods produce toxins, which are poisonous substances that produce toxemia within a host.</p>
                            <p>Three types of toxins are produced to cause damage:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content"><strong>Exotoxins:</strong> Proteins secreted by pathogens that cause damage to the host (botulinum toxin, tetanus toxin, hemolysin (ruptures red blood cells).</span></li>

                            </ul>

                            <h3 id="exiting">Exiting the Host</h3>
                            <p>A pathogen must exit the body. This occurs through various routes. Examples include sneezing, coughing, diarrhea, coitus, pus, blood, or insect bites.</p>

                            <h3 id="survival">Survival Outside the Host</h3>
                            <p>Finally, a pathogen must be able to survive in the environment long enough to be transmitted to another host. Some are hardy and can survive for several weeks before a new host is found.</p>
                            <p>There are others that survive in animal reservoirs or require direct contact because they are fragile.</p>

                            <p>(a) Exotoxins are proteins produced inside pathogenic bacteria, most commonly gram-positive bacteria, as part of their growth and metabolism. The exotoxins are then secreted or released into the surrounding medium following lysis.</p>

                            <p>(b) Endotoxins are the lipid portions of lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) that are part of the outer membrane of the cell wall of gram-negative bacteria (lipid A; see Figure 4.13c). The endotoxins are liberated when the bacteria die and the cell wall breaks apart.</p>
