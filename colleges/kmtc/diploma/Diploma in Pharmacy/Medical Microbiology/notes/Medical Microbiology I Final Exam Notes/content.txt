# Medical Microbiology I Final Exam Notes

## INTRODUCTION

Microbiology is the study of microorganisms, too small to be seen with the naked eye.

It considers the microscopic forms of life and deals about their reproduction, physiology, and participation in the process of nature, helpful and harmful relationships with other living things, and significance in science and industry.

Medical microbiology: is a branch of microbiology which deals with the study of microbes, such as bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites, which cause human illness and their role in the disease.

## Definition of Some Common Terms

Commensalism: is a relationship in which one organism derives food or other benefits from another organism without hurting or helping it. e.g. Commensal bacteria are part of the normal flora in the mouth

Commensals- These inhabit certain areas of humans, they are not usually associated with diseases

True Pathogens- Usually associated with diseases. They invade the body and cause diseases Pathogenesis - The development of a disease and the chain of events leading to that disease i emechanism of tissue attack

Aetiology- The study of the cause, or manner of causation of a disease or condition. An example of etiology is knowing that some of the causes of high blood pressure are smoking, lack of exercise, stress and a diet high in salt and fat.

Clinical presentation- refers to the physical signs or symptoms associated with a particular disease. e.g. fever, body color etc.

Laboratory diagnosis- A medical procedure that involves testing a sample of blood, urine, or other substance from the body. Laboratory tests can help determine a diagnosis, plan treatment, check to see if treatment is working, or monitor the disease over time.

Epidemiology - is the study of distribution, economic burden, control and prevention of communicable diseases.

Epidemic - describes a situation where a disease spreads rapidly to a large number of people in agiven population over a short period of time. Major epidemics include cholera and diarrhoeal diseases, measles, malaria, and dengue fever

Pandemic - describes the rapid spread of a transmissible infectious/communicable disease over several continents or worldwide. COVID-19 can be characterized as a pandemic

Endemic describes a disease that is present at an approximately constant level within a society or country. Example of endemic disease include malaria that occurs at a predictable rate among populations of some areas of Africa Each country may have a disease that is unique, for example

## Functions of Microbes in the Environment

- Food production e.g. yoghurt
- Manufacture/production of drugs
- Provide sea food to aquatic organisms
- Used in the brewing industry in the process of fermentation
- Serve as normal flora in our bodies. They inhibit the growth of other microbes by occupying the space which could be occupied by pathogens
- Used in decaying waste to manure and fertilizer
- Organic material is broken to produce biogas
- They help in the digestion of foods in the small intestine
- Used in scientific research
- Used to destroy dangerous chemical pollutants such as DDT and other toxic solvents.

As health care workers we must be aware of microbes, where they live naturally (their sources), how they are transmitted from the source to human beings, what disease they produce and under what conditions and those of us associated with patients to take precaution to prevent the spread of the pathogens.

## Transmission of Pathogens

- They can be spread in the following ways
- From health workers to patients
- Patient to patient
- From contaminated medical equipments
- From contaminated formites
- Patient to health worker
- Patient to other people

## History of Microbiology

Mankind has always been affected by diseases which were originally believed to be visitations by the gods and meant to punish evil doers.

Hippocrates (460 BC -370 BC), father of medicine, observed that ill health resulted due to changes in air, winds, water, climate, food, nature of soil and habits of people.

Marcus Terentius Varro (116–27 BC) theorized that disease was caused by minute living creatures invisible to naked eye but which were carried in the air through the mouth and nose into the body.

Girolamo Fracastoro (1478–1553) proposed that the agents of communicable disease were living germs that could be transmitted by direct contact with humans and animals, and indirectly by objects; but no proof because of lacking experimental evidence.

Antony Van Leeuwenhoek (1632–1723), father of Microbiology, observed "animalcules" using simple microscope with one lens. He drew what hesaw. He discovered protozoa, blood cells and sperms. He was the first who properly described the different shapes of bacteria. Although Leeuwenhoek was not concerned about the origin of microorganism; many other scientists were searching for an explanation for spontaneous appearance of living things from decaying meat, stagnating ponds, fermenting grains and infected wounds.

On the basis of this observation, two major theories were formulated.

1. Theory of Abiogenesis
2. Theory of Biogenesis

Theory of Abiogenesis deals with the theory of spontaneous generation; stating that living things originated from non-living matter.

Aristotle (384–322 BC): The founder of the theory spontaneous generation. He observed spontaneous existence of fishes from dried ponds, when the pond was filled with rain.

Francesco Redi (1626–1697): He is the scientist who first tried to set an experiment to disprove spontaneous generation.

- He put the meat in a bottle and covered it with a gauze.
- He observed that the flies laid eggs from which the maggots developed.
- He proved maggots did not develop from meat but from fly's eggs.

Theory of Biogenesis states that life comes from pre-existing life.

Louis Pasteur (1822–1895) was the scientist who disproved the theory of abiogenesis. He designed a large curved flask (Pasteur goose neck flask) and placed a sterile growth broth medium. Air freely moved through the tube; but dust particles were trapped in the curved portion of flask. Microbial growth in the broth was not seen. Therefore Pasteur proved that micro-organisms entered to substrates through the air and micro-organisms did not evolve spontaneously.

### Major contribution of Louis Pasteur

1. Microbial theory of fermentation
2. Principles and practice of sterilization and pasteurization
3. Control of diseases of silk worms
4. Development of vaccines against anthrax and rabies.
5. Discovery of streptococci

The germ theory of disease

Is the currently accepted scientific theory for many diseases. It states that microorganisms known as pathogens or "germs" can lead to disease.

The complete establishment of the germ theory of disease depended on the work of a Germans scientist, Robert Koch (1843-1910).

Major achievements of Robert Koch

1. Discovery and use of solid medium in bacteriology
2. Discovery of causative agents of tuberculosis and cholera.
3. Koch's phenomenon
4. Koch's postulates

Koch's postulates: proof of germ theory of disease

A micro-organism can be accepted as a causative agent of an infectious disease only if the following conditions are satisfied.

1. The micro-organism should be found in every case of the disease and under conditions which explain the pathological changes and clinical features.
2. It should be possible to isolate the causative agent in pure culture from the lesion.
3. When such pure culture is inoculated into appropriate laboratory animal, the lesion of the disease should be reproduced.
4. It should be possible to re-isolate the bacterium in pure culture from the lesion produced in the experimental animal.
5. Nowadays additional postulate is mentioned i.e. Specific antibody to the bacterium should be detectable in the serum during the course of the disease.

It has not been possible to fulfil every one of Koch's postulates, but by adhering to them as closely as possible, serious errors have been prevented.

Exceptions to Koch's postulates

1. Many healthy people carry pathogens but do not exhibit symptoms of the disease.
2. Some microbes are very difficult or impossible to grow in vitro (in the laboratory) in artificial media e.g. Treponema pallidum
3. Many species are species specific e.g. Brucella abortus cause abortion in animals but no report in humans.
4. Certain diseases develop only when an opportunistic pathogen invades immunocompromised host.

1784 Edward Jenner demonstrated the use of protective vaccination using cow pox. He used lesions of cowpox to inject in humans because it is similar to small pox. Vacca is a Latin word meaning cow

1867 Joseph Lister, a British surgeon, postulated that certain chemicals when used to clean surgical instruments were disinfective. He used carbonic acid to reduce wound infection rates

## Cell Theory

It was proposed in 1838 by two German microbiologists' i.e. Matthias and Theodore and it stated that all living things are composed of cells. Later Rudolf enhanced the theory with the idea that cells must arise from existing ones, in other words life must arise from life.

## TAXONOMIC CLASSIFICATION OF ORGANISMS

TAXONOMY is the science of organismal classification.

Classification is the assignment of organisms (species) into an organized scheme of naming. Ideally these schemes are based on evolutionary relationships (i.e. the more similar the name, the closer the evolutionary relationships).

TAXON: -A group or category of related organisms. Two key characteristics of taxa are:

- Members of lower level taxa (e.g. Species) are more similar to each other than are members of higher level taxa (e.g. Kingdom or domain).
- Member of specific taxa are more similar to each other than any are to members of different specific taxa found at the same hierarchical level (e.g. Humans are more similar to apes, i.e., comparison between species, than either is similar to, for example, Escherichia coli). Thus once you know that two individuals are member of the same taxon, you can ascertain similarities between the two organisms.

NOTE that taxa are dynamic, changing as our knowledge of organism and evolutionary relationships change

## BINOMIAL NOMENCLATURE

Organisms are named using binomial nomenclature (viruses are exceptions). Binomial nomenclature employs the names of the two level taxa, genus and species, to name aspecie. Binomial nomenclature includes:

i. Genus comes before species (e.g., Escherichia coli)
ii. Genus name is always capitalized (e.g., Escherichia)
iii. Species name is never capitalized (e.g., coli)
iv. Both names are always either italicized or underlined (e.g. Escherichia coli)
v. The genus name may be used alone, but not the species name (i.e. saying or writing "Escherichia" alone is legitimate while saying or writing "coli" is not)
vi. The genus name may be abbreviated and the species written in full; e.g. Staphylococcus aureus is written as S. aureus.

## Strain

a) A strain in some ways is equivalent to a breed or subspecies among plants or animal. Strain is the level below the species
b) Two members of the same strain are more similar to each other than either is to an individual that is a member of a different strain, even if all three organisms are members of the same species

## Bacterial species

A bacterial species is defined by the similarities found among its members. Properties such as biochemical reactions, chemical composition, cellular structures, genetic characteristics, and immunological features are used in defining a bacterial species. Identifying a species and determining its limits presents the most challenging aspects of biological classification for any type of organism.

A formal means of distinguishing bacterial species is by employing a dichotomous key to guide the selection of test used to efficiently determine those bacterial properties most relevant to bacterial identification

## Dichotomous key

A means of assigning an organism to a specific taxonomic category typically involves the use of specific criteria that may be posed as questions (e.g. what does the organism look like etc.).

Relevant criteria may be arranged as a dichotomous key. In a dichotomous key questions are arranged hierarchically with more general questions are asked first, with questions becoming more specific asked subsequently

## Bacterial classification system

After Species next higher classification is the genus. The same genus comprises several species which may differ in several aspects. Further up the ladder of classification, micro-organisms with similar features are placed in successive larger categories. Thus similar genera are grouped into families, similar families are categorized as order; similar order make up class; similar classes make up the phylum

### The five kingdom system

The five kingdom system was first proposed in 1969. The five kingdoms include:

- i. Plantae (the plants)
- ii. Fungi (the fungi)
- iii. Animalia (the animals)
- iv. Protista (the unicellular eukaryotes)
- v. Monera (the prokaryotes)

### Kingdom of Monera

Three categories:

#### 1. Eubacteria

Are our common, everyday bacteria, some of which are disease causing; also the taxon from which mitochondria originated.

#### 2. Cyanobacteria

Are photosynthetic eubacteria, the taxon from which chloroplast originated

#### 3. Archaebacteria

Are distinctive in their adaptation to extreme environments (e.g., very hot, salty, or acidic) though not all archaebacteria live in extreme environments.

These distinctions are more phenotypic than they are evolutionary (i.e., a cyanobacteria is a eubacteria, and neither is an archaebacteria).

### Kingdom Protista

Protista like Monera consist mostly of unicellular organisms.

Distinctively, however, the members of Kingdom Protista are all eukaryotic while the members of kingdom Monera are all prokaryotic. Some members of Protista are multicellular, however Kingdom Protista represents a grab bag, essentially the place where the species are classified when they are not classified as either fungi, animals or plants.

### Kingdom Fungi

Unlike Protista, the eukaryotic fungi are typically non aquatic species. They traditionally are nutrients absorbers plus have additional distinctive features. There do exist unicellular fungi, which we call yeast.

### Viral classification

Classification of viruses is not nearly as well developed as the classification of cellular organisms. Today viruses tend to be classified by their chemical, morphological and physiological attributes (e.g. genome = DNA vs RNA, virion particle = enveloped vs non enveloped and myriad details of their intracellular infection cycles). Binomial nomenclature is not employed to name viruses; instead viruses are named by their common names (e.g., Human Immunodeficiency Virus a.k.a HIV)

### EUKARYOTIC CELL

Eu- true
Karyote- nucleus

The eukaryotic cell has a true membrane bound nucleus, usually containing multiple chromosomes, a mitotic apparatus, a well-defined endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria.

### PROKARYOTIC CELL

Pro- primitive
Karyote- nucleus

The prokaryotic cell possesses naked DNA without associated basic proteins, divides amitotically by binary fission and bounded by a semi rigid cell wall.

The distinguishing features between Eukaryotic cell and Prokaryotic cell

## PATHOGENECITY AND HOST DEFENCES

A pathogen is defined as an organism causing disease to its host. The severity of the disease symptoms is referred to as virulence. Pathogens are taxonomically widely diverse and comprise viruses and bacteria as well as unicellular and multicellular eukaryotes. Every living organism is affected by pathogens, including bacteria, which are targeted by specialized viruses called phages.

A pathogen may also be referred to as an infectious agent, or simply a germ.

### Host-pathogen interactions

Host-pathogen interactions provide information that can help understand disease pathogenesis, the biology of one or many pathogens, as well as the biology of the host.

The interaction is referred to as symbiosis.

Symbiosis is a neutral, antagonistic or synergistic relationship between two dissimilar organisms (symbiotes, symbionts) living in close association with each other.

There are three forms of symbiotic relationships that can occur at an anatomical level.

- Mutualism (+/+): mutually beneficial relationship between two species: In mutualism, both the microorganism and the body work together. An example of this relationship would be cows and the bacteria in their rumen. Bacterial cellulase facilitates digestion in the animal, while the bacteria benefit from nutrients in the rumen.
- Commensalism (+/0): relationship between two species in which one is benefited and the other is not affected, neither negatively nor positively: In commensalism, either the body or the microorganism benefits, while the other is not affected by the interaction. Examples of this include microorganisms that make up the normal flora that inhabit the eyes. These organisms thrive on secretions and dead cells, but do not affect the host.
- Parasitism (+/-): relationship between two species in which one benefits (parasite) from the other (host); usually involves detriment to the host: In parasitism, one organism benefits at the expense of the other. For example, parasites use the gastrointestinal tract of a human or animal as an environment in which to reproduce.

### The Body's Normal Flora

The body contains two types of normal flora:

1. Resident flora (survive for extended periods), and
2. Transient flora (temporary).

Normal flora help to provide defenses against invading pathogens by covering adherence sites, producing compounds toxic to other organisms, and preventing pathogens from consuming available nutrients. For disease to occur there must be a change in the body's environment, which, in turn, allows the pathogen to overcome the normal flora. This can occur through a change in the pH of the body or elimination of normal flora due to antibiotics.

### Host Defenses

A microorganism will not be able to invade unless it overcomes individual's host defenses. Specific host defenses may include:

- Skin and mucosal secretions
- Non-specific local responses (e.g., pH)
- Non-specific inflammatory responses
- Specific immune responses (e.g., lymphocytes)

The ability for a pathogen to overcome host defenses can be accomplished by two distinct components: a primary pathogen (causes disease in a healthy host) or opportunistic pathogen (causes disease if host is immunocompromised).

### Pathogen Defenses

Pathogens contain virulence factors that promote disease formation and provide the opportunity for a microbe to infect and cause disease. The greater the virulence, the more likely disease will occur. Such factors include:

- Ability of a pathogen to adhere to a host
- Ability of a pathogen to colonize (overcome) a host
- Ability of a pathogen to evade host defenses

### Mechanisms of Pathogenesis

Pathogenesis is the method by which a disease can develop. This can occur through foodborne intoxication where the causative agent produces toxins in the body (e.g., botulism). Another route is the colonization of an invading pathogen on the host surface, which allows the pathogen to increase in numbers and produce toxins that are damaging to the host's cells (e.g., Vibrio and Corynebacterium).

Pathogenesis can also occur by pathogens invading and breaching the body's barrier in order to multiply. These organisms have mechanisms that will not allow macrophages (the body's defense against pathogens) to destroy them. They can also evade antibody detection (e.g., tuberculosis and plague). Finally, organisms can invade tissues within the body and produce toxins (e.g., Shigella).

The relationship between a host and pathogen is dynamic. Production of disease occurs through a process of steps. The first five mechanisms make up a pathogen's invasiveness (i.e., ability to invade tissues).

### Transmission

In order to begin infection and eventually cause disease, pathogens must find a transmission route. Transmission of an infectious agent can occur in many ways, but it is typically through exposed skin (e.g., a cut, abrasion, puncture, or wound) or mucous membranes (e.g., gastrointestinal tract, respiratory tract, or urogenital tract).

### Adherence

Once the pathogen has gained access to the body, it must have some means of attaching itself to the host's tissues. This attachment is called adherence and is a necessary step in pathogenicity. Microbes contain ligands, which are projections that attach host receptors or surface proteins.

Pathogens may have specific adherence mechanisms to attach to cells or tissue surfaces. Examples of this include:

1. Tissue tropism (i.e., pathogens that prefer specific tissues over others),
2. Species specificity (i.e., pathogens that only infect certain species), and
3. Genetic specificity (i.e., surface mutations that occur so previous antibodies do not recognize the invading pathogen). If a microorganism cannot adhere to a host cell membrane, disease will not occur.

### Invasion

At this point, microbes begin to invade the host and produce a bacteremia (i.e., presence of bacteria in the bloodstream) or viremia (presence of a virus in the bloodstream). Microorganisms are exposed to many barriers after introduction into the host. Some bacteria are able to cause disease while remaining on the epithelial barriers, while many need to penetrate that barrier.

Once this barrier has been penetrated, these pathogens can multiply without competition.

### Colonization

Colonization is the multiplication of pathogenic organisms where toxins are produced and the normal flora are overcome. During this stage, pathogens compete with normal flora for space and nutrients. Pathogens usually colonize host tissues that are in contact with the external environment. During colonization, the host begins to show signs of septicemia (i.e., blood infection where bacteria are reproducing). For infection to proceed an infectious dose should be determined. This is the minimal number of microbes necessary to establish infection. Certain pathogens are less contagious and therefore require larger numbers of pathogens to cause disease (i.e., 10-100 for Shigella and 1,000,000 for Salmonella).

### Evasion of Host Defenses

After colonization, pathogens circumvent the host's innate and adapted defenses by phagocytosis. Multiple mechanisms are used by pathogens to evade a host's immune system. For the innate system this includes:

- Intracellular pathogens that live inside a host cell
- Avoid phagocyte recognition by producing capsules prevents phagocytosis
- Producing membrane damaging toxins which can kill phagocytes (e.g., leukocidins)
- Interfere with complement activation
- Survive in the phagocyte

Pathogens must also avoid adapted defenses. Pathogens can produce proteases (i.e., allow each pathogen to avoid antibodies) or catalases (i.e., prevents the digestion of an engulfed pathogen).

They can also utilize antigenic variation to alter the antigen structure. In addition, pathogens can mimic host molecules, which can cause disease-related damage.

### Cause Damage or Disease to Host While Avoiding Host Defenses

Damage can occur through direct or indirect pathways. Direct methods produce toxins, which are poisonous substances that produce toxemia within a host.

Three types of toxins are produced to cause damage:

- **Exotoxins**: Proteins secreted by pathogens that cause damage to the host (botulinum toxin, tetanus toxin, hemolysin (ruptures red blood cells).
- **Endotoxins**: Toxic substances that are released when a cell is killed (Lipolsaccharides).
- **Exoenzymes**: Enzymes that function outside the host cells or tissues. These include coagulase (forms a fibrin clot that "hides" the microbe from phagocytosis), hyaluronidase (breaks connective tissues down), or fibrinase (breaks down blood clots to allow pathogens to continue spreading).

### Exiting the Host

A pathogen must exit the body. This occurs through various routes. Examples include sneezing, coughing, diarrhea, coitus, pus, blood, or insect bites.

### Survival Outside the Host

Finally, a pathogen must be able to survive in the environment long enough to be transmitted to another host. Some are hardy and can survive for several weeks before a new host is found.

There are others that survive in animal reservoirs or require direct contact because they are fragile.

## Mechanisms of pathogenesis. Infectious Diseases: The Basics

An infectious disease is a clinically evident deviation from health. It occurs when there is a parasitic relationship between a host and a microorganism. Several different factors influence amicoorganism's relationship to its host and level of severity. These include:

- Pathogenicity: The ability to produce disease in a host organism.
- Pathogenesis Is the origin and development of a disease and the chain of events leading to the disease.
- Virulence: The degree of pathogenicity of a microorganism. Determinants of virulence for a pathogen include a pathogen's genetic, biochemical, or structural features. For example, one strain of influenza may only cause a fever and sore throat, while another may cause pneumonia or other serious respiratory condition.
- Infectivity: The level at which a microorganism is able to infect or invade a host.
- Transmissibility: The measure of a microorganism's ability to spread from one host to the next. This can include both distance and number of affected individuals.

## Disease Stages

Infections can be either **subclinical** or **inapparent**. If clinical signs are seen, disease occurs. The incubation period is the time between infection and first appearance of signs or symptoms. This period depends on the dose level of microbes, microbe type, virulence, and host health.

The prodromal period of 1 to 2 days follows incubation in some diseases. This includes early, mild signs/symptoms such as, fatigue, muscle aches, and/or headache. Recovery occurs when signs/symptoms are subsiding but the host may remain more susceptible to secondary, opportunistic infections. During the convalescent period, the body returns to a pre-diseased state.

**Nosocomial infections**: an infection acquired in a hospital setting that was not present in the host prior to admission, generally occurring within 72 hours of admission.

| Infection Site | Percentage of All Nosocomial Infections | Most Common Agents |
|---------------|----------------------------------------|-------------------|
| Urinary Tract | 40% | Escherichia coli, Enterococcus, Proteus, Klebsiella, Pseudomonas aeruginosa |
| Surgical Wound | 20% | Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, E. coli |
| Pulmonary | 10% | Klebsiella, Pseudomonas, E. coli, S. aureus |
| Primary Bacteremia | 5% - 10% | S. aureus, S. epidermidis, Gram-negative rods |
| Others | 20% - 25% | S. aureus, E. coli |

## Difference between Endotoxin and Exotoxin

**Exotoxins** are toxic substances secreted by bacteria and released outside the cell. Whereas **Endotoxins** are bacterial toxins consisting of lipids that are located within a cell. Following are the few differences between exotoxin and endotoxin.

(a) Exotoxins are proteins produced inside pathogenic bacteria, most commonly gram-positive bacteria, as part of their growth and metabolism. The exotoxins are then secreted or released into the surrounding medium following lysis.

(b) Endotoxins are the lipid portions of lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) that are part of the outer membrane of the cell wall of gram-negative bacteria (lipid A; see Figure 4.13c). The endotoxins are liberated when the bacteria die and the cell wall breaks apart.

| Characteristics | Exotoxins | Endotoxins |
|----------------|-----------|------------|
| Source | Living gram positive and gram negative bacteria | Lysed gram negative bacteria |
| Location | Released from the cell | Part of cell |
| Chemical Composition | Protein | Lipopolysaccharide |
| Heat Sensitivity | Labile (60-80C) | Stable (250C) |
| Immune Reactions | Strong | Weak |
| Conversion to Toxoids | Possible | Not possible |
| Fever | No | Yes |
| Enzyme Activity | It has mostly enzymatic activity. | It has no enzymatic activity. |
| Molecular Weight | Its molecular weight is 10KDa. | Its molecular weight is 50-1000KDa. |
| Denaturing | On boiling it get denatured. | On boiling it cannot be denatured. |
| Specificity | Specific to particular bacterial strain | Non specific |
| Antigenicity | High | Poor |
| Examples | Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Streptococcus pyogenes | E.coli, Salmonella typhi, Shigella |
