\section*{The periodic table}

The periodic table is an arrangement of the elements in order of increasing atomic number. Elements that exhibit similar chemistry appear in vertical columns called groups (numbered $1-18$ from left to right); the seven horizontal rows are called periods.
- The CAS system used letters to differentiate main group (A) and transition (B) elements.
- The modern IUPAC system uses Arabic numbers 1-18, simply numbering the columns of the periodic table from left to right. Many periodic tables include both Roman and Arabic numbers. The Arabic numbering system is the most widely accepted today

8 groups A Element Families- Another common method of categorization recognizes nine element families:
1. Alkali Metals: Group 1 (IA)-1 valence electron
2. Alkaline Earth Metals: Group 2 (IIA) - 2 valence electrons
3. Boron Group or Earth Metals: Group 13 (IIIA) - 3 valence electrons
4. Carbon Group or Tetrels: - Group 14 (IVA) - 4 valence electrons
5. Nitrogen Group or Pnictogens: - Group 15 (VA) - 5 valence electrons
6. Oxygen Group or Chalcogens: - Group 16 (VIA) - 6 valence electrons
7. Halogens: - Group 17 (VIIA) - 7 valence electrons
8. Noble Gases: - Group 18 (VIIIA) - 8 valence electrons

Group B element families Transition Metals: Groups 3-12 - d and f block metals
Group 3 (IIIB) Scandium group:
Group 4 (IVB) Titanium group:
Group 5 (VB) Vanadium group:
Group 6 (VIB) The Chalcogens (Chromium group):
Group 7 (VIIB) Manganese group:
Group 8 : (VIII B) Iron group
Group 9 :(VIII B) Cobalt group:
Group 10: (VIII B) Nickel group
Group 11 (IIB) The coinage metals (Copper group):
Group 12 (IB) (Zinc group) The volatile metals: zinc (Zn), cadmium (Cd) and mercury (Hg)

The periodic law states that "the properties of the elements are the periodic functions of their atomic numbers" i.e. if the elements are arranged in the increasing order of their atomic numbers, the recurrence of properties of the elements takes place at regular intervals.
The elements of s and p-block (total 8 columns) are collectively called main group elements. The elements placed in s-block and p-block except the elements of groups 18 (zero group) are also known as representative elements and zero group elements are called inert or noble gases. The elements of the groups 3 or (IIIB), 4 or (IVB), … . 7 or (VIIB), 8 to 10 or (VIII), 11 or (IB) and 12 or (IIB) (total ten vertical columns) have been placed in d-block (also called transition elements). There are 28 elements arranged separately in two horizontal rows at the bottom of the main body of the periodic table, each row containing 14 elements. These have been included in f-block also known as inner transition elements or rare earth metals. First row of the elements is called $\mathbf{4 f}$-block elements or lanthanides because they all are having almost similar properties and follow the element lanthanum. The second row is the $\mathbf{5 f}$-block elements or actinides as they fall after actinium and also have almost similar properties. The transition elements have been placed between s-and p-block elements and inner transition elements within transition elements.
In general, all the elements of the long form of periodic table have been divided into four categories:
(i) Representative elements: These are the main group elements including the groups $1,2,13 \ldots \ldots .17$ which have either ns 1 or ns 2 and $\mathrm{ns}^{2} \mathrm{px}(\mathrm{x}=1-5)$ outer shell electronic configuration where n is the highest value of principal quantum number. All these elements have been placed in subgroups A of the periodic table.
(ii) Noble gases: These also fall within main group elements and include group 18 (or zero) elements. These all have completely filled s- or s- and p-subshells of outer most or ultimate shell with highest n value, i.e. ns 2 or ns 2 p 6 (ns2 for $\mathrm{He})$. These have also been placed in subgroup A of periodic table.
(iii) Transition metals: These are the elements of groups 3 to 12 and in general have incomplete d -subshell of the penultimate shell and filled s-subshell of ultimate shell with highest n -value. But the elements of some of the groups also have incompletely filled s-subshell of the ultimate shell in addition to incompletely filled d-subshell of the penultimate shell. All these elements have been placed in subgroups B of the periodic table.
(iv) Inner transition elements: These elements are said to belong to group 3 or (IIIB) due to close similarity in their chemical properties with those placed in group 3. These elements generally have incompletely filled ( $\mathrm{n}-1$ ) d and ( $\mathrm{n}-2$ ) fsubshells. According to their electronic configuration and the type of subshell to which the last of differentiating electron enters in the atom of the elements, the elements in the modern periodic table have been classified into four blocks i.e. s, p, d and f-block elements.
(i) s-Block elements: All these elements are metals and solid except H and He which are gases. These are the elements in which the last electron enters the s-subshell. The elements of group 1 (alkali metals, $\mathrm{Li}, \mathrm{Na}, \mathrm{K}, \mathrm{Rb}, \mathrm{Cs}, \mathrm{Fr}$ ) and group 2 (alkaline earth metals, viz., $\mathrm{Be}, \mathrm{Mg}, \mathrm{Ca}, \mathrm{Sr}, \mathrm{Ba}, \mathrm{Ra}$ ) belong to this block in addition to hydrogen (H) and helium (He). The general valence shell electronic configuration of these elements is $\mathrm{ns}^{\mathrm{x}}(\mathrm{x}=1$ or 2$)$ where n is the number of valence shell or number of period which the element belongs to.
(ii) p-Block elements: These elements in which the differentiating electron enters the orbitals of p -subshell of the valence or outer most shell are called p-block elements. The elements of groups 13 to 18 (except He with configuration 1s2) belong to this block. The group number and the elements contained in them are shown here:

Group 13 : B, Al, Ga, In, Tl
Group 14 : C, Si, Ge, Sn, Pb
Group 15 : N, P, As, Sb, Bi
Group 16 : O, S, Se, Te, Po
Group 17 : F, Cl, Br, I, At
Group 18 : Ne, Ar, Kr, Xe, Rn
The general valence shell electronic configuration of these elements in $\mathrm{ns} 2 \mathrm{np}^{\mathrm{x}}(\mathrm{x}=1$ to 6$)$ and n is the number of shell. The elements of this block exist in all the three states of matter viz. solid, liquid and gas. Most of them are non- metals and the rest are metals and metalloids (or semimetals).
(iii) d-Block elements: The elements in which the last electron enters the orbitals of (n-1) d subshell, (i.e. the subshell of penultimate shell) and d-orbitals are, thus, being progressively filled are known as d-block elements. These elements are also termed as transition elements and have been placed in the middle between s-block and p-block elements in the periodic table. Thus, these elements serve as a bridge or transition between highly electropositive s-block and highly electronegative p -block elements thereby being responsible for gradual change in the properties along a period. Hence the name, transition elements has been given to them. These include the elements of group 3 to group 12 (ten
columns). These have further been categorised into 3d, 4d, 5d and 6d series depending on the shell number whose dorbitals are being filled. Each of these series contains ten elements as given below:
3d series: scandium ( $\mathrm{Sc}, \mathrm{Z}=21$ ) to zinc ( $\mathrm{Zn}, \mathrm{Z}=30$ )
4d series: yttrium ( $\mathrm{Y}, \mathrm{Z}=39$ ) to cadmium ( $\mathrm{Cd}, \mathrm{Z}=48$ )
5d series: lanthanum ( $\mathrm{La}, \mathrm{Z}=57$ ), hafnium ( $\mathrm{Hf}, \mathrm{Z}=72$ ) to mercury ( $\mathrm{Hg}, \mathrm{Z}=80$ )
6d series: actinium ( $\mathrm{Ac}, \mathrm{Z}=89$ ), rutherfordium ( $\mathrm{Rf}, \mathrm{Z}=104$ ) to copernicium ( $\mathrm{Cn}, \mathrm{Z}=112$ )
The general valence shell electronic configuration of these elements is $(\mathrm{n}-1) \mathrm{d}^{\mathrm{x}} \mathrm{ns} 1$ or2 $(\mathrm{x}=1$ to 10$)$. All these elements are metals and solid except Hg (a liquid).
(iv) f-Block elements: In these elements, the last or differentiating electron, in general, enters the orbitals of (n-2) f subshell, i.e. the subshell of antipenultimate shell. All these elements are metals and solids. These elements are also called inner transition elements because they have incomplete f subshell as well as incomplete d -subshell and fall within d-block elements. These elements have been divided into two series of 14 elements each, as follows:
- 4f-series elements (lanthanides): cerium ( $\mathrm{Ce}, \mathrm{Z}=58$ ) to lutetium ( $\mathrm{Lu}, \mathrm{Z}=71$ )
- 5f- series elements (actinides): thorium (Th, $\mathrm{Z}=90$ ) to lawrencium ( $\mathrm{Lr}, \mathrm{Z}=103$ )

The general valence shell electronic configuration of these elements is ( $n-2$ ) f0-14 ( $n-1) d 0-2 n s^{2}$.
It has been noticed that for s and p -block elements, the outermost shell itself is the valence shell. For d -block elements, two subshells, $(\mathrm{n}-1) \mathrm{d}$ and n -s subshells taken together form the valence shell. For f -block elements, three subshells, ( n 2)f (n-1)d and n-s subshells jointly form the valence shell. This is due to nearly similar energy of these subshells. A valence shell is that shell of the atoms of the elements, from which the electrons are used for bond formation or chemical combination. For long form of the periodic table, it may be noted that the s-block elements (group 1and2) have been placed in the extreme left portion of the table and the p-block elements are kept in the extreme right portion. The middle portion includes d-block elements. At the bottom, f-block elements have been placed separately in two series/rows.

\section*{Trends in the periodic table}

Periodic trends are specific patterns that are present in the periodic table that illustrate different aspects of a certain element. They were discovered by the Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeleev in the year 1863. Major periodic trends include atomic radius, ionization energy, electron affinity, electronegativity, valency and metallic character. These trends exist because of the similar electronic configuration of the elements within their respective groups or periods and because of the periodic nature of the elements. These give a qualitative assessment of the properties of each element.

\section*{Across the period from left to right}
- Electrons fill the one ns and the three np orbitals in accordance with paulis exclusion principle and the hunds rule
- As a result of increasing nuclear charge and electrons being added to orbitals of the same energy level atoms size generally decrease whereas first ionization energy and electronegativity generally increases
- Ionization energy- energy to remove the electron with the highest energy
- Electronegativity- ability to form covalent bonds
- Metallic character decreases with increase in nuclear charge of the element across the period as elements change from metals to metalloids to non-metals
- Reactivity is highest at the left and right ends of the period except for innert noble gases
- Bonding between atoms of an element changes from metallic to covalent in networks to covalent in individual molecules to none between separate atoms. As expected physical properties change abruptly at the network/molecule boundary which occurs in the period between carbon and nitrogen
- Bonding between each element and an active non-metal changes from ionic to polar covalent to covalent. Bonding between each element and an active metal changes from metallic to polar covalent to ionic
- The acid base behavior of the common oxides in water changes from basic to amphoteric to acidic as the bond between the elements and oxygen becomes more covalent
- Reducing strength decreases through the metal and oxidizing strength increases through the non-metals

\section*{Trends down the group}

\section*{Group 1A: Alkali metal}

They are given this name because of their alkali (basic) nature of their oxides

\section*{Properties down the group}
- All members have the oxidation number +1 and form $\mathrm{E}^{+}$ions.
- Atoms have the largest size and the lowest ionization energy and electronegativity in their period
- Atomic and ionic size increases while ionization energy and electronegativity decreases
- Metallic bonding is relatively weak because there is only one valence electron i.e. metals have low melting point and boiling point which decreases down the group
- Large atomic size and low atomic mass results in low density that in alkali metals the rate of increase of mass is greater than rate of increase of volume, therefore the density increases down the group

\section*{Group 2A: Alkaline earth metals}
- All members have the oxidation number of +2 and form the compound with $\mathrm{E}^{2+}$ ions
- Atomic and ionic sizes increase down the group but are smaller than for the alkali earth metals
- The ionization energy and electronegativity decreases down the group
- Metallic bonding involves two valence electrons
- Melting and boiling point generally decrease and density increase down the group

\section*{Group 3A (3) Boron family)}
- All except thallium commonly display +3 oxidative state. The +1 state become more common down the group $\mathrm{Tl}^{+}$
- Atomic size, ionization energy and electronegativity do not change as expected down the group because there are intervening transition and inner transition elements
- Bonding changes from network covalent in boron to metallic in the rest of the group thus boron has a higher melting point than the others but there is no overall trend
- Boiling point decreases while density increases down the group

\section*{Group 4A (4) (carbon family)}
- Down the group the number of oxidation state decreases and the lower ( +2 ) state becomes more common
- Atomic size increases down the group while ionization energy and electronegativity generally decreases but deviations occur for Ge and Pb because of intervening transition and inner transition elements
- Decreasing hardness and melting point are due to change in type of bonding within the solid e.g. covalent network in carbon and silicon and Geranium, metallic in Sn and Pb
- Density increases down the group because of crystal packing

\section*{Group 5A Nitrogen family}
- The number of oxidation state decreases down the group and the lower $(+3)$ state becomes more common
- The atomic size, ionization energy and electronegativity decrease down the group
- Change from individual molecules to covalent network and to metals. Thus melting point increases and then decreases
- Density increases down the group

\section*{Group 6A oxygen family}
- A lower oxidation state becomes more common down the group
- Down the group atomic and ionic size increase and ionization energy and electronegativity decreases
- Melting point increases through to tellurium and then decreases for polonium due to its metallic bonding
- Density of the elements increases down the group

\section*{Group 7A Halogens}
- Elements lack one electron to complete the outer shell. The -1 oxidation state is the most common for all members
- Down the group atomic and ionic size increases steadily as ionization energy and electronegativity decreases
- Phase change temperatures exhibit smooth trends down the group the melting and boiling point increases as a result of stronger dispersion forces between havier molecules
- The density of the elements as liquids increase steadily with molar mass

\section*{Group 8 noble gases}
- All the valence shells are filled and are said to be unreactive. Only Kr and Xe are known to form compounds
- This group contains the smallest atom with highest ionization energy in their period. Down the group atomic size increases and ionization energy decrease steadily
- Melting and boiling point of these gaseous elements are extremely low but increase down the group
- Density increases steadily down the group

\section*{General properties of elements}
(i). Size of atom and ion (Atomic radius)- The atomic radius is the distance from the atomic nucleus to the outermost electron orbital in an atom. The size of atom decreases from left to right across a period in the periodic table. This is because there is a high force of attraction between electrons and the nucleus. On descending the group the size of atoms increase due to increase of number of energy levels. A positive ion is smaller than the neutral atom because it looses the electron in the outer most shell and the more electrons are removed the smaller the ion because of the higher effective nuclear charge

When a negative ion is formed, one or more electrons are added to an atom, the effective nuclear charge is reduced and hence the electron cloud expands. Negative ions are bigger than the corresponding atoms.
(ii). Ionization energy- The ionization energy is the minimum amount of energy that an electron in a gaseous atom or ion has to absorb to come out of the influence of attracting force of the nucleus. It is also referred to as ionization potential. If energy is supplied to an atom, electrons may be promoted to a higher energy level. If sufficient energy is supplied the electron can be ionized giving positive ions. The energy required to remove the most loosely bound electron is the ionization energy.

Factors affecting ionization energy are size of the atom, charge on the nucleus, and screening effect of inner electron shells. In small atoms electrons are tightly held and in large ones they are loosely held

The first ionization energy is the amount of energy that is required to remove the first electron from a neutral atom. The energy needed to remove the second electron from the neutral atom is called the second ionization energy and so on. As one moves from left to right across a period in the modern periodic table, the ionization energy increases as the nuclear charge increases and the atomic size decreases. The decrease in the atomic size results in a more potent force of attraction between the electrons and the nucleus. However, suppose one moves down in a group. In that case, the ionization energy decreases as atomic size increases due to adding a valence shell, thereby diminishing the nucleus's attraction to electrons. The $2^{\text {nd }}$ ionization energy is always greater than the first and the third greater than the second and so on.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/7ef96b79-0db7-494d-80b3-f46f1a506ae0-07.jpg?height=657&width=1329&top_left_y=1110&top_left_x=62)
(iii). Electron affinity- The energy released when an electron is added to a neutral gaseous atom to form an anion is known as electron affinity. Trend-wise, as one progresses from left to right across a period, the electron affinity will increase as the nuclear charge increases and the atomic size decreases resulting in a more potent force of attraction of the nucleus and the added electron. However, suppose one moves down in a group. In that case, the electron affinity will decrease as atomic size increases due to adding a valence shell, thereby diminishing the nucleus's attraction to electrons. Although it may seem that fluorine should have the greatest electron affinity, its small size generates enough repulsion among the electrons, resulting in chlorine having the highest electron affinity in the halogen family. Usually only one electron is added to form uni-negative ion. This repels other electrons and energy is needed to add a second electron e.g. $\mathrm{O}^{2-}$
(iv). Electronegativity- The tendency of an atom in a molecule to attract the shared pair of electrons towards itself is known as electronegativity. It is a dimensionless property because it is only a tendency. The most commonly used scale to measure electronegativity was designed by Linus Pauling. The scale has been named the Pauling scale in his honour. According to this scale, fluorine is the most electronegative element, while cesium is the least electronegative element.
- Trend-wise, as one moves from left to right across a period in the modern periodic table, the electronegativity increases as the nuclear charge increases and the atomic size decreases.
- However, if one moves down in a group, the electronegativity decreases as atomic size increases due to the addition of a valence shell, thereby decreasing the atom's attraction to electrons. However, in group XIII (Boron Family), the electronegativity first decreases from boron to aluminium and then increases down the group.
- It is due to the fact that the atomic size increases as we move down the group, but at the same time the effective nuclear charge increases due to poor shielding of the inner d and f electrons. As a result, the force of attraction of the nucleus for the electrons increases and hence the electronegativity increases from aluminium to thalium.
- Small atoms attract electrons more than large ones while atoms with nearly filled shells will tend to have higher electronegativity. Covalent bonds are formed by elements with similar high electronegativity values while ionioc bonds are formed by elements with large electronegative differences
(v). Polarization (fajans rule)- For two ions $\mathrm{A}^{+}$and $\mathrm{B}^{-}$the positive ions attract the electrons on the negative ion and repel the nucleus thus polarizing or distorting the negative ion, if the polarization is small ionic bonds result if the degree of polarization is large electrons are drawn from the negative ion to the positive ion and appreciably covalent bonds result. Fajans rule states that covalent bonding is favoured by
- Small positive ions
- Large negative ions
- Large charge on either ion
(vi). Valency- The valency of an element is the number of electrons that must be lost or gained by an atom to obtain a stable electron configuration. In simple terms, it is the measure of the combining capacity of an element to form chemical compounds. Electrons found in the outermost shell are generally known as valence electrons; the number of valence electrons determines the valency of an atom. Trend-wise,
- while moving from left to right across a period, the number of valence electrons of elements increases and varies between 1 to 8 . But the valency of elements first increases from 1 to 4 , and then it decreases to zero as we reach the noble gases.
- However, as we move down in a group, the number of valence electrons does not change. Hence, all the elements of a particular group have the same valency.
- However, this periodic trend is sparsely followed for heavier elements, especially for the F block and the transition metals. These elements show variable valency as these elements have d-orbital as the penultimate orbital and sorbital as the outermost orbital. The energies of these ( $\mathrm{n}-1$ )d $\&$ ns orbitals are relatively close.
(vii). Metallic character- Metals are electropositive and have a tendency to loose electrons if supplied with energy. The stronger this tendency the more electropositive and the more metallic an element is. Electropositivity is really the opposite of electronegativity. Strong electropositive elements react with water and acid to form strong basic oxides and hydroxides and react with oxyacids to form stable salts such as carbonates, nitrates and sulphates. Weak electropositive elements are unaffected by water and are much less readily attacked by acid and form unstable carbonates.

Salts of strong electropositive metals have little tendency to hydrolyse and form oxysalts while those of weakly electropositive elements hydrolyse and may form oxysalts. Metallic properties generally increase down the groups, as decreasing attraction between the nuclei and outermost electrons causes these electrons to be more loosely bound and thus able to conduct heat and electricity. Across each period, from left to right, the increasing attraction between the nuclei and the outermost electrons causes the metallic character to decrease. In contrast, the nonmetallic character decreases down the groups and increases across the periods.
(viii). Effective nuclear charge- Since the positive nuclear charge is generally offset by the negative charge of the internal electrons in the electron shell inside the valence electrons, the nuclear charge that valence electrons feel is smaller than the integer charge, Ze for an atomic number Z. This reduction is expressed by the shielding constant $\sigma$, and the net nuclear charge is called the effective nuclear charge, Zeff e. Zeff $=Z-\sigma$ The effective nuclear charge varies with different electron orbitals and distances from the nucleus. The effective nuclear charge ( $Z$ effective or Zeff) is defined as the net positive charge pulling these electrons towards the nucleus. The stronger the pull on the outermost electrons (valence electrons) towards the nucleus, the higher the effective nuclear charge and decrease down the group due to shielding.

\section*{COVALENT BONDS}

A covalent bond results from the sharing of two electrons between the combining atoms. The atoms approach each other closely so that the overlapping and subsequent merger of two atomic orbitals, one from each atom

The presence of either (i) one unpaired electron in each orbital, (the electrons being of opposite spin) or (ii) a pair of electrons in one orbital, the other being empty, The latter constitutes a coordinate covalent bond
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/7ef96b79-0db7-494d-80b3-f46f1a506ae0-09.jpg?height=250&width=1076&top_left_y=1411&top_left_x=55)

The simplest covalent structure is found in the hydrogen molecule; this is described in the structure. The process of formation of a molecule is as follows
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/7ef96b79-0db7-494d-80b3-f46f1a506ae0-09.jpg?height=130&width=752&top_left_y=1838&top_left_x=59)

The bond formed by this type of overlap is called a sigma ( $\delta$ ) bond. In such bonding rotation of one atom, relative to the other about a line joining the two atoms does not alter the extent of overlap of the two orbitals thus free rotation is possible about a sigma bond. The corresponding stages for the formation of a single covalent bond in hydrogen fluoride as shown
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/7ef96b79-0db7-494d-80b3-f46f1a506ae0-09.jpg?height=366&width=880&top_left_y=2262&top_left_x=62)

The electronic structure of fluorine is $1 \mathrm{~S}^{2} 2 \mathrm{~S}^{2} 2 \mathrm{P}^{5}$ and the vacancy in the 2 Px orbital is filled by the hydrogen electron. Again a sigma ( $\delta$ ) bond is formed-
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/7ef96b79-0db7-494d-80b3-f46f1a506ae0-10.jpg?height=227&width=1181&top_left_y=197&top_left_x=53)

Only one lobe of the 2 p orbital overlaps the hydrogen 1S orbital. The other lobe may not be used for further overlapping since the 2 p orbitals has now become part of a molecular orbital, embracing both hydrogen and fluorine atoms. Unlike the hydrogen molecular orbitals, the molecular orbital for hydrogen fluoride is asymmetrical, Showing that the two electrons forming the bonds are more likely to be found near that to the fluorine atom. This is due to the fact that fluorine is the more electronegative atom. This brings about a slight separation of charge, leaving the hydrogen and the molecule slightly positive and the fluorine ends slightly negative. Thus, hydrogen fluoride is a polar molecule. Similar diagrams may be drawn for other halogen hydrides.

The bonding process in oxygen is a little more complicated. Oxygen has the configuration $1 s^{2} 2 s^{2} 2 p^{4}$ so, that there are two p orbitals which are slightly filled. Assuming the 2Py orbitals contains two electrons (shaded in the figure), a single covalent bond can be formed by the overlap of a Px orbitals. The orbitals merge to form a molecular orbital. Now that the oxygen atoms have been drawn close together by the formation of the sigma bond, a second type of overlap a side by side overlap of the $p$ orbitals occurs. The upper and the lower overlap taken together constitute a new type of single covalent bonds the pi $(\pi)$ bond and the Pi molecular orbital is split into two regions. On rotation of the oxygen atom, the Pz orbitals, are quickly twisted out of overlap showing that such rotation would break the bond.

Nitrogen has three singly filled orbitals and one sigma ( $\delta$ ) and two pi bonds are formed, giving rise to a triple bond in the nitrogen molecule

\section*{Hybridization of orbitals}

In chemistry, orbital hybridisation (or hybridization) is the concept of mixing atomic orbitals to form new hybrid orbitals (with different energies, shapes, etc., than the component atomic orbitals) suitable for the pairing of electrons to form chemical bonds in valence bond theory. Carbon $1 \mathrm{~S}^{2} 2 \mathrm{~S}^{2} 2 \mathrm{P}^{2}$ (ground state) have only two unpaired electron, yet the chemistry of carbon is characterized by its ability to form four electron pair bonds. Any theoretical explanation of this must also agree with the following facts
1. The four bonds are equal in strength.
2. The four bonds are symmetrical directed in space, when linking carbon to four identical atoms as in the methane and carbon tetrachloride molecule

Four unpaired electrons may be obtained if sufficient energy is absorbed to uncouple one of the 2s-electrons and excite to the 2P level (excited state). This process is called promotion

Should bond formation take place immediately after promotion four equal bonds would not be produced. To overcome this, the orbitals are now equalized, so that four new equivalent orbitals are produced, which then take part in bonding.

The symbol given to these four new orbitals indicate their origin. In this case, they are labeled $\mathrm{SP}^{3}$ hybrid orbitals and the equalization process is termed hybridization. The shape of an $\mathrm{SP}^{3}$ hybridized orbital is shown in figure and since they are four of these new orbitals, they are directed symmetrically in space, ie tetrahedral.

$\mathbf{S p}^{\mathbf{3}}$ hybridization- The carbon atom can use its two singly occupied p-type orbitals to form two covalent bonds with two hydrogen atoms, yielding the singlet methylene $\mathrm{CH}_{2}$, the simplest carbene. The carbon atom can also bond to four hydrogen atoms by an excitation (or promotion) of an electron from the doubly occupied 2s orbital to the empty 2p orbital, producing four singly occupied orbitals. In $\mathrm{CH}_{4}$, four $\mathrm{sp}^{3}$ hybrid orbitals are overlapped by hydrogen 1 s orbitals, yielding four $\underline{\sigma}$ (sigma) bonds (that is, four single covalent bonds) of equal length and strength.

Methane $\mathbf{C H}_{\mathbf{4}}$ : The hybridization of the carbon atom in methane is of $\mathrm{sp}^{3}$ type. A $\sigma$ bond is formed by the overlap of each $\mathrm{sp}^{3}$ orbital and the s orbital of H . Thus the shape of methane molecule is regular tetrahedron. Like methane, $\mathrm{CCl}_{4}$, $\mathrm{CHCl}_{3}, \mathrm{CH}_{2} \mathrm{Cl}_{2}, \mathrm{C}_{2} \mathrm{H}_{6}, \mathrm{C}_{2} \mathrm{H}_{5} \mathrm{OH}$, etc. In many other carbonic compounds where only single bonds are formed with carbon, the hybridization of carbon occurs in a similar manner also in silane $\mathrm{SiH}_{4}$
$\mathbf{S p}^{\mathbf{2}}$ hybridization- For example, ethene $\left(\mathrm{C}_{2} \mathrm{H}_{4}\right)$ has a double bond between the carbons. For this molecule, carbon $\mathrm{sp}^{2}$ hybridizes, because one $\pi(\mathrm{pi})$ bond is required for the double bond between the carbons and only three $\sigma$ bonds are formed per carbon atom. In $\mathrm{sp}^{2}$ hybridisation the 2 s orbital is mixed with only two of the three available 2 p orbitals, usually denoted $2 p_{x}$ and $2 p_{y}$. The third $2 p$ orbital ( $2 p_{z}$ ) remains unhybridised forming a total of three $s p^{2}$ orbitals with one remaining p orbital. In ethylene ( ethene) the two carbon atoms form $\mathrm{a} \sigma$ bond by overlapping one $\mathrm{sp}^{2}$ orbital from each carbon atom. The $\pi$ bond between the carbon atoms perpendicular to the molecular plane is formed by $2 \mathrm{p}-2 \mathrm{p}$ overlap. Each carbon atom forms covalent $\mathrm{C}-\mathrm{H}$ bonds with two hydrogens by $\mathrm{s}-\mathrm{sp}^{2}$ overlap, all with $120^{\circ}$ bond angles. The hydrogen-carbon bonds are all of equal strength and length, in agreement with experimental data.

e.g. ethylene, boron trifluoride,
$\mathbf{S P}_{\mathbf{1}}$ hybridization -The chemical bonding in compounds such as alkynes with triple bonds is explained by sp hybridization. In this model, the 2s orbital is mixed with only one of the three p orbitals, resulting in two sp orbitals and two remaining p orbitals ( $2 \mathrm{p}_{\mathrm{y}}, 2 \mathrm{p}_{\mathrm{z}}$ ) are not hybridized. The chemical bonding in acetylene (ethyne) ( $\mathrm{C}_{2} \mathrm{H}_{2}$ ) consists of sp-sp overlap between the two carbon atoms forming a $\sigma$ bond and two additional $\pi$ bonds formed by $\mathrm{p}-\mathrm{p}$ overlap. Each carbon also bonds to hydrogen in a $\sigma \mathrm{s}-\mathrm{sp}$ overlap at $180^{\circ}$ angles e.g. ethyne (acetylene), beryllium hydride,

Atoms of many elements have d -orbitals. Atoms of these elements can participate in the formation of d orbital bonds. Atoms of these elements can also participate in d-orbital hybridization.

Example: In $\left[\mathrm{NiCN}_{4}\right]^{2-}$, Ni atom is $\mathrm{dsp}^{2}$ hybridized and its shape is square planar. In $\mathrm{PCl}_{5}$, the P atom is $\mathrm{sp}^{3} \mathrm{~d}$ hybridized and its shape is trigonal bipyramidal. In $\mathrm{SF}_{6}$, the S atom is $\mathrm{sp}^{3} \mathrm{~d}^{2}$ hybridized and its shape is octahedral. In $\mathrm{IF}_{7}$, the I atom is $\mathrm{sp}^{3} \mathrm{~d}^{3}$ hybridized and has a pentagonal bipyramidal shape.

Delocalized orbitals- A covalent bond between two atoms of hydrogen was formed by the overlapping of two atomic orbitals with the subsequent formation of molecular orbitals, the shape of the molecular orbital shown that the two bonding electrons are most likely to be found close to or individual between the two hydrogen planes the molecular orbital which is confined to linking to atoms is known as the localized orbitals.

In the case of benzene, a molecular orbital is formed which envelops six atoms and this is known as a delocalized molecular orbital system. Each carbon atom in benzene forms three sigma bonds, one with a hydrogen atom and one with each of the two neighboring carbon atoms in the ring.

\section*{Lewis Electron Dot Structures}

Electron dot structures or Lewis dot formula can be drawn if the molecular formula of the compound is known. It defines the nature of bond and position of atoms of the molecule which are connected in the molecule. The representation of molecules in Lewis electron dot structure or just a Lewis structure is in honour of the American chemist Gilbert Newton Lewis. Lewis dot structures also called electron dot structures are diagrams that describe the chemical bonding between atoms in a molecule. They also display the total number of lone pairs present in each of the
atoms that constitute the molecule. Lewis dot structures are commonly referred to as electron dot structures or Lewis structures. Lewis defined a base as an electron pair donor and an acid as an electron pair acceptor.

\section*{Lewis Dot Structure}

Lewis dot structures reflect the electronic structures of the elements, including how the electrons are paired. Lewis structures are a useful way to summarize certain information about bonding. In Lewis dot structures each dot represents an electron. A pair of dots between chemical symbols for atoms represents a bond.A Lewis Electron Dot Formula comprises one dot for every valence electron and an element's symbol. Make use of the $\boldsymbol{N}-\boldsymbol{A}=\boldsymbol{S}$ equation to get to know the number of bonds
- The sum of the number of valence electrons is equal to N
- The number of valence electrons in electron pot is A.
- The number of electrons shared in the molecule equals S
- Distribute the electrons from electron pot to account for the bonds
- Distribute the rest of the electrons

How to Draw Lewis Structures- A Lewis electron dot structure describes the bonding atoms, the number of bonds in the molecule, and the lone pairs left in the bonding atoms. The steps that must be followed while drawing a Lewis structure are listed below
- First, the total number of valence electrons present in the molecule is calculated by adding the individual valencies of each atom.
- If the molecule is an anion, extra electrons (number of electrons added $=$ the magnitude of negative charge) are added to the Lewis dot structure.
- When cationic molecules are considered, electrons are subtracted from the total count in order to make up for the positive charge.
- The least electronegative atom is made the central atom of the molecule or ion.
- The atoms are now connected via single bonds.
- Now, the lone pairs of electrons are assigned to each atom belonging to the molecule. Commonly, the lone pairs are assigned to the most electronegative atoms first.
- Once the lone pairs are assigned, if every atom does not have an octet configuration, a double or triple bond must be drawn to satisfy the octet valency of each atom.
- If required, a lone pair can be converted into a bond pair in order to satisfy the octet rule for two atoms.

It is important to note that only the valence electrons are considered while drawing Lewis dot structures and the electrons that do not belong to the outermost shell are ignored.

\section*{Lewis Structure Examples}

The Lewis electron dot structures of a few molecules are illustrated in this subsection.
1. Lewis Structure of $\mathbf{C O}_{\mathbf{2}}$-The central atom of this molecule is carbon. Oxygen contains $\mathbf{6}$ valence electrons which form 2 lone pairs. Since it is bonded to only one carbon atom, it must form a double bond. Carbon contains four valence electrons, resulting in zero lone pairs. Therefore, it is doubly bonded to each oxygen atom.
<smiles>O=CO</smiles>
2. Lewis Structure of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ _An atom of oxygen contains $\mathbf{6}$ electrons in the valence shell. Four of the valence electrons exist in lone pairs, implying that the oxygen atom must participate in two single bonds or one double bond in order to
attain an octet configuration. Since there are only two oxygen atoms in an $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ molecule, the atoms form a double bond resulting in the following Lewis electron dot structure.
<smiles>O</smiles>
3. Lewis Structure of CO (Carbon Monoxide)- A carbon monoxide molecule consists of one carbon atom and one oxygen atom. The carbon atom requires four electrons to obtain octet configuration whereas the oxygen atom requires two. Therefore, the valency is satisfied via the donation of a lone pair of electrons for bonding by the oxygen atom. The resulting Lewis electron dot structure displays a triple bond connecting a carbon and an oxygen atom, each holding a lone pair of electrons.

Thus, the concepts related to Lewis dot structures are discussed briefly in this article along with a few examples. Lewis structures are important for the prediction of geometry, polarity and reactivity of (in)organic compounds, Lewis structures are actually very important. The Lewis structure is drawn for individual atoms by putting a dot for each available valence electron around the atom.

\section*{Molecular orbital method}

United atom approach- For example, a simple homonuclear diatomic molecule, the two nuclei A and B coalesce. These united atoms can be treated like any other atom and its electron can be allocated to appropriate united atomic orbitals and the electron charged clouds will be spread out about axis connecting the two nuclei.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/7ef96b79-0db7-494d-80b3-f46f1a506ae0-17.jpg?height=499&width=1015&top_left_y=827&top_left_x=55)

When atomic orbitals interact, the resulting molecular orbital can be of three types: bonding, antibonding, or nonbonding.

\section*{Bonding Molecular orbitals:}
- Bonding interactions between atomic orbitals are constructive (in-phase) interactions.
- Bonding Molecular orbitals are lower in energy than the atomic orbitals that combine to produce them.
- Those levels or molecular orbitals corresponding to a decrease in energy as the atoms get closer together i.e. related to lines sloping downwards from right to left (namely, the $(\mathrm{K}) \mathrm{z} \delta, \mathrm{z} \delta, \mathrm{w} \pi \ldots . . \mathrm{etc}$. are called the bonding molecular orbitals.

\section*{Antibonding Molecular orbitals:}
- Antibonding interactions between atomic orbitals are destructive (out-of-phase) interactions, with a nodal plane where the wave function of the antibonding orbital is zero between the two interacting atoms
- Antibonding Molecular orbitals are higher in energy than the atomic orbitals that combine to produce them.
- Those corresponding to an increase in energy as the inter nuclear distance decreases and so related to lines sloping upwards from right to left e.g. $(\mathrm{k}) \mathrm{y} \delta, \mathrm{y} \delta, \mathrm{v} \pi \ldots$. etc are called antibonding molecular orbitals

\section*{Nonbonding Molecular orbitals:}
- Nonbonding Molecular orbitals are the result of no interaction between atomic orbitals because of lack of compatible symmetries.
- Nonbonding Molecular orbitals will have the same energy as the atomic orbitals of one of the atoms in the molecule.

In the Lewis electron structures the number of electron pairs holding two atoms together was called the bond order. Bond length is approximately equal to the average distance between the nuclei of two bonded atoms. More will be the bond order more will be the pull between electrons of two atoms and less will be the bond length.
bond order $=\frac{\text { bonding electrons }- \text { antibonding electrons }}{2}$
Molecular orbital diagram explains the chemical bonding in the molecules in terms of molecular orbital theory. In a molecular orbital diagram, the diagram of molecular orbital energy levels is shown as horizontal lines. Degenerate orbitals (orbitals having the same energy) are shown side by side in these diagrams. Electrons are filled according to the Pauli Exclusion Principle.

\section*{Linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO)}

The molecular wave function $\psi_{+}\left(\psi_{\mathrm{g}}\right)$ corresponds to build up of electron density in regions between the nuclei and a more effective screening of one nucleus from the other. Hence, decreasing in the energy of the system. A wave function has domains of positive and negative amplitude called lobes. The overlapping positive lobes or negative lobes of the wave functions of atoms in a molecule amplify each other to form a bond, but the positive and negative lobes cancel each other forming no bond. By comparison with the separated atoms so, that the bond has been formed, which is described by the bonding molecular orbitals $\psi+$, overlapping of the two atomic orbitals represented by $\phi \mathrm{A}$ and $\phi \mathrm{B}$. $\phi \mathrm{A}$ shows that $\phi \mathrm{A}$ and $\phi \mathrm{B}$ will combine effectively if
a) They will present states of similar energy
b) They overlap to a considerable extent and
c) They have the same symmetry with respect to the molecular axis A-B.

The wave function $\psi-\left(\psi_{u}\right)$ is called antibonding molecular orbitals since, to present a state of higher energy in which the electrons are displaced from the inter nuclear region. The energy is greater than either atomic orbitals, should an electron finds itself in an antibonding orbital, it will return if possible to a more stable atomic orbital of lower energy. The presence of electrons in antibonding orbitals produces a factor opposing formation of a stable molecule.

Electrons occupy the molecular orbitals in order of lowest to highest energy levels. The highest occupied molecular orbital is called the HOMO and the lowest unoccupied one the LUMO. Ken'ichi Fukui ( 1981 Nobel prize) named these orbitals frontier orbitals. When the wave functions of two atoms are set to $\varphi \mathrm{A}$ and $\varphi \mathrm{B}$, a molecular orbital is a linear combination of the atomic orbitals (LCAO) expressed as $\psi=\mathrm{CA} \varphi \mathrm{A}+\mathrm{CB} \varphi \mathrm{B}$ Only the atomic orbitals of the valence electron shell are used in the simplest molecular orbital method. All the levels below the HOMO are occupied by electrons and the levels above the LUMO are empty. Two or more molecular orbitals of equal energy are called degenerate orbitals. A sigma orbital has rotation symmetry around the bond axis, and a pi orbital has a nodal plane.

Therefore, sigma bonds are formed by the overlap of $\mathrm{s}-\mathrm{s}, \mathrm{p}-\mathrm{p}, \mathrm{s}-\mathrm{d}, \mathrm{p}-\mathrm{d}$, and $\mathrm{d}-\mathrm{d}$ orbitals and pi bonds the overlap of $\mathrm{p}-\mathrm{p}$, $\mathrm{p}-\mathrm{d}$, and d-d orbitals

The wave function $\psi^{+}$and $\psi$ - are usually written as $\psi \mathrm{g}$ and $\psi \mathrm{u}$ in molecular orbital theory of Heteronuclear diatomic molecules. The superscript $g$ and $u$ as abbreviated by German words, gerade (even) and ungerade (odd).
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/7ef96b79-0db7-494d-80b3-f46f1a506ae0-19.jpg?height=1151&width=1739&top_left_y=921&top_left_x=55)

The energies of the bonds are as follows
$$\sigma 1 s<\sigma^{*} 1 s<\sigma 2 s<\sigma^{*} 2 s<\sigma 2 p<\pi_{y} 2 p=\pi_{z} 2 p<\pi_{y}{ }^{*} 2 p=\pi_{z} * 2 p<\sigma^{*} 2 p$$

$$z \sigma<y \sigma<x \sigma<w \pi<v \pi<u \sigma \quad \text { or } 1 \sigma_{\mathrm{g}}^{2} 1 \sigma_{\mathrm{u}}^{2} 2 \sigma_{\mathrm{g}}^{2} 2 \sigma_{\mathrm{u}}^{2} 1 \pi_{\mathrm{u}}^{4} 3 \sigma_{\mathrm{g}}^{2}$$

A similar arrangement for $\delta 3 \mathrm{~S}$ and $\delta^{*} 3 \mathrm{p}$ molecular orbitals

${ }_{\mathrm{H}_{2}} \mathrm{H}_{2}\left[(\sigma 1 s)^{2}\right]$.
$\mathrm{He}_{2} \mathrm{He}\left(1 s^{2}\right)+\mathrm{He}\left(1 s^{2}\right) \rightarrow \mathrm{He}_{2}\left[(\sigma 1 s)^{2}\left(\sigma^{*} 1 s\right)^{2}\right]$.
$\mathrm{He}_{2}{ }^{+} \mathrm{He}\left(1 s^{2}\right)+\mathrm{He}^{+}(1 s) \rightarrow \mathrm{He}_{2}+\left[(\sigma 1 s)^{2}(\sigma * 1 s)\right]$.
The orbital energy levels for the molecules from $\mathrm{Li}_{2}$ to $\mathrm{N}_{2}$ are ordered as $1 \sigma \mathrm{~g}<1 \sigma \mathrm{u}<1 \pi \mathrm{u}<2 \sigma \mathrm{~g}<1 \pi \mathrm{~g}<2 \sigma \mathrm{u}$ and electrons occupy the levels sequentially from the bottom. The example of an $\mathrm{N}_{2}$ molecule with ten valence electrons is shown. Since the ordering of orbitals is somewhat different in $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{F}_{2}$, in which the $2 \sigma \mathrm{~g}$ orbital comes under that of $1 \pi \mathrm{u}$, the molecular orbital of the oxygen molecule, $\mathrm{O}_{2}$,. The 11th and 12th electrons among the 12 valence electrons occupy the doubly degenerate $1 \pi \mathrm{~g}$ orbital in the ground state and they have parallel spins under Hund's rule and hence an oxygen molecule has two unpaired electrons.
$\mathrm{Li}_{2}$
$$2 \operatorname{Li}\left(1 s^{2} 2 s\right) \rightarrow \operatorname{Li}_{2}\left[(\sigma 1 s)^{2}\left(\sigma^{*} 1 s\right)^{2}(\sigma 2 s)^{2}\right]$$
$\begin{array}{ll}\underset{\text { or }}{2 \mathrm{~N}\left(1 s^{2} 2 s^{2} 2 p^{3}\right)} \rightarrow & \mathrm{N}_{2}\left[K K(\sigma 2 s)^{2}\left(\sigma^{* 2} 2\right)^{2}\left(\pi_{y} 2 p=\pi_{z} 2 p\right)^{4}(\sigma 2 p)^{2}\right] \\ \mathrm{N}_{2} & \mathrm{~N}_{2}\left[K K(z \sigma)^{2}(y \sigma)^{2}(w \pi)^{4}(x \sigma)^{2}\right]\end{array}$

\section*{writing $K K$ in place of $(\sigma 1 s)^{2}\left(\sigma^{*} 1 s\right)^{2}$,}

With nitrogen, we see the two molecular orbitals mixing and the energy repulsion. This is the reasoning for the rearrangement from a more familiar diagram. Notice how the $\sigma$ from the $2 p$ behaves more non-bonding like due to mixing, same with the $2 \mathrm{~s} \sigma$. This also causes a large jump in energy in the $2 \mathrm{p} \sigma^{*}$ orbital. The bond order of diatomic nitrogen is three, and it is a diamagnetic molecule.

The bond order for dinitrogen ( $1 \sigma_{\mathrm{g}}{ }^{2} 1 \sigma_{\mathrm{u}}{ }^{2} 2 \sigma_{\mathrm{g}}{ }^{2} 2 \sigma_{\mathrm{u}}{ }^{2} 1 \pi_{\mathrm{u}}{ }^{4} 3 \sigma_{\mathrm{g}}{ }^{2}$ ) is three because two electrons are now also added in the $3 \sigma$ MO. The MO diagram correlates with the experimental photoelectron spectrum for nitrogen. The $1 \sigma$ electrons can be matched to a peak at 410 eV (broad), the $2 \sigma_{\mathrm{g}}$ electrons at 37 eV (broad), the $2 \sigma_{\mathrm{u}}$ electrons at 19 eV (doublet), the $1 \pi_{\mathrm{u}}{ }^{4}$ electrons at 17 eV (multiplets), and finally the $3 \sigma_{\mathrm{g}}{ }^{2}$ at 15.5 eV (sharp).

Chlorine and bromine have similar structure with fluorine which chlorine have inner K and L and bromine inner $\mathrm{K}, \mathrm{L}$, and M shells full. The molecule $\mathrm{He}_{2}$ is not formed under normal conditions so as we saw with $\mathrm{He}_{2}$ the number of bonding and antibonding electrons are equal. For similar reasons the other noble gases do not form diatomic molecules.

\section*{Heteronuclear diatomic molecules}

The bonding between hydrogen and fluorine atoms results almost entirely from the $\mathrm{H}(1 \mathrm{~S})$ and $\mathrm{F}\left(2 \mathrm{p}_{\mathrm{x}}\right)$ electrons and other electrons of fluorine remain in atomic orbitals (non-bonding orbitals) So

Hydrogen fluoride is an example of a heteronuclear molecule. It is slightly different in that the $\pi$ orbital is non-bonding, as well as the 2so. From the hydrogen, its valence 1s electron interacts with the 2p electrons of fluorine. This molecule is diamagnetic and has a bond order of one.

For example, five molecular orbitals in hydrogen fluoride, HF , are formed from the 1s orbital of hydrogen and the 2s and $2 p$ orbitals of fluorine. The bonding $1 \sigma$ orbital has the $2 s$ character of fluorine, and the antibonding $3 \sigma$ orbital the $1 s$ character of hydrogen. Since hydrogen has only one 1 s orbital, the overlap with the $2 p$ orbital of fluorine with $\pi$ character is not effective, and the fluorine 2 p orbital becomes a nonbonding orbital. Since HF has eight valence electrons, this nonbonding orbital is the HOMO.

As an illustration of these general points, consider a simple heteronuclear diatomic molecule, HF . The five valence orbitals available for molecular orbital formation are the 1 s orbital of H and the 2 s and 2 p orbitals of F ; there are $1+7$
$=8$ valence electrons to accommodate in the five molecular orbitals that can be constructed from the five basis orbitals. The $\sigma$ orbitals of HF can be constructed by allowing an H1s orbital to overlap with the F2s and F2p z orbitals (Z being the inter nuclear axis). These three atomic orbitals combine to give three $\sigma$ molecular orbitals. This procedure leaves the F2p x and F2p y orbitals unaffected as they have $\pi$ symmetry and there is no valence H orbital of that symmetry. These $\pi$ orbitals are therefore examples of the nonbonding orbitals mentioned earlier, and are molecular orbitals confined to a single atom. Note that, because there is no center of inversion in a heteronuclear diatomic molecule, we do not use the g,u classification for its molecular orbitals. The $1 \sigma$ bonding orbital is predominantly F2s in character as the energy difference between it and the H1s orbital is large. It is, therefore, confined mainly to the F atom and essentially nonbonding. The $2 \sigma$ orbital is more bonding than the $1 \sigma$ orbital and has both H1s and F2p character. The $3 \sigma$ orbital is antibonding, and principally H1s in character: the 1s orbital has a relatively high energy (compared with the fluorine orbitals) and hence contributes predominantly to the high-energy antibonding molecular orbital. Two of the eight valence electrons enter the $2 \sigma$ orbital, forming a bond between the two atoms. Six more enter the $1 \sigma$ and $1 \pi$ orbitals; these two orbitals are largely nonbonding and confined mainly to the F atom. This is consistent with the conventional model of three lone pairs on the fluorine atom. All the electrons are now accommodated, so the configuration of the molecule is $1 \sigma^{2} 2 \sigma^{2} 1 \pi^{4}$. One important feature to note is that all the electrons occupy orbitals that are predominantly on the F atom. It follows that we can expect the HF molecule to be polar, with a partial negative charge on the F atom, which is found experimentally

$\mathbf{C O}$ has an identical configuration to nitrogen molecule and NO has one additional electron placed in antibonding $\mathrm{v} \pi$ orbital electron, it is paramagnetic and bonding weaker than in nitrogen. NO is stable because the electron placed in a molecular orbital instead of an atomic orbitals. In carbon monoxide, CO, carbon and oxygen have 2 s and 2 p orbitals resulting in both sigma and pi bonds, and a triple bond is formed between the atoms. Although 8 molecular orbitals in this case are qualitatively the same as those of the isolectronic nitrogen molecule N 2 and 10 electrons occupy the orbital up to $3 \sigma$, the energy level of each orbital differs from that of the nitrogen molecule. The bonding $1 \sigma$ orbital has the 2 s character of oxygen because of its larger electronegativity, and the bonding $1 \pi$ orbital also has the 2 p character of oxygen. The antibonding $2 \pi$ and $4 \sigma$ orbitals have the $2 p$ character of carbon

O atomic orbitals

The bond order between atoms is a half of the number of electrons in the bonding orbitals minus those of the antibonding orbitals. For example, in N 2 or CO , it is equal to $1 / 2(8-2)=3$ and is consistent with the Lewis structure.

So, extension of bonding for $\mathrm{N}_{2}$ to $\mathrm{NO}, \mathrm{CO}$ have different atomic number i.e. as we go from C to N to O energies of analogous atomic orbitals are reduced because of increasing attraction to the nucleus. So, energy of oxygen, 2s orbitals will be lower and the bonding $\mathrm{w} \pi$ molecular orbitals are now lower in energy than bonding $\mathrm{x} \delta$ orbitals. The carbon and oxygen atomic orbitals no longer contribute equally to the molecular orbitals and coefficient of oxygen atomic orbitals being larger and electron concentrated towards oxygen atom

There is a strong resemblance between the elements of subgroup $\mathrm{A}(\mathrm{K}, \mathrm{Rb}, \mathrm{Cs}, \mathrm{Fr})$ and those of the head group elements (Li, Na), but lithium shows some likeness to Mg a group 2 element. Flame test are

\begin{tabular}{lllll} 
Li & Na & K & Rb & Cs \\
Crimson & Yellow & Red to violet & Violet & Blue
\end{tabular}

\section*{Reaction with water}
illustrates this trend:

\begin{tabular}{lllll}
Li & Na & K & Rb & Cs \\
gently & vigorously & vigorously with ignition & explosively & explosively
\end{tabular}

In the case of Group 1 and Li the following differences can be noted: Lithium has properties similar to magnesium.
- Lithium can exhibit a high degree of covalent character in its bonding. This covalent character is due to the high polarizing power of the $\mathrm{Li}^{+}$ion associated with high charge density.
- Lithium forms the normal oxide when burnt in oxygen, whereas other Group 1 elements form peroxides or superoxides.
- Lithium is the only alkali metal to form a nitride, $\mathrm{Li}_{3} \mathrm{~N}$, when heated in nitrogen, and a carbide, $\mathrm{Li}_{2} \mathrm{C}_{2}$, when heated with graphite.
- Some lithium salts such as the carbonate, phosphate, and fluoride have very low solubilities in water. Other lithium salts crystallize as hydrates or are hygroscopic.
- Lithium forms many stable organometallic compounds.
- Lithium nitrate decomposes directly to the oxide, whereas the other alkali metals initially form nitrites, $\mathrm{MNO}_{2}$.
- Lithium hydride is stable to heating to $900^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, whereas the other hydrides decompose on heating above $400^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.

Lithium's very low molar mass, which also makes it the least dense metal ( $0.53 \mathrm{gcm}^{-3}$ ), leads to applications where low weight is important. Examples include rechargeable batteries ( $\mathrm{LiCoO}_{2}, \mathrm{LiFePO}_{4}, \mathrm{LiC}_{6}$ ) and systems for hydrogen storage such as lithium metal hydrides, lithium borohydrides, and lithium amides and imides

\section*{General characteristics}
- They are metals, with electropositive character
- Hydroxides are strong bases,
- Forms salt with strong acids, not hydrolyzed
- Carbonates stable to heat
- Bicarbonate, obtainable in solid form
- Nitrates fairly stable to heat, evolve oxygen on strong heating
- Complexes are rarely formed.
- They are electro positive and have low valency of 1 , they lose 1 electrons to form +1 ion
- They are electropositive and have little tendency to share electrons and don't form covalent bonds except lithium.
- They do not form complex ions, but ions are hydrated in aqueous solution and sometimes crystals,
- Alkali metals ions are colorless and any color comes from the anion.
- It is easier to obtain potassium salts in higher state of purity than those of sodium so frequent use of potassium salts in analytical work. For example, potassium permanganate potassium iodide

\section*{Periodic Changes down the group}

Ionization energy decreases hence,
a) Electro positive character increases
b) Metal becomes more reactive

Ionic size increase hence,
- Hydroxides become stronger bases.
- Salt have decreasing tendency to be hydrated and are often more soluble in water
- Carbonates become more stable to heat
- polyhalides become more stable

Relative ion sizes

Elements on the left side of periodic table and are reactive and electropositive giving strong basic oxide,

\section*{Sodium (Na)}

Occurrence- Sodium does not occur free and there are a few natural occurring compounds some are found in large quantities e.g. sodium chloride NaCl , sodium nitrate $\mathrm{NaNO}_{3}$, (Chilesalt petre), sodium sesquicarbonate $\mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$. $\mathrm{NaHCO}_{3} .2 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$, sodium aluminum fluoride $\mathrm{Na}_{3} \mathrm{AlF}_{6}$.

Industrial preparation- Almost all of it is made by electrolysis of fused sodium chloride using down cell. The graphite anode is cylindrical and is surrounded by the steel gauze diaphragm and concentric cylindrical cathodes (also of steel). Electrolyte is a mixture of sodium chloride and calcium chloride. The latter is added to reduce the melting point of sodium chloride to approximately $500^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ (some calcium is therefore liberated with the sodium), the gap between anode and cathode is kept as small as possible to reduce resistance. The heat evolved by current maintains temperature of the cell. Chlorine is set free at the anode surface rises into the nickel core and is collected. Sodium liberated at the cathode is prevented by the diaphragm from passing into anode region. The molten sodium collects under the circular hood and rises up the pipe being assisted if necessary, by the paddle rod. The calcium being almost immiscible with sodium and much denser can readily separate from molten sodium. The graphite anode wears away and must be renewed from time to time.

\section*{Physical properties}
- Sodium is a soft silvery metal melting point $97.5^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, boiling point $880^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. Vaporizing to give a violet mono atomic gas.
- It is readily molded and extruded into wire form (ductile). This is used to dry organic solvents such as ether and benzene with which it does not react chemically.

\section*{Chemical properties}
- Sodium is rapidly tarnishes in moist air giving first film of the monoxide. This reacts with moisture to give the hydroxide with which atmospheric carbon dioxide is converted slowly to the carbonate. So, sodium must be kept in air tight vessels or under paraffin oil, not under water.
- Sodium burns in air with a familiar bright yellow flame giving with insufficient air the monoxide andwith excess air or oxygen the peroxide
- Sodium combines on heating with most elements eg with halogens it gives halides, with phosphorus it gives a phosphide with sulfur forms a sulfide, (with excess sulfur a polysulfide)
- Heating sodium in a stream of hydrogen produces sodium hydride. If sodium is heated with the chloride or oxides of less electropositive metals, these are often reduced to the metal

\section*{- $\mathrm{AlCl}_{3}+3 \mathrm{Na} \longrightarrow 3 \mathrm{NaCl}+\mathrm{Al}$}
- Sodium floats on water but reacts with it immediately to give sodium hydroxide, which defaults and hydrogen
$$2 \mathrm{Na}+2 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} \longrightarrow 2 \mathrm{Na}^{+}+2 \mathrm{OH}^{-}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \uparrow$$
- The reaction is strongly exothermic but the hydrogen is not ignited unless movement of the sodium over the surface is prevented. Sodium dissolves much more quietly in ethyl alcohol giving sodium ethoxide

\section*{$2 \mathrm{Na}+2 \mathrm{C}_{2} \mathrm{H}_{5} \mathrm{OH} \longrightarrow 2 \mathrm{NaOC}_{2} \mathrm{H}_{5}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \uparrow$}
- This is a process of preparing hydrogen and is also a safe and useful way of getting rid of excess sodium from other reactions. Sodium dissolved in liquid ammonia to give a deep blue solution like ink in appearance (in liquid ammonia sodium ionizes as follows; $\mathrm{Na} \rightarrow \mathrm{Na}^{+}+\mathrm{e}^{-}$the electrons produced associated in some way with ammonia to give a deep blue solution. Sodium in liquid ammonia is an excellent reducing agent and it reduces many metallic salts to metals.
- If this solution is kept for some time, the color disappears and sodium amide or sodamide is formed, hydrogen being evolved.

\section*{. $2 \mathrm{Na}+2 \mathrm{NH}_{3} \longrightarrow 2 \mathrm{NaNH}_{2} \downarrow+\mathrm{H}_{2} \uparrow$}
- The formation of sodamide in this way occurs rapidly in presence of a catalyst e.g. crystals of a ferric salt,

\section*{Users of sodium}
- Much sodium used to form a lead/sodium alloy to prepare lead Tetra ethyl, a common anti knocking additive to petrol.
- Sodium used to make oxides and peroxides. The latter is an intermediate in the preparation of peroxy salts used to prepare sodium cyanide used in gold extraction and as a reducing agent used particularly in organic chemistry, often used in the form of a dispersion, fine particles suspended in an inert liquid.
- It's also used in final storage of titanium extraction to reduce the chloride
- sodium used in cooling both, low melting point and high thermal conductivity making liquid sodium useful for this hence, it's used to cool fuel in nuclear energy reactors, i.e. to transfer heat from the reactor to a boiler in which steam is raised
- Sodium can be sealed into the stem and head of aircraft engine valves and molten sodium helps to dissipate heat from valve heads.

\section*{Compounds of sodium}

Sodium hydrideNaH- It is an ionic compound. It can be prepared by direct combination of the element or by heating sodium monoxide to $200^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ in a current of hydrogen,

\section*{$\mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{O}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \longrightarrow \mathrm{NaOH}+\mathrm{NaH}$}

The sodium hydride sublimes in the cooler part of the tube, sodium hydride reacts very vigorously with water
$$\mathrm{NaH}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} \longrightarrow \mathrm{NaOH}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \uparrow$$

Sodium monoxide $\mathbf{N a}_{\mathbf{2}} \mathbf{O}$-It is ionic, it is best prepared by heating sodium in a limited amount of oxygen and then distilled off the excess sodium in vacuo
$$4 \mathrm{Na}+\mathrm{O}_{2} \longrightarrow 2 \mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{O}$$

It results as a normal basic oxide, reacting violently with acid to give salts.

Sodium peroxide $\mathbf{N a}_{2} \mathbf{O}_{2}$ The peroxide is composed of ions $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $[\mathrm{O}-\mathrm{O}]^{2-}$ as its name a salt of hydrogen peroxide. It is made commercially by passing dry air free from carbon dioxide through a tube along which moves trucks carrying trays of sodium against the air stream. The reaction is exothermic
$$2 \mathrm{Na}+\mathrm{O}_{2} \longrightarrow \mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{2}+120 \mathrm{kcal}$$

Once started it maintains a temperature of about $300^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. Sodium peroxide is a pale yellow solid. It reacts with water at ordinary temperature to give NaOH and $\mathrm{O}_{2}$
$$2 \mathrm{O}_{2}^{2-}+2 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} \longrightarrow 4 \mathrm{OH}^{-}+\mathrm{O}_{2} \uparrow$$

With ice cold water however Hydrogen peroxide is formed by hydrolysis indicating that hydrogen peroxide is a weak acid
$$\mathrm{O}_{2}^{2-}+2 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} \rightarrow 2 \mathrm{OH}^{-}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{2}$$

With $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ sodium carbonate and $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ are formed
$$\begin{aligned}
2 \mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{2} & +2 \mathrm{CO}_{2} \longrightarrow 2 \mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}+\mathrm{O}_{2} \\
2 \mathrm{O}_{2}{ }^{2-}+2 \mathrm{CO}_{2} & -2 \mathrm{CO}_{3}^{2-}+\mathrm{O}_{2}
\end{aligned}$$

Uses
- Is a useful and effective oxidizing agent. In solution it is used in qualitative and quantitative analysis to oxidize chromium salts containing $\mathrm{Cr}^{3+}$ to chromate ( $\mathrm{CrO}_{4}{ }^{2-}$ ).
- The solid will ignite paper or sugar is these are slightly moist since it is most readily decomposed on heating. It may also be used in the fused state to oxidize metals (except nickel Hence, it is heated in a nickel crucible).

Sodium hydroxide, caustic soda (NaOH)- It is manufactured either by (a) Gossage (lime soda) process or b) electronically. Gossage process- The reaction is between sodium carbonate solution and the suspension of slaked lime
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/7ef96b79-0db7-494d-80b3-f46f1a506ae0-27.jpg?height=164&width=1533&top_left_y=1600&top_left_x=79)

The position of equilibrium is determined by the solubility product k 1 and k 2 of the two compounds and since is the same for both compounds.

zurici
    $\mathbb{K}_{s}=\left[\mathrm{Cs}^{2+} 1\left[\mathrm{CO}_{3}{ }^{2-}\right]\right.$
```

mmd since $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]$ is the same for both compounds:
$$\begin{aligned}
& \frac{[O H-]^{2}}{\left[C O s^{2}\right]}=\frac{K_{1}}{K 2}=K \\
& \text { or } \quad \frac{[O H-]_{1}}{\left[C O s^{2}\right]}=\frac{K}{[O H-]}
\end{aligned}$$
- In theory, it is desirable to keep hydroxide ion concentration as low as possible in order to effect a high conversion to NaOH . In practice, economic considerations require that the hydroxide ion concentration be maintained at a reasonable level.
- Excess lime is therefore added as a suspension (milk lime) to warm sodium carbonate solution
- A sludge of calcium carbonate and hydroxide is formed at the bottom of the iron tank in which action is carried out.
- The solution is filtered off and evaporated. Sodium carbonate (which is sparingly soluble in NaOH due to common ion effect) crystallizes out and complete evaporation by heating, then yields NaOH in fused state which is cast into sticks of pellets. Some $\mathrm{NaCO}_{3}$ is lost as sludge in the form of the sparingly soluble double carbonate

Electrolysis- from aqueous sodium chloride, chlorine is equally important product but electrolysis of sodium sulfate (by product of artificial silk industry) has been carried out on industrial scale in Germany . To obtain NaOH, anode and cathode must be either separated by a diaphragm to avoid mixing of products (diaphragm cell) or cathode may be of mercury, (Mercury cell) giving sodium amalgam (amalgam is an alloy of mercury with other metals) except iron, cobalt, nickel,

The hooker diaphragm cell- The anodes are rectangular slabs of graphite. Embedded in a lead base, the cathode is a double walled box, closed at the top and base except for cavities surrounding the anodes finger like projection extend between the anode as shown.

The fingers are perforated and coated with a thin layer of asbestos fiber (deposited by suction), which acts as a diaphragm separating anode and cathode products. When the cell is started, brine is poured in and made to flow into the cavities around the anode. The box is filled with caustic soda solution
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/7ef96b79-0db7-494d-80b3-f46f1a506ae0-28.jpg?height=542&width=1380&top_left_y=962&top_left_x=105)
- When current is turned on sodium and hydrogen ions move into the fingers of the box through diaphragm
- Hydrogen ions discharged preferentially and give hydrogen which is removed from the box. chlorine ions move towards anode and form chlorine which rise up to the top of the cell.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/7ef96b79-0db7-494d-80b3-f46f1a506ae0-28.jpg?height=400&width=1380&top_left_y=1738&top_left_x=60)
- Hydroxyl ions also tend to move towards anodes. But chlorine ions are discharged in preference due to their high concentration in strong brine
- The brine in the cell is maintained at a higher level than the liquid cathode box so that the flow of liquid into the latter balances the hydroxyl ions movement away from it.
- The liquid in cathode compartment is therefore enriched in sodium hydroxide, but will also contain some NaCl because of its lower level.
- caustic soda is run off (water enters to replace it) evaporated when NaCl crystallizes out and then evaporated completely to give NaOH

Kellner-Solvary cell- saturated brine is electrolyzed using a carbon anode and mercury cathode. At the cathode, sodium is liberated and dissolves to form sodium amalgam which is withdrawn from the cell and treated with water to give caustic soda and hydrogen

\end{figure}

Two factors determined that sodium is liberated instead of hydrogen as expected at the cathode,
- Very high over potential of hydrogen at a Mercury cathode raises its discharge potential very considerably, but this does not bring the figure up to that for the discharge of pure solid sodium
- Because sodium dissolves in the mercury to give a dilute solution the electrode potential of such a dilute amalgam is much less than that of solid $\mathrm{Na} / \mathrm{Na}^{+}$
- In the lab NaOH may be purified from sodium salt by dissolving in it alcohol in which the salts are insoluble and then evaporating off the alcohol.
- Ordinary solid sodium hydroxide always contains $\mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$, but if it is dissolved in its own volume of CO 2 , free water, the carbonate remains insoluble and can be filtered off through glass wool or asbestos, (not filter paper which is attacked). The clear filtrate can then be diluted and used to make e.g. standard solution for volumetric analysis.

\section*{Properties}

NaOH is pearly white solid melting point $318{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ very soluble in water (the process evolving much heat). The solid is deliquescent in air and readily absorbs $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ forming a crust of sodium carbonate on the hydroxyl surface
$$2 \mathrm{NaOH}+\mathrm{CO}_{2} \longrightarrow \mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$$

NaOH solution attacks flesh hence common name caustic soda, (caustic- burning) Glass is very slowly dissolved to give sodium silicate. Concentrated solutions cannot therefore be kept in glass bottles, unless lined with paraffin wax. Fused sodium hydroxide attacks most metals but iron and nickel resists the attack.

\section*{Other chemical properties}

Sodium hydroxide is a strong base, precipitating the hydroxides or oxides of many metals from solution
$$2 \mathrm{OHI}^{-}+\mathrm{Ni}^{2+} \longrightarrow \mathrm{Ni}(\mathrm{OHI})_{2 \downarrow} \downarrow$$

Some of the hydroxides are soluble in excess caustic soda to give sodium salts. Most acidic oxides dissolve readily to form salts. Some weakly electropositive elements like aluminium dissolve in NaOH evolving hydrogen gas. White phosphorus dissolves to give phosphine

Chlorine and other halogens dissolve in aqueous NaOH and product depending on conditions.
Ammonium salts evolve ammonia when heated with caustic soda, (test for ammonium salts)
$$\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}+\mathrm{OH}^{-} \longrightarrow \mathrm{NH}_{3} \uparrow+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$$

If carbon monoxide is passed, under pressure into a solution of sodium hydroxide heated at $160^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ sodium formate is formed
$$\mathrm{CO}+\mathrm{NaOH} \longrightarrow \mathrm{HCOONa}$$

Uses- it's used in the lab as a strong base and to absorb $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and other acid gases on commercial scale. It's used for the manufacture of soaps, paper, artificial silk and dyes

Sodium carbonate (soda ash) $\mathbf{N a}_{\mathbf{2}} \mathbf{C O}_{3}$ - Almost all of this salts made by ammonium soda or solvary process commercially. The reaction

\section*{$\mathrm{NaCl}+\mathrm{NH}_{4} \mathrm{HCO}_{3} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{NH}_{4} \mathrm{Cl}+\mathrm{NaHCO}_{3} \downarrow$}
in presence of sodium chloride and ammonium bicarbonate, Sodium bicarbonate is precipitated. Ammonium bicarbonate is produced by passing $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ through a solution of ammonia. The equilibrium is moved to the right of the
$$\mathrm{CO}_{2}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}+\mathrm{H}^{+}$$
reaction $\mathrm{NH}_{3}+\mathrm{H}^{+} \rightarrow \mathrm{NH}_{4}{ }^{+}$i.e.` by proton affinity of ammonia.
$$\mathrm{NH}_{3}+\mathrm{H}^{+} \longrightarrow \mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}$$
$$\mathrm{Na}^{+}+\mathrm{CO}_{2}+\mathrm{NH}_{3}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{Na}^{+}+\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}+\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}$$

Concentrated brine (free of calcium and magnesium salts) trickles down a tower up with gaseous ammonia passes through mushrooms shaped buffles to ensure absorption. The concentrated solution of sodium chloride and ammonia from the base of the tower next, flows down. a second tower the carbonator up when the $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ is blown. This form sodium bicarbonate by action which heat is produced, the carbonator is cooled by water. Liquid leaving carbonator carries with it a sludge of sodium bicarbonate which is filtered off by suction through funnels stretched on a slow rotating cylinder frame

The bicarbonate is washed to remove any ammonium chloride and is then heated in a furnace to give the carbonate and $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ the latter is recycled
$$2 \mathrm{NaHCO}_{3} \longrightarrow \mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}+\mathrm{CO}_{2} \uparrow+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$$

The main supply of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ is heating limestone in a kiln
$$\mathrm{CaCO}_{3} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{CaO}+\mathrm{CO}_{2} \uparrow$$

The calcium oxide produced is slaked to give a suspension of calcium hydroxide (milk of lime) and it's heated with filtrate from carbonator, which contains ammonium chloride and some unchanged sodium chloride
$$2 \mathrm{NH}_{4} \mathrm{Cl}+\mathrm{Ca}(\mathrm{OH})_{2} \longrightarrow \mathrm{CaCl}_{2}+2 \mathrm{NH}_{3} \uparrow+2 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$$
the ammonia gas is used to saturate lime. Only by product is calcium chloride. The anhydrous sodium carbonate so prepared (soda ash) is about $99 \%$ pure

\section*{Properties}
- Sodium Carbonate crystallizes from water as at ordinary temperature as the decahydrate washing soda which efflorescence in dry air to give a monohydrate which is a white powder
- On heating it gives the anhydrous salt. The latter is not decomposed by further heating to redness.
- A solution of sodium carbonate is alkaline to litmus because of hydrolysis and evolved CO 2 slowly on boiling.
- In the lab, it's used in volumetric analysis to standardize acid and in qualitative analysis, since it reacts with salts of many metals, precipitating the metal as the carbonate or basic carbonate (in case where carbonate is hydrolyzed and the hydroxide may be precipitated)
. $\mathrm{CO}_{3}{ }^{2-}+\mathrm{Ni}^{2+} \longrightarrow \mathrm{NiCO}_{3} \downarrow$
- this reaction, removes metal ions from solution and leaves behind the (acid radical) anion for analysis. The presence of sodium ion does not interfere with tests use.
- A similar reaction occurs when a metal salt is fused with sodium carbonate. This is used to get insoluble metal salts e.g. barium sulfate into solution for analysis. Potassium carbonate is usually added to lower the melting point. The sodium and potassium carbonate mixture is called fusion mixture

Industrial use- it's used in the glass making, paper making and soaps.
Sodium bicarbonate, $\mathbf{N a H C O}_{3}$ - It's prepared by passing $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ into a cold concentrated solution of sodium carbonate. The bicarbonate separates out as white crystals
$$\begin{aligned}
& \mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}+\mathrm{CO}_{2} \rightleftharpoons 2 \mathrm{NaHCO}_{3} \\
& \text { i.e. } \quad \mathrm{CO}_{3}^{2-}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}+\mathrm{CO}_{2} \rightleftharpoons 2 \mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}
\end{aligned}$$

It is not particularly soluble in water. When a solution is boiled $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ is evolved by reverse reaction. $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ is also driven off on heating solid sodium bicarbonate hence the use of it in baking powder to aerate the dough
$$2 \mathrm{NaHCO}_{3} \longrightarrow \mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}+\mathrm{CO}_{2}$$

H-bonding plays a part in holding together the ions in a crystal of sodium bicarbonate, below shows hydrogen bonding in hydrogen carbonate.

Sodium chloride NaCl -Exists in nature as rock salt or halite deposits, which consists crystalline NaCl often discolored by impurities. It is also present in seawater with an average concentration of $3 \%$. But in the Dead Sea, it's up to $7.2 \%$.
- Rock salt deposits as usually mined or occasionally e.g. in Cheshire, water pumps down and brine containing about $25 \% \mathrm{NaCl}$ brought to the surface. The brine is operated by vacuum evaporation, impurities separated first and can be removed.
- In warm climate, salt is obtained by evaporation of shallow sea water by sun to give bay salt
- Pure sodium chloride is prepared by passing HCL gas into a saturated solution of impure salt and the pure compound is precipitated

\section*{Properties}
- Crystallize in colourless, transparent cubes, crystals have simple cubic lattice,
- the melting point $804^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ and can vaporize at high temperature. The vapor mainly composed of ion pairs but contains a few discrete ions Na and Cl
- Solubility changes very little with temperature 35.5 grams at $0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ and 39 grams at $100^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.
- A solution containing $23.6 \% \mathrm{NaCl}$ forms eutectic mixture freezing at $-23^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. This is the lowest temperature obtainable with a water salt mixture.
- Ordinary common salt is deliquescent due to small amounts of magnesium chloride present as impurities. Sodium phosphate may be added to convert this to magnesium phosphate, which is not deliquescent (the salt runs better)

Uses- in food for flavoring and curing, Electrolysis used to produce caustic soda, chlorine, sodium hypochlorite and sodium chlorate

If salt is thrown into a furnace, where clay is being fired, to make earth ware, it volatizes and react with the silica to give a glaze of sodium silicate
$$2 \mathrm{NaCl}+\mathrm{SiO}_{2}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} \longrightarrow \mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{SiO}_{3}+2 \mathrm{HCl}$$

Sodium sulfate $\mathbf{N a}_{\mathbf{2}} \mathbf{S O}_{\mathbf{4}}$ and Sodium hydrogen sulfate $\mathbf{N a H S O}_{\mathbf{4}}$-These two salts can be prepared in the lab by mixing a solution of sodium hydroxide and dilute sulfuric acid and evaporating to crystallizing point. If equivalent amounts of base and acid added are used, the normal sulfate is formed
$$\underset{2 \text { equiv. }}{2 \mathrm{NaOH}}+\underset{2 \text { equiv. }}{\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{SO}_{4}} \longrightarrow \mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{SO}_{4}+2 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$$

With 2 equivalents of acid and one of base, the bisulfate is formed
$$\mathrm{NaOH}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{SO}_{4} \longrightarrow \mathrm{NaHSO}_{4}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$$

The bisulfate dissolves in water to give the ions in $\mathrm{Na}^{+}, \mathrm{H}^{+}$and $\mathrm{SO}_{4}{ }^{2-}$. It is therefore acidic in solution and in fact behaves very much like a solution of dilute sulfuric acid. Normal sodium sulfate is neutral and is not hydrolyzed in
solution. Sodium bisulfate is a bi-product in the manufacture of nitric acid from sodium nitrate and HCl from sodium chloride.
```
$\mathrm{NaNO}_{3}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{SO}_{4} \longrightarrow \mathrm{NaIHSO}_{4}+\mathrm{HNO}_{3}$
    $\mathrm{NaCl}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{SO}_{4} \longrightarrow \mathrm{NaHSO}_{4}+\mathrm{HCl}^{-}$
```


The normal sulfate can be obtained by heating the bisulfate with sodium chloride in a furnace
$$\mathrm{NaCl}+\mathrm{NaHSO}_{4} \longrightarrow \mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{SO}_{4}+\mathrm{HCl} \uparrow$$

Sodium sulfate crystallizes from water at room temperature as a decahydrate (Glaubers salt). The crystals effloresce in air to give a white powder of anhydrous salt. Sodium bisulfate is colorless and crystallizes from water at room temperature as monohydrate when the latter is heated gently; it first loses water to give the anhydrous salt and then gives the pyrophosphate
```
$2 \mathrm{NaHSO}_{4} \longrightarrow \mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{~S}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{7}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$
```


Stronger heating produces sodium sulfate and sulfur trioxide
```
$2 \mathrm{NaHSO}_{4} \longrightarrow \mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{SO}_{4}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}+\mathrm{SO}_{3}$
```


\section*{Sodium sulfide $\mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{~S}$ and Sodium hydrogen sulfide NaHS}

If excess $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{~S}$ is passed into aqueous solution of NaOH the hydrosulfide is obtained
```
$\mathrm{NaOH}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{~S} \longrightarrow \mathrm{NaHS}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$
```


The NaHS may be crystallized as $\mathrm{NaSH} \cdot 2 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$. If an equivalent of caustic soda is added to a solution above, sodium sulfide is formed and may be crystallized as $\mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{H} .9 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$

\section*{$\mathrm{NaHS}+\mathrm{NaOH} \longrightarrow \mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{~S}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$}

Sodium sulfide may also be prepared anhydrous by heating excess sodium with sulfur and distilling of excess metal
$$2 \mathrm{Na}+\mathrm{S} \longrightarrow \mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{~S}$$

Commercially sodium sulfide is prepared by heating sodium sulfate with coal followed by extractions with water filtration and evaporation

\section*{Properties}

Sodium sulfide is strongly hydrolyzed in aqueous solution and gives alkaline reaction
```
    $\mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{~S}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{NaHS}+\mathrm{NaOH}$
i.e. $\quad \mathrm{S}^{2-}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{HS}^{-}+\mathrm{OH}^{-}$
```


The hydrosulfide is only slightly hydrolyzed but sufficiently to cause both sulfide and Hydrogen sulfide solution to smell of $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{~S}$
```
$\mathrm{HS}^{-}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{~S} \uparrow+\mathrm{OH}^{-}$
```


By boiling a solution of sodium sulfide in alcohol with sulfur sodium polysulfides of general formula $\mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{~S}_{\mathrm{x}}(\mathrm{x}=2,3,4$ or 5) are formed.

\section*{$2 \mathrm{NaHS}+(x-1) \mathrm{S} \longrightarrow \mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{~S}_{x}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{~S} \uparrow$}

Sodium sulfide used industrially to remove hair from hides and in manufacturing of dyes
Sodium nitrate $\mathbf{N a N O}_{\mathbf{3}}$ - The crude form occurs naturally as Chile salt Petre, in the calicle deposits in Chile. Other constituents include sodium iodide, from which iodine is obtained. The crude extract is treated with hot water and clear solution of runoff and allowed to cool. Sodium nitrate is obtained $95 \%$ purity crystallize out, and sodium iodate remains in the mother liquor. Sodium nitrate melts at $316^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ and at higher temperature decomposes into sodium nitrite and oxygen
$$2 \mathrm{NaNO}_{3} \longrightarrow 2 \mathrm{NaNO}_{2}+\mathrm{O}_{2} \uparrow$$

Sodium nitrite $\mathbf{N a N O}_{\mathbf{2}}$-It is prepared as above; it can be made industrially by fusion of nitrate with lead
$$\mathrm{NaNO}_{3}+\mathrm{Pb} \longrightarrow \mathrm{NaNO}_{2}+\mathrm{PbO}$$

The nitrite is extracted with water filtered and allowed to crystallize. it is a pale yellow crystalline solid, quite soluble in water, With dilute acid, a blue solution of nitrous acid is formed which decompose rapidly at room temperature evolving oxides of nitrogen

Used extensively in dye industry with an aromatic amine like aniline it yields diazonium salts which are the basis for azo dyes.

\section*{Tests for sodium}
(1) Flame test; a persistent golden-yellow colour.
(2) Zinc uranyl acetate; a clear solution of this reagent in dilute acctic acid reacts with a sodium salt forming, slowly, a yellow orystalline precipitate of $\mathrm{NaZn}\left(\mathrm{UO}_{2}\right)_{3}\left(\mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{COO}\right)_{9} \cdot 9 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$, sodium zinc uranyl acetate.

\section*{Potassium}

The chemistry is similar to sodium. It occurs in wood ash as a carbonate and may be extracted with water. The aqueous solution was evaporated in iron pots to yield potash $\left(\mathbf{K}_{\mathbf{2}} \mathbf{C O}_{\mathbf{3}}\right)$ hence the name of the element

Occurrence- it's to reactive to occur free, but it's compounds are widely distributed important deposits found around strassfurt Germany, mainly as sylvine KCl and Carnallite $\mathrm{KCl} \cdot \mathrm{Mg}_{2} \cdot 6 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ and also elsewhere probably due to sea evaporation. It also occurs in rocks e.g. feldspar, Potassium aluminium silicate and mica. Potassium is an essential element in plants and animal metabolism. It's found in animal and plant products e.g. seaweeds contain some potassium iodide, wood, sheep's sweat (as potassium salts of organic acids), rhubarb and sugar beet The sea has less than $0.1 \%$ KCL.

Preparation -Metallic potassium is not prepared commercially in large scale. It can be obtained by electrolysis of fused hydroxide or cyanide. Pure potassium is made by heating KCl with calcium in vacuo
$$2 \mathrm{KCl}+\mathrm{Ca} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{CaCl}_{2}+2 \mathrm{~K} \uparrow$$

Potassium is distilled off and the reaction goes from left to right

\section*{Properties}
- The property resembles sodium in both physical and chemical properties
- The metal is softer than sodium and exhibit slight radioactivity due to the presence of the isotope ${ }^{40}{ }_{19} \mathrm{~K}$ in very small amounts.
- It is more reactive than sodium e.g. when it reacts with water heat is evolved causing ignition of hydrogen evolved
- In excess oxygen potassium burns to give the superperoxide $\mathrm{KO}_{2}$ while for sodium it gives the peroxide

\section*{Compounds of potassium}

Potassium hydride, KH - It is similar to sodium hydride, but less stable, reacts the same way with water but more vigorously.

Potassium monoxide $\mathbf{K}_{\mathbf{2}} \mathbf{O}$ - Prepared by heating potassium in a sealed tube containing insufficient oxygen, the excess potassium is distilled off and the properties are similar to sodium monoxide.

Potassium peroxide $\mathbf{K}_{2} \mathbf{O}_{2}$ - it's made by controlled oxidation of potassium e.g. heating potassium with calculated amount of air at $300^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ at high temperature some super oxide is formed. It reacts with water as sodium peroxide

Potassium superoxide $\mathbf{K O}_{\mathbf{2}}$ - Yellow solid composed of ions $\mathrm{K}^{+}$and $[\mathrm{O}-\mathrm{O}]^{-}$reacts with water involving oxygen and hydrogen peroxide. It is a strong oxidizing agent
$$2 \mathrm{KO}_{2}+2 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} \longrightarrow 2 \mathrm{KOH}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{2}+\mathrm{O}_{2} \uparrow$$

\section*{Potassium hydroxide, caustic potash, KOH}
- it's made by electrolysis of a solution of KCl . it's stronger base and more hygroscopic than NaOH . Potassium carbonate is soluble in solution of concentrated KOH hence exposure of KOH to moist air does not produce a crust of carbonate
- Potassium carbonate is thus an effective desiccant especially for substances which must be dried in absence of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$
- KOH which is more stable than NaOH in alcohol and alcoholic potash is used in organic chemistry.
- It's used to manufacture soft soaps

\section*{Potassium carbonate, pearl ash, potash $\mathbf{K}_{\mathbf{2}} \mathbf{C O}_{\mathbf{3}}$}
- Cannot be made by the Solvay process because potassium bicarbonate, unlike sodium bicarbonate is quite soluble in water even in the presence of excess potassium ions, it is most conveniently obtained from potassium hydroxide, by passing carbon dioxide into its solution and then evaporating it
- $\mathrm{KOH}+\mathrm{CO}_{2} \longrightarrow \mathrm{KHCO}_{3}$
- The bicarbonate is then heated to give the normal carbonate
$2 \mathrm{KHCO}_{3} \longrightarrow \mathrm{~K}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}+\mathrm{CO}_{2} \uparrow+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} \uparrow$
- In another process used in Germany purified producer gas, containing about $30 \%$ of carbon monoxide is passed under pressure through a hot solution of potassium sulfate with the milk of lime, when potassium formate is obtained
- $\mathrm{K}_{2} \mathrm{SO}_{4}+\mathrm{Ca}(\mathrm{OH})_{2}+2 \mathrm{CO} \longrightarrow 2 \mathrm{HCOOK}+\mathrm{CaSO}_{4} \downarrow$
- The calcium sulfate is filtered off and the filtrate evaporated. The solid potassium formate obtained is then heated in a rotary furnace with free access to air
- $2 \mathrm{HCOOK}+\mathrm{O}_{2} \longrightarrow \mathrm{~K}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} \uparrow+\mathrm{CO}_{2} \uparrow$
- Potassium carbonate crystallizes from water at ordinary temperature as the dehydrate. its aqueous solution, is strongly alkaline

Potassium bicarbonate -This acid salt may be prepared by passing carbon dioxide into cold concentrated solution of potassium carbonate
$$\mathrm{K}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}+\mathrm{CO}_{2}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} \longrightarrow 2 \mathrm{KHCO}_{3}$$

As already noted, it is readily soluble in water. On heating, it yields the normal carbonate
Potassium fluoride- If potassium carbonate is dissolved in excess hydrofluoric acid in a polythene beaker because the acid attacks glass and the solution evaporated crystals of potassium hydrogen fluoride or potassium bifluoride are obtained. The other halogen hydracids give the normal salt only e.g. $\mathrm{KCl}, \mathrm{KBr}, \mathrm{KI}$. potassium hydrogen fluoride is an ionic compound and may be represented as
$$\mathrm{K}^{+}[\mathrm{F}-\mathrm{H} \cdots \cdots \mathrm{~F}]^{-}$$
the existence of the anion is due to hydrogen bonding between the hydrogen of the HF and the $\mathrm{F}^{-}$ion. (shown in the dotted line). On heating the bifluoride the normal salt is obtained.
$$\mathrm{KHF}_{2} \longrightarrow \mathrm{KF}+\mathrm{HF} \uparrow$$

Potassium chloride KCl -The salt is found in sylvine. It is similar to sodium chloride except that it is more soluble in hot water than in cold

Potassium bromide, $\mathbf{K B r}$-This halide is made by the action of bromine on warm concentrated aqueous potassium hydroxide
i.e. $3 \mathrm{Br}_{2}+6 \mathrm{OH}^{-} \rightarrow 5 \mathrm{Br}^{-}+\mathrm{BrO}_{3}^{-}+3 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$
- The solution of bromide and bromate is evaporated to dryness and the residue heated with charcoal
- $2 \mathrm{KBrO}_{3}+3 \mathrm{C} \longrightarrow 2 \mathrm{KBr}+3 \mathrm{CO}_{2} \uparrow$
- After treating with water and filtering to remove the excess charcoal, the solution is evaporated to dryness. Potassium bromide can also be made from ferrous ferribromide obtained in the manufacture of bromine. By treatment with the potassium carbonate solution
$$\mathrm{Fe}\left(\mathrm{FeBr}_{4}\right)_{2}+4 \mathrm{~K}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}+x \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} \xrightarrow[\text { hydrated ferroso-ferric oxide }]{\mathrm{Fe}_{3} \mathrm{O}_{4} \cdot x \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} \downarrow+8 \mathrm{KBr}+4 \mathrm{CO}_{2} \uparrow}$$
- The hydrated ferrous oxide is filtered off and the filtrate evaporated to dryness.
- Chemically, the reactions of potassium bromide are those of the bromide ion of which it is the commonest source.
- It is used medically, as a sedative, and also to prepare silver bromide for use in photography.

Potassium iodide KI -This is prepared from iodine and potassium hydroxide in a manner similar to that for the bromide above. It is a white solid which tends to become yellow in bright light due to the liberation of traces of free iodine. It is extremely soluble in water and the solution readily dissolves iodine because of the action
$$\begin{aligned}
& \mathrm{KI}+\mathrm{I}_{2} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{~K} \mathrm{I}_{3} \\
\text { i.e. } & \mathrm{I}^{-}+\mathrm{I}_{2} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{I}_{3}^{-}
\end{aligned}$$

Potassium tri-iodide can be isolated as rather unstable black crystals of the monohydrate. Potassium tri-iodide is an example of the characteristic property of potassium, rubidium and caesium (but not sodium) of forming many polyhalides. The formation of this substance is given as an equilibrium because the $\mathrm{I}_{3}{ }^{-}$ion behaves chemically as a
mixture of $\mathrm{I}^{-}$and $\mathrm{I}_{2}$ e.g. the free iodine can be titrated with sodium thiosulfate. The equilibrium can however be investigated because if a solution of potassium iodide containing iodine is shaken with carbon tetrachloride because only the free iodine ( $\mathrm{I}_{2}$ ) is distributed between the two solvents, the iodine as $\mathrm{I}_{3}{ }^{-}$remains in the aqueous layer, Potassium iodide also dissolves iodides have some metals to give complex ions for example mercuric iodide dissolves to form $\left[\mathrm{HgI}_{4}\right]^{2-}$
$$\mathrm{HgI}_{2}+2 \mathrm{I}^{-} \rightleftharpoons\left[\mathrm{HgI}_{4}\right]^{2-}$$

Potassium chromate $\mathrm{KClO}_{3}$ The salt is not very soluble in cold water. It can therefore be prepared by mixing concentrated solution of sodium chromate and potassium chloride. Sodium chloride remains in solution but the solubility product $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]\left[\mathrm{ClO}_{3}{ }^{-}\right]$is exceeded and potassium chromate crystallizes out.
- On heating potassium chromate first melts, and then re-solidifies due to the formation of potassium perchlorate.

\section*{$\mathbf{4} \mathrm{KClO}_{3} \longrightarrow \mathbf{3} \mathrm{KClO}_{4} \boldsymbol{+} \mathbf{K C l}$}
- On strong heating, further decomposition occurs
$$\mathrm{KClO}_{4} \longrightarrow \mathrm{KCl}+2 \mathrm{O}_{2} \uparrow$$
- If potassium chlorate is heated with magnesium dioxide as catalysts, oxygen is involved below the melting point
- $2 \mathrm{KClO}_{3} \longrightarrow 2 \mathrm{KCl}+3 \mathrm{O}_{2} \uparrow$
- The other properties of potassium chlorate are essentially, those of the chlorate ions,
- The solid potassium chlorate is used as an oxidizing agent in the manufacture of marches, fireworks and explosives.

Potassium perchlorate $\mathrm{KClO}_{4}$ Potassium perchlorate is prepared by heating the chlorate. It is a colorless solid, only slightly soluble in water and insoluble in alcohol. Its crystals are isomorphous with those of potassium permanganate because of the similarity in shape, size, and change of the ions $\mathrm{ClO}_{4}{ }^{-}$and $\mathrm{MnO}_{4}{ }^{-}$; it is not however, a strong oxidizing agent e.g. does not oxidize the iodide ion, to iodine in acid solution

Potassium nitrate, nitre, saltpeter $\mathrm{KNO}_{3}$ This well-known compound is prepared by mixing hot saturated solution of potassium chloride and sodium nitrate
$$\mathrm{K}^{+}+\mathrm{Cl}^{-}+\mathrm{Na}^{+}+\mathrm{NO}_{3}^{-} \longrightarrow \mathrm{NaCl}_{\perp}+\mathrm{K}^{+}+\mathrm{NO}_{3}^{-}$$

Sodium chloride is the least soluble of the four salts $\mathrm{KCl}, \mathrm{NaNO}_{3}, \mathrm{KNO}_{3}$ and NaCl and crystallizes out, the remaining solution is then cooled to ordinary temperature when potassium nitrate (which is much less soluble in cold than in hot water) separate the figure shows the comparative solubility of the four salts
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/7ef96b79-0db7-494d-80b3-f46f1a506ae0-37.jpg?height=663&width=1196&top_left_y=1961&top_left_x=53)

Potassium nitrate has properties similar to those of sodium nitrate, but it is not deliquescent. It is therefore used in explosives where caking due to moisture must be avoided. Potassium nitrate ,potassium sulfate and the sulfides and hydrosulfide of potassium are similar to the corresponding compounds of sodium.

Tosts for potassium
(1) Flame test; a lilac-coloured flame is produced.
(2) Sodium perchlorate, NaC1Oa, precipitates potassimm perchlorate, KClO. slowly as colourless crystals.
(3) Sodium tetraphenylboron, NaB $\left(\mathrm{C}_{6} \mathrm{I}_{5}\right)_{4}$, gives an immediate white precipitate of the potassimm salt, $K B\left(C_{6} H_{5}\right)_{4}$, in weakly acid solution. The test is quantitative; the precipitate can be filtered off, dried, and weighed to estimate potassium.

Lithium, Rubidium and Caesium- Some general differences between sodium and potassium, potassium hydroxide is a stronger base than caustic soda and potassium gives salts which on the whole are more soluble in water and have less tendency to be hydrated than the corresponding salts of sodium. . In nature, Li is found as ores, for example, spodumene $[\mathrm{LiAl}(\mathrm{SiO} 3) 2]$, or at low concentrations as salts, for example, in rivers. The metal itself is soft and white in appearance; it has the lowest reactivity within the group of alkali metals. The $\mathrm{Li}+$ ion has the smallest ionic radius of all known metals.
- These tendencies continue with rubidium and caesium. The elements are strongly basic oxides and hydroxides, form salts which are usually not hydrated, but are very soluble in water, and they really form polyhalides
- Little is yet known of the chemistry of francium which is a product of the radioactive decay of actinium. What is known justifies the inclusion of this element in group I.
- The head element of group 1 Lithium is in many respects like magnesium and the alkaline earth metals. Its chemistry is summarized above where its properties compared to those of sodium and potassium.
- The difference in chemical behavior between the alkali metals can be linked to the difference in their ions. These all have the inert gas structure and carry a single positive charge, but defer in radius increasing from $\mathrm{Li}^{+}$(radius 0.6 A ) to $\mathrm{Cs}^{+}$(radius 1.7 A ) the force between ions are electrostatic and therefore increase with decreasing radius. Thus, there will be a greater attraction force between the ion $\mathrm{Li}^{+}$and $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$and $\mathrm{CS}^{+}$and $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$, hence when lithium hydroxide is dissolved in water, it is less easy to obtain free hydroxyl ions than if caesium hydroxide is used. Caesium hydroxide is therefore a stronger base (i.e. gives more free $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$ions) than lithium hydroxide. It is possible to explain other differences in the chemistry of the alkali metals in terms of the different radii of their ions.
- When lithium carbonate, (small cation, large anion) is heated and loses carbon dioxide to form lithium oxide smaller anion, the increase in electrostatic attraction in going from the carbonate to the oxide is considerable and this favors the decomposition. But in going from, for example, potassium carbonate, large cation to Potassium oxide, the gain in electrostatic attraction is relatively much less and the decomposition is less easy. Hence, lithium carbonate loses carbon dioxide on heating much more readily than the carbonate of the other alkali metals with larger cations, again the polyhalide anions (e.g. $\mathrm{I}_{3}{ }^{-}$) are large and very easily broken up in an electric field- hence, they do not form stable crystals with small cation, e.g. lithium and sodium which produce a strong field but only with large cation e.g. $\mathrm{K}^{+}, \mathrm{Rb}^{+}$, $\mathrm{Cs}^{+}$
- The ionization energy- the energy required to remove an electron from an atom decreases steadily from lithium to caesium because the outermost electron is less firmly held as more and more electron shells shields it from the attraction of the nucleus. Hence, the ease with which positive ions are formed (requiring the process $\mathrm{M} \rightarrow \mathrm{M}^{+}+\mathrm{e}^{-}$) increases from lithium down the group and the vigor of the reaction of the metal with water also increases since less energy has to be absorbed to produce the larger ions. This decrease of ionization energy down a group is quite general for all non-transition elements. It means that the tendency of the elements to form cations i.e. to show electropositive or metallic behavior always increases down the group (compared for example, carbon with tin and lead in group IV) even in group seven the halogen iodine can form cations $\mathrm{I}^{+}$under certain conditions

\section*{Biological importance of group I A \& group II A Elements \\ Medical uses of the alkali metals}

Lithium toxicity, also known as lithium overdose, is the condition of having too much lithium. Symptoms may include a tremor, increased reflexes, trouble walking, kidney problems, and an altered level of consciousness. Some symptoms may last for a year after levels return to normal. Complications may include serotonin syndrome. Lithium toxicity can occur due to excessive intake or decreased excretion. Excessive intake may be either a suicide attempt or accidental. Decreased excretion may occur as a result of dehydration such as from vomiting or diarrhea, a low sodium diet, or from kidney problems. The diagnosis is generally based on symptoms and supported by a lithium level of greater than $1.2 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$.

The biology of lithium and its medicinal application- Lithium salts are used in the prophylaxis and treatment of mania, and in the prophylaxis of bipolar disorder and recurrent depression. Lithium therapy is taken orally, usually as lithium carbonate $\left(\mathrm{Li} 2 \mathrm{CO}_{3}\right)$ or lithium citrate $\left[\mathrm{Li}_{3} \mathrm{C}_{3} \mathrm{H}_{5} \mathrm{O}(\mathrm{COO})_{3}\right]$, with a total dose of up to $30 \mathrm{mmol} /$ day. $\mathrm{Li}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$ is the preferred lithium salt used, as it causes the least irritation to the stomach. The treatment has to be closely monitored, and $\mathrm{Li}+$ blood concentrations are measured 12 h after administration to achieve a serum lithium concentration of $0.4-1 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{l}$. The therapeutic index (concentration window from efficacy to toxicity) for $\mathrm{Li}+$ is very narrow, and plasma $\mathrm{Li}+$ concentrations above 2 mM require emergency treatment for poisoning

\section*{Drugs, diet and toxicity}

Sodium chloride solutions are normally used when the patient is diagnosed with sodium depletion and dehydration. Treatment is mostly administered intravenously, but in chronic conditions (mild to moderate sodium loss) sodium chloride or sodium bicarbonate can be given orally.
Oral rehydration therapies usually use a mixture of alkali metal-based salts such as $\mathrm{NaCl}, \mathrm{KCl}$ and their citrates.
Sodium bicarbonate is usually administered orally in order to regulate the serum pH . Imbalances of the plasma pH can be due to problems occurring in the kidneys such as renal tubular acidosis
The most common dietary source of NaCl is table salt, which is used for seasoning and pickling (the high NaCl content inhibits the bacterial and fungal growth as a result of the osmotic gradient). The daily recommended NaCl intake varies depending on the country and the age group.
Potassium ions are crucial for the functioning of neurons, by influencing the osmotic balance between the cells and the interstitial fluid. The concentration of K+ within and outside the cells is regulated by the so-called Na+/K+-ATPase pump. Under the use of ATP, three $\mathrm{Na}+$ ions are pumped outside the cell and two $\mathrm{K}+$ ions are actively transported into the cell. As a result, an electrochemical gradient over the cell membrane is created; the so-called resting potential is established.
In the human body, $95 \%$ of the $\mathrm{K}+$ can be found inside the cells, with the remaining $5 \%$ mainly circulating in the blood plasma. This balance is carefully maintained by the $\mathrm{Na}+/ \mathrm{K}+$ pump,
Potassium salts and their clinical application: hypokalaemia

Imbalances, like hypo or hyperkalaemia, can have serious consequences.
Hypokalaemia is a potentially serious condition where the patient has low levels of $\mathrm{K}+$ in his/her blood plasma. Symptoms can include weakness of the muscles or ECG (electrocardiogram) abnormalities. Mostly, hypokalaemia can be a result of reduced K+ intake caused by GI disturbance, such as diarrhoea and vomiting, or increased excretion of $\mathrm{K}+$ caused by diuresis. Hypokalaemia is often found in patients treated with diuretics such as loop diuretics and thiazides. These classes of drugs increase the secretion of $\mathrm{Na}+$ in the nephrons in order to increase water excretion. Unfortunately, they also increase the excretion of K+ and lead to hypokalaemia. In contrast, potassium-sparing diuretics actively preserve potassium ions, and patients treated with loop diuretics or thiazides often receive also potassium-sparing diuretics
Oral supplementation in form of potassium salts is especially necessary in patients who take anti-arrhythmic drugs, suffer from renal artery stenosis and/or severe heart failure or show severe K+ losses due to chronic elderly patients when the $\mathrm{K}+$ intake is reduced as a result of changing dietary habits, but special attention has to be given to patients with renal insufficiency because K+ excretion might be reduced. Potassium salts are preferably given as liquid preparations, and KCl is the preferred salt used. Other potassium-based salts can be used if the patient is at risk of developing hyperchloraemia - increased chloride plasma levels. Typically potassium salts are dissolved in water, but the salty and bitter taste makes them difficult to formulate.
Oral bicarbonate solutions such as potassium bicarbonate are typically given orally for chronic acidosis states - low pH of the blood plasma.
Potassium citrate is used as an over-the-counter drug for the relief from discomfort experienced in mild urinary-tract infections by increasing the urinary pH . It should be not given to men if they experience pain in the kidney area (risk of kidney stones) or if blood or pus is present in the urine. Also, patients with raised blood pressure or diabetes should avoid taking potassium citrate without consultation with their general practitioner (GP). Caution is generally advised to patients with renal impairment, cardiac problems and the elderly
Hyperkalaemia- The therapeutic window for $\mathrm{K}+$ in the blood plasma is very small $(3.5-5.0 \mathrm{mmol})$, and especially hyperkalaemia, an increased level of K+ in the plasma, can lead to severe health problems. Potassium salts can cause nausea and vomiting and in extreme cases can lead to small bowel ulcerations. Acute severe hyperkalaemia is defined when the plasma potassium concentration exceeds $6.5 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{l}$ or if ECG changes are seen. This can lead to cardiac arrest, which needs immediate treatment. Treatment options include the use of calcium gluconate intravenous injections, which minimises the effects of hyperkalaemia on the heart. The intravenous injection of soluble insulin promotes the shift of potassium ions into the cells. Diuretics can also be used to increase the secretion of K+ in the kidneys, and dialysis can be a good option if urgent treatment is required.
1. Iodized salt is essential for the body as it helps in the production of thyroid hormones which affects growth \& metabolic rates.
2. Diclofenac is used to treat pain \& reduce inflammation that accompanies rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis.
3. Sodium bromide is used by the medical fraternity to treat headaches \& seizures.
4. Naproxen sodium is used to reduce pain associated with muscle injuries.
5. Potassium chloride is used as the treatment of meniere's syndrome and familiar periodic paralysis.
6. Potassium bicarbonate is used as antacid for those people who are restricted for in taking sodium.

\section*{BIOLOGICAL IMPORTANCE OF RUBIDIUM}
1. It can accumulate ahead of potassium in muscle.
2. It readily reacts with skin moisture to from rubidium hydroxide.
3. Failure to aggravated by exposure, heart patients, Potassium imbalance.

\section*{BIOLOGICAL IMPORTANCE OF CAESIUM}
- It is capable of replacing potassium in the body to some extent because of its chemical similarity. Ingestion of any Caesium compounds is therefore to be avoided.
- Because of this similarity, the isotopes 134Cs and 137Cs (present in the biosphere in small amounts as a result of radiation leaks) are very toxic.
- Rats fed Caesium in place of potassium in their diet die.

BIOLOGICAL IMPORTANCE OF FRANCIUM : Biological role of francium: Francium has no biological role. Hazards and risks: Francium does not occur to any significant extent in the biosphere and so normally never presents a risk.
- Francium is studied in a few nuclear research laboratories where its high radioactivity requires special handling techniques and precautions.
- One could speculate that its chemical hazards would be very similar to those of caesium.

\section*{GROUP II, IIA : THE ALKALINE EARTH METALS}

\section*{General characteristics}
- They are metals, electropositive character.
- Hydroxide, sparingly soluble in water and not very strong bases
- Salts of strong acids, not usually hydrolyzed (some salts of beryllium and magnesium exempted)
- Carbonates evolve carbon dioxide on heating
- Bicarbonates unstable in the solid states,
- Nitrates evolve nitrogen dioxide and oxygen on heating
- Complexes formed by beryllium and magnesium less commonly by other elements.
- Thus, whereas calcium, strontium, barium, and radium react readily with cold water, magnesium reacts only with hot water

\section*{Changes down the group}
- Ionic size increases hence
- Hydroxides stronger bases salts less hydrated and usually more soluble carbonates more soluble.
- Ionization energy decreases hence
- Electropositive character increases metals more reactive

Beryllium ion is the most soluble and the solubility decreases with increasing size so that Barium ion is the least watersoluble alkaline earth metal ion. Solubility in water is related to the ionic nature and size. Smaller ions have higher charge density and can be solvated by more water molecules. This releases a higher enthalpy of hydration and makes the hydrated ions more stable. Example: Solubility of $\mathrm{Be}^{2+}$ > Solubility of $\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ > Solubility of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ > Solubility of $\mathrm{Sr}^{2+}$ > Solubility of $\mathrm{Ba}^{2+}$
- Reactivity of Alkaline Earth Metals- Reducing ability is inversely related to ionization energy. As ionization energy decreases down the column, reducing property is expected to increase from Beryllium to Barium. Reduction potential also decreases from beryllium to barium indicating the increasing reducing capacities. But, the alkaline earth metals are weaker reducing agents than alkali metals, due to higher ionization energy.
- Flame Colouration- In Alkaline Earth Metals, the energy needed for an electronic transition between the available energy levels falls in the visible spectrum region. So, on heating, except beryllium and magnesium produce a characteristic colour to the flame reflective of their emission or absorption spectrum and can be used for their identification. Example: Ca - Brick Red colour, Sr - Crimson Red colour, and Ba - Apple Green colour.
- Melting and Boiling Points- Because of smaller size and strong metallic bonding in close-packed structure, the melting and boiling points of the alkaline earth metals are higher than alkali metals. Among the alkaline earth metals except for magnesium, the melting and boiling points decrease regularly from beryllium to barium.
- All the elements occur as hexagonal closed-packed structures with the exception of barium and radium, which adopt the more open body-centred cubic structure.
- The density decreases from Be to Mg to Ca (in contrast to the lighter Group 1 elements) as a result of very strong metallic bonding in the Group 2 elements, which leads to short metal-metal distances in the lighter elements ( 225 pm in beryllium, for instance) and as a result small unit cells. Beryllium is inert in air as its surface is passivated by the formation of a thin layer of BeO .
- Magnesium and calcium metals tarnish in air with the formation of an oxide layer, but will burn completely to their oxides and nitrides when heated. Strontium and barium, especially in powdered forms, ignite in air and are stored under hydrocarbon oils.
- As with the Group 1 elements, flame tests are commonly used for the identification of the presence of the heavier Group 2 elements and their compounds:

\begin{tabular}{llll} 
Ca & Sr & Ba & Ra \\
Orange-red & Crimson & Yellowish-green & Deep red
\end{tabular}
- Compounds of the Group 2 elements are used to colour fireworks.
- The small size of $\mathrm{Be}^{2+}$ (ionic radius 27 pm ) and its consequent high charge density and polarizing power results in the compounds of Be being largely covalent; the ion is a strong Lewis acid.

The coordination number most commonly observed for this small atom is 4 and the local geometry tetrahedral. Beryllium's larger congeners typically have coordination numbers of 6 or more. Some consequences of these properties are:
- A significant covalent contribution to the bonding in compounds such as the beryllium halides $\mathrm{BeCl}_{2}, \mathrm{BeBr}_{2}$, and $\mathrm{BeI}_{2}$ and the hydride, $\mathrm{BeH}_{2}$.
- A greater tendency to form complexes, with the formation of molecular compounds such as $\mathrm{Be}_{4} \mathrm{O}\left(\mathrm{O}_{2} \mathrm{CCH}_{3}\right)_{6}$.
- Hydrolysis (deprotonation) of beryllium salts in aqueous solution, forming species such as $\left[\mathrm{Be}\left(\mathrm{OH}_{2}\right)_{3} \mathrm{OH}\right]+$ and acidic solutions. Hydrated beryllium salts tend to decompose by hydrolysis reactions, in which beryllium oxo- or hydroxo-salts are formed, rather than by the simple loss of water.
- The oxide and other chalcogenides of Be adopt structures with the more directional 4:4-coordination structures.
- Beryllium forms many stable organometallic compounds, including methylberyllium $\left(\mathrm{Be}\left(\mathrm{CH}_{3}\right)_{2}\right)$, ethylberyllium, t butylberyllium, and beryllocene ( $\left.\left(\mathrm{C}_{5} \mathrm{H}_{5}\right)_{2} \mathrm{Be}\right)$.

The chemistry of the sub group IIA involving calcium to radium is in fact, the chemistry of the ions, $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}, \mathrm{Sr}^{2+}$ e.t.c. These elements do not form monovalent ions under ordinary conditions, because although more ionization energy is required to remove the second electron other energy changes, favor, the formation of the divalent ions both in crystal and solutions.
- They are metallic and electropositive and rarely from complex ions, except for the valency of 2, these are characteristics of the alkali metals. The fact that the ions are doubly charged, does however, affect some properties for example, the base calcium hydroxide, strontium hydroxide, etc. are weaker than the corresponding alkali metal hydroxide and they are more insoluble or sparingly soluble salts, e.g. fluorides carbonates sulfates,
- The above characteristics apply generally to magnesium also but this metal is rather less electropositive and does form a few compounds, which are partly covalent. A few complexes in general however, its chemistry is that of the ion $\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$. Beryllium is exceptional. It is certainly metallic yet readily forms covalent compounds and has a hydroxide which is amphoteric giving rise to beryllium salts (Some of which contain the ion $\mathrm{Be}^{2+}$ ) and to beryllates in these respect, there is a diagonal resemblance to aluminium.
- Boron and aluminium in group three can attain a covalency of 4 even if there are no enough electrons to provide four pairs. This tendency is shared by beryllium. Beryllium is compared with magnesium and calcium later in the text

\section*{Magnesium}

Discovery and isolation -Magnesium sulfate, (Epsom salts) mgSO4. 7 H 2 O was discovered in spring water at Epsom in 1695. Impure metallic magnesium was obtained electronically by Davy in 1808

Occurrence - Magnesium is not found free, but its compounds are widely distributed and plentiful. Dolomite $\mathrm{MgCa}\left(\mathrm{CO}_{3}\right)_{2}$ constitutes the Dolomites and other mountains, carnallite $\mathrm{KCl} . \mathrm{MgCl}_{2} .6 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ occur in deposits in Germany, other minerals are magnesite $\mathrm{MgCO}_{3}$ and asbestos $\mathrm{CaMg}_{3}(\mathrm{SiO} 3)_{4}$, magnesium halides are found in seawater and magnesium is an essential constituent of chlorophyll, the green coloring matter of plants.

Extraction- Magnesium is obtained commercially by the electrolysis of fused anhydrous chloride mixed with some sodium chloride to lower the melting point (or potassium chloride is the source of the magnesium chloride is carnallite), small amounts of alkali and alkaline earth fluorides are added to improve yield of magnesium. The first problem is to obtain the anhydrous salt. If magnesium chloride $\mathrm{MgCl}_{2} \cdot 6 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ or carnallite is heated, four molecules of water, are lost fairly readily, but attempts to remove the other two molecules result in the formation by hydrolysis of basic salts. Magnesium is extracted on a large scale using a Down's cell or the ferrosilicon process with seawater being the main source. The anhydrous chloride may therefore be made by heating crushed magnesite with coke and passing chlorine over it, the Magnesite is first decomposed to give the oxide which is then reduced
$$\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{MgCO}_{3} & \longrightarrow \mathrm{MgO}+\mathrm{CO}_{2} \uparrow \\
\mathrm{MgO}+\mathrm{C}+\mathrm{Cl}_{2} & \longrightarrow \mathrm{MgCl}_{2}+\mathrm{CO} \uparrow+33 \mathrm{kcal}
\end{aligned}$$

In the electrolytic cell, a carbon anode and an iron or steel cathode are used. The magnesium collects as drops on the cathode surface, this coalesce and rise to the surface of the melt from which a layer of magnesium can be collected. Since molten magnesium reacts with oxygen and nitrogen, coal gas may be used to provide the inactive atmosphere for electrolysis. Chlorine from the anode is used to make magnesium chloride

Magnesium is extracted from seawater in a large plant on the Gulf of Mexico. The first stage is to precipitate magnesium hydroxide by adding of lime
$$\mathrm{MgCl}_{2}+\mathrm{Ca}(\mathrm{OH})_{2} \longrightarrow \mathrm{Mg}(\mathrm{OH})_{2} \downarrow+\mathrm{CaCl}_{2}$$

The hydroxide is then converted to the chloride and the latter crystallized as $\mathrm{MgCl}_{2} \cdot 6 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$. This is dehydrated as far as possible without hydrolysis and this incompletely, dehydrated chloride can be then added to the fused chloride in the electrolytic cell. Each ton of magnesium requires the treatment of about 30,000 cubic feet of seawater. Another method for large scale preparation of magnesium uses the reversible reaction

\section*{$\mathrm{MgO}+\mathrm{C} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{Mg}+\mathrm{CO}$}

At $2,000^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, both products of the forward reaction are gaseous and would normally be recombined but if the products are cooled rapidly, magnesium is frozen out and the forward reaction goes to completion

Physical Properties -Magnesium is a white lustrous metal, which is fairly soft and ductile (eg magnesium ribbon)
Chemical properties- it tarnishes, somewhat in moist air, a film of the oxide MgO being formed. On heating in air magnesium burns with a brilliant light forming both the oxide and the nitride $\mathrm{Mg}_{3} \mathrm{~N}_{2}$. These appear as a white smoke which can be deposited on a flat surface as a thick, very uniform white layer. The latter has been used as a standard of
whiteness and also to study the size of liquid droplets formed when a jet of liquids breaks up. The droplets are allowed to fall on the white layer where they produce circular depressions proportional to their size. Magnesium will also burn in steam and in carbon dioxide
$$\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{Mg}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} & \longrightarrow \mathrm{MgO}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \uparrow \\
2 \mathrm{Mg}+\mathrm{CO}_{2} & \longrightarrow 2 \mathrm{MgO}+\mathrm{C} \downarrow
\end{aligned}$$

From the electrochemical series, it will be expected that magnesium will react with cold water. However, a layer of magnesium hydroxide $\mathrm{Mg}(\mathrm{OH})_{2}$ reduces the rate of attack of water on the metal which therefore dissolves only at a very slow rate. Dilute acids including nitric acids and solutions of salt which are acid by hydrolysis readily attack magnesium to give hydrogen
$$\mathrm{Mg}+2 \mathrm{H}^{+} \longrightarrow \mathrm{Mg}^{2+}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \uparrow$$

Alkalis have no action. Dry magnesium reacts to alkyl-halides to form covalent Grignard reagents much use in organic chemistry

Uses -Magnesium powder mixed with an oxidizing agent (such as potassium chlorate, or barium peroxide) is used in flashlight powders for photography and in Fireworks. Magnesium is a constituent of several useful light alloys eg magnalium (containing aluminium and magnesium) which are used extensively in aircraft manufacturers. Magnesium contains about $2 \%$ of manganese is not attacked by water. Magnesium is also used to reduce uranium and plutonium fluorides to the metal

\section*{Compounds of magnesium}

Magnesium hydride $\mathbf{M g H}_{\mathbf{2}}$ - the hydride is prepared by the action of hydrogen under pressure on heated magnesium powder, addition of a little iodine catalyzes the reaction
$$\mathrm{Mg}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \longrightarrow \mathrm{MgH}_{2}$$
it is a greyish white solid which reacts with water giving hydrogen and the hydroxide
$$\mathrm{MgH}_{2}+2 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} \longrightarrow \mathrm{Mg}(\mathrm{OH})_{2}+2 \mathrm{H}_{2} \uparrow$$
it is not readily decomposed by heating
Magnesium nitrite $\mathbf{M g}_{\mathbf{2}} \mathbf{N}_{\mathbf{2}}$ The nitride is formed when magnesium is heated to redness in nitrogen or ammonium gas
$$3 \mathrm{Mg}+2 \mathrm{NH}_{3} \longrightarrow \mathrm{Mg}_{3} \mathrm{~N}_{2}+3 \mathrm{H}_{2} \uparrow$$

It is a very pale yellow solid which is decomposed by water to give ammonia
$$\mathrm{Mg}_{3} \mathrm{~N}_{2}+6 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} \longrightarrow 3 \mathrm{Mg}(\mathrm{OH})_{2}+2 \mathrm{NH}_{3}$$

Magnesium oxide MgO- The oxide is prepared by heating Magnesite $\mathrm{MgCO}_{3}$ or burning magnesium in oxygen. It is a basic oxide reacting with acids to give salt. With water magnesium hydroxide is formed slowly

Magnesium hydroxide $\mathbf{M g}(\mathbf{O H})_{\mathbf{2}}$ The hydroxide is only slightly soluble in water and is a white precipitated when hydroxide ions are added to a magnesium salts
$$\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}+2 \mathrm{OH}^{-} \longrightarrow \mathrm{Mg}(\mathrm{OH})_{2} \downarrow$$
it is not precipitated by ammonium hydroxide in the presence of excess ammonium chloride. (group III of the classical analysis table) the hydroxide is not soluble in excess caustic soda solution.

Magnesium carbonate $\mathbf{M g C O}_{3}$ The carbonate occurs naturally as magnesite. When solution containing magnesium and carbonate ions are mixed, a white precipitate is obtained. This is a basic carbonate and can have a variable composition. The normal carbonate is obtained if the action is carried out in the presence of carbon dioxide or by the addition of sodium bicarbonate to a solution of magnesium salt. No precipitate is obtained if ammonium carbonate is added to a solution of magnesium salt in the presence of ammonium chloride and ammonium hydroxide (group five of classical analysis table)

Magnesium carbonate is fairly insoluble in water, but if carbon dioxide is bubbled through a suspension in water, the soluble bicarbonate is formed
$$\mathrm{MgCO}_{3}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}+\mathrm{CO}_{2} \longrightarrow \mathrm{Mg}^{2+}+2 \mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$$

The reaction occurs naturally where magnesium carbonate is found and thereby causes the water to be temporarily hard. Magnesium carbonate evolves carbon dioxide on strong heating refractory bricks for lining furnaces are thus made by burning magnesite.

Magnesium sulfate $\mathbf{M g S O}_{\mathbf{4}}$-The sulfate is prepared by the usual method for sulfates and crystallizes as $\mathrm{MgSO}_{4} \cdot 7 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ (Epsom salt) on heating, the hydrate water is first lost and then sulfur trioxide leaving finally the oxide. This reaction shows the weaker basic character of magnesium compared with the alkali metals.

Magnesium fluoride $\mathbf{M g F}_{\mathbf{2}}$-The fluoride is sparingly soluble in water (the fluorides of group IIA are soluble)
Magnesium chloride $\mathbf{M g C l}_{\mathbf{2}}$ - The chloride form several hydrates. When a solution is crystallized at room temperature, the hexahydrate $\mathrm{MgCl}_{2} \cdot 6 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ is obtained. This deliquescent in air and is soluble in water. As mentioned hydrated magnesium chloride decomposes on heating to give the basic salts, the simplest of which is $\mathrm{Mg}(\mathrm{OH}) \mathrm{Cl}$
```
$\mathrm{MgCl}_{2} \cdot 6 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} \longrightarrow \mathrm{Mg}(\mathrm{OH}) \mathrm{Cl}+\mathrm{HCl} \uparrow+5 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$
```


The pure anhydrous chloride is prepared by heating the hexahydrate in a steam of dry hydrogen chloride (mass action effect). It can also be obtained from the double salt $\mathrm{MgCl}_{2} \cdot \mathrm{NH}_{4} \cdot 6 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$. This is prepared by evaporating an aqueous solution containing magnesium and ammonium chloride in equimolar proportion. On heating the crystals so obtained all the water is evolved without any hydrolysis occurring
$$\mathrm{MgCl}_{2} \cdot \mathrm{NH}_{4} \mathrm{Cl} \cdot 6 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} \longrightarrow \mathrm{MgCl}_{2} \cdot \mathrm{NH}_{4} \mathrm{Cl}+6 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} \uparrow$$

Further heating sublines of the ammonium chloride to leave pure anhydrous magnesium chloride
$\mathrm{MgCl}_{2} \cdot \mathrm{NH}_{4} \mathrm{Cl} \longrightarrow \mathrm{MgCl}_{2}+\mathrm{NH}_{4} \mathrm{Cl} \uparrow$

Magnesium oxide is somewhat soluble in magnesium chloride solution. The solution stiffens on standing and may be used as a cement-sorel's cement (in this behavior beryllium and magnesium are similar, for beryllium oxide dissolves in beryllium salts).

Magnesium bromide $\mathbf{M g B r}_{\mathbf{2}}$ and magnesium iodide $\mathbf{M g I}_{\mathbf{2}}$ These are similar to the chloride but dissolve in some organic solvents

Magnesium ammonium phosphate $\mathbf{M g N H}_{\mathbf{4}} \mathbf{P O}_{\mathbf{4}} \cdot \mathbf{H}_{\mathbf{2}} \mathbf{O}$-it's formed as a white crystalline precipitate when a solution of disodium hydrogen phosphate $\mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{HPO}_{4}$ is added to a solution of magnesium salt containing ammonium chloride and ammonia
$$6 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}+\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}+\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}+\mathrm{PO}_{4}^{3-} \longrightarrow \mathrm{MgNH}_{4} \mathrm{PO}_{4} \cdot 6 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} \downarrow$$

The formation of this precipitate is used as a test for magnesium in qualitative analysis (group IV) after all the other metals except the alkali metals have been removed. For most metals, give insoluble phosphates. The same reaction may be used to estimate magnesium gravimetrically. The precipitate is filtered off and strongly heated in a crucible when it decomposes
$$2 \mathrm{MgNH}_{4} \mathrm{PO}_{4} \cdot 6 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} \longrightarrow \underset{\text { magnesium pyrophosphate }}{\mathrm{Mg}_{2} \mathrm{P}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{7}+13 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} \uparrow}+2 \mathrm{NH}_{3} \uparrow$$
the pyrophosphate is cooled and weighed
Magnesium Perchlorate $\mathbf{M g C l O}_{4}$-It is an excellent drying agent (anhydrone) for use in a desiccator because it can take up almost half its own weight of water. The anhydrous salt can be obtained by heating.

\section*{Tests for magnesium}
1. Magnesium, ammonium phosphate
2. P-nitrobenzene-azo- $\alpha$-naphthol (magnesone II) is a dye stuff which absorbs magnesium hydroxide from a blue lake. Hence, if sodium hydroxide is added to a solution containing magnesium ion and this reagent a blue color is produced

\section*{Calcium}

\section*{Discovery and isolation}

In 1808 Davy prepared calcium amalgam by electrolysis of a moist mixture of lime and mercuric oxide using a mercury cathode. When the mercury was distilled off impure calcium was left

Occurrence- Calcium is too reactive to occur naturally as the element but its compounds occur widely and abundantly. Calcium carbonate $\mathrm{CaCO}_{3}$ is found as marble, limestone, chalk, calcite, aragonite and Iceland spar. Calcium sulfate $\mathrm{CaSO}_{4}$ occurs in the anhydrous state as anhydride and as the dihydrated gypsum and Alabaster found as minerals. Calcium phosphate $\mathrm{Ca}_{3}\left(\mathrm{PO}_{4}\right)_{2}$ and calcium fluoride $\mathrm{CaF}_{2}$ are also found in minerals. Calcium is an essential constituent of many living organisms, occurring, notably as skeletal material in bone, teeth, seashells and egg shells.

Extraction- Metallic calcium is obtained by the electrolysis of a fused mixture of calcium chloride and calcium fluoride- the latter reduces the melting point below that of the metallic calcium. The mixture is melted in a graphite pot which also acts as the anode. The cathode is an iron rod dipping into the molten mass and it's gradually raised as electrolysis proceeds. In this way a rod of calcium metal is formed with a film of solidified electrolyte round it to protect it from corrosion by air or attack by the chlorine at the anode

Physical Properties -Calcium is a greyish white; fairly hard metal with a silvery luster on exposure to air it becomes covered with a whitish powder consisting of the hydroxide $\mathrm{Ca}(\mathrm{OH})_{2}$ and trace of the nitride $\mathrm{Ca}_{2} \mathrm{~N}_{2}$. M.p. $842{ }^{\circ} \mathbf{C}(\mathbf{1 , 5 4 8} { }^{\circ} \mathbf{F ) ~ a n d ~ B . P . ~} 1,484{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\left(2,703{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{F}\right)$ density $\mathbf{1 . 5 5 ~ g} / \mathbf{c m}^{3}$

\section*{Chemical mproperties}

The metal will burn in air to give the oxide CaO and some nitride also, it dissolves rapidly but not violently, in water, evolving hydrogen and forming the sparingly soluble hydroxide
$$\mathrm{Ca}+2 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} \longrightarrow \mathrm{Ca}(\mathrm{OH})_{2}+\mathrm{H}_{2}$$

On heating in chlorine, it forms the chloride $\mathrm{CaCl}_{2}$ similarly, heating in hydrogen gives calcium hydride
$$\mathrm{Ca}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \longrightarrow \mathrm{CaH}_{2}$$
(Magnesium does not react so easily with hydrogen). Calcium dissolves in liquid ammonia and on evaporating the solution, the compound calcium ammoniate $\mathrm{Ca}\left(\mathrm{NH}_{3}{ }^{)}\right.$is left

Uses- Metallic calcium is used as a drying agent (e.g. to dehydrate alcohol with which unlike sodium, it does not react) as a deoxidizer for metals to remove oxygen from casting, as a getter. i.e. to remove the last trace of air from high vacuum and as an additive to lead to hardening it for use as cable covering or in bearing metal. Calcium or magnesium is also used to reduce uranium and plutonium tetrafluoride to their respective metals. This reduction being the final stage in their extraction. The reaction is carried out in a steel crucible lined with calcium fluoride as refractory, once started the strongly exothermic reaction maintains the necessary temperature for it to continue. The reaction is carried out in an atmosphere of argon.

\section*{Compounds of calcium}

Calcium forms fewer basic salts than does magnesium and most of its salts are not hydrolyzed by water characteristics in keeping with the relative position of these two elements in the, electrochemical series

Calcium hydride $\mathbf{C a H}_{\mathbf{2}}$-The hydride is prepared by passing hydrogen over calcium heated to $400^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.

\section*{$\mathrm{Ca}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \longrightarrow \mathrm{CaH}_{2}$}

It reacts vigorously with water liberating hydrogen
$$\mathrm{CaH}_{2}+2 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} \longrightarrow \mathrm{Ca}(\mathrm{OH})_{2}+2 \mathrm{H}_{2}$$

The compound is a useful source of hydrogen and 1 gram with water yields $1070 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$ at St STP (Lithium hydride LiH gives an even greater yield of $2800 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$ per gram and has been used as a portable source of hydrogen for filling balloons

\section*{Calcium oxide, quick lime CaO}

The oxide is formed when calcium is burned in oxygen
$2 \mathrm{Ca}+\mathrm{O}_{2} \longrightarrow 2 \mathrm{CaO}$

It has also been prepared by heating calcium nitrate or carbonate. On the large scale limestone calcium carbonate is heated in a lime kiln. A tall tower into the top of which lumps of limestone are fed, Producer gas (is fuel gas that is manufactured by blowing a coke or coal with air and steam simultaneously. It mainly consists of carbon monoxide, hydrogen, as well as substantial amounts of nitrogen) is introduced at the bottom and burns to raise the temperature of the descending lumps of limestone to about $1000^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. The reversible reaction
$$\mathrm{CaCO}_{3} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{CaO}+\mathrm{CO}_{2}$$

Proceeds in the forward direction as the carbon dioxide is carried away by the upward draught through the kiln. Pure calcium oxide may be prepared by igniting calcite in a platinum crucible. It is a white substance of very high melting point (about $2570^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ ). When heated in the Oxy coal gas flame, it becomes incandescent and emits a vivid white light, (limelight) on exposure to air it quickly absorbs moisture and carbon dioxide.
$$\begin{aligned}
& \mathrm{CaO}+\mathrm{CO}_{2} \longrightarrow \mathrm{CaCO}_{3} \\
& \mathrm{CaO}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} \longrightarrow \mathrm{Ca}(\mathrm{OH})_{2}+15 \mathrm{kcal}
\end{aligned}$$

The last equation shows that the reaction is of quicklime and water is strongly exothermic. The addition of a limited amount of water is called slaking and the product (solid calcium hydroxide) slaked lime. Calcium oxide is a basic oxide and in the presence of moisture reacts with gaseous acidic oxides forming salt eg
$$\mathrm{CaO}+\mathrm{SO}_{2} \longrightarrow \mathrm{CaSO}_{3}$$
at high temperature, it can react with solid acidic oxides, for example with silica and phosphorus pentoxide
$$\mathrm{CaO}+\mathrm{SiO}_{2} \rightarrow \mathrm{CaSiO}_{3}$$

This reaction occurs in the manufacture of sulfuric acid
$$3 \mathrm{CaO}+\mathrm{P}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{5} \longrightarrow \mathrm{Ca}_{3}\left(\mathrm{PO}_{4}\right)_{2}$$

This reaction occurs during the process of steel manufacturing.
Uses- Calcium oxide is used in the lab as a drying agent in desiccators and for drying organic liquids e.g. ethyl alcohol or to produce ammonia by heating with an ammonium salt. A combination of these uses is to be found when quicklime and ammonium chloride are placed together in a desiccator for the drying of moist crystals of amine salts e.g. hexa-amino-nickel bromide $\left[\mathrm{Ni}\left(\mathrm{NH}_{3}\right)_{6}\right] \mathrm{Br}_{2}$. The quick lime absorbs the moisture and at the same time, ammonia is liberated creating an atmosphere which prevents loss of ammonia from the amine salt.

Calcium hydroxide slaked lime $\mathbf{C a}(\mathbf{O H})_{\mathbf{2}}$-The hydroxide is made by the addition of a limited amount of water to quicklime and hence is alternatively called hydrated lime. It is sparingly soluble in water being less soluble in hot water than in cold. The solution is known as lime-water, which with a pH value greater than 7 is alkaline to litmus. A suspension of calcium hydroxide in water is called Milk of lime.

When carbon dioxide is passed through lime water, a precipitate of calcium carbonate is first formed
$$\mathrm{Ca}(\mathrm{OH})_{2}+\mathrm{CO}_{2} \longrightarrow \mathrm{CaCO}_{3} \downarrow+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$$

More carbon dioxide converts the soluble bicarbonate and so the precipitate dissolves
$$\mathrm{CaCO}_{3}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}+\mathrm{CO}_{2} \longrightarrow \mathrm{Ca}\left(\mathrm{HCO}_{3}\right)_{2}$$

This action occurs in nature and is the cause of most temporary hardness of water. The calcium carbonate is reprecipitated by adding lime
$$\mathrm{Ca}\left(\mathrm{HCO}_{3}\right)_{2}+\mathrm{Ca}(\mathrm{OH})_{2} \longrightarrow 2 \mathrm{CaCO}_{3} \downarrow+2 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$$

It is also re-precipitated by boiling
$$\mathrm{Ca}\left(\mathrm{HCO}_{3}\right)_{2} \longrightarrow \mathrm{CaCO}_{3} \downarrow+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}+\mathrm{CO}_{2}$$

These two reactions provide methods of removing temporary hardness. Water collected on the roof of a limestone cave containing calcium bicarbonate in solution. If a drop should collect slowly evaporation during collection occurs; the bicarbonate decomposes to the normal salt which then collects on roof. Stalactites are formed in this way. On the floor further evaporation of solution takes place and calcium carbonate is deposited to form a stalagmite. In the course of time, stalactite and stalagmite may grow to form a pillar

As with the hydroxide of the alkali metal, the action of chlorine with calcium hydroxide depends upon the temperature and the conditions thus, With cold Milk of lime, calcium hypochlorite $\mathrm{Ca}(\mathrm{ClO})_{2}$ is formed
$$2 \mathrm{Ca}(\mathrm{OH})_{2}+2 \mathrm{Cl}_{2} \longrightarrow \mathrm{CaCl}_{2}+\mathrm{Ca}(\mathrm{ClO})_{2}+2 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$$

With hot milk of lime calcium chlorate $\mathrm{Ca}\left(\mathrm{ClO}_{3}\right)_{2}$ is obtained
$$6 \mathrm{Ca}(\mathrm{OH})_{2}+6 \mathrm{Cl}_{2} \longrightarrow 5 \mathrm{CaCl}_{2}+\mathrm{Ca}(\mathrm{ClO})_{3}+6 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$$

With cold solid slaked lime, the substance bleaching powder is formed. Much speculation and argument have occurred about the chemical nature of the substance but in 1935, an examination of the crystals by means of a microscope and by X-ray diffraction showed that bleaching powder is a mixture of calcium hypochlorite and a basic calcium chloride
$$3 \mathrm{Ca}(\mathrm{OH})_{2}+2 \mathrm{Cl}_{2} \longrightarrow \mathrm{Ca}(\mathrm{ClO})_{2}+\mathrm{CaCl}_{2} \cdot \mathrm{Ca}(\mathrm{OH})_{2} \cdot \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$$

Uses- Slaked lime is widely used in the chemical industry for the removal of acid gases e.g. the removal of hydrogen sulfide from coal gas and for the preparation of ammonia from ammonium chloride in the ammonia soda process. The softening of temporary hard water, the manufacture of mortar and cement and the neutralization of excess acid in the soil are other uses of these compounds,

Mortar which is a mixture of slaked lime and sand made into a paste with water. Mortar sets by loss of water by evaporation and the slow conversion of the lime to calcium carbonate by carbon dioxide of the air. The sand prevents cracking of the mortar as it sets; there is little or no reaction between the lime and ordinary sand $\left(\mathrm{SiO}_{2}\right)$. In some districts where sand is scarce finely ground black ash (clinker sand) may be used and this gives the motor better setting power but a less attractive appearance.

Cement is the word commonly used to describe Portland cement. Though there are many different kinds of cement for special purpose

Portland cement is made by heating almost to fusion. Any mixture of substance containing calcium oxide ( $60-65 \%$ ), silica $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}(20-25 \%)$ and alumina $\mathrm{Al}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{2}(5-10 \%)$; part of the alumina can be replaced by ferric oxide. A suitable mixture is obtained as a byproduct in the manufacture of sulfur dioxide from anhydride. Usually limestone and clay are
used; these are grounds together finely and mixed with water to form a slurry which is fed into the upper end of an inclined steel rotating cylinder (rotary kiln) lined with bricks. As the slurry slides down the kiln It meets the powdered coal or gas flame which is at 1400 to $1600^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, the mixture is slightly sintered i.e. it melts and nodules of cement consisting essentially of calcium silicate and aluminate emerge from the bottom of the cylinder. These are cooled, ground to a powder and a little gypsum $\mathrm{CaSO}_{4} \cdot 2 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ added to retard the setting.

Concrete is a mixture of cement with sand and gravel or ballast (aggregates, common ratio $1: 2: 3$ ). The setting of cement or concrete is a complex process but examination of the setting with the electron microscope at a magnification of 20,000 has shown that long thread like crystals form throughout the mass of the material giving it hardness and strength. The crystals are hydrated salts and so concrete sets better if it is occasionally dampened while hardening and it will set a better underwater

Calcuim carbonate $\mathbf{C a C O}_{\mathbf{3}}$-The carbonates exists in two crystalline forms (i.e. it is dimorphous) which of calcite and aragonite. Calcite is the common form being found in limestone, chalk, Iceland spar (a very pure form), marble and in eggshells and seashells. Calcite is the stable and aragonite is metastable form at ordinary temperature but aragonite occurs in shells and corals and separates from hot Lime water when carbon dioxide is passed through

Calcium carbonate is only slightly soluble in pure water but dissolved slowly in water containing carbon dioxide due to the formation of calcium bicarbonate
$$\mathrm{CaCO}_{3}+\mathrm{CO}_{2}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{Ca}^{2+}+2 \mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$$

If calcium carbonate is heated in air the decomposition to the oxide is complete, but if heated in a closed vessel, it proceeds to an equilibrium position only

\section*{$\mathrm{CaCO}_{3} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{CaO}+\mathrm{CO}_{2}$}

Calcium carbonate like all carbonates, react with acids evolving carbon dioxide e.g.
$$\mathrm{CaCO}_{3}+2 \mathrm{HCl} \longrightarrow \mathrm{CaCl}_{2}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}+\mathrm{CO}_{2} \uparrow$$

Calcium fluoride $\mathbf{C a F}_{\mathbf{2}}$-Calcium fluoride is found naturally in fluorite or fluorspar. The pure salt is obtained by the reaction of calcium carbonate and dilute hydrofluoric acid. Unlike all the other halides of calcium, it is insoluble in water. When fluoride ions, (e.g. of potassium fluoride) are added to a solution of a calcium salt a gelatinous precipitate of calcium fluoride is formed, but this is partly colloidal and very difficult to filter and hence, is not suitable for the gravimetric estimation of calcium. Calcium fluoride reacts with concentrated sulfuric acid on heating to give hydrogen fluoride
$$\mathrm{CaF}_{2}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{SO}_{4} \longrightarrow \mathrm{CaSO}_{4}+2 \mathrm{HF} \uparrow$$

Calcium chloride $\mathbf{C a C l}_{\mathbf{2}} \cdot \mathbf{x H}_{\mathbf{2}} \mathbf{O}$-The hydrated chloride can be prepared in a pure state by the reaction of calcium carbonate with hydrochloric acid. The solution is evaporated to a syrup and then cooled when crystals of the deliquescent hexahydrate $\mathrm{CaCl}_{2} \cdot 6 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ are formed. Calcium Chloride is available commercially as a byproduct of the Solvay process and it is not easy to find a use for all that is produced. It has been used instead of salt to melt ice control, a $40 \%$ solution in water freezes at $-55^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, but the concentrated solution formed is slightly acidic and therefore corrosive to vehicles.

It has been scattered on the runway in coal pits to keep down the coal dust because of its deliquescence. A solution of the salt helps to bind the surface of a shale tennis court.

The hexahydrate melts on heating and loses water to form the dihydrate $\mathrm{CaCl}_{2} \cdot 2 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$. Further strong heating gives the anhydrous salt. The latter contains a small amount of calcium oxide due to the reaction which occurs at the temperature of dehydration
$$\mathrm{Ca}^{2}+2 \mathrm{Cl}^{-}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} \longrightarrow \mathrm{CaO}+2 \mathrm{HCl} \uparrow$$

Calcium Chloride is very soluble in water and soluble in alcohol. The anhydrous salt dissolves with evolution of considerable heat. It will also absorb ammonia and alcohol, giving compounds such as $\mathrm{CaCl}_{2} .8 \mathrm{NH}_{3}$ and $\mathrm{CaCl}_{2} .4 \mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{OH}$. Because of this tendency to form addition compounds with substances containing - OH or $-\mathrm{NH}_{3}$ groups e.g. alcohol, ammonia. Calcium chloride cannot be used to dry such substances.

Bleaching powder - the preparation of this substance and its constitution have been given. On a large scale bleaching powder is made by passing a current of chlorine up a slightly inclined cylinder. Slaked lime is fed in at the upper end and passes down the cylinder against the chlorine stream; the lime is brought into contact with the chlorine by stirring it with revolving helical blades along the cylinder

In writing equation for the reaction of bleaching powder, Its formula may be written as $\mathrm{Ca}(\mathrm{ClO})_{2} \cdot \mathrm{Ca}(\mathrm{OH})_{2} \cdot \mathrm{CaCl}_{2}$ if it is always, remembered that it contains a basic chloride; bleaching powder is far less deliquescent than if it contained free calcium chloride.

Bleaching powder is a white solid, very slightly soluble in water. The solid reacts with carbon dioxide in the air.
$$\mathrm{Ca}(\mathrm{ClO})_{2} \cdot \mathrm{Ca}(\mathrm{OH})_{2} \cdot \mathrm{CaCl}_{2}+2 \mathrm{CO}_{2} \longrightarrow 2 \mathrm{CaCO}_{3}+\mathrm{CaCl}_{2}+2 \mathrm{HClO}$$

The hypochlorous acid formed then decomposes
$$2 \mathrm{HClO} \longrightarrow 2 \mathrm{HCl}+\mathrm{O}_{2} \uparrow$$
hydrochlorous acid so formed can react with more hypochlorous acid to give chlorine
$$\mathrm{HCl}+\mathrm{HClO} \longrightarrow \mathrm{Cl}_{2} \uparrow+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$$
the oxygen forming action is catalyzed by light and by the presence of salts of cobalt, iron and nickel, hence bleaching powder can evolve oxygen and chlorine in air, but only oxygen is set free in the presence of a catalyst since, in this case all the hypochlorous acid is used up rapidly in the oxygen forming action. Indeed if a suspension of bleaching powder in water is shaken with a small amount of cobalt salt. Oxygen is evolved briskly by the direct decomposition of the hypochlorite ion, (which comes from the calcium hypochlorite of the bleaching powder) thus
$$2 \mathrm{ClO}^{-} \longrightarrow 2 \mathrm{Cl}^{-}+\mathrm{O}_{2} \uparrow$$
the bleaching power of bleaching powder arises from the formation of hypochlorous acid in the presence of air containing carbon dioxide and therefore it bleaching by oxidation.

Bleaching powder shows other oxidation actions because of its hypochlorite content. In the following equation representing some of these oxidations, only the hypochlorite ion is represented. Bleaching powder oxidizes ammonia to nitrogen
$$3 \mathrm{ClO}^{-}+2 \mathrm{NH}_{3} \longrightarrow 3 \mathrm{Cl}^{-}+3 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}+\mathrm{N}_{2} \uparrow$$

It liberates iodine from an acidified solution containing iodide ions e.g. potassium iodide
$$\mathrm{ClO}^{-}+2 \mathrm{I}^{-}+2 \mathrm{H}^{+} \longrightarrow \mathrm{Cl}^{-}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}+\mathrm{I}_{2}$$

In acidic solution it oxidizes ferrous to ferric salt, I.e. $\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}$ to $\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}$ ion
$$\mathrm{ClO}^{-}+2 \mathrm{Fe}^{2+}+2 \mathrm{H}^{+} \longrightarrow \mathrm{Cl}^{-}+2 \mathrm{Fe}^{3+}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$$
it precipitates certain metallic dioxides from solution of the corresponding salt e.g. lead dioxide from lead nitrate solution. The first reaction is with the calcium hydroxide content of the bleaching powder
$$\mathrm{Pb}^{2+}+2 \mathrm{OH}^{-} \longrightarrow \underset{\text { white }}{\mathrm{Pb}(\mathrm{OH})_{2} \downarrow}$$

The white precipitate of lead hydroxide (or hydrated lead monoxide) rapidly turns brown particularly if warmed as it is oxidized to the dioxide
$$\mathrm{Pb}(\mathrm{OH})_{2}+\mathrm{ClO}^{-} \longrightarrow \underset{\text { brown }}{\mathrm{PbO}_{2} \downarrow}+\mathrm{Cl}^{-}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$$

Dilute nitric acid (which does not react with the lead dioxide) is then added to dissolve excessive bleaching powder and the brown lead dioxide is filtered off, washed and dried. This is a good method of preparing the compounds.

Manganese salts are similarly oxidized to manganese dioxide. Hence, however, the brown hydrated compounds is obtained. This is converted to the black anhydrous dioxide by gently heating. If a dilute acid is added, to bleaching powder, chlorine is liberated
$$\begin{gathered}
\mathrm{Ca}(\mathrm{ClO})_{2} \cdot \mathrm{Ca}(\mathrm{OH})_{2} \cdot \mathrm{CaCl}_{2}+3 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{SO}_{4} \longrightarrow 3 \mathrm{CaSO}_{4} \downarrow+4 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}+2 \mathrm{Cl}_{2} \uparrow \\
\mathrm{Ca}(\mathrm{ClO})_{2} \cdot \mathrm{Ca}(\mathrm{OH})_{2} \cdot \mathrm{CaCl}_{2}+6 \mathrm{HCl} \longrightarrow 3 \mathrm{CaCl}_{2}+4 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}+2 \mathrm{Cl}_{2} \uparrow
\end{gathered}$$

If the bleaching powder is actually $\left[\mathrm{Ca}(\mathrm{ClO})_{2} \cdot \mathrm{Ca}(\mathrm{OH})_{2} \cdot \mathrm{CaCl}_{2} \cdot \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}\right]$ then 100 grams should liberate 41 grams of chlorine (i.e. $41 \%$ ) by the above reaction, a good specimen of bleaching powder rarely yields above $40 \%$ Because chlorination of slaked lime gives small amounts of calcium chloride and chlorate as well as bleaching powder. Ordinary commercial product yields 36 to $40 \%$ of chlorine known as available chlorine. A lower yield indicates that the sample has deteriorated or that it has been incompletely chlorinated. The percentage of available chlorine is readily determined by means of reactions above.

The estimation is carried out practically as follows. An acidified solution of potassium iodide (in excess) is added to a known weight of bleaching powder in water suspension
$$\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{Ca}(\mathrm{ClO})_{2} \cdot \mathrm{Ca}(\mathrm{OH})_{2} \cdot \mathrm{CaCl}_{2}+6 \mathrm{HCl} & +4 \mathrm{KI} \\
& \longrightarrow 3 \mathrm{CaCl}_{2}+4 \mathrm{KCl}+4 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}+2 \mathrm{I}_{2}
\end{aligned}$$

The iodine liberated is titrated with standard sodium thiosulfate. The iodine found is equivalent to the available chlorine
$$2 \mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{~S}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3} \equiv \mathrm{I}_{2} \equiv \mathrm{Cl}_{2}$$

Alternatively, a known amount (in excess) of a solution of ferrous sulfate, acidified with dilute sulfuric acid is added to a known weight of bleaching powder in water suspension
$$\begin{aligned}
& \mathrm{Ca}(\mathrm{ClO})_{2} \cdot \mathrm{Ca}(\mathrm{OH})_{2} \cdot \mathrm{CaCl}_{2}+4 \mathrm{FeSO}_{4}+3 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{SO}_{4} \\
& \longrightarrow 2 \mathrm{CaCl}_{2}+\mathrm{CaSO}_{4}+2 \mathrm{Fe}_{2}\left(\mathrm{SO}_{4}\right)_{3}+4 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}
\end{aligned}$$

The resulting mixture is then treated with a standard potassium permanganate to determine the amount of unchanged ferrous salt and hence, that amount which was oxidized by the bleaching powder.

Bleaching powder has been used for sterilizing water, as a raw material in the manufacture of chloroform and for bleaching Paper-pulp and fabrics. The fabrics are immersed in a very dilute solution of the powder and then exposed to the air when the carbon dioxide liberated the hypochlorous acid which effects the bleaching. For water sterilization, direct chlorination from cylinders of the gas is now more commonly used and bleaching is effected more readily by the soluble hypochlorite e.g. NaClO or by chlorine dioxide. Production of bleaching powder is thus decreasing

Calcium sulfate $\mathbf{C a S O}_{\mathbf{4}}$-The sulfate occurs naturally as anhydrite (in large deposits in Cumberland and Durham) and as the dihydrate $\mathrm{CaSO}_{4} .2 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ (gypsum, Selenite, alabaster) It is found in natural water and is then the cause of permanent hardness. It is however only sparingly soluble in water and can be precipitated by adding sulfuric acid to a solution of a calcium salt.

When Gypsum is heated, it first loses water from the hemihydrate $\mathbf{2 C a S O}_{\mathbf{4}} \cdot \mathbf{H}_{\mathbf{2}} \mathbf{O}$ i.e. the crystals contain one molecule of water for every two calcium and every two sulfate ions. This is known as Plaster of Paris, which with water is rapidly reconverted to gypsum the must setting to a solid. Slight expansion occurs on setting and plaster of Paris is therefore used for making casts. It is also used for setting broken limbs to ensure correct healing.

If gypsum is heated above $200^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ it loses all its water of crystallization and then has little capacity to rehydrate. It is said to be dead burnt; if dehydrated gypsum (or anhydrite) is heated to $1200^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ slight decomposition occurs indicating some weakness in basic character in comparison with group IA metals
$$2 \mathrm{CaSO}_{4} \rightleftharpoons 2 \mathrm{CaO}+2 \mathrm{SO}_{2}+\mathrm{O}_{2}$$

The solid remaining has been used as a mortar. To release sulfur dioxide from anhydrite quantitatively the latter is heated with coke. Calcium sulfide is first formed
$$\mathrm{CaSO}_{4}+2 \mathrm{C} \longrightarrow \mathrm{CaS}+2 \mathrm{CO}_{2} \uparrow$$
at $1200^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ however, calcium sulfide reacts with anhydrite
$$\mathrm{CaS}+3 \mathrm{CaSO}_{4} \rightleftharpoons 4 \mathrm{CaO}+4 \mathrm{SO}_{2} \uparrow$$

The reaction is driven forward by adding acidic oxides to remove the lime
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/7ef96b79-0db7-494d-80b3-f46f1a506ae0-53.jpg?height=145&width=987&top_left_y=1912&top_left_x=73)

The residue then contains the necessary constituents of Portland cement. Hence, if the action is carried out in rotary kiln sulfur dioxide passes out at the top and cement clinker is obtained at the bottom. This process of obtaining sulfur dioxide from natural anhydrite is now an important initial stage in sulfuric acid manufacturers.

Calcium bisulfite $\mathbf{C a}\left(\mathbf{H S O}_{\mathbf{3}}\right)_{\mathbf{2}}$ - The bisulfite is prepared by passing excess sulfur dioxide into milk of lime
$$\mathrm{Ca}(\mathrm{OH})_{2}+2 \mathrm{SO}_{2} \longrightarrow \mathrm{Ca}\left(\mathrm{HSO}_{3}\right)_{2}$$

It is used to remove the lignin from wood pulp leaving behind the cellulose for paper making.

Calcium nitrate $\left(\mathbf{C a N O}_{\mathbf{3}}\right)_{\mathbf{2}}$-The nitrate is deliquescent and very soluble in water. It crystallizes as $\mathrm{Ca}\left(\mathrm{NO}_{3}\right)_{2} \cdot 4 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$. Heating first gives the anhydrous salt and then nitrogen dioxide and oxygen are evolved.

Calcium carbide, calcium acetylide $\mathbf{C a C}_{\mathbf{2}}$ - The carbide is made by heating a mixture of calcium oxide and coke to a very high temperature (about $2000^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ ) in an electric furnace
$\mathrm{CaO}+3 \mathrm{C} \longrightarrow \mathrm{CaC}_{2}+\mathrm{CO} \uparrow$
On adding of water it yields acetylene
$$\mathrm{CaC}_{2}+2 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} \longrightarrow \mathrm{C}_{2} \mathrm{H}_{2} \uparrow+\mathrm{Ca}(\mathrm{OH})_{2}$$

Calcium carbide is thus an important raw material for the manufacture of many organic substances e.g. acetaldehyde, acetic acid where acetylene is an intermediate. If calcium carbide is heated in a stream of nitrogen, calcium cyanamide $\mathrm{CaCN}_{2}$ and is formed
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/7ef96b79-0db7-494d-80b3-f46f1a506ae0-54.jpg?height=121&width=822&top_left_y=863&top_left_x=51)

The resulting black mixture is used as a fertilizer (nitrolime) the calcium cyanamide slowly liberates ammonia with water
$$\mathrm{CaCN}_{2}+3 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} \longrightarrow 2 \mathrm{NH}_{3}+\mathrm{CaCO}_{3}$$

The ammonia is absorbed into the soil and the calcium carbonate formed is, of course, beneficial also.

\section*{Test for calcium}
- Flame test- orange-red
- Ammonium carbonate gives a white precipitate of calcium carbonate.
- Ammonium oxalate gives a white precipitate of calcium oxalate. This can be used to estimate calcium gravimetrically the precipitate is filtered out washed ignited and weighed as calcium oxide

Strontium and barium These two elements are similar to one another in properties, and together they resemble calcium in many respects. They will therefore be considered together and the difference from calcium will be noted.
- The metals are similar to calcium but more reactive e.g. finely divided barium inflames in air. This increased reactivity is an indication of the more electropositive characteristic which is to be expected as we descend a group in the periodic table.
- The hydrides are more easily formed than that of calcium; thus Barium hydride, $\mathrm{BaH}_{2}$ is formed by the action of hydrogen on barium even at room temperature.
- The oxides are similar to that of calcium but there is an increased tendency to unite directly with oxygen to give peroxides. Thus, calcium oxide will not unite directly with oxygen. Strontium oxide combines with it at $400^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ and barium oxide at dull red heat giving $\mathrm{SrO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{BaO}_{2}$ respectively. (Calcium peroxide $\mathrm{CaO}_{2}$, can be made by adding sodium peroxide to concentrated calcium chloride solution. The anhydrous peroxide precipitates from one solution,
- The hydroxides are stronger bases than calcium hydroxide and are more soluble in water characteristics to be expected by the position of the metal within the group. Barium hydroxide is sometimes used as a standard alkali in volumetric analysis instead of caustic soda since; any carbonate formed is precipitated and does not interfere with the color change of the indicator. (If caustic soda containing sodium carbonate is used to titrate a weak acid using phenolphthalein as indicator a poor endpoint is obtained.) ${ }_{\text {This document is available on }}^{53}$ studocu
- The carbonates are more stable to heat than that of calcium. Barium carbonate can be heated in a blowpipe flame without any change.
- The fluorides are insoluble and the chlorides soluble in water like those of calcium and similarly, the chlorides form hydrated crystals.
- The sulfates are less soluble in water than that of calcium and barium sulfate is readily precipitate when sulfate ions are added to a barium salt or vice versa
$$\mathrm{Ba}^{2+}+\mathrm{SO}_{4}{ }^{2-} \longrightarrow \mathrm{BaSO}_{4} \downarrow$$

This reaction is used to determine sulfate of barium gravimetrically. The precipitate of barium sulfate is filtered off, washed and heated to dryness.

Complex of Alkaline Earth Metal- Smaller alkaline earth metals form complexes. Beryllium forms many complexes with mono, di and tetradentate ligands. Examples: $\left[\mathrm{BeF}_{3}\right]^{-},\left[\mathrm{BeF}_{4}\right]^{2-},\left[\mathrm{Be}\left(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{C}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{4}\right)\right]^{2-},\left[\mathrm{Be}_{4} \mathrm{O}(\mathrm{R})_{6}\right]$, where R may be $\mathrm{NO}_{3}{ }^{-}, \mathrm{HCOO}^{-}, \mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{COO}^{-}$etc.

\section*{Medical uses of alkali earth metals}

Magnesium: There are three stable isotopes of magnesium, namely 24 Mg ( $79 \%$ occurrence), 25 Mg and 26 Mg .28 Mg is radioactive with a half-life of 21 h .

Most magnesium salts are soluble in water, and given in large amounts they work as a laxative in the human body. Aqueous magnesium ions are sour in taste. Magnesium hydroxide $(\mathrm{MgOH} 2)$ has only limited solubility in water and the resulting suspension is called milk of magnesia, which is commonly used as an antacid and is known to be a mild base.
Biological importance- $\mathbf{M g}^{\mathbf{2 +}}$ is an essential ion in the human body and is a crucial constituent in numerous enzymatic processes. Indeed, $\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ is essential to most living cells as a signaling molecule and is involved in nucleic acid biochemistry dealing with the manipulation of ATP (adenosine triphosphate), DNA, RNA and related processes For example, ATP has to be coordinated to a magnesium ion in order to become biologically active. $\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ also stabilises DNA and RNA structures, which can be seen in their increased melting points. $\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ ions form the redox-active centre in chlorophyll, which facilitates the process of photosynthesis and the connected carbon fixation in green plants, magnesium salts are generally not well absorbed from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and therefore are often used as osmotic laxatives. The kidneys regulate the magnesium ion levels in plasma, and as a result high levels of $\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ are retained when the patient has renal failure. The resulting hypermagnesia can cause muscle weakness and arrhythmia, but it is a rare condition. Hypomagnesia, defined as low magnesium levels in the blood plasma, can be the result of losses in the GI tract, for example, excessive diarrhoea. Magnesium imbalances can also be a result of alcoholism or secondary to treatment with certain drugs. Hypomagnesia is often followed by hypocalcaemia (low calcium ion plasma levels) as well as hypokalaemia and hyponatraemia

\section*{Clinical applications and preparations of magnesium}

Magnesium ion preparations are also used as antacids, mostly in combination with aluminium-based salts.
Magnesium salts are involved in the treatment of arrhythmia (irregular heart beat) and eclampsia, a life-threatening hypertensive disorder in pregnant women.
Symptomatic hypomagnesaemia is associated with plasma serum $\mathrm{Mg} 2+$ levels of $<0.5-1 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{kg}$ for a period of 5 days or more. $\mathrm{Mg} 2+$ ions are initially given as intravenous (i.v.) or intramuscular injection; the latter is fairly painful and consisting of magnesium sulfate ( MgSO 4 ). MgSO 4 can also be used as emergency treatment for very serious arrhythmias, a disorder of the heart rate (pulse). In an emergency treatment, it is usually given intravenously as one single dose or with one repeat
Note that the plasma magnesium concentration should be monitored, and the dose has to be reduced in patients with renal impairment as $\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ is excreted via the kidneys. Magnesium ions can also be given orally to the patient, for example, in the form of magnesium glycerophosphate tablets.
Magnesium hydroxide $[\mathbf{M g}(\mathbf{O H}) \mathbf{2}]$ is present in antacids because of its laxative properties and is also the main ingredient of the 'milk of magnesia'. The 'milk of magnesia' is a suspension of $\mathrm{Mg}(\mathrm{OH})_{2}$ in water, which has a milklike appearance because of the low aqueous solubility of $\mathrm{Mg}(\mathrm{OH})_{2}$. It is considered as a strong electrolyte and a weak base and is given to the patient for indigestion and heartburn. The alkaline suspension neutralizes any excess stomach acid and therefore works as an antacid. It also stimulates intestinal movement, as the magnesium ions increases the water content in the intestines through its osmotic effect and as a result softens any faeces present.
Magnesium trisilicate $\left(\mathbf{M g}_{\mathbf{2}} \mathbf{S i}_{\mathbf{3}} \mathbf{O}_{\mathbf{8}}\right)$ can also be used in antacid preparations especially in the treatment of peptic ulcers. The mode of action includes the increase of the pH of the gastric fluid together with the formation of a colloidal silica precipitate, which forms a protection for the GI mucosa. Most antacids contain a mixture of aluminium hydroxide $\left[\mathrm{Al}(\mathrm{OH})_{3}\right]$ and magnesium and/or calcium preparations.
Orally taken magnesium salts can show interactions with other drugs taken simultaneously. Magnesium trisilicate reduces the absorption of iron products, certain antibiotics (such as Nitrofurantoin) or antimalarial drugs (such as Proguanil). Magnesium salt preparations, which form part of antacids, are not recommended to be taken at the same time as a variety of drugs such as ACE inhibitors, aspirin and penicillamine. In most cases, antacids reduce the absorption of the simultaneously taken drug. Therefore, before any treatment with antacids, the full medical history of the patient should be taken and possible interactions assessed

Magnesium oxide is used to treat constipation, Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), hypomagnesaemia, kidney stones, gastro esophageal reflux disease and gastric ulcer. Magnesium citrate is a hyper osmotic saline laxative which is used to treat constipation, kidney stones, colon and rectal diseases.

Calcium: the key to many human functions- $\mathrm{Ca}_{2+}$ has numerous intra and extracellular physiological roles, for example, a universal role as messenger and mediator for cardiac, skeletal and smooth muscle contractions. Calcium ions are a critical factor in several life-defining biochemical processes as well as in the endocrine, neural and renal aspects of blood pressure homeostasis.

Calcium ions play important roles in the human body in a variety of neurological and endocrinological processes. Calcium is known as a cellular messenger and it has a large intra- versus extracellular gradient ( $1: 10000$ ), which is highly regulated by hormones. This gradient is necessary to maintain the cellular responsiveness to diverse extracellular stimuli. Calcium ions are also involved in the formation of bones and teeth, which act also as a reservoir for calcium ions.
Calcium arsenate $\left[\mathbf{C a}_{\mathbf{3}}\left(\mathbf{A s O}_{\mathbf{4}}\right)_{\mathbf{2}}\right]$ is extremely poisonous and is used in insecticides.
Calcium carbonate $\left(\mathbf{C a C O}_{\mathbf{3}}\right)$ can be found in clinical applications such as antacids, but note that an excessive intake can be hazardous.
Calcium chloride ( $\mathbf{C a C l}_{\mathbf{2}}$ ) is used in ice removal and dust control on dirt roads, as a conditioner for concrete and as an additive in canned tomatoes.
Calcium cyclamate $\left[\mathbf{C a}\left(\mathbf{C}_{\mathbf{6}} \mathbf{H}_{\mathbf{1 1}} \mathbf{N H S O}_{\mathbf{4}}\right)_{\mathbf{2}}\right]$ is used as a sweetening agent, and calcium gluconate $\left[\mathrm{Ca}\left(\mathrm{C}_{6} \mathrm{H}_{11} \mathrm{O}_{7}\right)_{2}\right]$ is used as a food additive in vitamin pills.
Calcium hypochlorite $\mathbf{C a}(\mathbf{O C l})_{\mathbf{2}}$ can be found in swimming pool disinfectants, in bleaching agents, in deodorants and in fungicides.
Calcium permanganate $\left[\mathbf{C a}\left(\mathbf{M n O}_{\mathbf{4}}\right)_{\mathbf{2}}\right]$ is used in textile production, as a water-sterilising agent and in dental procedures.
Calcuim phosphate $\left[\mathbf{C a}_{\mathbf{3}}\left(\mathbf{P O}_{\mathbf{4}}\right)_{\mathbf{2}}\right]$ finds applications as a supplement for animal feed, as a fertiliser, in the manufacture of glass and in dental products.
Calcium sulfate $\boldsymbol{(} \mathbf{C a S O}_{\mathbf{4}} \cdot \mathbf{2} \mathbf{H}_{\mathbf{2}} \mathbf{O} \boldsymbol{)}$ is the common blackboard chalk.
Plaster of Paris [Calcium hemihydrate, $\mathbf{C a S O}_{\mathbf{4}} \cdot \mathbf{1} \mathbf{2 H}_{\mathbf{2}} \mathbf{O}$ ]- Naturally, available gypsum is calcium sulphate dihydrate $\left(\mathrm{CaSO}_{4} .2 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}\right)$. It exists in the monoclinic crystal structure. An aqueous solution of soluble calcium salts like nitrates or chlorides on treatment with dilute sulphuric acid precipitates out hydrous calcium sulphate. On heating in a carbonfree environment (otherwise calcium sulphate is reduced to calcium sulphite), depending on the temperature monoclinic gypsum undergoes various transformations. It hardens first into another orthorhombic allotropy form.
- At $\mathbf{1 2 0}^{\circ} \mathbf{C}$ : Some of the water of hydration is last to yield calcium sulphate hemihydrate, called as Plaster of Paris.
- On heating to $\mathbf{2 0 0}^{\circ} \mathbf{C}$ : It loses the remaining water and becomes anhydrous calcium sulphate called "dead burnt Plaster".
- At $\mathbf{4 0 0}^{\circ} \mathbf{C}$ : Calcium Sulphate decomposes into calcium oxide and evolving Sulphur dioxide and oxygen.

Properties- A paste of this hemihydrate with about one-third of water sets to a hard mass, in any moulding, in about 15 minutes. Added water may rehydrate the hemihydrate into dihydrate.
- Salts like sodium chloride accelerates the hydration to reduce the setting time, while alum or borax reduce the hydration to increase the setting time of hardening.
- It is used much in decorating surfaces, making false ceilings, bondages in surgical treatment, dentistry, etc.

Biological importance of calcium- A normal adult body contains $\sim 1000 \mathrm{~g}$ of calcium, of which around $99 \%$ are extracellular and most of which is stored in bones and teeth. Bones actually serve as a dynamic store for $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$. The remaining $1 \%$ of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ can be found in the extracellular space, such as plasma, lymph and extracellular water. The intra and extracellular $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ concentration is extremely important to many physiological functions and is therefore rigorously controlled
Renal osteodystrophy- Renal osteodystrophy, also called renal bone disease, is a bone mineralisation deficiency seen in patients with chronic or end-stage renal failure.
Vitamin D is usually activated in the liver to the pro-hormone calcidiol and then in the kidney to calcitriol,
Clinical application of calcium
Calcium supplements are usually required only if the dietary $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ intake is insufficient. As previously mentioned, the dietary requirements depend on the age and circumstances; for example, an increased need can be seen in children, in pregnant women and in the elderly where absorption is impaired. In severe acute hypocalcaemia, a slow i.v. injection of a $\mathbf{1 0 \%}$ calcium gluconate has been recommended. It has to be kept in mind that the plasma $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ level and any changes to the electrocardiogram (ECG) have to be carefully monitored.
A variety of calcium salts are used for clinical application, including calcium carbonate, calcium chloride, calcium phosphate, calcium lactate, calcium aspartate and calcium gluconate. Calcium carbonate is the most common and least
expensive calcium supplement. It can be difficult to digest and may cause gas in some people because of the reaction of stomach HCl with the carbonate and the subsequent production of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$
Calcium carbonate is recommended to be taken with food, and the absorption rate in the intestine depends on the pH levels. Taking magnesium salts with it can help prevent constipation. Calcium carbonate consists of $40 \% \mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$, which means that 1000 mg of the salt contains around 400 mg of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$. Often, labels will only indicate the amount of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ present in each tablet and not the amount of calcium carbonate.
Calcium citrate is more easily absorbed (bioavailability is 2.5 times higher than calcium carbonate); it is easier to digest and less likely to cause constipation and gas than calcium carbonate. Calcium citrate can be taken without food and is more easily absorbed than calcium carbonate on an empty stomach. It is also believed that it contributes less to the formation of kidney stones. Calcium citrate consists of around $24 \% \mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$, which means that 1000 mg calcium citrate contains around $240 \mathrm{mg} \mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$. The lower $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ content together with the higher price makes it a more expensive treatment option compared to calcium carbonate, but its slightly different application field can justify this. The properties of calcium lactate are similar to those of calcium carbonate, but the former is usually more expensive.
Calcium lactate contains effectively less $\mathrm{Ca} 2+$ per gram salt than, for example, calcium carbonate. Calcium lactate consists of only $18 \% \mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$, making it a less 'concentrated' salt Calcium gluconate is prescribed as a calcium supplement, but it is also used in the urgent treatment of hyperkalaemia ( $\mathrm{K}^{+}$plasma levels above $6.5 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{l}$ ).
Hyperkaleamia in the presence of ECG changes usually requires immediate treatment, and a $10 \%$ calcium gluconate solution intravenously administered is recommended (see Section 2.4.4). Administration of the calcium solution does not lower the plasma $\mathrm{K}^{+}$level but protects temporarily against myocardial excitability and therefore temporarily reduces the toxic effects of hyperkalaemia.
Calcium gluconate contains effectively the least $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ per amount of supplement (only around $9 \%$ ). That means that in 1000 mg calcium gluconate, only 90 mg is actual $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$
Barium salts can be highly toxic even at low concentrations.
Barium carbonate is highly toxic and can be used as rat poison as it readily dissolves in the stomach acid.
Barium sulfate is the least toxic barium compound mainly because of its insolubility. Barium sulfate is used in a variety of applications ranging from white paint to X-ray contrast agent. The clinical use of barium sulfate suspension is well known under the term barium meal. Patients are given a suspension of barium sulfate to swallow. Using X-ray imaging, the whole oesophagus, the stomach and the intestines can be visualised. Barium sulfate lines the tissue whilst travelling through the digestive tract. The heavy barium ions absorb X-rays readily and therefore these structures become visible in an X-ray screening. Barium sulfate is a well-used and tolerated oral radio-contrast agent. It is also used as radio-contrast agent in enemas.

Health effects of barium: People with the greatest risk to barium exposure with additional health effects are those that work in the barium industry. Most of the health risks that they can undergo are caused by breathing in air that contains barium sulphate or barium carbonate. The exposure will then be caused by breathing dust, eating soil or plants, or drinking water that is polluted with barium. Skin contact may also occur. The health effects of barium depend upon the water-solubility of the compounds. Barium compounds that dissolve in water can be harmful to human health. The uptake of very large amounts of barium that are water-soluble may cause paralyses and in some cases even death. Small amounts of water-soluble barium may cause a person to experience breathing difficulties, increased blood pressures, heart rhythm changes, stomach irritation, muscle weakness, changes in nerve reflexes, swelling of brains and liver, kidney and heart damage. Barium has not shown to cause cancer with humans. There is no proof that barium can cause infertility or birth defects.

Beryllium foil is used for radiation windows in scientific X-ray equipment. Beryllium mammography equipment enables to scan the finer tumor resolution and detect the breast cancer at its early, most treatable stages.

Medical lasers made with berylliaceramic help ophthalmologists to improve or restore eyesight for millions. Beryllium is also used in components of the analytical equipment used to analyze blood for HIV and other diseases.

Beryllium and chronic beryllium disease- Beryllium and its compounds are extremely poisonous and therefore there is only a very limited potential for their clinical applications. Indeed, even the inhalation of beryllium or its compounds can lead to serious respiratory diseases such as the chronic beryllium disease, and soluble beryllium compounds can cause serious skin irritations. Workers within the metal production industry are most likely exposed to beryllium and

such as administrative staff or families are at high risk of beryllium poisoning. Symptoms are not well reported, may occur many years after the exposure and include cough, fatigue and chest pain, whereas non-respiratory organs can also be affected.

\section*{BIOLOGICAL IMPORTANCE OF RADIUM}
- Radium chloride is used in medicine as a cancer treatment. Radium-223 isotope is currently under investigated to use as a medicine for cancer treatment to use as a medicine for cancer treatment of bone-metastasis. Using preparations of radium salt in bath water can treat arthritis, gout \& neuralgias.
- Radium therapy is used to prevent lupus, ulcerous growth \& keloid. Iodo-radium therapy is used for the treatment of tuberculosis. Radioactive iodine which produces from radium and iodine is used as a treatment of thyrotoxicosis and some types of thyroid cancer that absorb iodine.

Strontium - Strontium and calcium are chemically similar, and strontium toxicity is mainly due to strontium mimicking calcium within the body.

Potassium or calcium thioglycolate- used as a depilatory agent (removes hair). function by dissolving the keratin (a protein that gives strength to hair) in the hair shaft. Barium salt may damage the liver.
