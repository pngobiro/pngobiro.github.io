Later on, these substances were differentiated as food stuffs and therapeutic agents, as man tried to explore and utilize these natural products for treating the ailments. Thus, their utility to remove the disorders earned them the title-drug (originally from French language).</p>

                            <p>As mentioned in Papyrus Ebers, an old document written in 1500 B.C., Egyptians were aware of medicinal uses of several plants and animals and also about human anatomy. The great Greek physician Hippocrates (460 – 360 B.C.) known as 'Father of Medicine', dealt with anatomy and physiology of human beings. Aristotle, the renowned philosopher (384 – 322 B.C.), is well known for his studies on animal kingdom and Theophrastus (370 – 287 B.C.) for plant kingdom.</p>

                            <p>Dioscorides, a Greek physician in 78 A.D. described several plants of medicinal importance in "De Materia Medica". It was Pliny the Eider (23 – 70 A.D.), who compiled 37 volumes of natural history. Greek Pharmacist Galen (131 – 200 A.D.) described various methods of preparation containing active constituents of crude drugs, and even at present the branch dealing with the extraction of plant and animal drugs is known as Galenical Pharmacy.</p>

                            <p>Gradually, all the natural products, utilized by physicians were compiled together to form the 'Materia Medica' giving their detailed information. The products from plants, animals and mineral origin are the three broad classes of naturally occurring drugs.</p>

                            <p>Indian history of medicinal plants is dated back to 3500 B.C. The curative properties of plants have been mentioned in the Suktas of Rigveda and Atharvaveda. Ayurveda has also described good number of plants with their therapeutic properties. The ancient well known treatises in Ayurveda are Charak Samhita and Susruta Samhita.</p>

                            <p>While studying Sarsaparilla, it was Seydler, A German scientist, who coined the term Pharmacognosy in 1815 in his work entitled, "Analecta Pharmacognostica" from combination of two Greek words viz., Pharmakon, a drug and gignosco, to acquire the knowledge of. Further, Tschirsh made it more meaningful by restricting the term to the utilization of products from natural sources. Thus, pharmacognosy is the subject of crude drugs obtained from the plant, animal and mineral origins. It is the objective study of crude drugs of the natural sources processed scientifically. The word 'crude drug' itself is self-explanatory and is used with the meaning of 'simple drug' and also as it exists in the natural form. The crude drugs are plant or animal drugs that have undergone no other processes than collection and drying.</p>

                                    <p>Broadly, Pharmacognosy is defined as the scientific and systematic study of structural, physical, chemical and biological characters of crude drugs along with their history, method of cultivation, collection and preparation for the market.</p>

                            <p>The synthetic drugs do not fall within the scope of Pharmacognosy. With the recent developments in science and technology, several chemicals, which were originally found in plants and animals are synthesized at present. The reasons for their synthesis are either the scarcity or non-availability of natural drugs in which they occur, apart from the lack of knowledge of chemical processes required to extract them.</p>

                            <p>Most of the crude drugs are obtained from plants and only a small number comes from animal and mineral origins. Drugs obtained from plants consist of entire plants or their parts. Ephedra and datura are entire plants, while senna leaves and pods, nux-vomica seeds and cinchona bark are parts of plants. Crude drugs may also be obtained by simple physical processes like drying (opium) or extracting with water (catechu, agar).</p>

                            <p>Several other useful substances affecting health of animals and human beings are also included alongwith crude drugs in the study of Pharmacognosy.

                            <p>Even though, pharmacognosy is a branch of science dealing with crude drugs, it is very important to know all other indirectly related aspects of biomedicinals. To understand crude drugs completely, various terms used to describe the vegetable drugs as covered in botany and animal drugs as covered in zoology must be known to a pharmacognosist. He should also possess knowledge of pharmacology in order to understand the actions of drugs in human body. Pharmacology, like pharmacognosy, is an outgrowth of Materia Medica. Pharmaceutical chemistry and phytochemistry are also essential to understand the chemical composition of crude drugs. The art of preparing the galenicals and the use of pharmaceutical aids are covered under the subject, pharmaceutics. Knowledge of several other subjects apart from those mentioned above is necessary for various reasons. The knowledge of the principles of genetics, plant breeding and plant pathology is essential to understand cultivation of medicinal plants. The basic knowledge of biochemistry, chemical engineering and storage technology helps us to know the principles of collection, preparation and preservation of crude drugs. Chemotaxonomy and biosynthesis are the fields, which ought to be understood for interrelationship of active constituents and their physiological importance to the plants and animals. Pharmacognosy plays a very important role in the development of pure sciences, e.g. in descriptive botany, plant classification (taxonomy) and plant chemistry (phytochemistry).</p>

                            <p>Thus, pharmacognosy is an important liaison between pharmaceutical and all related subjects.</p>

                            <p>The system of Ayurveda-Ancient Science of Life-originated in India about 3000 years ago. It is one of the oldest systems of medicine identified exclusively with ancient Indian civilization and dealing with both preventive and curative aspects of life. The principles of positive health and therapeutic measures embedded in this system relate to mental, physical, social and spiritual welfare of human beings. Ayurveda encompasses the knowledge of Kayachikitsa (Internal medicine), Kaumarbhritya (Paediatrics), Trahchikitsa (Psychological medicine), Shalakya Tantra (Otorhinolaryngology and Ophthalmology), Shalya Tantra (Surgery) Agada Tantra (Toxicology), Rasayana Tantra (Geriatrics) and Vajikarana Tantra (Eugenics and Aphrodisiacs).</p>

                            <p>The Pharmacopoeia of Ayurveda consists of more than 8000 recipes made of natural drugs derived from herbal, mineral, animal and marine sources. These are used singly or in combinations and in varied forms such as decoctions, infusions, distillates, extracted juices, powders, pills, tablets, syrups, fermented liquids, bhasmas, medicated oils etc.</p>

                            <h3 class="card-title">SIDDHA SYSTEM OF MEDICINE</h3>
                            <p>The term ' Siddha ' means achievement and ' Siddhars ' were saintly personalities, who attained proficiency in medicine through practice of Bhakti and Yoga. This is the system of pre-vedic period identified with Dravidian culture and it is largely therapeutic in nature. Like Ayurveda, this system believes that all objects in universe are made up of five basic elements namely, earth, water, sky, fire and air. The identification of causative factors of diseases is done through pulse reading, colour of body, study of voice, urine examination, status of digestive system and examination of tongue. The literature of Siddha system is mostly in Tamil.</p>

                            <p>Few natural drugs used in Siddha system of medicine are :</p>

                            <h3 class="card-title">NATUROPATHY AND YOGA</h3>
                            <p>Naturopathy is not merely a system of treatment, but also a way of life, which is based on laws of nature. The attention is particularly paid to eating and living habits, adoption of purificatory measures, use of hydrotherapy, mud packs, baths, massage etc.</p>

                            <p>The system of Yoga is as old as Ayurveda. The eight components of Yoga are restraint, observance of austerity, physical postures, restraining of sense organs, breathing exercises, contemplation, meditation and samadhi. Yoga exercises have potential in improvement of better circulation of oxygenated blood in the body, restraining the sense organs, improvement of social and personal behaviour and induction of tranquility and serenity in the mind.</p>
