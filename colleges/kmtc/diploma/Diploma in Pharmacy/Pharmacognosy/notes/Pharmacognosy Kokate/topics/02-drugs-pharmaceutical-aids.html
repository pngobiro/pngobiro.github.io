                            <p>Though, a pharmacist is responsible for the entire process of manufacturing the pharmaceutical products, isolation or extraction of active principles from crude drugs has become a chemical or biochemical operation, rather than a pharmaceutical one. Drugs are rarely administered in singular form. They are essentially mixed with various types of additives or adjuncts or converted them into effective drugs. Thus, a pharmacist during the manufacturing process of dosage forms comes across the actual drugs and the adjuncts used alongwith them.</p>

                            <p>Etymological survey reveals that the word drug has its origin in French language and has been derived from the word <em>drogue</em>, which means any substance used in preparation of medicine. However, at present the term drug includes not only the medicines, but several other related substances without any pharmacological action.</p>

                            <p>The medicinal importance of plants in the treatment of human ailments is immense and has been so since the dawn of civilization. Until the beginning of the era of natural product chemistry in the beginning of twentieth century, the chemical composition of crude drugs remained ill defined in a structural sense. The majority of phytopharmaceuticals are derived from Spermatophyta. Some useful resins, oils and ephedrine are obtained from species of Gymnospermae, while Angiospermae provides a variety of useful drugs. Algae are a source of limited number of drugs such as agar and alginic acid. The fungi provides a number of life saving drugs especially antibiotics and ergot alkaloids. The microbial preparations include vaccines (viral, rickettsial, bacterial and toxoids). The animal derived drugs are hormones, animal extractives, enzymes, insects, fish oils and gelatin. Currently, useful marine products are protamine, pralidoxine kainic acid and agar. The phytopharmaceuticals of commercial significance from higher plants are quinine, quinidine, nicotine, tropane alkaloids-scopolamine and atropine, emetine, caffeine, sennosides, vinca alkaloids, reserpine, xanthotoxin, psoralen, pyrethrins, morphine and other opium alkaloids, diosgenin, solasodine, digoxin and lanatosides, volatile oils from sandal wood, umbelliferous fruits, rose, vetiver, lemon, lemon-grass, etc. spices and other products.</p>
