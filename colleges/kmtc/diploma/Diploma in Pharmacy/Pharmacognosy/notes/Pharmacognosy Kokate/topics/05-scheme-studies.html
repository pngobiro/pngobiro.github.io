                                METHODS OF ADULTERATING THE DRUGS
                            </h2>
                        </div>

                        <div class="content-card">
                            <p>The extent of adulteration depends upon whether the drug is indigenous or obtained from other countries. The reasons for adulteration are either scarcity or the high price of drug in the market. An adulteration of a drug may be deliberate or accidental. Adulteration is very common with drugs, which are sold illegally. Adulteration involves different conditions such as inferiority, spoilage deterioration, admixture, sophistication and substitution. Inferiority refers to any sub-standard drug, whereas spoilage could be due to attack of micro-organisms. Deterioration means impairment in quality of the drug, whereas admixture is the addition of one article to other through ignorance, carelessness or an accident. Sophistication means intentional or deliberate kind of adulteration. Substitution occurs when an entirely different article is sold or used in place of one required.</p>

                            <p>The different means for adulterating drugs are as follows:</p>

                            <ol class="enhanced-list">
                                <li class="list-item">
                                    <span class="list-marker"></span>
                                    <span class="list-content"><strong>Replacement by exhausted drugs:</strong> Particularly, this is observed in case of costly drugs such as cloves, saffron, tea, fennel, ginger etc. These drugs are exhausted for their active constituents and reused with genuine drugs after proper treatment. Exhausted saffron is coloured artificially, while ginger is mixed with starch and coloured to produce proper shade. The fictitious nutmegs are made from mineral matter pressed into moulds and flavoured.</span>
                                </li>
                                <li class="list-item">

                                    <span class="list-content"><strong>Substitution with superficially similar but inferior drugs:</strong> The harvesting of cultivated drug, when it has not reached minimum standard of quality, yields inferior drug. The common example of substitution is adulteration of cloves by mother cloves. Saffron is adulterated with dried flowers of <em>Carthamus tinctorius</em> (Safflower). Digitalis containing very less amount of glycosides is used as diluent in preparation of prepared digitalis leaves, containing higher percentage of glycosides.</span>

                                    <span class="list-content"><strong>Substitution by artificially manufactured substitutes:</strong> This type of adulteration is observed in case of drugs which are costly. Paraffin wax is tinged yellow and substituted for yellow bees wax, while artificial invert sugar is mixed with honey.</span>
                                </li>

The substitution of Alexandrian senna with Arabian senna, and substitution of rhubarb with many species of <em>Rumex</em> are other examples. Nux-vomica seed (<em>Strychnos nux-vomica</em>) are adulterated with <em>Strychnos nux-blanda</em> or <em>Strychnos potatorum</em> seed.</span>

                                    <span class="list-content"><strong>Presence of organic matter obtained from the same plant:</strong> In this case, advantage of similar colour, odour and constituents is taken into consideration and other parts of the same plant are added to genuine drug; e.g., cloves are mixed with clove stalks, while caraway and anethum fruits are mixed with other parts of inflorescence.</span>

                            <p>Several times, wastes from the market are collected and admixed with drugs. This is observed in case of unorganised or liquid drug. The pieces of amber coloured glass in colophony, limestones in asafoetida, white oil in oil of coconut and stearin or paraffin in cocoa butter are deliberate kind of adulterations.</p>

                                DRUG EVALUATION
                            </h2>
                        </div>

                        <div class="content-card">
                            <p>Evaluation of a drug means confirmation of its identity and determination of its quality and purity. If adulterated, it also includes the detection of the nature of adulteration in the crude drug.</p>
                            <p>Several methods are employed in detecting adulteration in genuine drugs. The form of drug provides a clue for the method of detection of adulteration to be followed. In ordinary course of study, the morphological characters may suffice the need of detection. But in case of powdered drugs, the microscopic characters, while in case of liquid drug chemical tests and one of the physical standards such as specific gravity, optical rotation, solubility etc., may be helpful in detection of adulteration.</p>
                            <p>Over the years, the nature and degree of evaluation of crude drugs has undergone a systematic change. Initially, the crude drugs were identified by comparison with standard description available. Due to advancement in chemical knowledge of crude drugs, at present, evaluation also includes the method of estimating the active constituent present in crude drug, in addition to its morphological and microscopic analysis.</p>
                            <p>Taking into consideration variation in source of crude drugs and their chemical nature, they are standardized by different techniques. Since methods of estimation of chief active principles of various crude drugs fall within the purview of pharmaceutical analysis, we shall only outline different methods of estimation. The crude drugs can be identified on the basis of their morphological, histological and chemical studies. The different techniques involved in standardization of crude drugs are as follows.</p>

                            <h3>1. ORGANOLEPTIC (MORPHOLOGICAL) EVALUATION</h3>
                            <p>It refers to evaluation of drugs by colour, odour, taste, size, shape and special features, like touch, texture, sound etc. Aromatic odour of umbelliferous fruits and sweet taste of liquorice are the examples of this type of evaluation. The study of form of a crude drug is Morphology, while description of the form is Morphography.</p>
                            <p>However, it should be noted that colour, shape and size of crude drugs as described in official books should only be considered as guidelines and may vary depending upon several factors. For example, colour of the crude drug may fade if it gets exposed to sunlight for very long duration or if, the drug is not stored properly. Depending upon the condition under which the drug is growing or cultivated, i.e., availability of proper irrigation, fertilizers or even, high temperature may influence the size of the drug. If it gets favourable conditions, leaf, seed and fruit drugs of maximum size may be available and the crude drugs if grown in adverse conditions, size may get reduced.</p>
                            <p>The adulteration of seed of <em>Strychnos nux-vomica</em> with the seed of <em>Strychnos nux-blanda</em> or <em>Strychnos potatorum</em>, caraway with Indian dill, Alexandrian senna with dog senna or palthe senna are identified by morphological technique.</p>
                            <p>In case of acellular products (unorganised drugs), form of the drug depends totally on the method of preparation of the drug. Thus, gum acacia is found in the form of ovoid tears, while tragacanth is marketed as vermiform ribbon with longitudinal striations.</p>

                            <h3>2. MICROSCOPIC EVALUATION</h3>
                            <p>This method allows more detailed examination of a drug and it can be used to identify organised drugs by their known histological characters.</p>
                            <p>Microscope, by virtue of its property to magnify, permits the minute structure under study to be enlarged and can be used to confirm the structural details of the drugs from plant origin. For the effective results, various reagents or stains can be used to distinguish the cellular structure. The microscopic evaluation also covers study of constituents by application of chemical tests to small quantities of drugs in powdered form or to histological sections of the drug (Microchemistry). Histological studies are made from very thin sections of the drugs. The characteristics of cell wall, cell contents, trichomes, fibres, vessels etc., can be studied in details, e.g. Signified trichomes in nux-vomica. The microscopic linear measurement and quantitative microscopy are also covered under this technique of evaluation.</p>

                                    <p>The actual number of stomata per sq. mm of leaf preparation may vary for leaves of the same plant grown in different environmental conditions. Stomatal number is relatively a constant for particular species of same age and hence, it is taken into consideration as a diagnostic character for identification of a leaf drug. The adulteration can also be detected by stomatal number. It can be further illustrated by following examples.</p>

                            <p><strong>(e) Quantitative Microscopy (Lycopodium Spore Method) :</strong> It is an important analytical technique for powdered drugs, especially when chemical and other methods of evaluation of crude drugs fail as accurate measures of quality. Lycopodium spores are very characteristic in shape and appearance and exceptionally uniform in size (25 µm). On an average, 94000 spores per mg of powdered lycopodium are present.</p>
                            <p>A powdered drug is evaluated by this technique, if it contains :</p>

                                $$\text{Percentage purity} = \frac{N \times W \times 94000 \times 100}{S \times M \times P}$$
                            </div>
                            <p>where,<br>
                            N - number of characteristic structures (e.g. starch grains) in 25 fields.<br>
                            W - weight in mg of lycopodium taken.<br>
                            S - number of lycopodium spores in the same 25 fields.<br>
                            M - weight in mg of the sample, calculated on the basis of sample dried at 105°C.<br>
                            P - 2,86,000 in case of ginger starch grains powder.</p>

                            <p>Lycopodium spore method can be used for evaluation of powdered clove, ginger, cardamom, nutmeg and umbelliferous fruits.</p>
                            <p>The study of microscopical or histological characteristics is useful in detection of adulterants in both entire and powdered forms of crude drugs. Apart from variations in cellular arrangement, many a times, the type of cuticle of epidermis and cell inclusion also help in detection of the adulterants. The common adulterant of <em>Digitalis purpurea</em> is <em>Verbascum thapsus</em>, containing candelabra trichomes, while digitalis contains either multicellular uniseriate trichomes or glandular trichomes. The powdered cloves contain neither prisms of calcium oxalate nor the sclereids, but in case of powdered clove stalks both are present. Starch is absent in clove, but is present in the powdered clove fruits. The leaves of <em>Digitalis purpurea</em> do not contain calcium oxalate crystals, while they are present in all other varieties of Digitalis. Surinam quassia does not contain calcium oxalate, but Jamaica quassia contains prismatic crystals of calcium oxalate.</p>
                            <p>The size of a starch grain is also important in detection of adulterants. In case of <em>Cinnamomum cassia</em>, the diameter of starch grains is usually more than 10 microns. The dimension of fibres also helps in detecting adulteration in case of cinnamon. The number of sclerenchymatous cells per square cm in cardamom is one of the criteria for detection of varieties of cardamom seed in powdered form.</p>

                            <h3>3. PHYSICAL EVALUATION</h3>
                            <p>Physical standards are to be determined for drugs, wherever possible. They may help in evaluation, specifically with reference to specific gravity, density, optical rotation, refractive index, melting point, viscosity and solubility in different solvents. A few of them are described below.</p>
                            <p><strong>(i) Moisture content:</strong> The percentage of active chemical constituents in crude drugs is mentioned on air-dried basis. Hence, the moisture content of a drug should be determined and also be controlled to make the solution of definite strength. The moisture content of a drug should be minimised in order to prevent decomposition of crude drug either due to chemical change or due to microbial contamination.</p>
