                            <p>Either single or various parts of the same plant can be used as source of drug and hence it becomes necessary to know various parts of a plant scientifically. Natural drugs may either constitute cellular or acellular organ of the plant. Cellular drugs are broadly known as organised crude drugs whereas acellular drugs as unorganised crude-drugs.</p>
                            
                            <p>Before dealing with the drugs in details, one should know how to distinguish clearly between organised (cellular) and unorganised (acellular) crude drugs.</p>

                            <p>Apart from the normal characteristics i.e. their arrangement on the stems, their apices, margin, petiole, presence or absence of stipules etc., leaves are characterized by certain diagnostic structures. Most of these diagnostic characters are microscopic one, such as stomata and trichomes, stomatal index palisade ratio, vein islet number etc. All these characteristics shall be referred in detail under microscopic characters of the leaves.</p>

                            <h3>Collection of Leaves</h3>
                            <p>The procurement of leaves depend on several factors and varies from leaf to leaf. One should have thorough knowledge of chemical constituents of leaves and the chemical changes which might take place in normal atmospheric conditions. Medicinal leaves are collected during the flowering season of plants, when the plants reach maturity and they are photosynthetically most active. If the leaves contain volatile oil, irrespective of the other facts, they are generally collected when the plant is rich in volatile oil content. The weather and time of collection is also very important for procurement of drugs. Dry weather with minimum humidity is ideal in most of the cases for plucking the leaves. Digitalis leaves are collected in dry weather, generally in the afternoon. Coca leaves are collected, when they are nearly ready to fall from the stems. The discoloration of leaves is undesirable, while the leaves of substandard quality fetch less value in the market.</p>

                            <h3>Preparation of the Leaves for the Market</h3>
                            <p>The leaves after drying are graded as broken and entire leaves or depending upon their colour. Tossing and sieving are also done in many of the cases. The packaging of leaves is likely to affect quality of the drug. In order to maintain the quality and potency of leaves, wherever necessary, leaves should be packed in air-tight containers protected from light and moisture.</p>

                            <h3>Diagnostic Characters of Leaves</h3>
                            <p>Apart from shape, size and colour, leaves are characterized by several microscopic structures which help in their proper identification. Following are few diagnostic characters of common occurrence.</p>

                            <h4>[A] Stomata</h4>
                            <p>Epidermis of leaf shows different characteristics, e.g. cutical stomata, trichomes, waterpore, cell inclusions, etc. A Stoma is a minute epidermal opening with following characteristics.</p>

                                <li class="list-item">

                                    <span class="list-content">A central pore.</span>
                                </li>

                                    <span class="list-marker"></span>
                                    <span class="list-content">Two kidney shaped similar cells containing chloroplasts known as guard cells and varying number of subsidiary (epidermal) cells covering the guard cells.</span>
                                </li>

                            <p>Stomata perform two functions in the plant body. The primary and most important function of stomata is gaseous exchange and the secondary function is transpiration.</p>
                            <p>It is not essential that each plant must have stomata. The leaves of bryophytes and submerged leaves of aquatic parts do not contain stomata. Generally, stomata are present in green parts of the plant (mostly leaves), but absent in roots. Apart from the leaves, they are also present in the stems (ephedra), flowers (clove), and fruits (fennel). However, it is generally observed that stomata are abundantly present in dicot leaves. In some cases, they are present on the upper surface of leaves, while in others on lower surface only (coca and cherry). In some, the stomata are present on both surfaces of the leaves (senna, belladonna, datura etc.). The distribution of stomata between upper and lower epidermis in dicot leaves shows great variation.</p>
                            <p><strong>Types of Stomata :</strong> Depending upon the type of the guard cells and arrangement of subsidiary cells, stomata are divided into four types.</p>

                                II. BARKS
                            </h2>
                        </div>

                        <div class="content-card">
                            <p>The secondary external tissues lying outside the cambium in stem or root of dicotyledonous plants, are known as the bark.</p>
                            <p>Botanically, bark is also known as periderm. Periderm consists of three layers viz., cork (phellem); cork-cambium (phellogen) and secondary cortex (phelloderm). Commercially, barks consist of all the tissues outside the cambium. A young bark includes epidermis, cortex, pericycle and phloem. Barks are obtained from the plants by making longitudinal and transverse incisions through the outer layers followed by peeling. Barks may be obtained from stems or roots. Due to the excessive growth produced by the cambium and cork cambium, the external tissues get tangentially stretched or torn and hence, the epidermis is not found in the barks.</p>

                            <h3>Characteristics of Barks :</h3>
                            <p>Barks exhibit several morphological and microscopical characters. The morphological characters need special attention, as they help in identification of the barks.</p>

                            <h3>Shapes in Barks :</h3>
                            <p>The shape or form of the bark is dependent upon the method adopted for its preparation. It also depends on the type of incision made and the extent of any subsequent shrinkage of the tissues. When the bark is removed from the large trees and dried under pressure, the flats are produced, e.g. quillaia and arjuna. When the bark is removed from the small branches due to shrinkage of the soft tissues, it tends to curve forming concavity on the inner side, yielding curved pieces, e.g. wild cherry and cassia. If the concavity is on the outer side of the bark, it is described as recurved, e.g. kurchi. When the shrinkage of the tissues is to a greater extent and it forms deep trough or channel, it is called a channelled bark, e.g. ashoka, Cinchona ledgeriana and cassia. In some cases, one edge of a bark covers the other to form quill, e.g. cascara and cinnamon. If both the edges of the bark roll independently forming quill, it is described as double quill e.g. Java cinnamon. In some cases, one quill of a bark is put inside other quill to form a compound quill, e.g. cinnamon. Compound quill is a man-made shape of bark. It reduces the exposure of bark to atmospheric conditions and also saves the space in transport (Fig. 4.5).</p>

                            <h3>Fractures in Bark :</h3>
                            <p>The appearance shown by the transversely broken surfaces of the bark is known as fracture. It is, sometimes, useful in identification of barks. The types of the fractures are as follows.</p>
                            <p>When fractured surface is smooth, it is described as a short fracture (cinnamon and kurchi). If the exposed surface exhibits small rounded appearance, it is described as a granular fracture (wild cherry and cassia). If, the broken surface shows the presence of uneven projecting points, it is described as splintery fracture, as seen in cinnamon. The presence of numerous fibres on the transversely broken surface is described as a fibrous fracture (cinchona). If the exposed surface shows the arrangements of layers one over the other, it is described as a laminated fracture, as observed in quillaia.</p>
                            <p>The various characters shown by the barks on the outer, as well as inner surface are also diagnostically important. Amongst these, the colour, condition and presence of several growths like lichens, mosses etc., are characteristic to each bark. The presence of lenticels and development of cracks are additional characters of bark. Outer surface of the bark shows presence of cracks and fissures, which are due to lack of elasticity or due to increase in girth of the trees. Fissures are usually deep. Wrinkles, which are seen on outer surface of the bark, result due to shrinkage of inside soft tissues. Furrows are troughs between wrinkles. Inner surface of bark shows characteristics such as striations, which are longitudinal and parallel lines. Transverse wrinkles present on inner surface are described as corrugations.</p>

                            <h3>Methods of Collecting Barks :</h3>
                            <p>Barks are collected in a season when they contain maximum concentration of active constituent. Cinnamon is collected in rainy season, while wild cherry is collected in autumn. Following are the methods of collecting barks.</p>

                                    <span class="list-content"><strong>Felling method :</strong> This is a very old method of collecting barks. The tree is cut at base and bark is peeled out. This method is not used at present commercially, since it causes total destruction of trees.</span>

                                    <span class="list-content"><strong>Uprooting method :</strong> In this case, the roots of plant are dug out of soil and bark is stripped off from roots and branches. This method is applied for collection of root bark of cinchona in Java.</span>

                                    <span class="list-marker"></span>
                                    <span class="list-content"><strong>Coppicing method :</strong> In this method, the plant is allowed to grow for a definite period and then it is cut off at specific distance from soil. The stumps, which remain in ground are allowed to send shoots, which develop further independently yielding aerial parts. These new parts are cut off and bark is collected from shoots. As compared to other methods of collection of bark, this technique is more economical and less time-consuming. It is, therefore, the method of choice for collecting barks commercially. Cascara and cinnamon are collected by this method.</span>

                            <p>In case of dicotyledonous plants, the tissues produced by cambium on inner side are collectively known as wood. Thus, it consists mainly of secondary xylem and smaller amount of other tissues. The cells forming these tissues are highly lignified. Commercially, two types of wood are available, heart wood or duramen and sap wood or alburnum.</p>
                            <ol class="enhanced-list">

                                    <span class="list-content"><strong>Heart wood :</strong> It consists of the innermost central region of dicot stem or root, which is non-functioning, non-living and dark coloured part due to presence of several chemical substances like tannins, pigments, gums, resins etc. It gives mechanical support, e.g. sandal wood.</span>
                                </li>
                                <li class="list-item">

                                    <span class="list-content"><strong>Sap wood :</strong> It is the outer region of the wood, which is the only functional wood conducting water and food material to plant and is lighter in colour, e.g. quassia.</span>
                                </li>
                            </ol>
                            <p>The transverse section of wood shows, annual rings, which represent season's growth. The wood formed in spring is known as spring wood, while the wood formed in winter is known as autumn wood. In some cases annual rings are not marked due to absence of seasonal interruption and hence they are known as false annual rings.</p>
                            <p>The wood in which spring vessels are arranged more or less in a ring, is described as 'ring porous wood', e.g. oak. When spring vessels are distributed uniformly throughout 'whole spring wood', the wood is described as 'diffuse porous wood' e.g. quassia. The arrangement of fibres in wood also decides nature of the wood. When the fibres are straight and arranged parallel, resulting in a smooth and uniform fracture, the wood is described as 'straight grained-wood'. If fibres in the wood are arranged at an angle roughly 30°, the wood shall not break easily and result in an irregular and splintery fracture. It is, then, described to possess inter-locked grain as in guaiacum.</p>

The ovules of the flowers, after fertilization, get converted into seeds, whereas the ovary wall develops further to form the protective covering over the seeds, which is known as fruit. In botany, this particular coating is also called pericarp.</p>
