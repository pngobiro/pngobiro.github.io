                        </h2>
                        <p>Interviewing and assessment form the foundations of all our conscious and unconscious interactions with others, whether they are formal, such as in an interview for a job, or informal, such as when we meet a newcomer to a tutorial group. We make conscious decisions on the information we glean from effective interviewing, e.g. determining the needs of the patient or client. These decisions are based on our knowledge and experience, but they are also based on unconscious experiences, that will influence our perceptions of the situation.</p>
                        <p>Physical messages that we observe such as the woman's or patient's physical condition or our colleagues' non-verbal cues, influence how we respond in those particular circumstances. Paralinguistics, language choice and voice modulation are clues to how the other person might be feeling. We need, therefore, to be aware of what we have observed and how we choose to respond when we are interviewing and making an assessment. The purpose and focus of the interview and assessment are more readily evident in formal situations, but might be less clear when, e.g. we are reviewing a patient's care plan or a woman's birth plan.</p>
                        <p>Assessment is the first stage of the nursing and midwifery processes. It forms the foundation of all the care to follow. As the nursing and midwifery processes are dynamic, care is adjusted according to the changing needs of those in our care. In order to do this successfully, we need to assess patients' and women's needs continually.</p>
                        <p>This chapter explores the skills we use when we interview others. It addresses how we make effective assessments and the skills we use to develop further our professional relationships and deliver care. The skills which will be considered are: questioning skills, explanation skills and giving information to relatives.</p>

                        <span class="heading-text">PRINCIPLES</span>
                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>In order to interview and assess effectively, there are a number of principles we need to apply. The purpose of each interview and the focus of each assessment need to be clear, both to you as the practitioner, and to those who are involved in the situation with you. In order to develop a partnership with the others in the interview, it is important that you engage them in the process and encourage their co-operation. The feelings of all involved influence the interview and assessment processes. It is key, therefore, to a successful interview, that you are aware of how you are feeling and of your body language. It is equally important to observe the non-verbal cues of those you are interviewing. These can give you clues to how they might be feeling.</p>
                        <p>Where you have a number of women or patients to care for during a shift, you need to decide whose needs take priority, thus who you will interview and assess first. When and where you hold the interview may influence its process. It is important, therefore, to make the environment as friendly and private as possible.</p>
                        <p>If time is limited, as in an emergency, the attention of the others involved needs to be drawn to this. By doing so, you can help them to understand the reasons for quick interactions, such as asking a number of closed questions when assessing a newly admitted woman in labour.</p>
                        <p>You need always to be sensitive to the diversity of those in your care. All of us come to interviews with our own understanding of appropriate behaviour in the circumstances. Our cultural, social, personal and professional heritages will influence how we perceive others as well as how we behave in relation to them and in that situation. These factors will also influence the interactions of our colleagues and clients, as well as those occurring in informal interactions (see Ch. 1). Cultural difference is evident in subtle ways as well as in the more obvious such as race, language and religion. Think too about issues such as age, gender, occupation and which part of the country a person comes from. English dialect can be confusing even to those whose mother tongue it is. 'Tea' to one person might mean the early evening meal, but to someone else it might mean a cup of tea. You can demonstrate sensitivity by observing the language others use and choosing words that are as unambiguous as possible. Take care when you use metaphors and idioms, as these are usually culturally specific. An example is the term 'to spend a penny' which means 'to pass urine'. This term is commonly used in certain groups, but it might not make sense to people who do not remember when it cost 1 penny to use the public toilets!</p>
                        <p>Avoid questions beginning with 'Why?' These are apt to sound accusatory or critical. 'Why did you tell the doctor you were worried about Mr Patel?' can sound as if you think your colleague has done something wrong in discussing concerns about the patient with the doctor. It would be preferable to say: 'What were your reasons for telling the doctor you were worried about Mr Patel?' This question will elicit information about Mr Patel's condition as well as the rationale for talking to the doctor caring for him.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>We use questions for a variety of reasons, such as to show we are listening, to encourage others to disclose information or to join in the conversation as a group discussion, and to explore and clarify situations. The skilful use of questions is integral to effective interviewing and assessment.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Closed questions</h3>
                        <p>These are questions to which there is only one answer, such as 'Yes' or 'No'. They can be used when you want specific information. They limit explanation and can help ensure that interviews keep to the point. They are therefore also useful on occasions when a short answer is appropriate such as when you are in a hurry, or when the person you are addressing is breathless or acutely distressed. Examples are: 'Are you alright?', 'Are you still in pain?'</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Open questions</h3>
                        <p>Open questions differ from closed questions as they allow for a wide range of answers. You will find them useful for exploring issues and seeking wider perspectives. When we ask open questions we allow the other person to describe their experiences, feelings or understanding. Examples are: 'How are you feeling?', 'What happened?'</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Open focused questions</h3>
                        <p>These are questions that are open, but focus on specific areas. They are useful if you wish to address particular issues or experiences. Examples are: 'What was your reason for choosing the birthing pool for your labour and delivery?' 'What was your experience of being with the occupational therapist in the community?'</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Assessing a distressed pregnant woman</h3>
                        <p>Mrs Angela McBride is a 30-year-old Irish woman who was admitted to your ward last night. She seems to be miscarrying her first and much longed-for baby and is due to have an ultrasound scan to assess the state of her pregnancy. She is quiet but obviously very distressed. You are asked by the Midwife in Charge of the antenatal ward to find out how Mrs McBride is feeling before she goes for an ultrasound scan.</p>
                        <p>Some issues raised by this scenario:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Mrs McBride is facing a deeply distressing life event - the possibility of losing her baby. You know she is distressed and will need sensitive care. It would be helpful for you to know more specifically how she feels so you can be perceptive in meeting her needs for support.</li>
                            <li>Mrs McBride's knowledge of her situation needs to be assessed.</li>
                            <li>Finding out how she feels about having a scan and what its results might be will enable you to offer her appropriate reassurance and information.</li>
                            <li>The value of a scan and how it is actually carried out needs explaining.</li>
                            <li>When people are very distressed, they often need to be given the same information on a number of occasions.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Specific principles</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>When interviewing and assessing someone's needs it is always important to state your reason for requiring the information.</li>
                            <li>Open questions give a wide range of possible answers; closed questions can identify exact information.</li>
                            <li>Closed questions are especially important in situations where complicated or long answers would be too demanding for patients and women in your care, such as when they are in a lot of distress through pain or breathlessness.</li>
                            <li>As only limited answers are required, closed questions can be experienced by the person being interviewed as controlling because they cannot expand on their experiences, e.g. when you are taking a nursing history.</li>
                            <li>If you use a mixture of open, closed and open focused questions skilfully, you will be effective in interviewing and assessing the needs of others and the situations in which you are practising.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Preparation of self</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Think about how you feel about Mrs McBride's situation. Have there been other occasions where patients or friends have lost pregnancies and you have cared for them?</li>
                            <li>It is understandable that you too might feel distressed about Mrs McBride's situation. How do you think you can use the awareness of your feelings to help her?</li>
                            <li>Think about how you are feeling about asking Mrs McBride about her feelings. You might feel apprehensive about intruding or concerned that you might say the wrong thing.</li>
                            <li>Consider what sort of information you need from Mrs McBride in order to offer her appropriate support.</li>
                            <li>What is the best way for you to gain this information? What skills will you use? If you intend to use questions, what will they be - open, closed or open focused?</li>
                            <li>How will you open the interview?</li>
                            <li>What do you hope Mrs McBride will gain from the assessment of her needs?</li>
                            <li>Think about what you have noticed about Mrs McBride's demeanour. Is she withdrawn, tearful or putting a brave face on things?</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Environment</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Ideally this should be private and out of others' hearing. However, this can be difficult to attain on an open ward but closing the curtains partially or completely provides some privacy.</li>
                            <li>If you are talking to a patient or client and assessing their needs in a public place, e.g. the street after an accident, try to make space around the person, which effectively 'shuts out' any onlookers. One way to do this is to turn your back on onlookers and keep the person shielded as far as possible by your presence. This can be done by the way you position yourself and any equipment you might have with you.</li>
                            <li>If you want to sit on a patient's or client's bed, it is important to ask permission. Unless they have a private room, the bed is usually the only exclusively personal space that patients or women on the maternity unit have when they are in hospital.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Putting the skills into practice</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>What you observe about Mrs McBride will guide you as to how to open the interview so you can assess her needs for support and information, as well as for physical care.</li>
                            <li>It is helpful to approach her bed quietly as she seems distressed. Consider whether it will be sensitive to sit on her bed or pull up a chair.</li>
                            <li>Greet Mrs McBride and introduce yourself if this is the first time you have met her. A beaming smile does not seem appropriate, although a warm facial expression will show her you are interested in meeting her and caring for her.</li>
                            <li>If this is the first time you have met, it might help the interview to be relaxed if you engage her with a short social interaction like commenting on her bedside plants or get-well cards.</li>
                            <li>You might use an open question like: 'How are you, Mrs McBride?' Depending on her answer and her emotional response, you can decide where to sit.</li>
                            <li>She might well respond tearfully or in a similarly distressed manner. It is very important to sit quietly and 'be with' the patient (Benner 2001: 50).</li>
                            <li>If she is weeping, avoid platitudes like: 'It's going to be all right', as clearly you cannot know that. A sensitive comment acknowledging her distress like, 'I am so sorry you are having such a difficult time' demonstrates empathy (see Ch. 4).</li>
                            <li>It is advisable to wait quietly until Mrs McBride has gathered herself and seems able to talk to you.</li>
                            <li>If she is very distressed you might pass her a tissue and/or ask her if she would prefer you to come back in a few minutes. Be sure to make eye contact with her, even if only fleetingly, to show you are not evading her distress. However, making eye contact is culturally very specific, so it is important to be aware of different cultural norms. Watch for signs that eye contact is too intimate (i.e. if the patient looks uncomfortable) and gauge when to look away (see Ch. 1).</li>
                            <li>Be aware of how you are feeling as 'strong feelings are contagious' (Platt & Gordon 2004: 57). This self-awareness can help you to avoid being caught up in your own emotions that the situation has aroused in you: it will also enable you to listen empathetically.</li>
                            <li>When she is ready, you can then assess her knowledge about the need for having a scan, by asking in a gently modulated voice an open focused question such as, 'What do you understand about why the doctors have arranged for you to have a scan?'</li>
                            <li>Address any questions she might have and clarify anything she does not understand or has not been advised about. Explain the process to her, outlining the procedure: when, where and how it will happen, who is likely to do the scan and whether she will be chaperoned. Ask her if she would like anyone to be with her (e.g. husband, partner, relative or friend).</li>
                            <li>Ensure that you follow local procedures and if necessary inform the relevant department that someone will be accompanying Mrs McBride.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Reflection on practice</h4>
                        <p>Think of a situation from your experience where you have assessed a distressed patient or client.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>What were your feelings during the assessment of the person in your care's needs? How do you think they influenced the way you responded?</li>
                            <li>How did the person respond when you went to assess their needs?</li>
                            <li>If you were able to sit quietly with them, what was their response? What interventions seemed to help the most?</li>
                            <li>If relatives or friends were present, how did you support them? If you included the person's partner in the assessment, how did you do this?</li>
                            <li>How did other staff members help you with this assessment? What feedback do you think the nursing team needed in order to give the patient sensitive and appropriate care? How, when and where did you give it? What did you document in the care plan?</li>
                            <li>What would you like to have done differently? What observations of yourself and the responses of those in your care prompted you to consider these changes? How will you use this learning in future practice?</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>Explanation enables us to clarify our thinking, helps others to understand the reasons for our decisions and is essential in the teaching of others. Patients and clients might need information about a variety of issues: a first time mother will probably need to know how they will be cared for during labour; an ill person might need help to understand the nature of their illness; students and colleagues might need help to understand a new technique or policy. Effective use of questions enables you to assess how much the person knows and understands. Set aside enough time and start by clarifying the person's understanding of the topic. Assess the person's physical and emotional state as these influence how much they can absorb and for how long. Use an interpreter if necessary (see Ch. 7).</p>
                        <p>Give a brief overview of the topic, starting with what the patient or client already understands, and avoid using jargon and giving them too much information at once. Talk logically through the topic, linking important issues coherently. Allow time for them to consider what you have said and to ask questions. Check understanding of the key points regularly by asking the person to tell you what they have understood. Open focused questions are useful here.</p>
                        <p>Finish with a clear summary and follow-up with written details and contact numbers as appropriate. If the explanation is required because the person's condition has worsened, it is important to be honest and not give false hope. Your tone of voice, choice of words and manner all need to be empathetic.</p>
                        <p>In the following scenario, the woman needs information about the significance of being sent to a specialist unit, what this entails and when she is likely to know about the wellbeing of her baby.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Explanation skills</h3>
                        <p>Mrs McBride is aware of the need for a scan but does not understand why she has to go to a specialist department - the Early Pregnancy Assessment Unit - as up until now, she has had scans in the main X-ray department.</p>
                        <p>Some issues raised by this scenario:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Mrs McBride's fears about the implications of going to a specialist unit</li>
                            <li>Whether or not she will be able to be accompanied by you and/or her husband</li>
                            <li>When she is likely to be told about the outcome of her scan and by whom.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Preparation of self</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Identify equipment/aids that might be needed. In this instance, a leaflet on the Early Pregnancy Assessment Unit and the value of ultrasonic scans in pregnancy would be appropriate.</li>
                            <li>Ensure you are thoroughly versed in what it is you intend to explain. What procedures are followed when a woman seems to be miscarrying in early pregnancy and needs a scan? Identify the limits to your knowledge and authority to pass on information.</li>
                            <li>Choose a private area where you will not be overheard if at all possible.</li>
                            <li>Reflect on the type of relationship you have with the person to whom you are giving the explanation.</li>
                            <li>Decide on the essential pieces of information and how they are interrelated.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Environment</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Wherever possible, this should be private and out of earshot. In an open ward, pull the curtains partially or completely around the bed for privacy, if this suits the patient. If Mrs McBride is in a side room, close the door with her consent.</li>
                            <li>If you feel it is appropriate to sit on Mrs McBride's bed, it is important to ask her permission.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Putting the skills into practice</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Take into account Mrs McBride's emotional state. When people are distressed and anxious, it is difficult for them to take in information and so it might need to be repeated.</li>
                            <li>Clarify a starting point by finding out what the patient already knows. You might ask, 'What do you know about having a scan?' This is particularly important when the person is distressed as it helps them to focus on the relevance of the information to their situation.</li>
                            <li>Provide a context for the explanation that the other person understands. This helps to reassure them that the issue is relevant to them personally.</li>
                            <li>Talk logically through the information, from the agreed starting point to the end, linking the information so that it makes a coherent whole.</li>
                            <li>Check understanding regularly by asking the other person to paraphrase what they understand and by using open focused questions.</li>
                            <li>If the person does not understand, re-frame the information using age-, culture-and situation-appropriate metaphors. Use adjectives and descriptions to which the other person can relate. This is where cultural awareness in the use of metaphors is important (see Ch. 1).</li>
                            <li>When you have finished your explanation, ask the other person to repeat what they have understood.</li>
                            <li>Ask the other person what questions they might have. Avoid asking the closed question, 'Have you any questions?' It is better to ask something like, 'Is there anything else that you would like me to clarify?'</li>
                            <li>Where possible, provide written information to support your explanation, e.g. a leaflet on ultrasound scans.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Reflection on practice</h4>
                        <p>Consider a situation from your practice when you gave an explanation about treatment to someone in your care.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>What aspects of your explanation went well? What are your reasons for thinking this?</li>
                            <li>How coherent was your explanation of the need for the treatment and what it entailed? What would you like to have done differently?</li>
                            <li>If you had to clarify aspects more than once, what were the reasons for this? Perhaps you might have worded your questions differently or used shorter sentences. In situations where patients are anxious or distressed, as with Mrs McBride, they might have found it hard to take in everything you were saying.</li>
                            <li>How did the patient seem at the end of the explanation? What are your reasons for thinking this?</li>
                            <li>How will what you have learnt from this reflection influence the way in which you give explanations in future?</li>
                        </ul>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Giving information to relatives about the wellbeing of those in our care is an everyday and essential part of effective communication in nursing practice. The Nursing and Midwifery Council is clear that we need to be able to do this without breaching patient confidentiality (Nursing and Midwifery Council 2008) but we also need to avoid seeming 'cagey' or withholding, thereby offending people who have genuine concerns about their loved ones. Relatives are also among the people to whom we offer care. This is most obvious when the news about their loved one is worrying or likely to cause distress. Always ensure that what you tell relatives is accurate and appropriate and that you have the knowledge and authority to do so.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Checking the identity of enquirers</h3>
                        <p>A student nurse is working in a rehabilitation centre for patients who have suffered some form of brain injury. The student knows most of the patients well as he has cared for many of them over the preceding weeks. A young woman, whom the student had not previously met, introduces herself as Marcia Goldsmith and asks: 'Nurse, please would you tell me how my father, Mr Pringle, is getting on?'</p>
                        <p>Some issues raised by this scenario:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The identity of the woman and her relationship to Mr Pringle, who she says is her father</li>
                            <li>Whether or not Ms Goldsmith is known to the other centre staff, either as a documented next-of-kin in the patient's records or as someone they have met and talked to in the past</li>
                            <li>Whether or not Mr Pringle has identified her as his daughter and what he would like her to know about his situation and progress</li>
                            <li>How the student is going to clarify these issues before sharing information with Ms Goldsmith.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Specific principles</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>As professional practitioners we have a responsibility to keep confidential all the information we have about clients and patients. Sharing information about those in our care must be guided by professional ethics and the Code of Professional Conduct (Nursing and Midwifery Council 2008).</li>
                            <li>Patients and clients have a right to privacy (Human Rights Act 1998). The ethics and protocols of giving information about people in our care to relatives differ from those governing information-sharing with colleagues. There are specific protocols (e.g. Chief Medical Officer of England 1997) for information-sharing across professional disciplines.</li>
                            <li>Sharing information needs to be justified, appropriate and proportionate to the situation, auditable and necessary (Human Rights Act 1998).</li>
                            <li>The support patients and clients receive from their relatives varies from person to person, their particular family relationships and culture. The information we share about them must always reflect the requests of those in our care, not the wishes of their family and/or friends.</li>
                            <li>A holistic approach to care for patients and clients does however mean that we need to offer support and understanding to their relatives and friends.</li>
                            <li>It is essential always to be very clear that patients or clients consent to your sharing information, exactly what information you might share and with whom.</li>
                            <li>Take care not to make assumptions about who those patients or clients regard as their relatives. Same-sex couples might name their partner as their next-ofkin and not want their blood relatives to know anything about their condition. It is important to be aware that this might upset other relatives but the person's wishes must be respected.</li>
                            <li>If people request information about a patient or a pregnant woman in your care, it is important to be sure of the identity of the person enquiring and whether or not the patient or client wants them to be kept informed (see Ch. 7).</li>
                            <li>In situations where there is a risk of violence to the patient or client, e.g. when a woman has been admitted with injuries as a result of domestic violence, it is crucial that you do not expose the patient to further risk by disclosing information such as their whereabouts. Always check in these situations whether or not the patient consents to your disclosing this information and to whom. Significant skill is required here to avoid giving information in such a way as to show that the victim is in your care. For example, refusing to give information about a person in your care on the grounds of confidentiality is an admission that the person is in your care.</li>
                            <li>Whenever possible, share information in a private place, out of earshot of others. Avoid corridor conversations.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Preparation of self</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Be absolutely certain that you know what the patient or client consents to your disclosing and to whom.</li>
                            <li>Be sure you know the identity of the people asking for information before you disclose anything about the person in your care. In this situation, you need to consider how you intend to ensure that Ms Goldsmith is who she says she is.</li>
                            <li>It is important that any information you disclose is accurate and appropriate.</li>
                            <li>Decide what you are going to say and what words you will use. Avoid using abbreviations like 'obs' for observations.</li>
                            <li>Ensure that you use easily understandable words rather than technical terms, as these can confuse and worry relatives, especially if they are anxious or unfamiliar with medical and nursing and midwifery terminology.</li>
                            <li>How are you feeling about talking to Ms Goldsmith? Do you have the necessary knowledge and experience? Would you prefer a qualified staff member to speak to her instead, or to be with you while you do so?</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Environment</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The environment in the centre should be one where people in your care and relatives feel safe, psychologically and physically.</li>
                            <li>If Ms Goldsmith has not been there before she might feel intimidated or anxious in a strange place, especially if there is a lot of activity or rehabilitation equipment in the environment where you meet.</li>
                            <li>Your manner of greeting will be important to help Ms Goldsmith to feel valued and her father well-cared-for.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Putting the skills into practice</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>To ensure you know that Ms Goldsmith is Mr Pringle's daughter, you might need to ask another member of staff to confirm her identity, or you might need to ask Mr Pringle if he would like to see her and confirm her identity for you.</li>
                            <li>This can be done in a friendly and assertive manner by saying something like, 'It is nice to meet you, Ms Goldsmith. I'm sure you understand that as we've never met before, it's important that your father or another nurse who knows you introduces me to you before we discuss his progress.'</li>
                            <li>Clarify what she wants to know and clarify exactly what Mr Pringle is happy for her to know. This you can do by asking him and/or looking at his records.</li>
                            <li>If Mr Pringle does not want her to know anything other than that he is 'alright', you need to be sure you can say this without seeming to be withholding, especially if Ms Goldsmith has a lot of questions.</li>
                            <li>Decide exactly what you are going to say, where and how.</li>
                            <li>If it is appropriate, share the information with Mr Pringle present, so he can explain his situation and progress to his daughter himself.</li>
                            <li>Take care to share information in a private place. Shut the door. If this is not possible, draw curtains or move away from people who might be able to overhear your conversation. If possible, offer Ms Goldsmith a chair to sit down, and sit down too.</li>
                            <li>If the news might cause distress, it is crucial that it is shared in private and Ms Goldsmith has enough time and space to take in the information, ask questions and express her feelings. Never disclose disappointing or bad news in a public arena.</li>
                            <li>Arrange the space so that if people look in, her facial expressions and nonverbal cues are not easily viewed from the outside, e.g. position her chair facing away from the window.</li>
                            <li>Always make time to share information. This might mean asking Ms Goldsmith to wait while you finish what you are doing before you go and speak to her. When the news is distressing, making enough time is crucially important.</li>
                            <li>If you cannot find a private space to talk to her, place yourself between her and any onlookers so that you make a secluded space that discourages others from interrupting you. One way of doing this would be to find a corner and stand with your back to the room with Ms Goldsmith facing you.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Note:</strong> It is never acceptable to give anything other than positive information in a public place.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Allow time for Ms Goldsmith to ask any questions she might have and, before ending the interview, check that she is satisfied and has nothing else to clarify.</li>
                            <li>Be sure to show that the interview is over by taking your leave cordially. You might stand up and offer to shake her hand.</li>
                            <li>If the news has been bad, it is caring and very important to ensure that she has some sort of support getting home and/or when she gets home, if this is at all possible. If necessary, check whether it is possible to arrange for someone to collect her.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Reflection on practice</h4>
                        <p>Think of a situation when you have had to check the identity of someone who was enquiring about a patient/client on your ward.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>How did you feel about checking the identity of the person before you gave any information about their relative/friend?</li>
                            <li>What aspects of your information-sharing went well? What are your reasons for thinking this?</li>
                            <li>How effective was your explanation of the need to check the person's identity? What would you have preferred to have done differently?</li>
                            <li>If you had to explain the situation and the patient's or client's progress more than once, what were the reasons for this? Perhaps you might have worded your information differently or used shorter sentences. Perhaps the relative was more anxious than you realized and might have found it hard to take in everything you were saying.</li>
                            <li>How did the relative seem at the end of the interview? What are your reasons for thinking this?</li>
                            <li>What did you find most challenging in that situation? How will you use what you have learned from this reflection in your future practice?</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">GIVING INFORMATION OVER THE TELEPHONE</h3>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Dealing with an aggressive caller</h4>
                        <p>A man telephones the ward where you are a student nurse. He asks loudly if his wife Mrs James is there and how she is. He does not give you his name and when you ask for it, he becomes abusive and says: 'Don't be ridiculous! I've told you I am Mrs James's husband and I have a right to know how she is!' You are aware that Mrs James has described her marital status as 'separated'.</p>
                        <p>Some issues raised by this scenario:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Mrs James has said she is separated and therefore you must not assume to disclose any information about her to her estranged husband, unless she advises you otherwise.</li>
                            <li>As with all other enquirers, he needs to be treated with respect but Mrs James needs to have the final say as to who is informed about her progress.</li>
                            <li>He is aggressive. This can be a sign of acute distress caused by fear for a loved one but it could also be due to concern that he might not be able to find out about her because of her choices to exclude him for reasons of her own.</li>
                            <li>If Mrs James is happy for information to be disclosed to him you need to verify his identity (see below).</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Specific principles</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The principles of confidentiality as stated in the Nursing and Midwifery Code of Conduct (Nursing and Midwifery Council 2008) and patient or client choice apply to the disclosure of information concerning them to relatives enquiring about their progress.</li>
                            <li>If anyone requests information about someone in your care, it is important to be sure of the identity of the person enquiring and whether or not the patient or client wants them to be kept informed (see Ch. 7).</li>
                            <li>As before, always ensure that what you tell relatives and enquirers is accurate, appropriate and that you have the authority to disclose the information.</li>
                            <li>The information we share on the telephone must always reflect the wishes of those in our care, not those of their family and/or friends.</li>
                            <li>It is essential always to be clear that the patient or client consents to your sharing information, exactly what information you may share and with whom, whether on the telephone or in person.</li>
                            <li>On the telephone it is easier to miss situations where there is a risk of violence to the person in your care. These are as crucial as they are in face-to-face enquiries. You must ensure that you do not expose the patient to risk by inadvertently disclosing information such as their whereabouts. Note that this takes forethought and skill.</li>
                            <li>Always verify the identity of the enquirer as far as possible. If necessary, ask for a telephone number which you can check against next-of-kin details and/ or which you can use to telephone the enquirer back.</li>
                            <li>If you are unsure as to the identity of the enquirer refrain from disclosing anything about the patient, including that they are in your unit or on the ward. It is important to take care not to do this inadvertently by saying something that infers their condition or implies that they are on your unit.</li>
                            <li>Whenever possible, share information in a private place, out of earshot of others. If this is not possible when using the telephone, keep your voice low so others are less likely to overhear your conversation.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Preparation of self</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Take time to notice how you are feeling in response to the caller's attitude. You might be taken aback by his vociferousness or indeed frightened by his behaviour.</li>
                            <li>When we feel strong emotional responses, especially when we find ourselves in unexpectedly intense situations, we can respond immediately 'from the heart' without thinking. Here the old maxim 'count to 10' can help us draw breath before saying anything.</li>
                            <li>Consider how the caller might be feeling. This can help you choose words which demonstrate empathy by acknowledging his anger (Lindenfield 1992), rather than those which might alienate the caller.</li>
                            <li>Speak calmly without raising your voice and in measured tones. Avoid raising your voice in response.</li>
                            <li>Say something like: 'I understand that my not discussing anything concerning our patients with you, can be very frustrating and therefore you sound angry.' Avoid platitudes like: 'I hear you sound angry', or 'I know how you feel.' None of us can 'know' exactly how someone else feels, as we are all unique and respond to situations in our own way. Likewise, it is not possible to 'make' someone feel the way they do, although it is possible to understand how they might be feeling in a given situation.</li>
                            <li>Reflecting back (Clark 2003) to the caller what they are saying, can help them to feel you empathize with their situation, and thus they may calm down. Be wary of using the 'fogging strategy' (Clark 2003) as that can fuel the person's anger and frustration, particularly if it sounds as if they are being fobbed off or condescended to, however inadvertently.</li>
                            <li>Keep in mind what you know about the behaviour of abusive intimate partners and relatives. If this is the case, be very careful not to disclose that Mrs James is on the ward.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Environment</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Think about the environment you are in. Is the telephone in the middle of the ward, or are you answering it in the office?</li>
                            <li>If you are in a public area, who is likely to overhear you? Would it be better to take the call in the ward office?</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Putting the skills into practice</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Keep your voice calm and well-modulated.</li>
                            <li>Ask for the caller's name and address him by it.</li>
                            <li>Offer empathy and encourage cooperation by saying something like, 'I can appreciate you are concerned, Mr X, but I am sure you will understand that for reasons of patient confidentiality, I cannot let you know who is on the ward.'</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Note:</strong> Do not ask the caller to hold the line while you enquire, because this action will disclose to him that she is on the ward.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Avoid being drawn into a battle of wills, by repeating your statement courteously and firmly, but recognizing all along that he is obviously concerned.</li>
                            <li>Do not ask for contact details by which you can ensure he is contactable by his estranged wife, as this will disclose her whereabouts.</li>
                            <li>End the conversation by thanking him for calling and for his understanding and say goodbye.</li>
                            <li>After you have ended the call, go and talk to Mrs James and let her know Mr X had called asking after her. Explain that as you were aware she was separated from her husband and you did not know whether or not she wanted him informed about her whereabouts and condition, you did not let him know she was on the ward.</li>
                            <li>Clarify with Mrs James who she would like informed about her presence on the ward and offer to help her telephone Mr X if that is what she would like to do.</li>
                            <li>Ensure that you record Mrs James's wishes and this incident in the nursing records and that you notify your colleagues at handover.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Reflection on practice</h4>
                        <p>Think about a situation from practice when you have had to deal with an aggressive caller on the telephone.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Consider how you felt when the caller became aggressive and impatient with you. What were your gut reactions? These are 'as valuable as theory' (Ash 1995: 26). How did these feelings affect your thinking?</li>
                            <li>When you recall what you actually said, were there any particular points in the interactions that resulted in the caller being mollified?</li>
                            <li>What aspects of the conversation did you deal with well? What aspects of this conversation could you have dealt with better? What are your reasons for thinking this?</li>
                            <li>How do you feel you dealt with the caller's distress?</li>
                            <li>How do you think what you have learnt from this situation will influence your practice in future?</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Informing relatives of an emergency admission</h4>
                        <p>A patient is admitted to your ward following a fall in which he fractured his ankle and he now needs surgery. You need to ring his wife and inform her of his admission.</p>
                        <p>Some issues raised by this scenario:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Consider whether you have the skills to carry out this task or need supervision from someone else. If you do need to ask someone more experienced, try to listen to what is said so that you can gain experience.</li>
                            <li>Your patient is likely to be anxious about not having contacted his wife as his admission was an emergency. He is also likely to be very concerned about how his wife might respond to the news.</li>
                            <li>Anxiety can make it difficult for patients to think clearly. Your patient might therefore have difficulty remembering where his wife is and how to contact her.</li>
                            <li>The patient's wife might well be quite shocked by your telephone call and the news you are giving her.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Specific principles</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The principles of confidentiality and patient choice addressed above apply to the disclosure of information concerning them to their relatives, even when they have asked you to contact their next-of-kin.</li>
                            <li>It is important to check with the patient exactly the name and contact details of his wife and what he is happy for her to know about his circumstances and condition. If necessary, write down exactly what he would like her to be told.</li>
                            <li>Make the call as soon as possible after the patient has been admitted.</li>
                            <li>Take into account the effect your call and the news is likely to have on the recipient. This patient's wife is likely to be shocked and need reassurance.</li>
                            <li>As it is most unlikely that your patient will have any toiletries and pyjamas, ask him what he would like his wife to bring in. Make a list of what he needs. Remember to suggest things like reading matter that might make the time pass more quickly.</li>
                            <li>If the patient's wife asks you about his progress be sure to use language that is reassuring but honest. Do not disclose anything more than the patient has agreed for you to say.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Preparation of self</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Consider how you feel about contacting a stranger to advise her of her husband's accident. How do you think your feelings might interfere with how you will break the news that he is in hospital?</li>
                            <li>Choose beforehand the words you will use to describe your patient's circumstances and condition to her. If necessary, write out your opening sentences or list a few phrases to help you through the conversation.</li>
                            <li>Be prepared for a relative who might be anxious, unco-operative or unwilling to help.</li>
                            <li>Think about what you might say in these circumstances.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Environment</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>As always, it is important to think about the environment you are in. Ensure as far as possible you are out of earshot of people other than the healthcare team. If you can, use the office telephone.</li>
                            <li>Try to ensure that you are unlikely to be interrupted when you are making the call; finish immediate tasks and close the office door when you make the call.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Putting the skills into practice</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Before you pick up the telephone, check that you are sure of the wife's name and title. Check also that you have the correct number and the list of your patient's requirements.</li>
                            <li>When the telephone is answered, introduce yourself with your title and place of work and ask to speak to the woman concerned by her full name, i.e. title, first name and surname.</li>
                            <li>Be sure to reassure the person receiving your call that there is no cause for her to be unduly worried.</li>
                            <li>Ask her name before you disclose anything.</li>
                            <li>Explain clearly the circumstances of your call. You might say something like, 'There is nothing to worry about unduly, but unfortunately your husband (name) has been admitted to our ward (name) at (name of hospital). He has asked me to let you know he fell and broke his ankle today and will need an operation later, but that he is alright and you're not to worry.'</li>
                            <li>Answer all the wife's questions as honestly as you can in a well-modulated tone and with empathy. Acknowledge that this is probably a shock for her. Reassure her as to your patient's progress and condition.</li>
                            <li>Listen carefully for any feelings she might be expressing in her comments and questions. Demonstrate empathy by paraphrasing briefly what his wife is saying and by not answering too quickly. Pausing like this also gives you time to think about how you might respond sensitively as well as demonstrates that you are listening (Nelson-Jones 2006).</li>
                            <li>His wife is likely to want to visit and bring him his pyjamas and toiletries. When it seems appropriate, tell her he has said what he would like her to bring. List clearly all the things your patient has asked for. Ask his wife to clarify what she has understood.</li>
                            <li>Ask her if she has any messages for her husband or questions for you.</li>
                            <li>Before ending the conversation, ensure she knows the ward details, its whereabouts, how to reach the hospital and how to contact you. Advise her of how to get there and repeat your name and the ward telephone number.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Reflection on practice</h4>
                        <p>Think of a situation when you have had to telephone an unsuspecting relative to give news about a patient.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>What did you think and feel before you made the telephone call? Well-prepared, rushed, ill at ease? How did you deal with your feelings?</li>
                            <li>How well did you establish a professional relationship with the relative? Review what you actually said. Were there any particular points in the interactions that helped you to build a rapport with them?</li>

                            <li>Were there any aspects of this conversation that you could have dealt with better? What are your reasons for thinking this? Your feelings about the call might help you reflect on this aspect of your practice.</li>
