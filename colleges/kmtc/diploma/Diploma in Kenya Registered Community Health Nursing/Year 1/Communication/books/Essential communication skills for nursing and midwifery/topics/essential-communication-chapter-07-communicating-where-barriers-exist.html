                        </h2>
                        <p>As health care practitioners we communicate in a wide variety of environments, on multiple occasions with an infinite variety of people, often using equipment such as the telephone, facsimile machine, e-mail and visual aids such as cue cards. The focus of this chapter is the development of skills to communicate effectively across barriers. There are situations where this may be difficult and misperceptions and misunderstandings may result.</p>
                        <p>This chapter aims to address some of the situations where effective communication requires specific consideration. The chapter is divided into two sections, the first addressing telephone skills and the second outlining other situations where effective communication might be difficult. These include the use of appropriate language; assisting people who are deaf or hard of hearing; assisting people who are blind or partially sighted; assisting people who have dementia; using cue cards effectively and the importance of being aware of the resources available for interpretation.</p>

                        <span class="heading-text">TELEPHONE SKILLS</span>
                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Speaking on the telephone is, for most people, an everyday occurrence. It is a means of both social and professional communication. There are, however, certain conventions that are acceptable in social discourse on the telephone that would be inappropriate in professional circumstances, e.g. how we greet the caller when we answer the telephone. Although we cannot see each other while speaking on the telephone, strong impressions about one another and the organization, can be transmitted. It is important therefore to develop skills in using the telephone in order to convey a courteous and efficient manner and develop appropriate professional relationships with callers.</p>
                        <p>Throughout the working day, there are a number of experiences that remain in your preconscious and/or unconscious but will have an effect on your practice and communication. Furthermore, in some instances callers will try to elicit information which they know they are not party to, from staff over the telephone.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Answering the telephone when you are busy</h3>
                        <p>The ward is very busy and one member of staff is off sick. You are busy with a patient or client but notice that the telephone has been ringing for some time. Having excused yourself from the person in your care, you answer the telephone.</p>
                        <p>This scenario explores how these experiences might influence your telephone manner and how any negative experiences might be prevented.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Principles</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The telephone does not provide the visual information that is used to complement communication that occurs during face-to-face conversation. This lack of visual information and contact means that hearing needs to be finely attuned.</li>
                            <li>If you are having or have had a difficult day, your tiredness or irritability might be inadvertently evident in your tone or the words you use.</li>
                            <li>It is important to signal the opening and closing of the conversation. The opening of the conversation must include personal identity and the location.</li>
                            <li>Listening skills need to be more finely attuned to particular aspects of communication, e.g. the caller's tone of voice, any pauses in the conversation, what is said/not said or what is implied.</li>
                            <li>Careful consideration needs to be given to how any questions are worded.</li>
                            <li>Always ensure that the caller has a legitimate reason for obtaining/is authorized to be given information.</li>
                            <li>Clear coherent speech, with clarification sought at regular intervals, is essential.</li>
                            <li>If the caller is to be left while further information is obtained, he or she should be informed of the forthcoming break in communication and the reason for this. The 'secrecy' button should then be used while the caller is awaiting your return to prevent other conversations being overheard.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Note:</strong> See chapter 5 on safeguarding patient/client confidentiality.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Preparation of self</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>You need to be aware of how you feel about being short-staffed as well as being interrupted while you were giving care.</li>
                            <li>Taking a deep breath, clearing your mind and smiling might help you dissipate any anger or frustration you might have. Standing firmly on the ground or sitting rather than shifting from one foot to another might help you remain calm and focused. It's not the caller's fault that you are having a difficult day!</li>
                            <li>It would also be helpful if you consider that the caller might also be anxious or frustrated about the nature of the call they are making and the difficulties they might have had getting through to the ward (Farrell 1996).</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Environment</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>What else is going on in the ward that might affect the quality of your telephone conversation?</li>
                            <li>Who else can hear the conversation you are about to have? It might be appropriate to transfer the caller to a quieter and more private location.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Putting the skills into practice</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Make sure that you leave your patient or client safe and comfortable before leaving to answer the phone.</li>
                            <li>Identify the ward, your status and your name, in a clear and unhurried manner. If the caller has not already stated what they want, ask how you can help.</li>
                            <li>Apologize for the fact that the caller has been kept waiting.</li>
                            <li>If the caller starts the conversation before you have had the opportunity to do any of the above, you will need to listen to what they have to say and give the information at an appropriate point.</li>
                            <li>It is important not to become defensive if the caller complains about how long they have had to wait to get through to the ward. Telling the caller that you are busy might at times be appropriate. However, this is not an intervention that addresses the caller's concerns; in fact it might exacerbate them, particularly if they take this to mean that the staff are too busy to look after their relative.</li>
                            <li>Adjust your tone accordingly to reflect the nature of the conversation.</li>
                            <li>Deal with the caller's enquiry with confidence and repeat the apology in your parting statement.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Reflection on practice</h4>
                        <p>Think of a situation from your experience where you have answered the telephone when busy.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>How would you ensure that the person in your care was safe and comfortable before leaving to answer the phone?</li>
                            <li>When in similar situations on the telephone, do you consider that you have presented a calm and reassuring manner?</li>
                            <li>If you have been calm in such situations and able to reassure the caller, how did you manage to achieve this?</li>
                            <li>If, on reflection, you felt hurried and less understanding of the caller's needs than you could be, what would you need to do differently if a similar situation arose again?</li>
                            <li>Were you able to provide the information that the caller required? If not, what other resources were available to you?</li>
                            <li>Having ended the conversation, was there anything else you wished you had said or done? How are you going to increase the likelihood of remembering these aspects in the future?</li>
                            <li>If you have to leave a patient or client to attend to another issue, consider how you might respond if they seem to be annoyed or feel inconvenienced (see also Ch. 8, "Dealing with embarrassing situations").</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Being professional on the telephone</h3>
                        <p>A caller asks you about the condition of a relative. You do not know who the patient is.</p>
                        <p>The importance of establishing and maintaining trust and confidence over the telephone is addressed in this scenario.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Preparation of self</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Consider how the caller might be feeling.</li>
                            <li>Identify the name of the unit and introduce yourself.</li>
                            <li>Think of a statement that will be reassuring and lets the caller know that even although you do not know the patient, you are still concerned and wish to help them.</li>
                            <li>Take a deep breath, relax and smile, this will help your voice sound warmer and reflect interest and enthusiasm.</li>
                        </ul>

                            <li>Inform the caller that you will go and speak to the person in charge rather than saying, 'I don't know who that is' or 'I've never heard of that patient'. A more appropriate response would be to say that you are not familiar with that particular patient.</li>
                            <li>Before leaving to seek this information from other staff members, inform the caller that you are going to get further information and apply the 'secrecy' button.</li>
                            <li>On returning to the caller, let them know who you are transferring them to before passing the receiver to the staff member.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <ul>
                            <li>When in situations where you have been distracted while giving care, you will need to consider whether your attitude and manner led the caller to feel confident in you as a professional practitioner. If so, how did you achieve this? If not, what could you do differently?</li>
                            <li>In similar situations where you have to pass information on to other people, what information do they need in order to help a third party efficiently?</li>
                            <li>Having put the receiver down or handed the caller over to someone else, have there been times when you wished you had said or done something differently? By reflecting on such a situation you can continue to develop and improve your skills and confidence.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Maintaining confidentiality on the telephone</h3>
                        <p>A caller enquires about a relative and asks you what sort of illnesses are treated on the ward.</p>
                        <p>Some issues raised by this scenario:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Maintaining patient confidentiality when an anxious relative is requesting information</li>
                            <li>Strategies for maintaining professional competence and reassuring relatives.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Putting the skills into practice</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Identify the ward, your status and your name in a clear and unhurried manner. If the caller has not already stated what they want, ask how you can help them.</li>
                            <li>Permission should always be obtained from the individuals in your care before you pass on any information concerning their presence on your unit or their details/condition to enquirers. It is crucial that any inadvertent direct or indirect disclosure of the presence of a patient or woman being in your care or on your ward, is always avoided. This issue is crucial when a person is fleeing from their partner because of domestic violence, e.g. a pregnant or newly delivered woman is at increased risk of being killed by her current or former partner (see Richards 2003 and Ch. 5).</li>
                            <li>Ascertain exactly who the caller is and let them know that you will see if the patient is awake and able to speak with them. If the patient does not wish to or is unable to speak with the caller, take a message, repeating it to the patient in order to ensure that you convey their wishes to the caller.</li>
                            <li>If the caller asks for more information relating to the nature of the patient's condition or nature of the ward speciality, politely decline to disclose this unless there is a previous agreement with the patient about who can have information about their condition (see above).</li>
                            <li>It might be appropriate to refer to an external authority, such as the hospital or professional policy by saying that it is hospital policy not to give such information. However, internalized professional values relating to respecting privacy and maintaining confidentiality, along with the ability to demonstrate these with ease, are signs of an expert practitioner.</li>
                            <li>If the patient consents for information to be given, it is important that you consider the words that you are going to use, since you might not know the circumstances and condition of the caller. It is generally useful to establish when the caller last saw their relative. If the patient's condition has deteriorated, you might say something like: 'There is some concern about her/his condition now.' If this is the case, consider whether you need to ask someone with more experience to take the call.</li>
                        </ul>

                            <li>When speaking to concerned relatives over the telephone, to what extent have you been able to address the caller's enquiry efficiently?</li>
                            <li>Have there been any aspects of patient confidentiality that you found difficult to maintain over the telephone or face-to-face with a relative?</li>

                            <li>Identify the ward, your status and your name in a clear and unhurried manner. If the caller has not already stated what they want, ask how you can help them.</li>
                            <li>Since you might need to call back to clarify a piece of information, it is essential that you ascertain the name of the person to whom you are speaking.</li>
                            <li>Ask the caller to wait while you get something to record the information on. There might be a designated book for this or the information might go directly into the patient's records.</li>

                        <span class="heading-text">COMMUNICATING WHERE BARRIERS EXIST</span>
                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>One of the greatest challenges in nursing and midwifery practice is to be able to communicate effectively with those in our care and their families when barriers to communication exist. When caring for patients and clients who have communication difficulties, it is important that we consider how we might demonstrate the core conditions of helping and building effective therapeutic relationships with those in our care. In order to do so, we need to bear in mind how patients and clients might be feeling and thinking and how this might affect their behaviour and that of their families.</p>
                        <p>There are many potential barriers to communication that nurses and midwives will regularly need to deal with, e.g. deafness, language differences and speech impairment following a stroke. In midwifery, particularly on the labour ward, relationships sometimes have to be established in a quick and trusting manner in order to facilitate the optimum outcome for mother and baby. Consider what barriers to effective communication you have experienced in practice and what you did to overcome them.</p>
                        <p>Imagine you are in a foreign country where you do not speak the language. You suddenly have terrible abdominal pain and need help. What might you be thinking? How might you feel? How will you be able to explain your needs to people who come to your aid? People who cannot speak English, and those who are blind, deaf or disabled by learning difficulties, brain injury or illness causing thought and memory impairment - or confusion because of shock, or dementia associated with ageing - are also likely to face these thoughts and feelings when they are distressed or ill and need help.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Factors influencing communication</h3>
                        <p>Whaley & Wong (1991) identified a number of factors that influence communication:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Perceptions</strong> (how we see ourselves, others and the situations we are in)</li>
                            <li><strong>Values</strong> (which underpin our ethical decisions, thoughts about them and behaviour)</li>
                            <li><strong>Development</strong> (our age and life stage affect how we perceive and experience situations)</li>
                            <li><strong>Personal space</strong> (proximity and how we use the space around us have an impact on how we are perceived and how we feel)</li>
                            <li><strong>Emotions</strong> (can be very powerful and have significant consequences for effective communication)</li>
                            <li><strong>Sociocultural background</strong> (see Ch. 1 for the implications of this)</li>
                            <li><strong>Knowledge</strong> (this gives us a framework of reference and can be used as a means of power and control, as in expert power, described by Grasha (1995: 358, after Raven 1992)</li>
                            <li><strong>Roles and relationships</strong> (social status and relationships, both formal and informal, influence communication)</li>
                            <li><strong>Environment</strong> (this is addressed throughout the text as significant in all interactions between people).</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The model of communication that underpins the approach of this book (see Ch. 1) highlights the significance of our personal history, social history and our history in society. These issues are likely to become more obvious when barriers exist and we are trying to communicate effectively across them. These histories affect both our conscious and unconscious processes and might reflect unhelpful attitudes that, in turn, reflect the prejudices of society.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Principles</h3>
                        <p>In order to communicate effectively where barriers exist, we need to consider a number of principles.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Therapeutic relationship</h4>
                        <p>The provision of the core conditions of warmth and respect, empathetic understanding and openness and genuineness (Rogers 1957) are as crucial here as in any other therapeutic relationship. When people have difficulties in communicating, offering these conditions will help them to feel safe and cared for, even although they might have problems expressing their needs. The ways in which we demonstrate these core conditions are likely to be subtly different from how we would do so when we are communicating where there are no barriers. An example of this could be that we might give more eye contact when talking to someone who is deaf.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Language issues</h4>
                        <p>The use of dialect or specific expressions varies across different parts of the country but also among age groups, social backgrounds and people with disabilities. It is important to bear this in mind when we are talking to people where there are communication difficulties, as they may use language that is unfamiliar to us or that means something different from what is expected by us. Not being aware of this possibility can add to the risks of misunderstanding and confusion. Regional and foreign accents can impede verbal communication and mutual understanding. In the area of your practice it is important to consider whether your way of speaking and use of non-verbal cues could be a barrier to effective communication. For example, a Yorkshire accent may be unintelligible to an elderly person born and brought up in the East End of London. This is a similar situation for first generation migrants, regardless of whether they are the carers or the people receiving the care.</p>
                        <p>Working with people when barriers to communication exist frequently takes more time than when there are no difficulties. It is therefore important to make enough time available to listen to your clients' and patients' needs and explain the care they are receiving. This skill is an important way to demonstrate respect and empathy. Take care to avoid using inappropriate terms of endearment or controlling language, e.g. 'dear', 'lovey', 'good boy'. This demonstrates disrespect and is discourteous. It is important always to check your understanding of the patients' needs as well as clarifying their understanding of what you have communicated, with them (see Chs 5 and 10).</p>
                        <p>Being honest about not understanding and thus asking clients to repeat what they have said is an essential skill (Brearley & Birchley 1994). It demonstrates respect and concern for the client and can reassure them that you are making a genuine effort to understand. However, it is important to do this without displaying signs of irritation. Sometimes we might have particular anxieties about disabilities or situations where communication is likely to be difficult. If we are aware of our own anxieties in these circumstances, we are more likely to be sensitive and patient, particularly when we are under pressure.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Cultural issues</h4>
                        <p>All societies have norms and values about people's roles and status. It is important to bear in mind the cultures from which those in our care come as well as our own culture and that in which we work. Discriminatory attitudes such as ageism (Le May 1998, Scrutton 1999) do occur and may influence how those we care for perceive us and how we perceive them. Self-awareness is particularly important when we communicate where barriers exist because unconscious prejudices may hinder the successful building of therapeutic relationships.</p>
                        <p>Our assumptions about people's ability to communicate can be influenced by a variety of factors such as the situation or our previous experience, with the consequence that we make inappropriate assessments of how extensive the hindrances to communication are. An example here is that in some cultures a woman may not say anything in front of her husband, as it is important that she defers to him in public. Practitioners might then assume that she cannot speak English, which is not necessarily the case. Being aware of, and using formal interpreting services in practice is essential. Confidentiality can easily be broken by inappropriate use of family members or other patients as interpreters. This can result in patients not disclosing their needs or indeed these not being explained, with the result that appropriate care is not offered.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Deafness and partial sight</h4>
                        <p>Never assume that everyone who comes for healthcare can see and/or hear. If a patient has not responded to their name, always check that they have seen and/or heard you. This also applies in hospitals and residential homes when meals and drinks are brought. Always let the patients know you have brought them a meal. Social definitions of disability can be prescribed by those without the disability, e.g. use of the term 'hearing loss' sounds like a medical definition with an emphasis on the lack of hearing ability, whereas deaf people prefer the positive description 'deaf' as this describes them as they are, not as lacking the ability to hear.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Dementia and cognitive difficulties</h4>
                        <p>Where people have chronic communication difficulties resulting from illness like dementia, it is important to have an understanding of how their illness has affected their speech and interaction with others. How we respond to others is not only about how well we know them, but also about the social context and physical environment as well as the nature of our relationship with them (see Ch. 1). If illness impairs memory and/or the ability to think about who one is and thus one's sense of self as well as how you want to express your needs, communication becomes very difficult (see Ch. 4).</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Aids to communication</h4>
                        <p>In the UK, the Disability Discrimination Act 2005 requires all public organizations to:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Promote equality of opportunity between disabled persons and other persons</li>
                            <li>Eliminate discrimination that is unlawful under the Act.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>This duty means that people with disabilities must be offered services according to their needs, even if it means offering more facilities to them than to people without disabilities (Disability Rights Commission 2005: 2.13). It is therefore important to recognize that communication aids are central to sound care delivery and should be available in all healthcare settings. Likewise the provision of sign language interpreters for deaf people is a responsibility of the public authorities providing the services (see Disability Discrimination Act 2005).</p>
                        <p>Aids to communication such as cue or picture cards, pen and paper are essential equipment in any healthcare setting. Sign language used by deaf people has its own social conventions, vernacular and dialect. British Sign Language has now been recognized by the UK government as an official language. It can be helpful for practitioners to learn some sign language in order to develop professional relationships with clients and colleagues.</p>

                        <p>Mr Richard Laycock is a 90-year-old man who is admitted to your ward for treatment of a chest infection. He is breathless and feeling unwell. You are allocated to do his nursing assessment. He greets you briefly but with a smile and says: 'My, but I'm crook, nurse!'</p>
                        <p>Some issues raised by this scenario:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Mr Laycock is considerably older than the staff. His language is likely therefore to be of his generation.</li>
                            <li>The use of the word 'crook' (meaning unwell) might be confusing to others. It does not mean he is a dishonest person, i.e. a crook!</li>
                            <li>His breathlessness means that talking is likely to be exhausting.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Specific principles</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>It is important to consider Mr Laycock's age. His use of language is likely to be of his generation and therefore different from yours.</li>
                            <li>Respect is demonstrated by clarifying how he prefers to be addressed (see Ch. 3), and by avoiding the use of inappropriate terms of endearment such as 'darling'. This latter can be perceived as condescending.</li>
                            <li>Communication is a two-way process, so if you do not understand any terms he uses, it is important to ask for clarification.</li>
                            <li>Use language that is unambiguous and does not require long explanations. Avoid jargon (Le May 1998). For example: 'For how long have you been breathless?' requires a short answer like: 'Three days.' This ensures Mr Laycock can give you a specific answer without a long explanation.</li>
                            <li>Allow time for Mr Laycock to express his needs, which should be actively sought even although you are trying to limit the demands on his strength.</li>
                            <li>Avoid controlling language such as leading questions like: 'You aren't bothered too much by the oxygen mask, are you, Mr Laycock?' This does little to enhance his trust in you (Le May 1998) and does not demonstrate respect.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Preparation of self</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Think about how you feel about Mr Laycock's condition. Have you cared for an older adult with similar health problems and communication difficulties?</li>
                            <li>Consider carefully what you want to ask Mr Laycock in the assessment; his breathlessness will make long explanations difficult and tiring.</li>
                            <li>Think about how you are feeling. You might feel apprehensive about asking too much of a patient in obvious distress.</li>
                            <li>Consider what sort of information you need from Mr Laycock in order to do an accurate assessment of his needs. Decide what information can wait until he is a bit better, so you don't demand too much from him at this first meeting. What information can be gained from other sources, e.g. the medical notes or an accompanying relative?</li>
                            <li>What is the best way for you to gain this information? Closed questions require short answers. These are more appropriate for Mr Laycock, as talking is likely to be strenuous and stressful for him.</li>
                            <li>How will you open, conduct and close the interview?</li>
                            <li>Think about what you have noticed about Mr Laycock's demeanour. Is he cheerful when you are with him but subdued and struggling to relax when he is not talking to anyone? How will this influence the language and questions you choose and the tone of your voice?</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Environment</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Ideally this should be private, out of earshot and quiet so Mr Laycock does not have to raise his voice to be heard. This can be difficult to attain on an open ward, but pulling the curtains partially or completely around the bed can help to muffle sound and offers privacy.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Note:</strong> He might find the enclosing nature of the curtains adds to his respiratory distress as he might experience the closed curtains as confining and restricting the flow of air.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Consider where you will position yourself in relation to Mr Laycock. You need to be close enough for him to see you and for you to hear him, but take care not to assume a proximity that might seem discourteous or intrusive. It is important not to crowd him as he is breathless and might experience this as suffocating.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Putting the skills into practice</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>What you observe about Mr Laycock will guide you as to how to open the interview so you can avoid putting unnecessary demands on him for lengthy explanations. This would also apply to a patient in pain.</li>
                            <li>Approach his bed quietly as he has respiratory distress. Consider where you will position yourself. A chair near his bed is probably best so he does not feel crowded.</li>
                            <li>Make your greeting and introduction short but friendly. A short social interaction such as: 'It is nice to meet you, Mr Laycock' is appropriate here but social chit-chat extends the interaction and could add to his discomfort.</li>
                            <li>When you begin your assessment it is important to explain your reasons for the questions you are asking and that you will try to phrase them so that he only needs to give short answers.</li>
                            <li>Clarify with him any terms he might use, like 'crook', by asking: "'Crook" isn't a term I fully understand. Does it mean that you feel really unwell?'</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Reflection on practice</h4>
                        <p>Think about a situation from your nursing experience when you cared for someone with respiratory distress or in pain.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>What were your feelings while you were working with the patient? How do you think they influenced the way you spoke and the language you chose?</li>
                            <li>How successful were you in keeping your language clear and straightforward? What questions seemed most effective?</li>
                            <li>How successful were you in helping to avoid the patient having to give long-winded explanations?</li>
                            <li>What would you like to have done differently? What observations of yourself and your patient's responses prompted you to consider these changes?</li>
                            <li>What feedback did you give the nursing team in order that they understand your patient's communication needs? How, when and where did you give it? What did you document in the care plan?</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Using culturally sensitive language</h3>
                        <p>Joshua is a young man of 17 years old. He is getting out of bed for the first time since he fractured his tibia and fibula in a motorcycle collision. You are helping him to sit comfortably in a chair beside his bed. Once he is safely in the chair you ask him how he feels. He replies: 'It's cool to be out of bed! My leg is OK, but I feel as if my arse belongs to someone else!'</p>
                        <p>Some issues raised by this scenario:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Confusion might arise from the use of the word 'cool', i.e. it might be interpreted as his feeling cold now he is out of bed.</li>
                            <li>The use of the term 'arse' might be offensive to other patients within earshot and indeed some nurses might find it vulgar and not respectful towards them.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Specific principles</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>It is important to consider Joshua's age and developmental stage. He is in late adolescence and probably still vulnerable to feelings of insecurity and thus uncertainty about how to behave appropriately. These feelings might mean that he behaves with bravado or he might appear withdrawn or moody, i.e. he might create barriers to effective communication.</li>
                            <li>Careful consideration needs to be given to how Joshua might be feeling as a developing young man suddenly dependent on others to do intimate things for him, at a time when he is gaining independence and becoming increasingly adult. This is particularly significant if the nurses are not much older than he is. Consequently, Joshua might adopt behaviour that aims perhaps, to shock or irritate in order to assert his independence. Your response needs to take into account his age and his feelings about how this situation affects his sexual and self-image (Hoff et al 2009, Price & Gwin 2007).</li>
                            <li>It is important that we are aware of our response, why we are making it and what our feelings are. We might be the parents of adolescent children and want to respond to him as we would to our own children. However, if we respond to him in this way we might say something insensitive. This awareness will help us avoid negative responses, which are likely to create our own barriers to effective communication (see Ch. 1).</li>
                            <li>As a teenager Joshua uses language that is part of his subculture. It is important therefore that what he actually means is clarified. When he says 'cool', does this mean he is cold, or is he really pleased to be more independent and out of bed?</li>
                            <li>Use age-appropriate language. Joshua is old enough to understand formal language for anatomy and physiology, but avoid using long technical terms, which practitioners sometimes resort to when they are embarrassed or ill at ease.</li>
                            <li>In order to demonstrate genuineness it is important to avoid using language with which we do not feel comfortable and which we would not use ourselves.</li>
                            <li>Using terms like 'arse' might be something you feel comfortable with, but it can offend others. It is important to consider what image you are presenting when you use language that might offend or shock - maybe not Joshua himself, but those around him. This language might be appropriate when talking to Joshua but might not be if the patient were from a different background or age group.</li>
                            <li>It is also important to remember that if we use inappropriate language, we can cross professional boundaries and those in our care might feel less sure of how to relate to us.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Preparation of self</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Think about how you feel about Joshua's situation. How do you feel about a young man being so badly injured and subsequently dependent?</li>
                            <li>What reactions did you have to his language use? What language would you use instead without seeming to be critical of Joshua's preferred terminology?</li>
                            <li>Consider carefully how you are going to clarify exactly what Joshua means when he says his 'arse doesn't feel as if it belongs to him'. What sort of information do you need from Joshua to help him feel more comfortable?</li>
                            <li>What language will you use to describe his discomfort while he is sitting?</li>
                            <li>Think about what you have noticed about Joshua's demeanour. Is he trying to cover up pain by bravado? How will you deal with this?</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Environment</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Joshua is in a chair beside his bed and in view of the rest of the ward. Other patients might be watching to see how you respond to him and his reaction. It might be the first time since his admission that he has been in a position where he can have more relaxed interaction with ambulant patients and visitors.</li>
                            <li>Consider your proximity to Joshua before you address his concerns about his 'arse'. Positioning yourself too closely to him might feel embarrassing or intrusive.</li>
                            <li>If you need to attend to his discomfort, remember to close the curtains so that you do not expose him and cause him embarrassment.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Putting the skills into practice</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Respond to Joshua in a friendly and open way.</li>
                            <li>Stand near him and perhaps to one side and try to keep your eyes level with his. This is likely to entail crouching down to his level or sitting on a stool or chair. Avoid stooping over him as he might feel this is intimidating.</li>
                            <li>Ask him to explain exactly what he means when he mentions his discomfort. You might say: 'That sounds very uncomfortable, Joshua. What exactly is the sensation that you have now you are sitting in a chair and which part of you feels as if it doesn't belong to you?'</li>
                            <li>Clarify with him any terms he might use like 'cool' if you are unfamiliar with his vernacular. You might say with a smile: "'The word "cool" can have several meanings. What exactly did you mean when you said it was "cool" to be out of bed?'</li>
                            <li>Draw the curtains round and help Joshua to get comfortable. If you feel he was making some sort of sexual innuendo out of bravado or embarrassment it is wise to ask someone to help you so he is not alone with you.</li>
                            <li>It is important to engage his cooperation in repositioning him so it is a collaborative exercise as opposed to you 'doing something' to him. Be clear about how you want to help him reposition himself.</li>
                            <li>Be matter-of-fact if you need to alter his clothes or uncover him in any way that might risk embarrassing him. You might say something like: 'I'm going to need to lift your pyjama top. Perhaps you'd like to hold the blanket to keep yourself covered.'</li>
                            <li>Consider what you will document in his care plan.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Reflection on practice</h4>
                        <p>Think of a situation from your practice when you have cared for someone who was particularly sensitive to intimate care and the dependence it brought. Consider their use of colloquial language and how this might have been a means of covering their embarrassment.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>When you asked about the patient's comfort how did you feel about their response? You might have felt as if you hadn't 'got it quite right'. How do you think your feelings influenced the way you spoke to the patient and the language you chose? If you were embarrassed by the patient's language, how did you deal with that?</li>
                            <li>If you had to ask the patient what they meant by their colloquialism ('cool' in Joshua's case), how did they respond?</li>
                            <li>How successful were you in keeping your language clear and straightforward? What instructions seemed most effective in helping to get your patient's cooperation during the care process?</li>
                            <li>What, if anything, would you like to have done differently? What observations of yourself and your patient's responses prompted you to consider these changes to your practice?</li>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>(With grateful acknowledgements to Julie Hornsby (2009, 2004) and Sharon Lee (2004), sign language interpreters.)</p>
                        <p>If someone is deaf or hard of hearing they have a disability that is not necessarily obvious when we first encounter them. This can put them at a disadvantage if we do not assess their needs effectively. In a birthing environment, the woman is likely to be concerned and anxious not just for herself, but also for her baby. She may feel that options offered may be limited because of her difficulties. As we are likely to care for people who are deaf or hard of hearing, it is essential that we develop our skills of communicating with them effectively and sensitively in order to meet their nursing and midwifery needs appropriately.</p>
                        <p>In the UK, most service providers - such as Primary Care Trusts - will have service level agreements to provide sign language interpreters. These practitioners can be contacted through local authorities or an agency such as the Royal National Institute for the Deaf. It is also possible to have a deaf intermediary present (Casson-Webb & Wood 2009), particularly in situations that might entail legal reports, which can help the deaf person and the intermediary develop a rapport as the intermediary might have met the deaf person before the actual interview.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Giving directions to a person who is deaf or hard of hearing</h3>
                        <p>You are standing in the busy entrance to the hospital waiting to meet a colleague when a middle-aged woman who looks very distracted comes up to you and asks for directions to the Outpatients Department. You notice that she has a rather flat intonation to her voice, the words are slurred and she seems to stare at you as she speaks. You have to ask her to repeat her question. When you begin to explain she says: 'I'm sorry but I don't hear you very well. Please would you repeat that?' You then notice that she has a hearing aid.</p>
                        <p>Some issues raised by this scenario:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The woman's manner might at first seem anxious and her intense gaze perhaps a little rude. When people have difficulty hearing and the situation is unfamiliar it can exacerbate their feelings of anxiety.</li>
                            <li>The environment is noisy and this is likely to make it more difficult for a person with hearing loss to understand you.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Specific principles</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Often people are tempted to raise their voices when someone is hard of hearing. This is not helpful as it can distort their lip patterns and make it more difficult for the person to lip read.</li>
                            <li>As there are many causes of deafness and different forms of hearing loss, this underlines the importance of assessing individual needs and adjusting your communication strategy accordingly. For example, you might need a sign language interpreter and/or to use cue cards.</li>
                            <li>It is important to assess the client's ability to hear in that environment and adjust your response accordingly.</li>
                            <li>Best practice is always to carry a pen and paper while at work in case you are asked to help someone who is deaf.</li>
                            <li>Drawing pictures and enabling the deaf person to do so too, will aid effective communication.</li>
                            <li>Help the person to understand by pointing to the equipment or apparatus to be used and make appropriate gestures/movements, e.g. positioning yourself where you would like the person to be and pointing to the couch or chair.</li>
                            <li>If it is an unfamiliar situation for you, prepare yourself by practising how you will convey what is required of the person in that situation and how you will structure your communication.</li>
                            <li>People who have no speech can sometimes lip read, so even if you do not know sign language, always try and face a deaf or hard-of-hearing person when you are speaking to them.</li>
                            <li>Never touch people with hearing loss before they have seen you. They probably will not have heard you approaching and this can give them an unpleasant surprise. It is also disrespectful.</li>
                            <li>Wherever possible, it is best practice to use a registered interpreter for deaf people rather than an enthusiastic amateur. Family members should be used with caution to protect privacy and confidentiality and ensure accurate interpreting.</li>
                            <li>Always consider your employer's policies and practices about booking and using interpreters for deaf people. It is important to bear in mind that more notice is often required than is needed for interpreters for spoken languages.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Preparation of self</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Consider what your priorities are in this situation. You are meeting a colleague, but a hospital client needs your help. How might you help the client but not miss your colleague?</li>
                            <li>Think about your feelings. You might be embarrassed that you cannot fully understand what the client is saying, particularly as deaf people can have indistinct speech; or you might be anxious that you will miss your colleague. Acknowledging your feelings and putting them to one side helps to ensure that they do not interfere with the way in which you communicate verbally and non-verbally with the woman.</li>
                            <li>Decide on how you will invite the client to move to somewhere more suitable in which to talk and think about how best to give her clear and logical directions to the department requested. Consider the structure of your sentences as well as the language you will use. Always use short words and sentences.</li>
                            <li>Consider whether you need to draw her a map, or find a clear hospital plan to show her.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Environment</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>This environment is noisy and distracting. Therefore, it is important to suggest moving to a quieter place so the client can see and hear you better.</li>
                            <li>If it is not possible to find a quiet area or corridor, or it is inappropriate to go outside, make a quieter space by moving aside to a wall or into a quiet corner.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Putting the skills into practice</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Be friendly and smile as this demonstrates that you are willing to help.</li>
                            <li>Suggest that you move to one side and indicate this with your hands if necessary, demonstrating the need for a quieter, less busy place in which to talk.</li>
                            <li>Be aware of how you are feeling so that you can use your feelings to help you communicate effectively rather than allowing them to interfere with your practice.</li>
                            <li>Encourage a collaborative relationship by explaining to your client that you need to be within view of the main entrance, so she understands if you are unable to find somewhere quieter, well away from the entrance.</li>
                            <li>Telling her your name and asking her for hers can help encourage a collaborative relationship. It is important to wear your name badge and to draw it to her attention.</li>
                            <li>Position yourself so that the client can see her surroundings as well as seeing your face clearly. Ensure that you do not hem her in if you have to stand to one side in the entrance area. Do not stand in front of a door or window, as the light behind you will obscure your lip patterns. Position the client in front of the door or window instead.</li>
                            <li>It is important to talk slowly while facing the woman so she has the optimum opportunity to lip read (Quill 1995, Craddock 1991). Keep your voice well-modulated and at a normal pitch. Raising your voice is not necessary and, depending on the type of deafness, can make it more difficult for the client to understand.</li>
                            <li>If it is difficult to understand what you are being asked, it is important to request that the person repeats the question, possibly using 'different words' (Brearley & Birchley 1994: 62), or ask her to write her request.</li>
                            <li>Explain the directions logically, using clear simple sentences and beginning from where you both are now standing. Complicated directions can be confusing. Indicate by gesture the signs visible around you and the direction she should take. If necessary, draw her a map if you have a pen and paper with you, or show her the way.</li>
                            <li>You might ask her if she knows familiar landmarks or places in the hospital on the way to the Outpatients Department. This helps to put your directions into context.</li>
                            <li>When you have finished, ask her if she is now clear about how to find the Outpatients Department or whether she would like to repeat any of the information.</li>
                            <li>When you part, it can be reassuring to say you were pleased you could help.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Reflection on practice</h4>
                        <p>Think about a situation when you had to communicate with someone who was deaf or hard of hearing.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Some deaf people have visual impairments too (e.g. Usher's syndrome). Had you considered that the person you were seeing might have this or other disabilities too? Were you able to check their records beforehand, to ensure you were well-informed about their situations/diagnoses and specific needs? If not, how did you deal with the situation?</li>
                            <li>What did you feel when you first met the person you were going to help? You might have felt anxious that you would not communicate effectively, or irritated because the communication was taking much longer than you felt you had time for. You might have felt embarrassed because it took you a while to realize the person was deaf. You might also have felt uncomfortable if their speech was difficult to understand.</li>
                            <li>How successful were you at putting your feelings to one side so you could engage fully with the needs of the person? What helped and/or hindered this process?</li>
                            <li>How did your thoughts and feelings influence the way you spoke and the language you chose?</li>
                            <li>How successful were you in keeping your language clear and the sentences straightforward? How did the person respond?</li>
                            <li>What would you like to have done differently? What observations of yourself and the client's responses prompted you to consider these changes to your practice when communicating with people who are deaf or hard of hearing?</li>
                            <li>Consider what training needs you might have. It is always useful to learn a few words of sign language such as 'deaf', 'hello', 'good-bye', 'please' and 'thank you'. How do you think you would benefit from classes in British Sign Language?</li>
