                        </h2>
                        <p>Privacy and dignity are defined respectively as 'freedom from intrusion' and 'being worthy of respect' (Department of Health 2001: 204); both being identified 'as the softer aspects of care ... which are nevertheless crucial to the quality of care patients experience' (Department of Health 2001: 10). In 2008, the Royal College of Nursing launched the 'Dignity at the heart of everything we do' campaign and emphasized that in order for people to feel comfortable and valued, it had to be an essential feature of the care and attention provided. In the absence of the three key elements of dignity: respect, compassion and sensitivity, people might '... lack confidence, be unable to make decisions for themselves and feel humiliated, embarrassed and ashamed' (Royal College of Nursing 2008: 1). Respect is identified as 'the foundation on which all helping interventions are built . . . a way of viewing oneself and others' (Egan 2007: 53). Egan (2007) considers that respect is a value that one holds and that dignity is a belief about how others should be treated. The norms that link these two aspects are outlined as ensuring that no harm is done, being competent and committed in one's work and being able to withhold judgement and by being person-centred.</p>
                        <p>It would be reasonable to assume that all humans welcome privacy and expect to be treated with dignity and respect. There are, however, many variables that will affect how these qualities are demonstrated and experienced. These variables include age, gender, status, culture, ethnicity and health status. When meeting patients, their relatives and other healthcare professionals for the first time, the practitioner needs to convey trust and a professional manner.</p>
                        <p>The scenarios in this chapter are presented to illustrate how practitioners might further develop their communication skills, in order to ensure respect and dignity while carrying out their work. The specific skills that are explored in this chapter include greeting adults and children, leave-taking skills and how to end relationships with colleagues.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>When we meet people for the first time, the impression we make can be crucial for any continuing relationship with them. How we greet them is a significant part of this process. Berne (1975) explores the factors which influence what we say after we have said 'Hello'. While each person might have something to say, a number of considerations have to be taken into account in order for communication to be effective. The people with whom we come into contact might be anxious, frightened or angry. In the dementias, for example, memory and language are affected to different degrees, therefore as practitioners, making appropriate adjustments to our communication might help to address the person's concerns and facilitate an effective therapeutic relationship (Department of Health 2009). The dementias are '... acquired syndromes marked by chronic, global (not just memory and language problems) impairments of higher brain function occurring in alert patients which interfere with the ability to cope with daily living' (Nicholl 2006: 33).</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Principles</h3>
                        <p>When meeting patients/clients for the first time, it is important to introduce yourself and enquire about the identity of anyone else that might be with them. It is important to adjust the style of communication in accordance with the person or people with whom one is speaking. For example, if the person is deaf, practitioners should ensure that they stand at the side where the patient's hearing is best, face the patient and maintain good eye contact.</p>
                        <p>Social rules are learnt from within the context of one's upbringing and are integrated and activated at an unconscious level. It is therefore important for practitioners to increase their level of awareness with regard to meeting people from cultures different from their own in order to establish contact and reduce the risk of offence.</p>
                        <p>Forms of address vary across cultures, with some cultures placing higher regard on the use of titles than others. Individuals might feel offended if their full title is not used, since their title might denote status and possibly their occupation. It is important that practitioners also clarify how they would like to be addressed. Since there can be any number of different cultural groups in a large city, it would be unrealistic to be familiar with all of them. However, a lot can be learnt by observing the patient's preferred style of communication, the patient's use of eye contact and the extent to which they appear comfortable with your style of communication. The initial greeting can yield much information regarding the patient's level of understanding, degree of anxiety and support systems.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Greeting children and adults</h3>
                        <p>You are a student nurse on a nursery placement and this morning you have just met an adult who has brought a child into the nursery.</p>
                        <p>Issues identified include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The importance of creating a good first impression</li>
                            <li>How to help reassure individuals</li>
                            <li>The need for familiarity concerning security procedures.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Specific principles</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>When speaking with more than one person, it is imperative that communication is adjusted accordingly. For example, in this scenario the nurse might kneel down so as to be at the same level as the child.</li>
                            <li>The parent might feel more at ease if they see that the child is settled and consider that you have the ability to care for their child. This latter aspect can be established if the nurse appears suitably dressed and presents an appropriate professional manner (see Ch. 6).</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Preparation of self</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>What is the correct procedure for receiving children into the nursery? Is there a book or form that needs to be completed before the child is left?</li>
                            <li>What information do you have about the child/parent? What is their first language? Are they able to speak the formal language used in the nursery? If not, what resources are available that will assist your communication?</li>
                            <li>Is the person accompanying the child their parent/guardian?</li>
                            <li>What information do you need from the adult before they leave? For example, how has the child been over the last 24 hours? Has anything significant happened in the family that might affect the child's behaviour?</li>
                            <li>What strategies does the nursery employ to reduce parents' anxiety during the early days of the child's stay in the nursery? For example, some nurseries send a fax of the child's drawing to reassure parents that their child has settled and is engaged in activities.</li>
                            <li>Will you be the person spending time with the child during that day? If so, the parent might feel reassured to know this.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Environment</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The nursery environment can be one where the child feels secure and happy or where they are distressed and need longer to adjust.</li>
                            <li>The parent might be unsure about leaving the child at the nursery, therefore it is important to present a warm, friendly and professional atmosphere.</li>
                            <li>The environment also needs to take into account the cultural groups that the children represent, by providing facilities to ensure effective communication and development. Examples of this include the availability of toys that reflect the diversity of the children.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Putting the skills into practice</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Greet the adult both non-verbally, with a smile for example, and verbally by introducing yourself.</li>
                            <li>Then greet the child using age-appropriate language; this might include involving any toys they might have with them in the conversation.</li>
                            <li>Use short sentences if either the parent or the child speaks little English. If no English is spoken, an advocate/interpreter might be necessary.</li>
                            <li>Find out how the child has been over the previous 24 hours.</li>
                            <li>Posture, tone of voice and facial expression are very important, since there is a need to engage with both the adult and the child. This will also enable you to make an assessment of parenting style and the child's attachment style (Ainsworth et al 1978).</li>
                            <li>Address any concerns that the parent might have, particularly if they are new to the nursery environment, and remind them of the activities that are available during the day.</li>
                            <li>If the child is distressed, reassure the parent that this is normal and that the child will settle and that time will be spent with them until they do settle. Explain any measures that the nursery employs to put the child at ease since this might also reassure the adult.</li>
                            <li>Confirm the arrangements for collecting the child and who will be collecting the child. If the adult who is collecting the child is not the parent, ensure that the procedure for this has been adhered to. For example this might include producing identification and confirming that the person has parental responsibility.</li>
                            <li>Ensure that the procedure for leaving children at the nursery has been adhered to.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Reflection on practice</h4>
                        <p>When meeting people of different ages, it is useful to reflect on your ability to adjust your communication appropriately and to assess the effectiveness of your communication style.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>How would you summarize your interaction with adults?</li>
                            <li>How would you summarize your interaction with children?</li>
                            <li>How would you reduce any anxieties that an adult might have about leaving a child?</li>
                            <li>Similarly, how would you calm a child who is being left behind?</li>
                            <li>If there are questions to which you do not know the answers, how will you get this information for future reference?</li>
                            <li>How would you assess the relationship between an adult and a child? You might find it useful to discuss your thoughts with a qualified member of staff, to help you understand some of the principles of child development and child behaviour.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Orientating yourself to a new placement</h3>
                        <p>In Chapter 2, you reflected on your expectations of a new placement as part of your preparation. Now think about how you would orient yourself as you start a new module and a new placement.</p>
                        <p>This scenario provides an opportunity to explore:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The importance of preparation for new clinical placements</li>
                            <li>How to create a good first impression</li>
                            <li>How to generate motivation for new clinical experiences.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Specific principles</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>An essential part of healthcare education and training is gaining experience in different clinical/practice placements. You might or might not be looking forward to working in some of the areas that your course has to offer; however, if you lack motivation while on a particular placement you might miss valuable learning opportunities. If you are finding it hard to be interested in the area you have been allocated to, aim to discuss this with a member of your support team, e.g. your mentor, link lecturer and/or personal tutor.</li>
                            <li>A competent practitioner is one who works effectively as part of a team. Since the people that make up a team have a variety of personalities, it is the duty of each member to consider how they can best contribute to the effectiveness of the team (see Ch. 9).</li>
                            <li>The ability to make and maintain relationships with other healthcare professionals is an essential skill. However, the breadth and depth of communication will vary according to the level of experience and familiarity with the individual and the environment.</li>
                            <li>When meeting members of the team for the first time, it is important to introduce yourself and enquire about the identity of the others.</li>
                            <li>Arriving on time is a crucial part of professional behaviour; therefore always allow plenty of time to travel to your placement.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Preparation of self</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Ensure that you have the correct start date, name and location of the placement area and the name of the person in charge.</li>
                            <li>Contact the placement to establish your shift times and any other relevant geographic information.</li>
                            <li>Familiarize yourself with the themes and foci of the module that accompanies this placement, as well as any assessments that need to be completed during this time.</li>
                            <li>Acquaint yourself with the types of conditions/illnesses for which the patients/clients in that area are being seen/treated, and begin to consider any personal learning outcomes.</li>
                            <li>Consider contacting your personal tutor or the link lecturer to help you prepare for the placement.</li>
                            <li>Consult your reflective journal and comments from previous placements and devise a plan for addressing those areas that were identified and need to be addressed.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Environment</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The level of your previous clinical experience will determine the degree of familiarity you have with a ward or other placement environment.</li>
                            <li>It is important to ascertain the exact location of those features common to most clinical environments, e.g. the treatment room, the sluice room and emergency equipment. There might also be equipment that is specific to the speciality with which you will need to become familiar.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Putting it into practice</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>If you have not been able to visit the area before the start of your placement, arrive a few minutes early so that you can ascertain where to put your belongings and where the handover takes place.</li>
                            <li>Introduce yourself and correct any errors in the pronunciation of your name.</li>
                            <li>Limit your greeting of patients to non-verbal acknowledgements until you know more about them, unless there are obvious signs of distress, risk or emergency.</li>
                            <li>Depending on the procedure in the clinical area, you might be introduced to other members of the team and patients/clients before, during or after the handover.</li>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Admitting a patient</h3>
                        <p>A new patient has arrived on the ward and you have just greeted them and asked them to wait in the lounge area. The patient is from an ethnic background that is different from your own.</p>
                        <p>This scenario highlights a number of skills that can be used to facilitate an effective admission procedure. Admission to hospital causes patients varying degrees of anxiety. The practitioner who is admitting and orienting the patient has only one chance to make a good first impression. This process might present an additional challenge for both parties if they have different cultural norms.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Specific principles</h4>
                        <p>In order to facilitate the development of an effective therapeutic relationship with individuals who are from an ethnic group that is different from your own, it is beneficial to become familiar with their preferred style of communicating. People from high-contact cultures, e.g. Southern Europeans and African-Caribbeans, might appreciate a handshake as a greeting more than those from low-contact cultures such as Chinese and East-Asian cultures (see Ch. 1). In recognition that there are a number of different cultural groups in a community, it is essential that attempts are made to ensure that the caring environment is equitable for all patients/clients with regard to actions taken to promote effective communication. An example of this would be the availability of cue cards reflecting the languages spoken by the patients who represent the community (see Ch. 7). While the practitioner might engage in information-gathering to increase effectiveness in communicating across cultures, it is important to remember that not all people coming from a specific culture observe the rites, rituals and customs that are identified as coming from that culture.</p>
                        <p>Most people admitted to a care environment are likely to experience a degree of anxiety. This is likely to be higher if they have been admitted as an emergency, since they have not had sufficient time to prepare themselves and mobilize their defences. The process of orienting a patient to the ward needs to take the mode of admission and the patient's condition into account. For example, is this an emergency admission or an elective one? Maslow's hierarchy of needs (Maslow 1954) provides a useful framework when considering the needs of the patient. For example, if the patient has a physiological need (they are hungry, need to go to the toilet or they are breathless), attention will need to be paid to this before continuing to discuss ward layout and procedures, thus meeting their safety and security needs. Maslow's (1954) hierarchy suggests that basic physical needs have to be satisfied before moving to higher-order needs.</p>
                        <p>The initial greeting can yield much information regarding the patient's level of understanding, degree of anxiety and their support systems. For example, is the patient accompanied by anyone? Is their body language congruent with their responses, e.g. do they say they are fine but appear tense and worried?</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>What information do you have about the patient?</li>
                            <li>What is the first language of the patient/client? What dialect do they speak? You might need to arrange for an interpreter or have cue cards available that reflect the patient's language (see Ch. 7).</li>
                            <li>What is the patient's name, age and reason for admission?</li>
                            <li>Is the patient's bed area appropriately prepared? For example, is the area clean and is the bed ready if the patient wishes or needs to lie down? Is there water, if appropriate? Does any equipment need to be available for the patient?</li>
                            <li>Will you be the person admitting the patient? If so, ensure that you have the necessary documentation with you.</li>
                            <li>If you will not be the person carrying out the admission procedure, you will need to explain this to the patient. This would be an ideal learning opportunity for you to observe your mentor/assessor or to be observed by your mentor/assessor while carrying out this procedure.</li>

                            <li>There also needs to be an awareness of how these features of a ward might affect someone who is not as familiar with them as you are.</li>
                            <li>The ward environment needs to provide a secure (both physically and psychologically) space where patients can trust that they will be cared for.</li>
                            <li>Each member of the team, whether based on the ward or not, e.g. a physiotherapist, contributes to the ward environment.</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Introduce yourself and clarify with the patient how they would like to be addressed.</li>
                            <li>The order in which you orient the patient will need to take into account the condition of the patient. The process might need to be conducted over the course of the day.</li>
                            <li>Since orientation to the ward is part of the admissions procedure, ideally the practitioner who does this should be the one who conducts the initial patient assessment as well as completing relevant documentation.</li>
                            <li>This would provide both you and the patient/client with a degree of continuity. It might be more practicable, however, if the process of orientation and admission is shared between you and your mentor/assessor.</li>
                            <li>As locations are pointed out to the patient and routines explained, note how the patient is responding to the information, both verbally and non-verbally. Use these moments to offer clarification and reassurance.</li>
                            <li>When asking questions, ensure that you do not use multiple questions since this can lead to confusion, as you will not be sure which question the individual is answering (see Ch. 5).</li>
                            <li>The development of a therapeutic relationship will be dependent on the patient's/client's experience of feeling cared for. As a practitioner you can enhance the quality of the relationship by demonstrating empathic understanding and acceptance. For example, you might say: 'The bed probably isn't what you're used to, but we'll try and make you as comfortable as possible.'</li>
                            <li>The aim of demonstrating the core conditions of empathic understanding, genuineness and acceptance is to help reduce the patient's/client's experience of any physical and/or psychological pain they might be experiencing. This can be achieved by remaining calm, demonstrating the ability to act appropriately and engaging in effective problem-solving. For example, by suggesting a change in position to relieve any pain the patient/client might have.</li>
                            <li>If the patient is anxious or in pain, touch might be a useful intervention. In this case it might also be appropriate to use more closed rather than open questions, e.g. 'Would it help if I sat with you for a short while?' or 'Is that better?'</li>
                            <li>If relatives are present and they have been instrumental in assisting you with communicating with the patient/client, consider asking them to write down common phrases that can aid communication when an interpreter or relative is not available.</li>
                            <li>It would also be valuable if any specific preferences/practices that the client/ patient might have/needs to observe are explored. For example, these might relate to diet, hygiene needs or worship. However, when involving relatives in interpreting, the patient's confidentiality needs to be considered and protected.</li>
                            <li>It is not uncommon that people who do not have English as a first language might be able to speak some English but feel less comfortable communicating in English. The practitioner could facilitate the client's confidence by encouraging them and giving them feedback.</li>
                            <li>If communicating via an interpreter or translator, it is important to maintain eye contact with the patient/client while speaking with the interpreter or translator. This might feel awkward but it will ensure you remain in connection with the patient (see Ch. 7).</li>
                            <li>It is important to establish who should be contacted if there is a change in the patient's/client's condition.</li>

                            <li>Having admitted a patient/client, it is important to reflect on this process, not only because something might have been forgotten, but also to evaluate your effectiveness during this first meeting.</li>
                            <li>What have you learnt from your initial meeting with this patient/client and, if accompanied, from their relative/s?</li>
                            <li>What is the patient's/client's level of understanding of their environment and the reason for their admission?</li>
                            <li>Were there any communication difficulties? If so, how do you think these can be addressed during the patient's/client's stay?</li>
                            <li>How would you sum up the relationship between the patient/client and their relative? This information might give you some insight into the patient's/client's close relationships, their support system and their degree of dependence or independence, both physical and psychological.</li>
                            <li>Did the patient/client and/or relative express any concerns that you were not able to address? If so, what were they and what do you need to do about this?</li>
                            <li>How would you rate the relationship between you and the patient/client and vice versa?</li>
                            <li>Has all the necessary information been documented?</li>
                            <li>Looking back at your first meeting with a patient/client, was there anything that you could have done or said differently?</li>
                            <li>Which elements of undertaking a cultural assessment do you need to familiarize yourself with?</li>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Use of terminology in obstetric emergencies</h3>
                        <p>You are caring for a woman called Patricia, while she is in labour. When you examine her you find she has a prolapsed cord. You know that this means her baby is at extreme risk and could die unless you intervene immediately. You also know that you need to ask her to adopt what is often described as asking the woman to 'get on all fours with her bottom in the air' position, in order to take the pressure off her baby's umbilical cord. You explain the findings of your examination and give her instructions about the position she needs to adopt to take the pressure off the umbilical cord.</p>
                        <p>Some issues raised by this scenario:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>This situation is an obstetric emergency. It is in these circumstances that communication is most likely to be delivered in short specific directives to the woman.</li>
                            <li>While this is a very important instruction, the midwife needs to be very sensitive as to how it might be received and perceived.</li>
                            <li>The woman is likely to be very anxious because of the risk to her baby and herself. She might be aware also of a sense of increased powerlessness and vulnerability, which might be reminiscent of past experiences of abuse or indeed of the circumstances of her baby's conception.</li>
                            <li>The instruction to 'get on all fours' could well remind her emotionally and/or cognitively of previous occasions when she was in a humiliating and/or non-consensual sexual situation and one where she thought her life might be at risk, i.e. situations which might be reminiscent of past sexual abuse.</li>
                            <li>If she reacts in what might be considered as an 'unco-operative manner', i.e. freezes or refuses to adopt the position, it might indicate distress. Her response might not be related to the here-and-now but is an unconscious defence for self protection as a result of the negative transference with the midwife who could be perceived in the same light as the past abuser. The gender of the midwife might well affect the response. For further discussion on the impact of the transference on the therapeutic relationship, see Chapter 1.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Environment</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>There is likely to be an increase in the number of people and the amount of equipment in the room. Any newcomers should introduce themselves or be announced by the midwife and their presence explained.</li>
                            <li>Noise can be very anxiety provoking. It is important to keep this to a minimum to ensure the environment conveys a sense of respect for the woman and what is happening to her and her baby.</li>
                            <li>The temperature of the room needs to be appropriate and comfortable for the woman and suitable for her baby.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Preparation of self</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Although this type of situation cannot be anticipated in relation to a specific woman's labour, it is important for the midwife to reflect upon how they might feel, what they should do and how they intend to respond when faced with this type of obstetric emergency. Anticipatory reflection (Sully et al 2008) enables practitioners to plan ahead for foreseen and unforeseen events.</li>
                            <li>Acknowledgement of one's feelings such as fear, excitement, anticipation allows for the development of effective coping strategies that will not interfere with offering optimum care in emergencies.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Putting it into practice</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>It is important to establish eye contact with the woman when you give her the instruction to change her position.</li>
                            <li>Language that you could use instead of the term, 'Please get on all fours' could be 'Please kneel and then lean forward on to your forearms so your shoulders are lower than your hips.'</li>
                            <li>It might be appropriate to follow-up this instruction with a cue card or drawing of the position the woman needs to adopt (see Appendix 3).</li>
                            <li>It is important to respond sensitively to any manifestations of distress or confusion throughout this process. Using a well-modulated and gentle voice, alongside a calm and efficient approach can induce confidence in the woman.</li>
                            <li>Wherever possible, it is important to offer the woman choices when the situation is being managed, e.g. 'Would you like a blanket to keep you warm?'</li>
                            <li>It is essential for the midwife to observe the woman's non-verbal behaviour in relation to where other people are positioned in the room. Where people are not involved in her actual physical care, it is important to ensure that they position themselves where the woman feels at ease.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Following an emergency it is likely that you will feel a mixture of emotions about how you delivered care, the outcome of the situation and the effects it has had on you and your colleagues. Think about a situation when you were involved in delivering care during an emergency. How did you feel when you became aware that the situation was life-threatening? How did this influence the ways in which you reacted?</li>
                            <li>How did you maintain the client's dignity and demonstrate respect for them?</li>
                            <li>What helped and/or hindered your ability to maintain the client's dignity?</li>
                            <li>It is likely that you had learnt about emergency care prior to actually dealing with the situation. Were there any emotional and/or practice aspects that you had not anticipated?</li>
                            <li>What have you learnt about yourself and your ability to manage yourself in emergencies? How will this awareness influence your future practice?</li>

                            <li>The older patient might have some communication difficulties, which may range from a hearing or sight impairment, to aphasia or dysarthria. The latter might have resulted from a stroke or other neurological disorder.</li>
                            <li>In the dementias, memory impairment and preservation (the repetition of previous information that is not relevant to the current context), is a common feature, therefore it is important to be patient and clear in your communication and to facilitate the patient to engage in conversation (Bayles & Tomoeda 2007).</li>
                            <li>Ensure that any aids the patient might need to facilitate effective communication are available, e.g. dentures that fit correctly, a hearing aid with a functioning battery.</li>
                            <li>Older people might have difficulty with long sentences; therefore consider how you structure your sentence to ensure the main points are identified in a concise manner. It might be necessary to repeat the focus of the conversation.</li>
                            <li>Communication will be more effective if you use normal intonation, appropriate timing and emphasis on relevant words. With regards to pace, it might be appropriate to speak at a slightly slower pace with pauses which would enable the listener to process the information. However, if the pace is too slow, the patient might find it difficult to remember the earlier part of the conversation.</li>
                            <li>While a slower pace might be used, it is important not to sound patronising and to ensure that a childlike tone or language is avoided.</li>
                            <li>During the course of the day (e.g. following a wandering incident), it might be necessary to re-orientate the patient about where they are and why they are there.</li>
                            <li>While carrying out care it might also be appropriate to involve any mementoes Mrs James might have brought from home. In your conversations with her, you can use these mementoes as a means of helping her to remember her past in a positive way.</li>
                            <li>Since it might be difficult for a person with a dementia to generate possible responses to open questions, it is more effective to use open focused questions which will encourage choices to be made (see Chapter 5). For example: 'What would you like to wear today?' would be better as: 'Which dress would you like to wear today, the pink one or the yellow one?'</li>
                            <li>Effective communication also needs to take place in a context: so in the above conversation if the nurse is helping the patient with hygiene needs and has both dresses in her hands, this helps the patient to grasp the information.</li>
                            <li>Care needs to be taken, however, to ensure that the patient is not required to concentrate on more than one thing at a time, e.g. asking them about their choice of clothes, while also asking them to carry out an activity.</li>
                            <li>If it appears that the person has not understood what has been said, this will need to be restated in a different way.</li>
                            <li>If the person has difficulty remembering events (episodic memory), it can be helpful to use proper nouns rather than pronouns. For example, rather than: 'Robert and Mary went to see Fred yesterday and the district nurse was there. They wanted to make sure everything was alright and she said he was fine.'<br><br>The following would be easier for the person to understand: 'Robert and Mary went to see Fred yesterday and the district nurse was there. Robert and Mary wanted to make sure everything was alright and the nurse said Fred was fine.'</li>
                            <li>As with all effective exploratory communication, engaging the five senses is very useful, e.g. 'Does this feel soft?', 'Is the radio too loud for you?', 'Does this smell like tea or coffee?'</li>
                            <li>It might also be difficult for the patient if a number of people are speaking at once, e.g. during an interdisciplinary team meeting.</li>
                            <li>While use of humour can be appropriate, the person with a dementia might not be able to interpret the meaning and therefore there might be a risk of being disrespectful towards the individual.</li>
                            <li>It is important to check the side-effects of any medication that Mrs James might be taking, since these might contribute to her feelings and behaviour.</li>

                            <li>The level of lighting needs to be reduced when helping the patient settle for bed.</li>

                            <li>Approach Mrs James in a calm, unhurried manner and consider your body language, since you do not want to startle her.</li>
                            <li>Remind Mrs James of your name and your role.</li>
                            <li>It might be appropriate to touch her arm and then ask her if you can take her hand, you might also indicate that this is what you want to do.</li>
                            <li>Link the information that is being communicated with information that is already known, this will involve some degree of repetition, e.g. 'Mrs James remember you are in hospital? Are you looking for your bed or do you need to go to the toilet?'</li>
                            <li>If you do not understand her response, you can use closed questions and/or gestures to try and capture/guess what she is trying to say.</li>
                            <li>It would also be appropriate to acknowledge her feelings and validate them, e.g. 'I can see you're very upset, are you in pain?' or 'Were you looking for the way to your home?'</li>
                            <li>In order to help Mrs James re-orientate to the time and location, you might give her some information. This should be in manageable chunks and you will need to check her understanding. For example: 'You're on the ward and it's night time. I can help you get ready for bed. Your bed is over there, shall we go now?'</li>
                            <li>At an appropriate point, it would be important to check that Mrs James has not sustained any injuries during this episode.</li>

                        <p>The skills of taking our leave are as important as greeting skills in all professional relationships. The non-verbal gestures and terms of address we choose will, of course, be dictated by the nature of the relationships we have with the people involved and each unique circumstance. This might be formal or informal, depending on the nature and significance of the relationship. Achieving closure and ending professional relationships with groups, e.g. at the end of your education programme, is addressed in Chapter 9.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Specific principles</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>When leave-taking, you need to adjust your style of language and non-verbal cues to take into account the age, gender and culture of the people involved, as well as the nature of your relationships with them.</li>
                            <li>Using the core conditions of effective therapeutic relationships addressed in Chapter 1, it is possible to disagree on issues without losing respect for the other people involved. Leave-taking in these circumstances might be difficult if tempers are running high; however it is possible to focus on what has been achieved, such as an agreement to disagree.</li>
                            <li>When taking our leave, it is important to acknowledge something positive that has been gained from the experience of working with the others involved. This is especially important when the relationships have not run smoothly.</li>
                            <li>This skill of focusing on the positive when ending professional relationships, allows for the possibility of those involved to remember the encounter in a positive way. This is especially important when patients and clients have lived through frightening and painful experiences that you have shared with them.</li>
                            <li>Leave-taking can raise paradoxical feelings of loss as well as relief that a difficult time has come to an end, or pleasure at looking forward to a new phase in life such as when a new mother goes home with her partner and their baby.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Saying goodbye</h3>
                        <p>You are due to finish your shift and have been nursing a 45-year-old patient, Mr Alphonso, for the last 2 weeks. He is due for open-heart surgery in the morning. He will be admitted to the Intensive Care Unit when he leaves theatre. You are aware that he is understandably anxious about the operation. You are also unlikely to be nursing him again because when he returns to the ward you will have moved to a new practice placement.</p>
                        <p>Some issues raised by this scenario:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Mr Alphonso is facing major surgery, which everyone hopes will greatly improve his quality of life; however it also carries a significant risk to his health. You know he is anxious about this and the possibility that he could die.</li>
                            <li>The symbolism of your not seeing him again could raise for him associations between parting and death.</li>
                            <li>There is fear of the unknown, e.g. in Mr Alphonso's feelings about being in intensive care and away from being nursed in a familiar environment by a familiar nurse.</li>
                            <li>You need to acknowledge your feelings about saying goodbye to a patient at a time when he is vulnerable and facing a stressful life event.</li>
                            <li>There are parallel processes of your moving on to a new and stressful but probably positive experience as you progress through your programme, and Mr Alphonso facing a new and stressful experience.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Preparation of self</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Think about your feelings in relation to this situation. You might well have been in similar situations before with patients and clients.</li>
                            <li>How do you feel about saying goodbye to Mr Alphonso, especially bearing in mind that you have supported him in preparation for this surgery?</li>
                            <li>What do you think you offered him that he seems to have especially valued when having been nursed by you?</li>
                            <li>What have you gained from nursing him? Perhaps you have enjoyed his sense of humour or he has told you interesting things about his family, background and culture.</li>
                            <li>What do you think he is likely to miss about being away from the ward? How will this knowledge influence what you will say to him when you take your leave?</li>
                            <li>What physical gestures will you consider using, e.g. shaking hands, sitting beside his bed?</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Environment</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Consider the best place and time in which to take your leave of Mr Alphonso.</li>
                            <li>Where are you going to say goodbye? Will you talk to him by his bed or take him into an interview room if the ward has one?</li>
                            <li>Who can overhear you? Does it matter if the conversation is not private? These considerations will be affected by the strength of the bond you have with Mr Alphonso and how much he has shared his experiences with you.</li>
                            <li>It is best practice to ensure as much privacy as possible.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Putting the skills into practice</h4>
                        <p>Once you have decided when and where you are going to take your leave, you need to decide on how to perform the skill.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Make time for the ending.</li>
                            <li>Decide what you are going to say and how you are going to say it.</li>
                            <li>What physical gestures will you feel comfortable using? Decide whether you will sit down or stand.</li>
                            <li>Be empathetic to how Mr Alphonso might be feeling about his situation and about saying goodbye to you. Warmth and politeness when saying goodbye help to avoid the implication of rejection.</li>
                            <li>Say goodbye, using clear language that means the encounter is ending. Avoid euphemisms such as 'see you later' when this is unlikely to happen.</li>
                            <li>Sometimes patients and clients keep in touch with the ward by letter or telephone (this might be necessary for follow-up treatment or support). However, it is important to avoid encouraging inappropriate dependence.</li>
                            <li>If the patient is being referred elsewhere, clarify the arrangements with him before you say goodbye.</li>
                            <li>Include any family or friends of the patient who are present, especially if you have had significant dealings with them.</li>
                            <li>Acknowledge the significance of the relationship to you, by valuing expressed feelings and stating your own, e.g. 'It has been a privilege to ...'</li>
                            <li>Give space by leaving time and remaining quiet for Mr Alphonso to give you feedback on his experiences of being cared for by you.</li>
                            <li>When actually parting, be culturally sensitive in what physical gestures you use, e.g. bowing or waving.</li>
                            <li>Where possible, if others are leaving, escort them to the door and open it. If you are leaving someone's home, it is important to allow them to open their own door and see you out.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Reflection on practice</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>How successful were you in your preparation for taking your leave?</li>
                            <li>What aspects of the environment where you took your leave were appropriate? Where the environment was not ideal, what did you do to ensure that it was possible for your leave-taking to be the focus of the interaction between you and Mr Alphonso and be managed respectfully?</li>
                            <li>How did you feel before, during and after saying goodbye to Mr Alphonso? What do you think the reasons were for this?</li>
                            <li>How do you think these feelings might have influenced your non-verbal cues, the language you used and how he experienced the process?</li>
                            <li>In what ways did cultural awareness influence what you said and did? For example, did you shake his hand?</li>
                            <li>What have you learned from this experience? How will you develop your practice as a consequence of this reflection?</li>

                        <p>For the last 4 weeks you have worked in the community with the district nurses or midwives.

                            <li>Make time for the ending.</li>
                            <li>Decide what you are going to say and how you are going to say it.</li>
                            <li>Decide on your non-verbal gestures.</li>
                            <li>Be empathetic to how the other people involved might be feeling about their situations and about saying goodbye to you. Warmth and politeness when saying goodbye help to avoid the implication of rejection.</li>
                            <li>Say goodbye, using clear language that means the encounter is ending. Avoid euphemisms such as 'see you later' when this is unlikely to happen.</li>
                            <li>Acknowledge the significance of the relationships to you, by valuing expressed feelings and stating your own, e.g. 'I have really enjoyed working with all of you in the community. I have learnt how exciting it is to work with a committed and integrated team. I'll miss you all.'</li>
                            <li>Give space for the team members to give you feedback about their experiences of working with you as a student.</li>
                            <li>When actually parting, be culturally sensitive in what physical gestures you use with each team member, for example, by shaking hands or waving.</li>
                            <li>If others are leaving you and it is your space, escort them to the door and open it. If you are leaving your colleagues' office, it is important to allow them to open the door and see you out, whenever possible. Who sees who to the door is an unspoken norm in different situations. It is important to be aware of the customs in each of your placements.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Reflection on practice</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>How successful were you in your preparation for taking your leave?</li>
                            <li>What aspects of the environment where you took your leave were appropriate?</li>
                            <li>Where the environment was not ideal, what did you do to ensure that it was possible for your leave-taking to be the focus of the interaction and managed respectfully?</li>
                            <li>How did you feel before, during and after the parting?</li>
                            <li>How do you think these feelings might have influenced your non-verbal cues, your tone of voice and the language you used?</li>
                            <li>How do you think your colleagues experienced the process? What happened for you to come to these conclusions?</li>
                            <li>In what ways did cultural awareness influence what you said and did?</li>
                            <li>How will you develop your practice as a consequence of this reflection?</li>
                        </ul>
