                        <p>Communication underpins everything we do in everyday life as well as in professional practice. What we say, how we say it and what we do communicates a multiplicity of messages. These messages are given and received both consciously and unconsciously.</p>
                        <p>This book explores how we communicate every day in nursing and midwifery practice. It focuses on the communication skills needed for the development of effective and professional therapeutic relationships. The aim is to enable practitioners to reflect on the effectiveness of their communication skills in practice and to build on their existing skills. This reflection is encouraged, acknowledging that practitioners have differing levels of ability and recognising that these abilities vary according to the situation and the demands made on those involved.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">What is it?</h3>
                        <p>Theories offer foundations for exploring the nature of the therapeutic relationship and applying their principles to nursing and midwifery practice. The three theories chosen for this text, humanistic, psychodynamic and systems, acknowledge the importance of both the conscious and unconscious processes that affect our lives and our communication. While we are clear that this is not a book outlining the principles of counselling, we draw on that literature, as well as that of nursing, midwifery, psychology and other relevant sources, to demonstrate the application of effective communication skills to nursing and midwifery practice. These theories of personality and their theoretical principles offer frameworks for explaining and analysing human interactions.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">How do I use it?</h3>
                        <p>Each chapter begins with an Introduction and goes on to outline principles underpinning the practice of the skills to be explored. An explanation of the skills is given, followed by a scenario from practice. Specific principles are identified (where appropriate) relating to each scenario as well as the considerations that need to be given to the environment. In this second edition, as well as exploring the specific and sensitive nature of communication in midwifery practice, we have also considered the person with dementia and the specific communication skills that are necessary.</p>
                        <p>Reflection is integral to the entire text. Readers are invited to consider personal preparation prior to putting a skill into practice. Then, having practised the skill, readers are offered opportunities to reflect on practice. At the end of each scenario, there are reflection-on-practice questions. These are designed to enable readers to analyse their experiences and apply what they have learned to their future practice. If readers have not had a similar experience in practice, they are invited to try and imagine how they would respond if they had.</p>
                        <p>Each chapter concludes with specific references relevant to the content and in some there are suggestions for further reading. At the end of the book there is a Bibliography to support the theoretical underpinning of the text.</p>
                        <p>There is a short glossary of specialist terms and an appendix outlining unconscious defences. Other appendices cover obstetric terminology in an emergency and strategies for communication partners of people with aphasia.</p>
                        <p>We hope that you will find this book interesting, enjoyable and a valuable resource to support and enhance your communications skills and therapeutic relationships.</p>

                        <p>All of us practise skills in communication. Communication skills are transferable across different walks of life and different practice circumstances. Communication is a complex process. It involves a number of interacting factors: (1) physical, e.g. someone with dementia; (2) psychological, e.g. an anxious student and (3) social, e.g. a new mother in her home. How we as practitioners respond in each unique situation requires skilled thought. Effective communication, therefore, requires self-awareness, attention to the unique nature of this episode and a willingness to respond sensitively and flexibly by the use of verbal and non-verbal skills. These skills need to be embodied within the person of the practitioner in order for them to respond compassionately and flexibly regardless of the circumstances with which they are faced. Thus, a nurse or midwife does not have to be a specialist in Accident & Emergency (A&E) nursing or neonatal care to demonstrate sensitive communication skills, e.g. how to support a distressed relative.</p>
                        
                        <p>One model that might be used to understand the process of developing effective communication skills is that developed by Howell (1982), identified in Box 1.1. This model demonstrates how our awareness of our ability changes as we learn new skills and recognize how able, or not, we are to apply them in practice.</p>

                            <h4 class="callout-title"><span class="callout-icon"> </span>Box 1.1 Conscious and unconscious incompetence (Howell 1982)</h4>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Unconscious incompetence</li>
                                <li>Conscious incompetence</li>
                                <li>Conscious competence</li>
                                <li>Unconscious competence.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </aside>

                        <p>For example, the practitioner might not realize how distressing the resuscitation room in A&E might be for the relative and therefore will not offer appropriately sensitive support (unconscious incompetence). On the other hand, nurses or midwives may be aware that the resuscitation room is a distressing place for the relative but may not know how to offer adequate support (conscious incompetence).</p>
                        <p>In such situations, consciously competent practitioners would be aware of the distressing nature of the environment as well as the needs of the relative. They would therefore consider consciously the best ways to support the relative and choose appropriate interventions. However, unconsciously competent practitioners are able to select from a number of observations based on a broad range of experience, about the needs of the relative in this situation. The decision on how to intervene to support the relative is made very quickly: the decision-making process is fast and not necessarily the result of overt conscious deliberation. Although it seems ideal for a skilled practitioner to be able to respond in an unconsciously competent way, there are however, practice implications for effective communication. They might be so familiar with their ability that they no longer reflect on their behaviour because it is automatic. This can have a significant and unhelpful interpersonal impact on others, such as failing to explain to the person in their care their intended action or intervention.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">CULTURE AND COMMUNICATION</h3>
                        <p>It can be useful to think of culture as being concerned with individuals, groups, organizations, and professions - each have their own assumptions, values and beliefs - and a willingness to be open to those that vary is conducive to promoting cooperative relationships. The relationship may be easier to establish and maintain where there are shared assumptions and beliefs that are linked with shared values. These values in turn produce shared norms that govern patterns of behaviour; according to Egan (2007: 52), 'patterns of behaviour constitute . . . the bottom line of personal or individual culture'.</p>
                        <p>'Culture provides each person with specific rules dealing with the universal events of life - birth, mating, childrearing, illness, pain and death' (Munoz & Luckmann 2005: 22). Culture '... is the lens through which we view the world' (Witte & Morrison 1995: 217). A significant task for practitioners therefore is to consider the communication styles and preferences of the people with whom they come into contact, and who may be from a culture that is different from their own. This informed knowledge, however, should not be used to assume that all people from a specific culture would behave in a specific way or require specific considerations; rather it provides the nurse and midwife with options.</p>
                        <p>Since social rules operate below the level of consciousness, there is also a need for practitioners to increase their awareness with regard to their own behaviour and the cultural factors that influence it. This process can reveal any irrational beliefs, generalizations and stereotypes that they might hold. Practitioners can then reflect on their assumptions and set them aside so they do not interfere with their communication skills. This process of reflection and learning ultimately can lead to increased confidence in communicating effectively.</p>
                        <p>Throughout this book, the assumption is that readers will come from a wide variety of cultural and ethnic backgrounds. Where appropriate a specific discipline, e.g. nursing or midwifery is identified in the text; where the issue relates to both disciplines, the term 'practitioner' is used.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Individualism and collectivism</h4>
                        <p>Hofstede (1991) used the terms 'individualism' and 'collectivism' to describe the cultural preferences held in relation to the degree to which people considered their needs over those of the group(s) to which they belong. While there will always be variations within any cultural group, western cultures are identified as individualist, where all but the immediate family are placed on the periphery and the individual occupies the central position. A high level of importance is also placed on autonomy, independence and self-assertion (Table 1.1).</p>

                        </div>
                        <p>In comparison, collectivist cultures are those where family and group membership is central and the individual's life is regulated according to these systems. These cultures operate within an interdependent structure and have a greater desire for the collective rather than focusing on individual achievement (Brown et al 1992). It is important to note that, while a country may be identified as individualist, other cultures within that country may have collectivist trends, for example African-Caribbean, Spanish, or those from the Asian sub-continent in the UK may operate according to their respective ancestries.</p>
