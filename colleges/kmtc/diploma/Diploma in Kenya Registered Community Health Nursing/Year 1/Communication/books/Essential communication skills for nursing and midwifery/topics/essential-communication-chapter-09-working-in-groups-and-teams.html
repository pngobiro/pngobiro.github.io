                        </h2>
                        <p>One of the key elements of healthcare practice is the ability to work in a team. 'A team is a small number of people with complementary skills who are committed to a common purpose, performance goals, and approach for which they hold themselves mutually accountable' (Katzenbach and Smith 1993). Larson & LaFasto (1989: 19) define a team as having 'two or more people; it has a specific performance objective or recognizable goal to be attained, and co-ordination of activity among members of the team is required for the attainment of the team goal or objective'. Comparative analysis undertaken by Larson & LaFasto (1989) revealed eight characteristics of effectively functioning teams. These are summarized in Box 9.1.</p>
                        <p>Referring specifically to healthcare teams, Prosser (2005) considers that effective teams have:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>a clear sense of purpose and direction</li>
                            <li>openness as a key characteristic</li>
                            <li>a balanced membership</li>
                            <li>performance as their main focus of attention</li>
                            <li>an effective leader who adopts an appropriate leadership style.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The foundations and principles that can facilitate a team working effectively as shown in Box 9.1 are the same as working within a group, therefore in this chapter the terms 'team' and 'group' will be used interchangeably. One of the challenges that you face as a student, is the movement from one practice placement to another throughout your course. This frequent movement requires the student to become skilled in initiating, maintaining and ending relationships with members of a team that is already established. In addition, the practice placements might involve different geographical locations, which might add to the unfamiliarity and stress experienced by you, as a result of the time needed to adjust.</p>
                        <p>The ward culture, staffing levels and frequent change of students allocated to the placement will all contribute to the reception the student receives and might have an effect on their ability to feel and become part of the team. For example, some team members might feel that it is not worth investing time in teaching students who are 'passing through', particularly if the placements are very busy. It is also possible that the frequent change in students allocated to the area is experienced as stressful. The conscious and unconscious perceptions and experiences of both the student and the other members of the team are a major contributing factor in influencing how each gets on with the other. For example, current students might be compared with the previous group of students, without specific experience of how this group behaved.</p>

                        <p>'The ability to work effectively with a group of other people, either as a leader or member, is an important interpersonal skill' (Hayes 2002: 60). Effective communication increases our ability to provide good-quality care, and enhances our learning potential. Communication in healthcare takes place within the context of an organizational structure that might contain power or hierarchical elements that determine how communication is carried out. Bradley & Edinberg (1982) provide a good discussion of the different communication patterns that exist within healthcare teams.</p>

                        <p>Where a hierarchy exists, a coalition is essential in order to enhance the quality of communication. When we join a group, there is a need to feel accepted, to feel able to communicate openly and honestly, to express our needs and to receive empathetic understanding about what these needs are. Where these elements form the foundation of the relationship, we are more likely to achieve our potential (Rogers 1961). Through collegiate relationships, members of a group can give each other feedback about how others see us.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Factors contributing to group process and roles</h3>
                        <p>A review of the literature reveals that the evolution of a group is similar to life development: it begins with a high degree of infantile dependence, moves to a stage of rebellion, which involves achieving a sense of identity in the group, and then works to attain greater stability and adult functioning. In other words, groups follow a recognized process of development, which begins with an increased dependence on the person identified as the leader and moves to a position of being able to work autonomously as well as in collaboration with others.</p>
                        <p>A number of authors (Baron & Kerr 2003, Belbin 2003, Sundeen et al 1998, Clarkson 1993, Yalom 1970, Berne 1966, Tuckman 1965, Bion 1961) have written extensively about these processes, as well as the various roles that individuals adopt when in a group, some of which enhance the effectiveness of the group. It is important to remember when considering stage theories (such as Tuckman's) that a number of factors influence the process, e.g. a group might regress to an earlier stage when a new member joins or someone leaves. A group might also become fixed at a particular stage and might need assistance to move on. For example, if a group is stuck at the storming stage, it is difficult for the task to be addressed, as the atmosphere might not facilitate effective communication. One aspect of an effective healthy group, is that they are able to discuss those aspects that are causing concern as well as the 'nice things'. The roles that contribute to the dynamics of the group can be divided into task and maintenance activities. Task roles include titles such as initiator, consensus taker and summarizer. Maintenance roles include encourager, compromiser and harmonizer.</p>
                        <p>In a group there will be times when self-protective behaviours are used. For example, one person might be so quiet in the group that they are 'invisible' or in contrast another might be the 'intellectualizer' and tend to overcomplicate the situation and use unnecessarily complex terms. Both of these actions might act as a block to interacting with others in order to control anxiety and maintain self-esteem. Berne (1966) uses the term IMAGO (see below) to outline the perceptions we might have before meeting the group and the subsequent process of becoming a group member. Napper & Newton's (2000) contribution to this idea is summarized in Box 9.2.</p>
                        
                        <aside class="callout note" role="note">
                            <h4 class="callout-title"><span class="callout-icon"> </span>Box 9.2 Becoming a group member (adapted from Napper & Newton 2000)</h4>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Imagine how the group will be: this will be based on conscious and unconscious past experiences of being in a group and perceptions of the group.</li>
                                <li>Meet the others and begin to differentiate between them, transferring expectations on to them.</li>
                                <li>Angling for one's place in the group might mean accepting a role that is familiar but not necessarily desired.</li>
                                <li>Get On with each other in the present, without the previous expectations that were projected on to group members. At this point there is open communication in the group and a sense of belonging is experienced.</li>
                            </ol>
                        </aside>

                        <p>Group members need to be familiar with the various roles required of an effective group and to become skilled in recognizing the roles that might be missing in a group and modify their behaviour accordingly. For example, group members might be very focused on the task but leave each encounter feeling that their efforts are unappreciated. It might be that no one is occupying the encourager role, which involves (among other things) giving empathetic responses and helping to maintain motivation. It might well be that the placement area has a culture of withholding this type of nurturing from the staff; this might however have a negative effect on the degree of effort that will be put into the group activity. As the group size increases, less effort and investment is put into an activity; Latane et al (1979) call this 'social loafing'.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Working in groups</h3>
                        <p>Increasingly, the nature of healthcare education involves working in groups, in order to explore in greater depth and apply to practice, the theoretical and clinical principles that have been introduced in a lead lecture. This is also taking place with students of other disciplines in healthcare. Introducing project work for groups to undertake has the benefit of enabling you to use the knowledge you already have to explore those gaps in your knowledge. This process can be initiated by the lecturer, e.g. by presenting a patient scenario or an aspect of healthcare, which is then explored by the group with the aim of developing their knowledge and presenting this in a seminar at a later date.</p>
                        <p>Once the group agrees on what is already known and what information needs to be gathered in order to address the task, the group identifies what further information is needed and allocates various aspects to each group member. The learning process usually culminates with each group presenting the findings of their project to the rest of the cohort in whichever format they feel is appropriate and interesting.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Working in a group</h3>
                        <p>You have just begun another module and during the study week preceding your placement your seminar group has been given a project. At the end of the module, in 12 weeks' time, your group will be expected to present the completed project to the other groups in your cohort. As a group, you need to identify the task and agree the strategies for producing the work before you all leave to go on your placements. There is a session in 4 weeks' time when the group will be expected to present the material they have developed so far.</p>
                        <p>The scenario above provides the opportunity for you to consider the factors that enable a group to work together in a productive way. It also invites you to think about your behaviour and contributions in groups.</p>
                        <p>Some issues raised by this scenario:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Role negotiation and decision-making</li>
                            <li>Seeking clarification</li>
                            <li>Summarizing</li>
                            <li>Challenging.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Specific principles</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Since nursing and midwifery are professions that require practitioners to be able to work in a group or team, one of the benefits of project work is that it provides an opportunity for students to develop the skills of working together. In the early stages of group formation, there is increased dependence on the lecturer/facilitator to make decisions and give instructions.</li>
                            <li>As a group progresses, members need to take on the various roles necessary to help the group function in a healthy manner. This will result in less dependence on the lecturer/facilitator for instruction; who can then act as a guide and consultant offering suggestions and/or expert information as appropriate.</li>
                            <li>The role of the lecturer therefore moves to become one of a facilitator, not a director. The group might also request that the facilitator provides feedback to them on how they are working together.</li>
                            <li>The group (including the facilitator) will need to explore and agree how the group is going to be run and what each expects from the other. This might include such issues as attendance at future meetings or how to address non-participation in the activities by some members of the group.</li>
                            <li>If this is the first time the group has met or they have not worked together before in this way, the facilitator is likely to introduce some team-building activities in order to aid this process. This would also be appropriate if there has been a change in the group make-up.</li>
                            <li>One of the skills of working in a group is being able to recognize how the behaviour of the group members (including oneself) affects the group's performance and achievement of the identified goals.</li>
                            <li>Another feature of an effective group is that, once the agreed goal has been achieved, the group is psychologically able to move on to work efficiently on another project. Debriefing and reflection can facilitate this.</li>
                            <li>Equally important is the ability to appreciate the knowledge and skills each person in the group has, and when engaged in group activity, encourage the appropriate use of the skills in a non-manipulative way (see also Ch. 6).</li>
                            <li>Care needs to be taken with regard to decision-making and allocation of tasks in a group. This is because the status or verbosity of an individual might be the criteria that are used for selection, rather than the appropriate matching of their expertise for the task. Task allocation might be an opportunity for another member of the group to develop their skills.</li>
                            <li>A group is likely to work best if they consider the task to be relevant to their personal goals and whether or not the task provides an appropriate level of difficulty.</li>
                            <li>As the group size increases, the investment in the task might diminish, therefore subgroups need to be practical and enable appropriate communication.</li>
                            <li>Where a group is very concerned about maintaining a smooth easy-going atmosphere, particularly in the 'storming' stage of development (Tuckman 1965), this can inhibit creativity and result in the group agreeing on the one or two ideas that have been generated. Larson & LaFasto (1989) call this 'groupthink'. Exploring this process and introducing other possibilities will help the group members move towards a more rewarding and productive experience. It might be useful to refer to Chapter 6 and Figures A1-4 for additional information.</li>

                            <li>Is the environment conducive to the discussion that you need to have in order to ensure you all understand what is expected? Will group members be able to meet while on your various placements? What other suitable locations might there be?</li>
                            <li>Are there appropriate resources available for you to engage in identifying the relevant issues and planning the way forward? For example, would it be useful for you to have a flip chart or whiteboard, pens, contact details, books, articles or a diary to record dates for future meetings?</li>
                        </ul>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Listen to the information that is being given regarding the project and seek clarification about exactly what your group is expected to do.</li>
                            <li>Ensure that you contribute to the discussion about how the group is going to function, particularly if something is suggested and you are unsure or unhappy about what is expected or assumed about your participation.</li>
                            <li>If you decide that you would like to contribute more or less than you usually do in the group, it would be useful to outline this to the other members, so that they can adjust their expectations of you.</li>
                            <li>Once you have decided upon your personal objectives for this module, consider how the project might contribute to this. It would be useful to express your preference and find out who else has similar interests.</li>
                            <li>Aim to be realistic in the amount of work you agree to do. This will involve setting limits to ensure that there is equity in the group. Being clear about what you are willing to do will also lessen the likelihood of sabotaging the success of the group by consciously or unconsciously 'forgetting' to do something (see Ch. 6).</li>
                            <li>Ensure that you summarize any tasks that you have agreed to do.</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>When engaging in group work, what is your level of concentration and participation in the group like? What affects your ability to listen and participate?</li>
                            <li>How would you sum up your relationship with the other members of the group?</li>
                            <li>What type of contributions do you make in this group? For example, are you the one who makes suggestions? Is your primary aim to seek agreement among the group or are you the 'invisible' person?</li>
                            <li>Do you feel able to ask someone else, who appears to have the appropriate knowledge and skills, to undertake a task that is being suggested?</li>
                            <li>When you have been part of a group but you have not contributed to the decisions that have been made, how do you feel about that?</li>
                            <li>When in a group and seeking clarification, do you feel you have a clear understanding about the work that is to be carried out? If not, how can this information be obtained more effectively?</li>
                            <li>When you think back to the first time you were in your seminar group, how did you feel? What did you think of it? How has your opinion altered?</li>
                            <li>As you reflect on the variety of groups that you have belonged to or still belong to (e.g. ward team, student group, church/social groups), how does your participation in each vary? In what way might you need to increase or decrease your involvement in order to achieve your goals in a healthy manner?</li>

                        <p>You are back in your university for a study day and your seminar group is scheduled to have a session in order to give feedback to each other regarding the activities that have been agreed in the first study week. As the session progresses it becomes clear that, while you have made an effort to do some of the work you agreed to do, some of the others have not.</p>
                        <p>Some issues raised by this scenario:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Assessing the team atmosphere</li>

                            <li>Giving and receiving feedback</li>
                            <li>Paraphrasing</li>
                            <li>Using humour.</li>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Specific principles</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>If an individual does not identify with the group (they might feel excluded or have excluded themselves) they are likely to put little effort into the group task. To increase effectiveness this needs to be addressed.</li>
                            <li>If there is a strong group identity, members are more likely to have a greater commitment to the success of the group. This would contribute to the motivating force of healthy competition with any other seminar groups.</li>
                            <li>Some people, for a variety of reasons, find it difficult to contribute in a group. However, the consequence is that they deprive others in the group from being able to learn from them, and might not make themselves available to learn from others.</li>
                            <li>There is always a need in a group for each member to pay attention to their own and others' experiences of being in the group. This will include aspects such as how empathetic members are, how feedback is given and received and how the accomplishments of group members are acknowledged.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Note:</strong> It might be useful to refer to Chapter 6 for more details.</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>In situations where you have realized that some of your colleagues had not done the work they had agreed to, how do you feel?</li>
                            <li>In light of this, what feedback do you want to give the group or the individual about this?</li>
                            <li>Having considered how you have felt or might feel and what you think, how are you going to give this information in a way that maintains respect for yourself and for the other person?</li>
                            <li>Having considered the work that you have done, how are you going to present your contribution in a concise manner?</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Putting the skills into practice</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>In discussing your group, it is useful to use inclusive words such as 'us', 'we' and 'our'. This not only provides a sense of belonging and cohesiveness but might be experienced as non-blaming by the person with whom you are speaking.</li>
                            <li>A greater sense of achievement can be attained if you develop the skill of offering help and asking for it when you need it.</li>
                            <li>It might be appropriate to speak to the person individually or generalize the feedback if it is an issue that is a common feature of the group. For example, although one person might be persistently late, lateness might be a major feature of the group.</li>
                            <li>State the issue that concerns you, identifying the specific behaviour and the effect it has on you as a member of the group by using 'I' statements. Using the formula 'when you do/say... I feel' might be helpful.</li>
                            <li>It might also be appropriate to state how you think the situation might be rectified.</li>
                            <li>Alternatively, it might be appropriate to find out what impact the person thinks their lack of contribution has had on the group.</li>
                            <li>It might be that there are particular circumstances that have affected their ability to make their contribution, which might or might not be divulged. Consider how you are going to empathize with the person or express your irritation if you consider it to be appropriate. For example, someone might say that they were unable to complete the work because their printer broke down and you feel that, although annoying, this was unavoidable.</li>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Endings provide a variety of opportunities to develop our knowledge with regard to our relationships, our knowledge and our skills. There might be an opportunity to negotiate when the ending might occur or this might be predetermined: either way, those with whom you are working will need to be informed and reminded when this will take place. This is particularly important in practice placements for a number of reasons. It is highly likely that you have developed a good relationship with both patients and staff and so leaving unannounced will create varying levels of concern and possible anxiety (see Ch. 3).</p>
                        <p>A student once commented that she ended a placement without telling the patients with whom she had been working for 8 weeks that she was going. She did this because she did not want them to get upset. This is a good example of conscious incompetence (Howell 1982), in that the student had an awareness that leaving would have an effect on the patients, but she chose a strategy that would not relieve any anxieties that they might have about not seeing her; in fact, it might have heightened them. Interestingly, she did not comment on the effect that leaving the ward would have on her, until this was brought into her awareness through discussion.</p>
                        <p>Endings are likely to stimulate a sense of loss and the emergence of defensive feelings and behaviours that reflect those of loss and grief. This might include elements of denial, depression or acceptance. For example, a student might feel anxious and not ready to take on the responsibility of their first post as a registered nurse/midwife. As a consequence of this, they might delay applying for a job and preparation for interview until the very last minute, increasing the likelihood of being unsuccessful. This action could be considered as an unconscious defence leading to a self-fulfilling prophecy of not being good enough.</p>
                        <p>The practice of revisiting previous placements might be a defence against feeling loss and anxiety about moving on to another stage of development (see Appendix 2). Ideally, a state of acceptance of the sadness of leaving, with recognition that not all aspects of the experience might be missed, is desirable. Often there is a combination of excitement and anxiety at moving on to a new situation.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Achieving closure</h3>
                        <p>You are in the last module of your course and have 3 weeks left of your placement. You have successfully completed all your assessments and have had a job interview, which you feel went well. Looking at your timetable, you notice that one of your study days has a reflection session scheduled. This will be your last session with your group.</p>
                        <p>The issues in this scenario provide ideas to help you make sense of and summarize your experiences throughout your course, and identify the transferability of the knowledge and skills that you have accomplished. There is also the opportunity to achieve satisfactory closure and prepare for the next stage of your development.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Specific principles</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Pre-registration nursing and midwifery education generally involves being part of a large cohort of students who receive lead lectures, the principles of which are then explored in greater detail in smaller seminar groups.</li>
                            <li>The smaller groups might each consist of students studying for the same branch of nursing or it might be a mixed group. As well as being an aid to the development of practical skills, smaller groups can assist with the development of a more personal relationship with peers.</li>
                            <li>Throughout training the group membership might change and this will have an effect on the group dynamics. Factors that might affect group members include patterns of poor attendance by some members, and when people leave or join the group.</li>
                            <li>Changes in personal tutor or group/module leader might add to student anxieties since the 'secure base' from which to explore this learning experience has been disturbed (Bowlby 1988).</li>
                            <li>Wherever possible, any changes in the group make-up should be made known without breaking confidentiality or with appropriate self-disclosure. For example, it is sufficient for a group member to say that they will be leaving the group without giving any further details.</li>
                            <li>As an ending approaches, group members might begin to leave before the official leaving time occurs. This action not only discounts the value of the last episodes, as the person rushes to embrace the new experience, but also denies themselves and others the opportunity to give feedback and say goodbye. At an unconscious level, this strategy might serve to prevent the experience of sadness of leaving and/or fear of the future.</li>
                            <li>Whether leaving a placement prior to commencing another or ending your education programme, experiences of regret might be evoked. Regret might be the result of having to leave just as you are beginning to understand the nature of the speciality and have become familiar with the team and the professional skills and activities.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Preparation of self</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>What are you going to say to the patients you have been caring for with regard to the end of your placement?</li>
                            <li>Which members of staff in particular need to be reminded that you will soon be leaving?</li>
                            <li>Is there a session that is designed to help you reflect on your experiences?</li>
                            <li>Are you going to attend the reflection session? If you decide that you are not, what do you imagine you might miss? If you decide to go, what would you like to achieve from the session?</li>
                            <li>How do you feel about the fact that you are approaching the end of the module? It might be useful to make some private time available to explore this.</li>
                            <li>Select a model of reflection that might help you record your experiences and reflections. Rolfe et al (2001) provide a critical selection from which to choose.</li>
                            <li>Alternatively, you might wish to discuss this with a colleague to share thoughts and feelings. A number of authors recognize the positive value of undertaking reflection in a group (e.g. Bolton 2001, Hawkins & Shohet 2006, Sully et al 2008).</li>
                            <li>If there is a staff nurse or midwife on your placement who has recently qualified, you might consider asking them how they felt when they were nearing registration.</li>
                            <li>Consider speaking with your personal tutor, since they will be interested in helping you with this transition and they will also be preparing your reference and completing your personal file.</li>
                            <li>Read what the literature has to say about the transition from student to registered nurse/midwife. This will help 'normalize' any concerns and anxieties that you have.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Make a note of the things that need to be done when you leave the placement/ course, for example completion of documentation. This might include such things as identifying a person to whom you wish to speak, submission dates for final assessments, or the gathering of books that need to be handed back to the library.</li>
                            <li>Consult your journal or reflective notes before the reflection session so that you can make relevant personal contributions. This might add to your understanding of your current level of development.</li>
                            <li>You might prefer to write about your experiences and the important moments in your course in the third person as this might help you to view it more objectively.</li>
                            <li>Make appointments with those to whom you would like to speak for advice or in order to give appropriate feedback.</li>
                            <li>At intervals throughout your final week, inform the patients in your care that you will be leaving the placement. This might be an opportunity to highlight your experience of caring for them and, if appropriate, the progress the patient has made during your time with them. Since the patients might have developed a strong bond with you, it is also important to reiterate the ability of those staff members who remain to care for them.</li>
                            <li>An example of what to say as a leaving statement, is to identify what you will miss and what you are looking forward to (see Ch. 3 Leave-taking skills).</li>
                            <li>Decide if there is anything special that you would like to do to mark the end of the course. It would be useful to investigate this and obtain relevant material should your group be interested in a group activity of some sort.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Reflection on practice</h4>
                        <p>Referring to self-knowledge, Gibran (1991: 65) suggests that 'the treasure of your infinite depths would be revealed to your eyes'. One of the benefits of reflecting on an experience is to increase awareness and facilitate personal and professional development. If a period of time is not put aside to reflect at the end of a module of training or, indeed, at the end of a longer course, some of the significant contributors and contributions to your development (that might not be instantly obvious) can be missed. Gaining insight into your development through the exploration of concrete examples will help you discuss these at interview and have clearer ideas about your strength and areas for development. The following provide some strategies that you might use to capture those important episodes during your training. If you have been keeping a journal over the years, this will also facilitate the reflective process.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>What achievements would you like to celebrate as you approach this ending?</li>
                            <li>What was it like when a new member joined your group?</li>
                            <li>What was it like when you realized that someone had left the group?</li>
                            <li>What do you imagine happened to them?</li>
                            <li>How do you feel as you approach the end of this experience?</li>
                            <li>What did you do as part of leaving each placement?</li>
                            <li>How did others acknowledge that you were leaving the placement?</li>
                            <li>What have you noticed about the different ways your group members are preparing for leaving the course? How can you help and support each other?</li>
                            <li>Write a list of the people and aspects you are going to miss. Consider how you might keep memories of these, e.g. pictures, letters, contact details.</li>
                            <li>Write a poem, story or letter that outlines your experience of the period of training.</li>
                            <li>Draw a picture that symbolizes your experiences of being on the course.</li>
                            <li>Draw a line to represent the beginning to the end of the course. Mark off significant highs and lows along the line and make notes about those times.</li>
                            <li>Read through your journal, making a note of the date of the entries. This might help you make sense of the comments that you have made. For example, upon reading an entry that you made during the middle of your course you will be able to comment on the extent to which your level of knowledge, skills and confidence has developed. It might also be that your comments reflect events in your personal life or the nature of the speciality you were working in at the time.</li>
                            <li>Looking back at the module or your course, is there anyone else you would like to give feedback or say goodbye to?</li>
                            <li>Is there anyone you will be glad to leave behind? What have you learnt about yourself from this person?</li>
                            <li>What have you learnt from doing any or all of the above activities?</li>
                            <li>Write one sentence that sums up your experience of being on the course.</li>
