                        </h2>
                        <p>Our experiences as lecturers have revealed that the questions and situations that qualified staff and students find difficult to address, are often those that highlight their lack of skills or those that stimulate incongruence (see Appendix 1). For example, having to withhold information from a patient when you would prefer to disclose it, or being in a caring role but feeling that you cannot help, might lead to inner conflict. Kirschenbaum & Henderson (1990) suggest that anxiety and vulnerability accompany incongruence, and this in turn can be interpreted as the response to being in a difficult situation; this response might be physical and/or psychological. Students classified as difficult, those situations where they felt they did not have the answer to a particular problem or where they found themselves in a situation which took them by surprise.</p>

                        <span class="heading-text">PRINCIPLES</span>
                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The making, maintaining and ending of relationships in healthcare can involve the management of situations that challenge our value systems, identify the need for the expansion of our communication skills or have an impact on our personal life.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Self-disclosure</h3>
                        <p>The experience of embarrassment can take many forms; this can include working with people who are significantly similar to or different from us. Being sensitive to the feelings of others is vital, and what is considered sensitive will vary between people and between cultures. By being aware of your own embarrassment or anxiety you are being genuine and, when expressed in moderation, two purposes can be served. First, you are acknowledging what might interfere with the effectiveness of your communication, and by releasing this internal anxiety you can be free to listen to what the person has to say. Second, it might be appropriate to disclose your feelings of anxiety, embarrassment or sadness to the patient, as this will demonstrate to the patient that you are a human being as well as a healthcare practitioner. This demonstration of empathetic understanding might lead, e.g. to the patient's own embarrassment being reduced. It is important however to be sure that the focus of the practitioner's self-disclosure is the wellbeing of the person they are caring for, rather than for the release of the intense emotions and thus for the emotional comfort of the practitioner.</p>
                        <p>In the dynamic of the practitioner-patient/client relationship, the patient or client might need (at an unconscious level) to consider the practitioner to be psychologically stronger than they are. This would enable them to feel confident that the practitioner will be able to meet their needs during their illness/situation. For example a woman in labour might feel increasingly vulnerable and will need the midwife to be 'strong' for her as her labour progresses. While self-disclosure can facilitate the therapeutic relationship, there are times when this intervention might not be in the patient's/client's best interest. For example, if the practitioner responds to the frequent requests for personal information or opinions from the person in their care, the focus of the conversation moves away from the person to the practitioner. This might be an unconscious strategy used by the person to provide some respite from thinking about their own situation; then they might need to be facilitated and supported in thinking about themselves.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Unconditional positive regard</h3>
                        <p>Throughout your communication (both verbal and non-verbal), you will need to enable the patient to feel that whatever they say about their feelings, thoughts and behaviours is acceptable. This demonstration of unconditional positive regard might be difficult, e.g. where the person has a belief that you do not share, or behaves in a way that you feel is unacceptable. This does not mean however that antisocial behaviour, such as sexual harassment or abusive language, is acceptable.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Discussing intimate information and assisting with intimate procedures</h3>
                        <p>You are working in women's health and this placement includes spending time in the women's outpatient clinic. During this time you have been involved in a variety of activities including admitting patients, assisting with intimate examinations and providing postoperative information prior to discharge.</p>
                        <p>Some issues raised by this scenario:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The factors that might affect communication when the patient's/client's health status has an impact on their sexual practice and/or their sexuality</li>
                            <li>The practitioner and/or the person in their care might be apprehensive about the nature of the chaperone's role</li>
                            <li>The patient, client and/or the practitioner might be apprehensive about the examination of genitalia.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Specific principles</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>It is essential to be specific when giving and receiving information, especially when discussing sex, sexuality, intimate examinations and procedures. This will reduce the risk of assumptions being made and important areas left unexplored. Omissions or misinformation are more likely to occur if you and/or the patient are experiencing a high level of anxiety or embarrassment.</li>
                            <li>Patients may not want to give extensive information about the effect that their illness has on their sexual activity. However, they do need to be reassured about their sexual activity and feel that they are able to discuss such issues, should they wish to do so (Stead et al 2001). Written information is often useful.</li>
                            <li>Humour, laughter and touch are useful strategies; however you will need to assess the appropriateness of their use. For some patients, any difficulties they have discussing personal information could relate to feeling judged and not accepted.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Preparation of self</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>What type of information is going to be needed? What words will you use to obtain this information?</li>
                            <li>How do you feel about asking questions or giving information of such a personal nature?</li>
                            <li>How will you record this information? Make sure you have the appropriate documentation, demonstration equipment, e.g. models of anatomy, and information leaflets for completing this.</li>
                            <li>Is the patient alone or accompanied by their partner or another person? If the patient is accompanied, the boundaries of confidentiality need to be established.</li>
                            <li>How will your feelings affect your body language, tone of voice and your memory?</li>
                            <li>From what you know of the patient, how do you think they respond to this type of experience or conversation?</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Environment</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Is there a private room available? If not, how are you going to create privacy in the space available to you?</li>
                            <li>What facilities are there in the area you are planning to use, e.g. is there a table and resources to draw or write?</li>
                            <li>Are there leaflets or other sources of information available?</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Putting it into practice</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>It is important to develop a therapeutic relationship with the patient as quickly as possible. Behaviours that will facilitate this include establishing eye contact, appropriate smiling and a reassuring, confident approach.</li>
                            <li>If the discussion is to take place at the patient's bedside, consider moving to the quieter side of the patient's bed, drawing the curtains and lowering your voice. Clinical tasks such as helping with catheter care might provide good opportunities to discuss related issues.</li>
                            <li>One way to demonstrate empathy might be to share how you feel about being asked these questions or having to be examined.</li>
                            <li>When interviewing a patient, consider the structure and sequence of your questions and aim to provide an even balance between open and closed questions. It might also be appropriate to use humour; however, care and sensitivity must be taken into account. The Royal College of Nursing (2001) has produced useful guidelines for considering and incorporating the sexual health needs of patients into everyday professional practice (see Ch. 5).</li>
                            <li>In order to demonstrate unconditional positive regard (acceptance), it is important to consider your body language, facial expression and the words you use, should you hear something that you think is unacceptable and in conflict with your own values. This does not mean that you have to agree with what the patient says or does; it might mean that you will have to focus on the patient's needs and rights rather than your personal values.</li>
                            <li>You need to explore any unsafe practices the patient mentions and address any missing or inaccurate information.</li>
                            <li>While the patient might not need your assistance preparing for a physical examination, it is important that you speak to them and ensure that they are appropriately covered during the procedure. If chaperoning a patient who is lying on a couch, position yourself near the head of the couch. This will enable eye contact to be established and the degree of anxiety, discomfort or pain the patient might be experiencing to be assessed. You can act as an advocate for them by passing this information on to the person examining the patient, to make sure that they are aware and take this into account.</li>
                            <li>If the patient engages in any high-risk behaviours, these will need to be explored. For example, if discussing menstruation with a woman who is about to have a hysterectomy, she might say that she hates sanitary towels. However, following a hysterectomy, tampons are not recommended in the immediate postoperative period; sanitary towels reduce the risk of infection and facilitate the accurate assessment of blood loss.</li>
                            <li>If the patient is undergoing a procedure that you wish to observe, you should gain consent from them beforehand. The patient might however prefer you to act as their chaperone, rather than use their examination as a learning experience for you (Royal College of Nursing 2002; see also the Royal College of Nursing 2006 guide for vaginal and pelvic examination).</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Reflection on practice</h4>
                        <p>Think back to situations where you have assisted patients or women during intimate procedures or assessment.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>How did you help patients or women in your care to feel at ease?</li>
                            <li>How did you ensure that you felt at ease?</li>
                            <li>What values do you hold that might have a negative effect on your communication?</li>
                            <li>Are there any areas that you find it difficult to be more specific about?</li>
                            <li>How would you summarize the quality of your interventions? If there are areas that you are dissatisfied with, what steps will you need to take to address them?</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Dealing with embarrassing situations</h3>
                        <p>A student who was recently allocated to the ward was asked to assist a patient out of bed to go to the bathroom. After introducing himself and contracting with the patient (agreeing who would do what), he proceeded to look under the patient's bed for the patient's slippers. After a thorough search he told the patient that he could only find one slipper, to which the patient replied, "That's because I only have one leg'. The student was so embarrassed that he, 'wished the ground would swallow me up'. The student apologized and the patient laughed, saying that this had often happened. The student then also laughed.</p>
                        <p>Some issues raised by this scenario:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The responsibility of the senior practitioner to provide adequate information when delegating a task</li>
                            <li>The importance of consulting appropriate documentation before providing care for a patient</li>
                            <li>How a mistake might affect the practitioner-patient relationship</li>
                            <li>How to re-establish an effective relationship with a patient following a mistake</li>
                            <li>How to be open and honest in a therapeutic relationship.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Specific principles</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>When a practitioner makes a mistake when caring for a patient or where trust has been breached, the therapeutic relationship will be compromised. Guistolise (1996) and Safran & Muran (1996) identify such incidents as ruptures in the relationship, but reassure us that these can be repaired and might lead to a richer quality of interaction between the patient and the practitioner.</li>
                            <li>While humour and laughter are essential components of everyday life, the practitioner needs to make a distinction between 'laughing with' and 'laughing at' the patient and whether or not it is appropriate to laugh at all.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Environment</h4>
                        <p>The patient was an amputee on a ward and had become increasingly dependent on the nurse to assist with his mobility. In such situations, personal possessions need to be conveniently placed to enable the patient to obtain them as independently as possible. However, the patient might wish an artificial limb to be kept somewhere discreet rather than on view to all.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Putting the skills into practice</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>It is important to establish eye contact with the patient and not to laugh alongside the patient following such an incident. It is quite likely that the patient's laugh is what is called a 'gallows laugh' or, in Freudian theory, an unconscious defence known as reaction-formation (see Appendices 1 and 2).</li>
                            <li>It is inappropriate to join in with the patient's response to what amounts to a lack of appropriate care; instead, an intervention that includes an apology and demonstrates empathic understanding is required.</li>
                            <li>One way to identify an intervention that you feel comfortable using is to consider how you would feel if you were the patient and this type of incident had happened to you on a number of occasions. What would you think about the staff? What response would lead you to feel that the nurse had an understanding of how you were feeling at that moment? For example: 'I am very sorry about that. I imagine you are really annoyed that this keeps happening.'</li>
                            <li>Expressing one's embarrassment at the time of an incident can lead to the relief of any anxiety that is being experienced, and lessen the likelihood of inappropriate expression, in this case 'nervous laughter'. An example of skilled self-disclosure in this situation would have been to apologize and to say something like, 'I'm really embarrassed about making this mistake.'</li>
                            <li>The recognition of the gallows laugh and a verbal reflection of how frustrating it must be (or check with the patient how they feel about this happening), might lead to a more in-depth discussion with the patient about how they feel about being in hospital and their current quality of life. This information can then be shared with appropriate people and the documentation updated as necessary.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Reflection on practice</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>In situations where a mistake has been made, it is essential to consider how and why the situation occurred and strategies to prevent something similar happening in the future.</li>
                            <li>Does the person in your care appear satisfied with the care they have received and the resolution of any misunderstandings? If not, how are you going to address this?</li>
                            <li>Is the patient/client demonstrating signs of anger, frustration or dissatisfaction? If so, what are you going to do? How are you going to defuse the situation?</li>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">The psychological importance of similarities and differences in healthcare</h3>
                        <p>While on a ward placement, a Zimbabwean student is asked to assist an elder Zimbabwean male with his hygiene needs.</p>
                        <p>In this scenario, the similarity of culture is used as a means of considering the impact that similarity (and hence difference) might have on boundaries in the practitioner-patient relationship. It would also be beneficial to consider other similarities such as age, gender, class and status and the impact these might have on the practitioner-patient relationship. The similarity might also be around the use of language and where both share the same first language which is not the dominant language of the country.<br>The issues addressed include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The importance of self-awareness when working with people</li>
                            <li>The impact of conscious and unconscious processes on healthcare practice</li>
                            <li>Strategies for enhancing the cultural sensitivity of the care provided.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Specific principles</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>While working with patients or clients, it is inevitable that preference for some and dislike of others might be experienced. It is important that you develop an awareness of these thoughts and feelings, since they will have an impact on your approach to the people in your care.</li>
                            <li>It might be obvious to you why you like or dislike a patient/client, e.g. you might like the fact that they are always polite or have a good sense of humour. However, it might be difficult to pinpoint exactly what it is about them that you find difficult to work with. In such circumstances self-disclosure in a discussion with your mentor, a registered practitioner or your personal tutor might help your unconscious become conscious (see Ch. 1).</li>
                            <li>It could be that the patient or situation reminds you of a similar person or past experience and that you are responding in the same way you did to that experience and not to the reality of the current situation. This would be termed transference. In a similar vein, when a patient/client responds to a practitioner in the same way they have done to a previous practitioner who looks similar, e.g. this would be called countertransference (see Ch. 1).</li>
                            <li>By identifying that a similarity or difference is having an adverse effect on the practitioner-patient relationship, there is the opportunity to make appropriate adaptations or challenge any assumptions. The following provides an example of how this phenomenon might present and a suggestion for addressing such a situation:<br>A patient, who has had a previous admission on another ward, is admitted to your ward. You notice that they appear to be in pain but they have not asked for help. When you mention it the patient says, 'I don't like to bother you. The staff in the last ward were always busy and it seemed as if I was bothering them when I asked for painkillers.' You reply, 'I'm sorry you felt like that. It's no bother. Please feel free to ask any of us if you need anything. Would you like something for pain now?' This clarification of the situation provides firmer ground upon which the practitioner-patient relationship can develop.</li>
                            <li>While the patient is in your care, there is a need to create a balance between establishing and maintaining a professional relationship and becoming appropriately attached to the patient to enable them to feel 'cared for'.</li>
                            <li>In order to reduce the possibility of the patient feeling that you are the only one (because of your similarity) that can provide specific aspects of their care, sharing information with your colleagues is important. If this is not done, an unhealthy dependence can result with the person in your care not expressing their needs until 'their' nurse/midwife arrives. This could also lead to the patient's needs being unmet and appropriate care not being offered.</li>
                            <li>It is also important that you challenge and explore any assumptions the patient expresses, e.g. when the patient says, 'You know what I mean'. The patient's assumptions might be based on face value (literally), and your perception based on what you think a person from the same background would want. This might not however reflect the actual needs of the patient and these might remain unmet. The result would be that the patient would be left feeling disappointed, and you left unsure about where you went wrong.<br>The information that follows is designed to encourage you to think not only of the practical aspects of your work with patients/clients, but also of the psychological factors that will influence the care you provide. This exploration will also help illuminate the personal-professional boundary.</li>

                            <li>What is the nature of your relationship with the patient or client?</li>

                            <li>To what extent does the ward environment reflect that to which the person in your care is accustomed in their own country? It would be appropriate to explain the location of various facilities such as the bathroom, and to highlight any of the ward policies. This would be designed to help them become familiar with the environment in order to reduce their anxiety.</li>
                            <li>What expectations might the patient/client hold with regard to your role as a professional practitioner and their role as a patient? For example, the patient might not be familiar with the expectation that they can question actions and seek advice from the doctors and other members of the healthcare team; the practitioner might need to clarify these options.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Putting it into practice</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Any similarities that you share with a patient or client might mean that areas such as hygiene practices and religious/spiritual rituals are known and facilitated as much as possible.</li>
                            <li>While assisting them with their care, it would be useful to explore their previous experiences of being in hospital in this and other countries.</li>
                            <li>It is important that you share this information with colleagues verbally and through documentation.</li>
                            <li>While carrying out care and in general conversation with the person in your care, it would be opportune to explore their assumptions based on your appearance, similarities and differences, as a means of gathering information regarding the extent the patient/client feels that their needs are being met.</li>

                        <p>One of your patients has developed a wound infection and is coming to terms with their altered body image. The patient asks you: 'Do I smell?'</p>
                        <p>This scenario explores how the health care professional can use the core conditions and effective communication skills while helping a patient to come to terms with altered body image. It invites you to think about how you would address a situation where it is important not to cause offence, and where it is also your responsibility to assist the patient in managing changes in their health.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Specific principles</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Providing information and supporting patients with the consequences of their illness are central parts of your role. At times this might involve giving information that might cause embarrassment, disappointment or concern for you, the patient or both.</li>
                            <li>Open and honest communication is a cornerstone of the development and maintenance of an effective therapeutic relationship.</li>
                            <li>As a practitioner you can help the patient to develop strategies that can enhance their quality of life, by being willing to take notice of the concerns that they might express. However, some patients might express themselves less directly than others, and more time and skills might be needed to interpret what they are saying.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Preparation of self</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Consider your facial expression and general body language.</li>
                            <li>Pay attention to your senses, particularly those of sight and smell. What are they telling you? Is there an odour? How noticeable is it?</li>
                            <li>What do you know about how this patient is coping with their health condition?</li>
                            <li>What do you imagine their psychological needs might be?</li>
                            <li>With this in mind, what is the objective of your communication: to explore the patient's emotional state, to solve the problem of an odour or both?</li>
                            <li>How much time do you and the patient have?</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Environment</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Where is this interaction taking place? In the bathroom or toilet, at the bedside or while walking along a corridor? The location of this interaction will determine the depth to which you should explore the patient's concern at this point.</li>
                            <li>The more privacy that you can offer the patient the more appropriate it will be to discuss the matter in greater depth.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Putting it into practice</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>It is important that you remain physically close (or draw nearer to the patient), since their verbal expression indicates a fear of rejection.</li>
                            <li>Establish eye contact with the patient and it might also be appropriate to use touch as a therapeutic intervention (Sundeen et al 1998). This will depend on your relationship with the patient and your assessment of their emotional state.</li>
                            <li>A genuine response, acknowledging whether there is or is not an odour, will assist the patient in accepting their reality: the patient might exaggerate the intensity of any odour they consider exists, e.g. 'I smell disgusting. I'm sure everyone knows it's me'. The extent of your confirmation might need to be modified. Confirming that there is an odour is important, but knowing that it permeates the whole ward will not help the patient.</li>
                            <li>Consider your automatic response and monitor your facial expression, particularly if there is an offensive smell. Although the patient will be listening for your verbal response, it is highly probable that they will be paying more attention to your facial expression. It is therefore essential to ensure that there is congruence between your facial expression and your verbal statement, and that both are appropriate.</li>
                            <li>It is also important to take into account the impact the information might have on the patient's self-esteem. Use of empathetic understanding about the reality of their situation might facilitate the move to problem-solving, if appropriate. For example, the practitioner might say, 'You sound very concerned about this. You're right, your wound does smell a little, but it's not as bad as you suggest. I'll change your dressing and use a dressing designed to reduce the smell. Is there anything else that you think might help you feel more comfortable about this?'</li>
                            <li>If there is minimal or no odour at all, it would be appropriate to explore this with the patient rather than dismiss it; e.g. invite the patient to describe what the smell is like. It is possible however that 'the smell' might be a façade for other anxieties or concerns that the patient might have, but finds it difficult to discuss. In such circumstances, by raising this issue of a smell, the patient has attracted your attention and it is now your job to facilitate them in revealing their concerns.</li>
                            <li>Depending on your relationship with the patient, it might be appropriate to use the skill of advanced empathy, and offer them an interpretation of what you think is going on. For example, 'I can see that you are worried. I wonder if it's about your treatment/having surgery/being discharged.'</li>
                            <li>If a patient complains repeatedly of an odour that is minimal or does not exist, this might be their way of expressing another underlying anxiety. It is important that you treat this defence with respect. In this situation you can either provide regular assurance that there is no odour or choose to explore the underlying anxiety in more depth.</li>
                            <li>It is, however, inappropriate to deny the existence of an odour if an odour does exist, particularly if this is done because it is thought that it would be unkind to tell the truth. Interventions such as, 'Of course not' or 'We're used to it', are blocks to further interaction on the subject and therefore inhibit the development of a meaningful therapeutic relationship.</li>
                            <li>As a nurse or midwife, being used to a sight, sound or a smell is part of becoming a professional practitioner; however, as a means of conveying the uniqueness of a particular patient, their experience and your recognition of how they may be feeling, it is not a useful intervention. A further consequence of such interventions is that they deny the opportunity for the enhancement of problem-solving and communication skills in both you and the person in your care.</li>
                            <li>Depending on their needs, the above interventions might be useful in helping allay the patient's concerns about offending you. It is important to remember, however, that protecting you should not be the concern of the patient.</li>
                            <li>If the environment is not conducive to in-depth exploration (e.g. while accompanying the patient to another department), acknowledge that there is an issue that needs to be addressed and contract with the patient for a time and place when you will speak with them about the issue. It is important to ensure that you keep to that commitment.</li>
                            <li>At the end of your interaction it would be beneficial to summarize the areas of discussion and reflect (both verbally and non-verbally) your appreciation of the patient's level of concern.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Reflection on practice</h4>
                        <p>When faced with unexpected situations, it might be difficult to know what to say for the best, or how to say it. Each time you are faced with such situations, it is useful to reflect upon how you managed them. It is also useful to consider discussing the 'what would I say if' scenarios with your mentor.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>If you were in a similar situation, to what extent do you feel you would be able to demonstrate acceptance of the patient? What evidence do you have to support your answer?</li>
                            <li>How might you improve your use of empathetic understanding?</li>
                            <li>Have there been times when you have felt stuck during an interaction with a patient? If so, why do you think this happened?</li>
                            <li>What skills do you need to develop further?</li>
                            <li>What have you learnt that might be applied to other patients and future clinical placements?</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Withholding information</h3>
                        <p>One of the patients on your ward is terminally ill and wants to know what is wrong with them and asks you if they are going to die. Although you want to be honest with the patient and give them the information, it was made clear in the handover and in the patient's notes that the patient was not to be told their diagnosis. You are very uncomfortable about this.</p>
                        <p>Some issues raised by this scenario:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The importance of reflection</li>
                            <li>Strategies to be used to ensure the maintenance of an effective therapeutic relationship in such a situation.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Specific principles</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>When working in a team or in an organization, there will be times when decisions are made which go against one's personal philosophy, but with which one has to conform. This scenario explores a situation where the agreed strategy is to withhold information regarding diagnosis from the patient. Although it is important that the nurse is familiar with the legal and ethical issues surrounding such a decision, this is not the focus of the following discussion.</li>
                            <li>Interactions with the patient might be strained, particularly if the nurse is experiencing inner conflict (incongruence) caused by a desire to tell the patient and an instruction not to do so.</li>
                            <li>The interventions might focus on how to remain within the agreed protocol for the patient, but the strain on open and honest communication might be compounded if the patient is anxious or distressed by the lack of information.</li>
                            <li>It is important that the healthcare team is able to negotiate and agree the plan of care. However, each team member might belong to a different hierarchical structure, and values and beliefs might clash (Roberts 1994). Occasionally, where beliefs differ, acceptance of the situation is necessary.</li>
                            <li>Reflecting on a given situation from the perspective of each person concerned will provide valuable insights and this might make acceptance easier to manage and work with. Being aware of your feelings about a given situation and being able to put the distracting elements aside is an essential skill for all healthcare practitioners. It is equally important that you have another forum within which these distracting thoughts and feelings can be explored. The ward meeting, a tutorial, clinical supervision or reflection sessions are examples of appropriate arenas for this activity.</li>
                            <li>In such a situation, it is difficult if the patient asks about their diagnosis. 'We're all going to die' is sometimes suggested as an appropriate response but, while this is certainly the truth, this response is unlikely to meet the emotional or cognitive needs of the patient. The maintenance of a therapeutic relationship is also threatened since such interventions do not encourage the patient to discuss how they feel about their situation.</li>
                            <li>The use of such responses reflects one of two things: either a lack of awareness or the level of anxiety experienced by the nurse in the face of such a question. The response could be considered as a defence against this anxiety, since it blocks the depth of conversation that the patient desires.</li>
                            <li>At times other strategies might also be used to reduce anxiety, such as ignoring the question, changing the subject or using humour. While the use of humour in the clinical setting is often useful, the nurse needs to consider the appropriateness of this intervention.</li>

                            <li>Why do you think the patient needs to know their diagnosis? What do you imagine their needs are at this time?</li>

                            <li>What do you know about the information that is being withheld? How long will the information be withheld?</li>
                            <li>What do you know about this patient's spiritual, religious and cultural beliefs?</li>
                            <li>If you were able to speak openly and honestly with the patient, what would you say?</li>
                            <li>What areas do you think this discussion will lead to? Have you discussed these areas before? Do you feel you have the necessary skills to support the patient as they explore these issues or do you need the support of a more experienced practitioner?</li>
                            <li>If unable to discuss the patient's diagnosis, what other aspects of the patient's care or situation could you explore, rather than avoiding the patient?</li>
                            <li>Who have you consulted to express your concerns and to provide support for you in this situation?</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Environment</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>In such situations, it is useful to note what was happening immediately prior to being confronted with this situation, as this might be an indication of the patient's level of anxiety. For example, were you assisting the patient with an aspect of their care or were you simply passing by their bed?</li>
                            <li>Is there anyone else with the patient or are they alone? If they are with a relative, it might be the relative that is forcing the issue.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Putting the skills into practice</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Consider your automatic response and monitor your facial expression, particularly if this request has taken you by surprise. It might be appropriate to disclose that you were surprised by the question.</li>
                            <li>It is important that you remain physically close or move nearer to the patient. This will reflect that you understand the seriousness of the question and will also act as a means of providing privacy.</li>
                            <li>Establish eye contact with the patient and, depending on your relationship with them and your assessment of their emotional state, it might be appropriate to use touch as a therapeutic intervention.</li>
                            <li>The environment within which the issue is raised might not be conducive to in-depth exploration, i.e. you are in the process of doing a wound dressing or you are helping the patient while in the toilet. It is crucial to acknowledge that they have raised important issues that need to be discussed and agree a time and a place where this discussion can take place. It would also be appropriate to mention if you are going to speak with another member of the healthcare team about their concerns.</li>
                            <li>The above strategy serves two purposes: first, it protects the patient's privacy and self-esteem by planning for the discussion to take place in a more secure environment; and second, it provides time for both you and the patient to think about the next step.</li>
                            <li>The patient might feel some relief about the fact that they have raised the issue and might now need some time to think about what they are going to say. They might also wish to contact a member of their family or a friend to ask them to visit. The nurse can also take this opportunity of time to seek advice, consult another member of the team and think about what future actions might be appropriate.</li>
                            <li>Alternatively, the environment might be where such a conversation can take place, where a degree of privacy can be assured, where the patient can be comfortable and where appropriate verbal and non-verbal communication can take place.</li>
                            <li>In responding to direct or implied questions like, 'Am I going to die?' you have a number of options. One is to respond with empathic understanding (see Ch. 4), e.g. 'I can see that you look worried' and this could be followed with open focused encouragement such as, 'Tell me more about how you have been feeling lately.'</li>
                            <li>The skill of active listening involves listening to what is unspoken as well as the spoken word. For a greater understanding of this, imagine the thoughts and feelings you would have if you were being asked either of the above questions.</li>
                            <li>For example, the patient might speak at length about the impact of their illness on a family member, but not mention how they are feeling. Addressing this with the patient will depend on your skills, your relationship with the patient and the appropriateness of the location.</li>
                            <li>It might be that the patient signals (verbally or non-verbally) that they do not wish to talk about a particular issue. While you might feel discouraged about this, you have signalled to the patient that you have noticed something important and that you are available to discuss it, should they wish to.</li>
                            <li>Specific responses reflecting the patient's condition might also be appropriate, e.g. 'It does seem as if your symptoms are taking a long time to respond to the treatment.' Open questions such as, 'What do you think is wrong with you?' or 'How do you think you are progressing?' will imply your willingness and ability to engage with the client at a very personal level, therefore such interventions should not be used unless this is your intention.</li>
                            <li>However, since this might be exactly the type of conversation that the patient wants to have with a member of the team, you could say, 'It sounds as if you want to be clear about what is wrong with you' or 'It sounds as if you are very concerned that you are not getting better.' Either statement could then continue: 'I'm not able to discuss these issues with you, but I will ask the nurse in charge/doctor to come and speak with you urgently. In the meantime is there anything I can do for you now?'</li>
                            <li>There are occasions when a patient feels out of control, helpless and/or powerless. It is helpful if you are aware of this and use interventions that offer choices, encourage the patient and help boost their self-esteem. For example, 'It certainly sounds as if you have been giving this a lot of thought. Would you like to talk to the doctor about your thinking?'</li>
                            <li>It would be appropriate for you to accompany the team member who will subsequently speak with the patient, since the patient has established a relationship with you. However, it would be respectful to seek permission from the patient first.</li>
                            <li>At the end of your interaction it is beneficial to summarize the areas of discussion and reflect (both verbally and non-verbally) your appreciation of the patient's level of concern.</li>
                            <li>If a senior member of staff was not present during your discussion, it would be important to update them on what has been said, and inform your colleagues in the next handover. Completion of appropriate documentation will ensure that the team is conversant with the latest developments with regard to the patient's concerns and the information that the patient has.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Reflection on practice</h4>
                        <p>Think back to a situation where you have been unable to disclose information, such as test results to a patient.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>How would you monitor the changes in a patient's psychological state during such an interaction?</li>
                            <li>How effective are you in supporting patients through this type of experience?</li>
                            <li>How might you improve your use of empathetic understanding?</li>
                            <li>Have there been occasions during an interaction when you have not known what to say?</li>
                            <li>What have you learnt about communicating with patients experiencing such uncertainty? What skills do you need to develop further?</li>
                            <li>What have you learnt that could be applied to other patients and future clinical placements?</li>
                            <li>What support do you need to be able to reflect on such situations? Are there any changes that you need to make to your support network?</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Supporting a pregnant woman in decision-making</h3>
                        <p>A woman has been in hospital for over a week having various tests and scans and is awaiting the results. She asks the midwife, 'Why me?' or 'What would you do?'</p>
                        <p>This scenario reflects some of the fundamental existential questions that practitioners might face, but that cannot be answered, other than by acknowledging the feelings that often accompany them. These questions might also be difficult because the practitioner has not explored them with regard to their own lives and circumstances.<br>Some issues raised by this scenario:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>How to use self-disclosure effectively</li>
                            <li>How to inform and give advice efficiently</li>
                            <li>How to manage one's own anxiety and help the person in your care manage their anxiety.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Specific principles</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Maintaining a balance between personal and professional relationships might be difficult at times, particularly if the practitioner identifies closely with the patient or woman's situation and finds it hard to maintain the distinction between themselves and the patient.</li>
                            <li>Deciding if, when and how to disclose personal information to a person in your care is a challenging skill, since in some situations it can significantly enhance the relationship. However, in other situations the person might consider it an unwanted intrusion.</li>
                            <li>Enabling patients and clients to make their own decisions is often more difficult than telling them what to do for the best, and it might also be more time-consuming. There are clearly times when it is the practitioner's role to let the woman know what might be in their best interest, e.g. 'You will probably find it easier to breathe if you have a few more pillows supporting your back. I'll go and get some for you.' There are others, however, when you cannot make the decision for the person in your care; such as a pregnant woman, when discussing the option of the administration of Vitamin K to her baby after delivery, might ask you, 'What would you do?'</li>
                            <li>At times, practitioners are very focused on problem-solving and use this as their primary and main intervention, particularly in the face of staff shortages. Moving to problem-solving might also be a strategy for reducing anxiety when faced with the reality of not knowing what to do or say. Silence might be an appropriate option. (For a useful framework which identifies the choices we have when communicating, see Heron 2001).</li>
                            <li>Lack of experience or awareness might also cause the practitioner to take the patient's or client's questions literally and begin the search for answers; when 'staying with' and supporting them might be the best solution.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Preparation of self</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Why do you think the woman is asking the question?</li>
                            <li>What thoughts and feelings do you have when women or patients ask questions such as these?</li>
                            <li>As you listen and observe women or patients, how do you assess their psychological state?</li>
                            <li>How does this assessment affect your interactions with the person in your care?</li>
                            <li>Are you the only person that the woman or patient has asked, or have other members of staff been approached? It is important that the woman or patient does not develop an unhealthy reliance on you.</li>
                            <li>What would you like to say to them? How do you imagine this might help or hinder them?</li>
                            <li>What do you know about your client's or patient's spiritual, religious and cultural beliefs?</li>
                            <li>In light of the information that you have about your clients/patients regarding their health, what other resources and information would be useful for you to consult?</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Environment</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>What was happening immediately prior to being confronted with the situation? For example, were you assisting the woman with an aspect of her care or were you simply passing by her bed, or has she just been seen by the doctors?</li>
                            <li>Knowledge of what preceded the woman's statement might provide you with a reference point from which to begin your interaction. For example, if this occurred while assisting a woman with her hygiene needs, you might explore the impact her pregnancy is having on her independence and how she feels about this. It might be that other strategies or resources might need to be employed, especially if the woman is due to be discharged.</li>
                            <li>Where is this interaction taking place? In the bathroom or toilet? At the bedside? In the corridor? The location of this interaction will determine the depth to which the concern can be addressed.</li>
                            <li>It is important that you remain physically close (or draw nearer to the patient), since this will afford the person some privacy and show them that you are paying attention.</li>
                            <li>Establish eye contact with the patient and it might also be appropriate to use touch as a therapeutic intervention. This will depend on your relationship with the woman and your assessment of their emotional state.</li>
                            <li>A genuine response, acknowledging the dilemma or situation they are facing, would be appropriate.</li>
                            <li>If the environment is not conducive to in-depth exploration, acknowledge that you hear their concern and contract with the person in your care for a time and place when you will talk about the issue. It would also be appropriate to mention if you intend to inform another member of the healthcare team about their concerns.</li>
                            <li>The above strategy serves two purposes: first, it protects the person's privacy and self-esteem by planning for the discussion to take place in a more secure environment and second, it provides time for both the practitioner and the person to think about the next stage.</li>
                            <li>The woman might feel some relief about the fact that she has raised the issue and might now need some time to think about what she is going to say. She might also wish to contact a member of her family or a friend to ask them to visit. The nurse/midwife can take this opportunity of time to seek advice, consult another member of the team and think about what future actions might be appropriate.</li>
                            <li>Alternatively, the environment might be one within which such a conversation can take place, that is, where a degree of privacy can be assured, where the woman or patient can be comfortable and where appropriate verbal and non-verbal communication can take place.</li>
                            <li>In responding to direct or implied questions like, 'Why me?', the practitioner has a number of options. One is to respond with empathetic understanding, 'I can see that you look worried.' This might be followed with an open question, 'Tell me more about how you have been feeling lately.'</li>
                            <li>'Why me?' might also be a verbal exclamation to the woman's or patient's spiritual/religious being. One way to demonstrate respect if this is the case, would be to witness the expression, remain silent but use your body language to show you recognize the despair that they might be experiencing. For example, sit with them, hold their hand and adjust your facial expression. An appropriate verbal response might be, 'Yes, you are having a rough time.'</li>
                            <li>Aiming to answer such a question might leave both participants dissatisfied, therefore it would be best to try and capture the feelings that underpin such statements. At times there are occasions when a woman or patient feels out of control, helpless, hopeless and powerless. It is useful for the practitioner to be aware of this and use interventions and offer choices that encourage the person and help them boost their self-esteem.</li>
                            <li>Active listening involves listening to what is unspoken as well as the spoken word. For a greater understanding of this, it would be useful to imagine the thoughts and feelings you would have if you were asking either of the questions asked by the woman.</li>
                            <li>It might be beneficial to sit with the woman or patient and listen without offering solutions. Silence will facilitate listening and allow them to feel free to speak. Occasional reflection and paraphrasing might be used as appropriate. For example, 'It is unfair that you are having to suffer like this' or 'It is really frustrating not knowing what to do for the best. I can't tell you what to do but I am here to support your decision and give you what information I can.' This would enable the person to tell their story and give the practitioner a clear picture of the woman's or patient's perspectives and concerns.</li>
                            <li>An example of a response using self-disclosure and reflecting the woman's dilemma might be, 'When I was faced with a difficult decision recently I found it useful to write down the pros and cons of the options and then I discussed these with . . .' or 'I really don't know what I would do if I were in your situation. I'd hope there were people around to help me and I guess I'd make a decision eventually, but I know it wouldn't be easy. This is why we're here, to give you information and support you in making your decision and open focused.'</li>
                            <li>Open questions and open focused questions such as, 'What do you think would be the best for you?' or 'What choices do you feel you have?' are interventions that will give the signals to the patient that you are willing and able to engage in helping them. These are examples of what Heron (2001) terms catalytic interventions.</li>
                            <li>If the woman has inaccurate or insufficient information, agree a strategy for addressing this. For example, it might be appropriate to teach her (see Ch. 10) to obtain other resources or arrange for a specialist practitioner or other member of the healthcare team to visit.</li>
                            <li>At the end of your interaction it is beneficial to summarize the areas of discussion and reflect (both verbally and non-verbally) your appreciation of how concerned the person is.</li>
                            <li>If it has been arranged for another member of the team to visit the woman, it would be appropriate for you to accompany them when they speak with her, since the patient has established a relationship with you. However, it would be respectful to seek permission from the woman first.</li>
                        </ul>
