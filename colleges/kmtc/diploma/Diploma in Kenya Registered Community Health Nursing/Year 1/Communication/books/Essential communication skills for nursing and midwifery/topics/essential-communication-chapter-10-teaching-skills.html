                        </h2>
                        <p>Teaching is an integral part of nursing and midwifery practice (Kiger et al 2004) when working with patients, women who are pregnant or have become new mothers, families, clients, carers and colleagues. Benner (2001: 50) identifies teaching as part of the 'helping role' of the nurse. The Royal College of Midwives (2009) lists the wide variety of topics that are relevant to the midwife's role and thus identifies that teaching is integral to the midwife's role, e.g. in screening and health promotion, supporting breast-feeding, and in evidence-based practice.</p>
                        <p>Although this chapter addresses teaching patients and clients, the principles apply equally to teaching students and colleagues. The Nursing and Midwifery Council sets clear standards for the requirements to be met for the education and training of pre-registration nursing and midwifery students (Nursing and Midwifery Council 2004a,b): these requirements clearly state that registered practitioners have a responsibility also to support and teach the student nurses and midwives.</p>

                        <span class="heading-text">PRINCIPLES</span>
                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>There are a number of principles that apply to all situations when practitioners teach. Rogers (1961) argues that 'significant learning' changes us as people. Therefore in order to be effective in helping others to learn, practitioners need to base their teaching on an attitude of respect (Rogers 1983, 1961) for those in their care and for their circumstances.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Teaching to reduce dependence</h3>
                        <p>Learning and teaching is a collaborative process. This is particularly significant in acute settings where patients are often dependent. Similarly women who are in labour, are dependent on the midwife's support and understanding of the process, a cooperative relationship being central to enabling them to respond appropriately when advised by the practitioner. In such settings, it is important to use teaching to promote their independence. Practitioners' encouragement that 'involves (their) relinquishing power and control over them, and which instead facilitates their empowerment' (Latter 1998: 13), enables them to gain knowledge and skills that can free them from dependence on the nurse or midwife.</p>
                        <p>By demonstrating empathetic recognition of the patient's or woman's concerns about the topic or process to be taught, the practitioner lays the foundation for trust. Trust is an essential component of the helping relationship (Sundeen et al 1998, Rogers 1957) through which those in our care can express their thoughts and feelings about what they are learning.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Adult learning</h3>
                        <p>Arguably, the majority of people who midwives and nurses teach are adults, in that they are most likely to be 16 years of age or older. Knowles et al (2005: 199) state that 'Adults tend to be motivated towards learning that helps them solve problems in their lives or results in internal payoffs'. Adults learn best therefore when they recognize that they need to learn, e.g. a new skill as a pre-registration student or a mother's different way of managing her infant feeding when her new baby doesn't seem to settle. Adults are thus also more likely to be self motivated.</p>
                        <p>Frequently, those in our care who need to understand their changed health situations or their new status such as being parents, are facing major life transitions. It is for this reason that practitioners need always to remember their responsibilities to approach those they are teaching with respect and empathy, recognizing that anxiety and intense emotions can interfere with peoples' capacities to learn and thus acquire new skills and attitudes to deal with their new situations.</p>
                        <p>It is also important to recognize that people have individual learning styles (Knowles et al 2005, Dean & Kenworthy 2000). Therefore it is essential that the specific needs and circumstances of patients, women, their carers and/or loved ones are taken into account when planning, implementing and evaluating teaching, to ensure that these issues are accommodated.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Preparation for teaching</h3>
                        <p>The practitioner must be well-informed about the topic to be addressed. The session should be prepared in advance, whether it is a formal or informal session, and even if time is short. There should be clear aims and learning outcomes for the session. The practitioner needs to be clear about exactly what the person needs to know and how it will be taught. The subject and focus of the session therefore needs to be decided in collaboration with the client. Practitioners also need to be aware that clients, while recognizing that they do need to learn, might not know the essential components of what they are setting out to learn.</p>
                        <p>Teaching notes should be written to ensure that information is up-to-date and nothing essential is omitted. Cards are useful when working on the practice area, as they are easily kept in pockets or equipment bags. Time must be set aside for the teaching and the venue where the teaching takes place has to be prepared to ensure as far as possible that it is quiet, that as little as possible is likely to be overheard, and there are no interruptions. This allows for the client to ask questions and express concerns. Set any tables and chairs in a manner that does not form a barrier between the practitioner and the client.</p>
                        <p>Any apparatus used, such as blood-monitoring equipment or an overhead projector, must be checked to ensure it is functioning correctly and any written information must be up-to-date and correct. In order to help build a collaborative working relationship, it is important for us to introduce ourselves and invite the patients, women and clients to use our preferred name. Introduce the topic and explain the reasons why it is important that they are well-informed about it. It is important to start with what they understand and/or what skills they can already perform. Thus clarification of their knowledge and skills is crucial before introducing new information and/or techniques to them.</p>
                        <p><strong>Note:</strong> In all circumstances, practitioners should ensure that they are competent to teach the topic, process or practical skill. Students should always be supervised, unless formally deemed competent by a qualified practitioner to teach unsupervised. The qualified practitioner is accountable, but the student is responsible for agreeing that they are able to undertake the task.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Teaching methods</h3>
                        <p>The method of teaching must be appropriate for the topic, e.g. practical skills must be demonstrated and not just discussed. Clients should also be able to practise the skills under the supervision of the practitioner. Information and skills should be broken down into their component parts and given in a logical sequence. The practitioner should choose language that is appropriate for the client's understanding. Jargon and technical terms should be avoided and cue cards or an interpreter should be used if necessary.</p>
                        <p>Body language should demonstrate respect; it is usually inappropriate to stand over a client when teaching. It is better to be at the same level as them and be aware of physical proximity, so as not to be perceived as intimidating. Most clients are likely to have had experience of being taught, some of which may not have been pleasant. Being taught could elicit discomfiting memories (see Ch. 1).</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Checking understanding</h3>
                        <p>The practitioner must check the client's understanding at regular intervals and correct it if necessary. Wherever possible, written information for the client to refer to afterwards should be given. If appropriate, this should include contact details of the ward and/or service and support organizations. The practitioner should continually evaluate the teaching, checking the client's understanding by asking them to explain exactly what they understand from the session. This can be done through careful questioning (see Ch. 5).</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Learning from experience</h3>
                        <p>When we teach patients we include them in the process, thereby offering them an experience that is relevant to their learning needs. Steinaker & Bell (1979) describe the processes of learning from experience as follows (Nicklin 2000: 21):</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Exposure level</strong> - where the learner is exposed to an experience and conscious that this is so</li>
                            <li><strong>Participation level</strong> - where the learner decides to be actively involved in the process of learning from the experience</li>
                            <li><strong>Identification level</strong> - where the learner identifies with the experience and sees its relevance to them, both emotionally and intellectually</li>
                            <li><strong>Internalization level</strong> - where the new learning becomes an integral part of the learner's personal knowledge and understanding, and their behaviour changes as a result</li>
                            <li><strong>Dissemination level</strong> - where the learner passes the experiential learning on to others.</li>
                        </ul>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Much of what we teach clients has to do with what is likely to occur, i.e. a process, such as being discharged, rather than solely a topic, such as details about their condition. We therefore need to recognize the differences in helping those in our care to understand the processes they are likely to experience as well as specific topics.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Teaching a patient how to take medication</h3>
                        <p>A middle-aged patient has asked you to explain why it is so important that she remembers to take her medication for hypertension.</p>
                        <p>Some issues raised by this scenario:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>What do you know about your client, their individual circumstances (not solely their diagnosis and treatment) and how these relate to the teaching of this topic? Note their age, gender and culture so you can choose appropriate language and examples.</li>
                            <li>Clarify exactly what your client needs to learn.</li>
                            <li>What literature or information do you need on the subject?</li>
                            <li>Ensure that all the information you have is correct and up-to-date.</li>
                            <li>Write brief aims and learning outcomes for the teaching session.</li>
                            <li>Write notes to ensure the important points are not omitted. Collect together any equipment you will be using.</li>

                            <li>Help the client to understand by making the information relevant to their own circumstances. For example, ask them about their daily routine so that the times they are most likely to remember to take their medication can be identified.</li>
                            <li>Observe throughout the session for verbal and non-verbal signs of their level of understanding.</li>
                            <li>At regular intervals, ask the client to repeat to you what they understand of what you have explained and clarify any misunderstandings.</li>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Learning and teaching practical skills are integral to nursing and midwifery practice (Neary 2000). As professional practitioners we often need to teach those in our care new practical skills such as mixing their babies' feeds or managing their stomas. Learning new practical skills can be daunting for many people, especially when we appear to demonstrate them with ease. People are able to take control of their healthcare needs if they are able to learn the necessary practical skills, such as giving themselves injections or ensuring that they sterilize their babies' bottles correctly. Taking on these responsibilities for themselves can give them a sense of accomplishment and empowerment (see also Ch. 5).</p>

                        <p>Under the supervision of her mentor, a student is asked to teach a woman with gestational diabetes how to monitor her blood sugar levels.</p>
                        <p>Some issues raised by this scenario:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The need for supervision and knowledge of the technique and standard precautions</li>
                            <li>The need to break a complex skill into manageable steps.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Preparation of self</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>What do you know about the person in your care, their individual circumstances (not solely the duration of their pregnancy or their diagnosis and treatment) and how these relate to the teaching of this topic?</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Note:</strong> Remember their age, gender and culture so you can choose appropriate language and examples.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Clarify with them exactly what they need to learn.</li>
                            <li>What literature or information do you need on the subject? Ensure that all the information you have is correct and up-to-date.</li>
                            <li>Write brief aims and learning outcomes for the teaching session and notes to ensure the important points are not omitted.</li>
                            <li>Collect together any equipment you will be using.</li>
                            <li>Ensure that you have any written information that you think the client might find useful to keep, including contact and support group details.</li>
                            <li>Prepare all the equipment needed for the demonstration, e.g. gloves, blood glucose meter, finger-pricking device or lancet, gauze swab or cotton ball (according to policy), blood glucose testing strips (Nicol et al 2008: 36).</li>
                            <li>Ensure that you are observing universal precautions.</li>
                            <li>Ensure that a qualified member of staff observes your practice of the skill and considers that you are competent to teach it.</li>
                            <li>Practise the skill to ensure you are proficient in doing it yourself and you feel confident to teach it.</li>
                            <li>Then break it down into component parts and prepare what you need to say during each stage of the demonstration. These steps may need to be taught on separate occasions, e.g. pricking the finger and obtaining a good blood sample on one occasion and using the glucose meter on another occasion.</li>
                            <li>Ensure your own proficiency in the skill as well as breaking it down into steps and explaining them, as you demonstrate each step.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Environment</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The environment should be quiet.</li>
                            <li>Set aside enough time for the woman to accomplish the skill. It is wise to be generous with the time rather than hurry her while she is practising the skill.</li>
                            <li>Ensure there is enough equipment for you to demonstrate more than once if necessary and for the woman to practise with.</li>
                            <li>On completion, tidy the environment and put all equipment away.</li>
                            <li>Ensure that any disposable equipment is discarded appropriately, e.g. disposing of the lance in a sharps bin.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Ensure you have all the equipment necessary for the demonstration.</li>
                            <li>Ensure the woman is positioned comfortably and can see clearly what you are demonstrating.</li>
                            <li>Establish whether she is right- or left-handed.</li>
                            <li>Ensure you are observing universal precautions throughout the demonstration.</li>
                            <li>Explain to the woman the skill you are about to teach them and the reasons.</li>
                            <li>Explain clearly all the equipment and its relevance.</li>
                            <li>Demonstrate the complete skill.</li>
                            <li>Then demonstrate the first part of the skill, explaining what you are doing throughout the process, e.g. how to hold a lancet.</li>
                            <li>Observe for verbal and non-verbal signs of her level of understanding.</li>
                            <li>Now, encourage the woman to try out the first part of the skill with you. Do not move on to the second part of the skill until this is firmly understood.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>This may well take several sessions with a complex skill such as blood glucose monitoring. The woman can gradually assume more responsibility for the parts of the skill as she accomplishes each part.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Explain clearly the process as she practises each component part and learns to link them together.</li>
                            <li>Encourage her to ask questions, clarify points and explain any difficulties she might be encountering.</li>
                            <li>Allow time for her to keep practising the skill until both you and she are sure she is competent.</li>
                            <li>An accurate demonstration by the woman is a sound means of evaluating your teaching session.</li>
                            <li>Ensure that she is supervised until you both feel confident that she can do it alone.</li>
                            <li>Throughout the process offer the woman positive feedback and encouragement, helping her to use her strengths to accomplish those aspects of the skill she might be finding more difficult.</li>
