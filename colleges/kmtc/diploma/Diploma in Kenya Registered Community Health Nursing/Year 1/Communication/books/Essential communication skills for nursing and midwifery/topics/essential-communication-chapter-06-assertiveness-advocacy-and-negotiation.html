                        </h2>
                        <p>Nursing and midwifery take place within organizations and require effective communication with everyone involved, in order to ensure competent and safe practice. This chapter addresses some of the important skills that practitioners need to develop so that a good standard of care can be provided. These skills include: using assertive communication; acting on behalf of another if appropriate; and negotiating activities. While assertive communication facilitates compromise and negotiation, there are occasions when this is not the best option and examples of alternative strategies are also explored. Assertiveness also involves being clear about professional boundaries and the chapter concludes with a discussion about boundary-making skills.</p>

                        <span class="heading-text">ASSERTIVENESS</span>
                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Assertive communication is the key to communicating important messages to others (Fig. 6.1). It also helps individuals to stand up for their rights and, when appropriate, the rights of others (e.g. advocacy). As a practitioner within a professional team, using assertiveness skills is an essential component of working in a proficient manner. There are a number of key principles that describe the concept of assertiveness. Essentially, these principles identify types of behaviour, attitudes and feelings that influence how we interact with others. Rakos (1991) provides a thorough discussion of the various theoretical perspectives that underpin assertiveness.</p>
                        <p>Assertive messages are clear, succinct and respect the self-esteem of the person being addressed, as well as that of the speaker. Such messages may be used to articulate an opinion that is different from that of the majority, reveal a lack of knowledge or skill, or express a concern. There is a risk to the individual's self-esteem, however, that the other person(s) might not respect this information and that the response might be aggressive or dismissive. The underlying philosophical belief regarding assertive behaviour is that of 'I'm OK - you're OK' (Harris 2004, Berne 1975).</p>
                        <p>Using assertive behaviour in the form of clear and focused communication can enhance the quality of our personal and professional relationships. Assertive behaviour might not always be the most appropriate response; e.g. where there might be a high risk of personal injury, a passive or manipulative approach might be best. Assertive behaviour might be difficult for an individual for a number of reasons, including cultural norms, lack of information, lack of awareness, lack of support or lack of appropriate skills.</p>
                        <p>The preferred style for handling conflict and decision-making varies across cultures. Those from individualist cultures (see Ch. 1) were found to use strategies that maximized their own interests at the expense of others, while those from collectivist cultures used a negotiating style that took the interests of others into account (Oetzel 1995, Witte & Morrison 1995). In collectivist cultures harmonious relationships are considered essential and it might be felt to be inappropriate to place great emphasis on assertive behaviour, which by definition focuses on the individual. In addition, people from Asian cultures are identified as tending to prefer not to use the word 'no', therefore 'yes' might mean 'no' or 'perhaps'. It is therefore essential to seek clarity when in conversation, in order to ensure that information, instructions and implications have been understood. For an informed discussion on cultural factors that might affect the western principle of assertiveness, see Kim (1995) and Singelis (1994).</p>

                        <p>Paying attention, listening and minimizing fidgeting increase the impact of the communication (McFall et al 1982). An upright position with good eye contact is desirable; this means adopting intermittent and comfortable eye contact, which is neither a glare nor gives the appearance of staring. Body movements should be steady and smooth and an audible, clear and appropriately modulated tone of voice used. Fluency while speaking is a feature of effective assertive communication. Rakos (1991) found that the use of inflection, e.g. changing tone or placing emphasis on an important part of a statement, was also very effective. If you are highlighting a discrepancy or challenging an opinion, it might be useful to consider whether you are the best person to have this conversation and whether you and the other person are in a receptive frame of mind, physically and psychologically. For example if either of you have just finished a long shift, tiredness or fatigue might adversely affect perception, cognitive ability and/or reasoning.</p>
                        <p>In any given situation there are choices as to how one can respond. The style of responding can be passive, manipulative, assertive or aggressive. A brief explanation of these behaviours follows. (For a more detailed discussion, see Seaward 2009, Bond 1986, Paul 1985 and Dickson 1982). Examples of verbal responses from the different perspectives are provided in Box 6.1. In addition, analysis of transactions is facilitated by considering Berne's (1975) ego state model (parent, adult and child), a description of which appears in the glossary (Appendix 1). The different styles of responding available to us have both verbal and non-verbal characteristics, e.g. body language and tone of voice.</p>

                            <h4 class="callout-title"><span class="callout-icon"> </span>Box 6.1 Examples of verbal responses</h4>
                            <p>In the following responses, the same example has been used to illustrate the differences in verbal presentation. As well as the verbal statements that represent the various responses, you need to consider the body language, tone of voice and emphasis that may be used.<br>The nurse has just completed a ward round with a doctor. The doctor is about to leave the ward and has forgotten to request investigations for one of the patients that has been seen. The nurse wishes to draw this omission to the doctor's attention.</p>
                            <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Passive behaviour (I'm not OK - you're OK)</h4>
                            <p>The nurse's speech is high-pitched or quiet, there is minimal eye contact and the sentence lacks fluency and consistency. There is also some hesitancy.</p>
                            <p>Nurse: Doesn't say anything to the doctor, but complains to other colleagues about the doctor's inefficiency once the doctor has left the ward or<br>Nurse to doctor: 'I'm really sorry to bother you, I could be wrong, but did you want Mrs Jones to have an ECG. I wonder if you could possibly, er ... complete the request form?'</p>
                            <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Manipulative behaviour (I'm OK - you're not OK, but I'll let you think you are)</h4>
                            <p>The nurse speaks softly, possibly seductively or louder than the circumstance warrants. There is likely to be intermittent or continued eye contact and possibly reduced personal space. Once the task has been completed this personal space is likely to be increased.<br>Nurse to doctor: 'You're usually so good about these things, would you like me to get the request form for Mrs Jones ready for you to sign?'</p>
                            <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Aggressive behaviour (I'm OK - you're not OK)</h4>
                            <p>The nurse's body language might be very rigid or overactive, with the tone and speech short and abrupt, the statement perhaps being totally unexpected by the doctor. There might also be a hint of sarcasm and impatience. Eye contact might vary from a firm glare to none at all, signalling a disregard for the other person. The statement is more of a demand than a request.<br>Nurse: 'You've forgotten to complete the form for Mrs Jones. You doctors are always forgetting to do these things and we have to keep phoning you to come to the ward. Can you do it now please, and then we can send it off.'</p>
                            <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Assertive behaviour (I'm OK - you're OK)</h4>
                            <p>The nurse gains the doctor's attention and establishes eye contact. Speech is clear, fluent and non-accusatory, and the tone of voice is moderate.<br>Nurse: 'I think you've forgotten to write a form for Mrs Jones. Would you like to do it now or will you be coming back to the ward later to do it?'</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Passive behaviour</h3>
                        <p>This behaviour is based on a belief, that in a given situation we consider ourselves to be less worthy when compared with others. This might be because we do not feel as capable as the other person generally or in a given situation. In certain circumstances this might be the safest option; however if this is the general pattern of behaviour, it is likely that self-esteem is compromised and the individual is not living to their full potential. When this position is used, verbal presentation tends to include the use of long sentences that lack focus and contain statements that discount the value of the individual's opinion. There are also frequent apologies.</p>
                        <p>A major disadvantage of always communicating in this pattern is that others might interpret passive behaviour as a lack of interest or knowledge. This might lead to people becoming frustrated in trying to involve someone who does not appear to be interested or able to participate. Equally, people might believe that the person is incapable and therefore they might not be included in decision-making. Either way, passive individuals are left feeling less worthy than their colleagues, and fear, anger and/or sadness are common feelings and can lead to a self-fulfilling prophecy (see Appendix 1).</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Manipulative behaviour</h3>
                        <p>As children, we have all learnt different ways to get what we want. As adults, this might have developed to include encouraging others with the use of flattery or flirtation (which is not genuine) towards an action that meets our desired outcome. This activity is sometimes referred to as 'stroking someone's ego'. In a group, for example, this might result in an individual thinking that they have made a decision when what has actually happened was that they were coerced (unconsciously) into making the decision. This strategy will only work however if the other person is open or receptive to the 'hook' that has been dangled. In transactional analysis (e.g. Stewart 2007, Berne 1975), this could be referred to as an ulterior transaction.</p>
                        <p>A manipulative strategy may sometimes be used in order to 'save the face' of another person, who might otherwise feel embarrassed if their lack of knowledge or skill were exposed. One of the disadvantages of taking the responsibility for 'saving the face' of someone else might be that one's own knowledge and skills go unnoticed and resentment might build up. It also means that the person being manipulated does not get an opportunity to develop their knowledge and skills, if they are always being rescued. Feelings such as anger, guilt and embarrassment need to be taken into consideration before deciding whether or not to use this style of communicating in a given situation.</p>
                        <p>Manipulation can be considered a negative pattern of behaviour if the feelings and needs of the other person are disregarded, or if others are treated as objects to fulfil the needs of the manipulator. However, the use of a manipulative style of communication is the preferred way of interacting in some cultures. This is not seen as a means of deceiving another person, rather a manner of approach that is less direct than in western cultures.</p>
                        <p>One way of assessing the style of communication is to consider whether or not the thoughts and feelings of the other person have been taken into account. It may be appropriate to provide feedback to the sender of a message about the impact of their style of communication in order to make them aware of its effect on you.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Aggressive behaviour</h3>
                        <p>When we interact from this position, we have assumed that our rights are the only ones that matter; we will also find it difficult to acknowledge any mistakes that we have made, since this is a position of superiority in comparison with others. Fear, anger and anxiety might be the underlying feelings that result in verbally attacking others, using sarcasm, employing threatening tones and blaming. While responding in this way might be a one-off, repeated experiences and observations by patients and other members of the team might result in a tense working environment and strained communications.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Assertive behaviour</h3>
                        <p>This perspective acknowledges the rights and responsibilities of oneself and others, as well as the strengths and weaknesses that are a part of being human. Communication is open, honest and personalized; and compromise and negotiation are key features of the interactions. The main advantages of communicating in this style are that individuals experience the satisfaction of expressing themselves as well as listening to the needs of others. However, individuals who have a preference for communicating in any of the above ways might find it frustrating (the manipulator), frightening (the passive person) and irritating (the aggressor) when in communication with an assertive person. This is because they are likely to be offered the opportunity to discuss and negotiate their concerns in an understanding manner. For example, imagine trying to maintain an argument with someone who is demonstrating an understanding of your concern and offering to help solve the problem.</p>
                        <p>Assertive communication skills are used to express one's thoughts, feelings, needs, wants, beliefs and opinions and, while focused on oneself, an integral part of assertiveness is the recognition that others also have the right to do the same. Negotiation and compromise are therefore key features of being assertive. Box 6.1 gives examples of different verbal responses.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Being assertive to ensure patient safety</h3>
                        <p>There is a patient in the recovery area who has had an invasive procedure. You have agreed to collect them. Having received a handover from the nurse or midwife, you are unhappy to take the patient back to the ward.</p>
                        <p>Some issues raised by this scenario:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>As a registered nurse or midwife you will be expected to collect patients or women following procedures that require sedation, general or local anaesthetic.</li>
                            <li>There might be occasions when you do not feel competent to undertake this activity. Patient and client safety might be compromised if you accept a task for which you are not adequately prepared. It is therefore essential that you inform the appropriate person if this is the case. The Nursing and Midwifery Council (2008a) in the UK outlines practitioners' responsibilities to those in their care by stating that they must be competent to practice and have been educated and trained for the purpose of their professions.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Specific principles</h4>
                        <p>Strategies to consider in such situations include: how to say 'no'; how to negotiate an alternative; how to use effective self-disclosure; and the importance of using all senses to gather information.</p>
                        <p>Prior to collecting a patient following a procedure, ensure that you are familiar with the condition the patient is likely to be in, on return to the ward. Ensure that the bed area the patient will return to is prepared and any equipment that is needed is available, assembled and in working order. You might need to take equipment with you to ensure the person's comfort and safety during the journey back to the ward. For example, a receiver, airway and swabs or tissues might be useful if the person in your care is feeling nauseous or if they wish to expectorate. Specific equipment such as an abduction wedge pillow (following total hip replacement) or clip removers might also be required. Check the local policy.</p>
                        <p>Gather appropriate information from the staff member who has asked you to collect the patient (e.g. patient details, the procedure performed), particularly if you are not familiar with the person and the procedure.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Preparation of self</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>What is the basis of your concern? Do you have factual information (e.g. vital signs, visual observations, etc.) or is this an intuitive feeling? (Atkinson & Claxton 2000)</li>
                            <li>How are you going to get the information necessary to allay or confirm your concern? For example, what are the person's vital signs? What information do your visual and aural observations give you about the amount of drainage, colour of the patient, breathing pattern and respiratory sounds? (Reed 2003)</li>
                            <li>Do you have sufficient information to ensure clarity of the statement you intend to make? If not, consider using open, closed and open focused questions to get the information that you need.</li>
                            <li>It might also be appropriate to ask yourself what the implications might be if you decide not to be assertive in this situation.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Environment</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>It is important to take time to consider the appropriateness of the environment in relation to the conversation that you intend to have. While the person's eyes may not be open, the sense of hearing is the first to return following an anaesthetic and they may become anxious if they overhear your concerns.</li>
                            <li>How close are the other patients in the recovery area? How are you going to maintain confidentiality during this conversation?</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Putting it into practice</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>If you consider that some of the information you have received is inconsistent, or you cannot make the necessary links between what you are being told and what you observe the person's condition to be, seek clarification in a non-accusatory way. For example:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Recovery Practitioner: 'The wound was oozing quite a bit but I have changed the dressing and the patient is fine now.'</li>
                                    <li>Registered Nurse/Midwife: 'Yes, the wound does appear dry, but the patient looks very pale to me. What exactly is her blood pressure now?'</li>

                            <li>It is essential to consider what you want to say and do and how you are going to say and do it. Consider your body language and tone of voice so that you do not appear uncooperative or defensive.</li>
                            <li>It is important to ensure that you are putting your views across but not imposing them. Negotiation and compromise might be used thus:<br>'I think you've given me a full handover but I'm still not happy to take this patient back to the ward now. Would it be alright for me to come back in say, half an hour, or shall I call a more experienced nurse to collect the patient?'<br>Rather than: 'No, I'm not taking the patient back to the ward because I don't think she's well enough.'</li>
                            <li>If you are inexperienced with regard to collecting patients with a particular piece of equipment or following a specific procedure, for example, you should make this known and seek help from a more experienced practitioner.</li>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>According to Honey (2001), negotiation involves clarifying what is wanted (the ideal) and the minimum that is acceptable for both parties (the bottom line). An example of this is that your mentor meets with you at the end of each shift to discuss your experiences (ideal). The minimum that would be acceptable (the bottom line) is that you meet twice a week to discuss your learning experiences, while other qualified nurses contribute to your learning. In the practice situation, referring to the learning outcomes for the placement and being familiar with the opportunities available can help you structure your discussion and negotiate appropriate learning experiences.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Being assertive with your mentor</h3>
                        <p>You are due to have a meeting with your mentor and you are unhappy about some aspects of the relationship and your general experience of being mentored by them.</p>
                        <p>Some issues raised by this scenario:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Expressing your needs and wants</li>
                            <li>Giving constructive feedback</li>
                            <li>Negotiating a desired outcome.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Specific principles</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Being able to work alongside an experienced practitioner is an essential component of an effective practice placement. The Nursing and Midwifery Council (2008b) identifies that a minimum of 40% of the student's clinical experience should be under the direct/indirect supervision of a mentor; this includes an additional hour per week for final year students to be spent with their sign-off mentor. A mentor can act as a role model and enable students to achieve their potential and develop appropriate skills. As you advance through your professional programme, the style of mentorship that will enable you to reach your potential will change. In addition, if you are a midwifery student who is qualified as a registered nurse, there will be skills with which you are already familiar and might therefore need less explanation than someone who has had less exposure to them. You (the mentee) will need to negotiate with your mentors to ensure that they provide effective and appropriate support. If this is not already in place, it would be a good idea to arrange initial, interim and final meetings with your mentor to ensure that your experience continues to meet the outcomes of the placement.</li>
                            <li>It can be helpful to have prepared beforehand a written list of issues that you can take to the meeting and which you would like to discuss with your mentor.</li>
                            <li>Ideally, the mentorship relationship should be explored and negotiated as near to the beginning of the placement as possible.</li>
                            <li>Where discussion of the mentorship relationship does not take place, is one-sided and you are not involved in a collaborative way, or is based on an assumption of your needs, there is likely to be dissatisfaction.</li>
                            <li>Preferred styles of mentorship and supervision need to be explored, and strategies for achieving the ideal need to be identified. If there are any obstacles that might affect this, these need to be addressed, e.g. the availability of a co-mentor if your mentor is on night duty or annual/study leave.</li>
                            <li>The conversation also needs to include the frequency and location of subsequent meetings to discuss your learning experience.</li>
                            <li>While there will always be variation within cultures, where the mentors or mentees come from collectivist cultures (see Ch. 1), there might be a belief that the person seen as the authority figure will offer help without being asked, and a type of dependent relationship may exist (McNamara & Harris 1997). In contrast, the general expectation from an individualistic perspective will be that the mentee will be self-directed and will seek assistance as required. Where mentor and mentee share a similar understanding of how the relationship will operate, there will be a greater sense of satisfaction.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Preparation of self</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Reflect upon what you think is working well and what could be improved.</li>
                            <li>Identify what you consider to be your responsibility and that of your mentor, since this might form the basis of the negotiation in your meeting. Using Boud et al's (1985) model of reflection (see Ch. 2) or others such as Gibbs (1989) or Johns (2002), might be helpful.</li>
                            <li>You will need to consider what is the bottom line for you, remembering that it needs to be reasonable.</li>
                            <li>Consider the nature of the feedback you might be given regarding your performance in the placement thus far. How do you think you might respond to it?</li>
                            <li>How are you going to present your concerns? What supporting examples do you have?</li>
                            <li>Consulting the link lecturer or your personal tutor before and/or after the meeting might be a supportive strategy.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Environment</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The best time to discuss the mentorship relationship would be during one of the scheduled meetings. The location should be private, where there is less chance of interruptions.</li>
                            <li>If meetings have not been arranged, have been cancelled or an urgent situation has arisen, an appropriate time and place need to be chosen to remind the mentor that a discussion is required. It is your responsibility to remind them if necessary.</li>
                            <li>As well as alerting the mentor to the fact that you have something you would like to discuss with them, this also facilitates negotiation.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Putting it into practice</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Attract your mentor's attention and state that you would like to discuss your placement, and that you would like to arrange a time to meet. The time between this initial contact and the actual meeting can allow space for both parties to prepare themselves to be constructive.</li>
                            <li>Based on your earlier reflective activity, summarize your experience on the ward.</li>
                            <li>When giving feedback to the mentor about your experience of the relationship, be clear and specific about your perspective (Seaward 2009). Remember to highlight those areas where the mentor has been helpful, as well as those where things could have been better for you. For example: 'I felt really welcomed when you showed me around the ward on my first day, but now we never seem to be on the same shift and I have not had the chance to work with or speak to you since then.'</li>
                            <li>Avoid generalizations, such as 'everybody's unhappy here', unless you have been asked to speak on behalf of others. Instead, provide constructive feedback that 'owns' your experience by using 'I' statements. For example: 'I realize that this ward is busy and that the staff work very hard, but I'm very unhappy here because no-one seems to have time for me. I'm often left on my own to manage, and I'm not always sure of what I'm doing.'</li>
                            <li>In providing the mentor with this feedback, the skills of empathic understanding (see Ch. 4) and self-disclosure (see Appendix 1) might be used.</li>
                            <li>You might choose to tell your mentor how you have been getting on while on the placement, about your experience of mentorship with them and check to see if they have a similar perception to you.</li>
                            <li>Alternatively, you can invite your mentor to give feedback about your performance on the ward and how they think the mentorship relationship is progressing.</li>
                            <li>When receiving feedback, aim to suspend any judgements until you have heard all of the information, even when you feel anxious about what you might be told; otherwise an ineffective defensive response might result. Honey (2001) suggests that the problem, not the person, should be addressed.</li>
                            <li>Additional skills to be employed in the discussion are open and open focused questions, paraphrasing, silence and summarizing. This last skill is particularly valuable during the conversation, since it can help ensure you have heard the key points. It is also useful at the end of a conversation to confirm any actions that have been recommended or agreed.</li>
                            <li>Take time to consider your response and agree or disagree as appropriate. It might be helpful to ask for examples if there are areas where you disagree with the feedback. A compromise might be to agree or to disagree on a particular aspect.</li>
                            <li>Equally, it is reasonable to ask the mentor for specific examples of your good practice and areas for development, encouraging them to include solutions for areas of concern.</li>
                            <li>It is essential that you raise any points that the mentor has not included, but that you consider to be important.</li>
                            <li>Identifying a plan of action and a date and time to review the agreed activities would be a good conclusion to this meeting.</li>
                            <li>After having attended a meeting, it is beneficial to reflect on what happened in the meeting, your contributions, and the extent to which it met your needs.</li>

                            <li>How did you feel during the meeting?</li>
                            <li>How did your thoughts, feelings and behaviour change throughout the situation?</li>
                            <li>To what extent did you achieve any personal aims for attending to the situation or meeting?</li>
                            <li>What did you learn about the other person's perspective on the situation?</li>
                            <li>How did their perceptions differ from your own? How might you explain this difference?</li>
                            <li>What helps you to remain focused during discussions and meetings?</li>
                            <li>If you were to have another meeting or discussion (with your mentor), what would you do differently?</li>
                            <li>Having considered this scenario, what have you learnt that will help you in this and future placements?</li>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Being an advocate for your patient</h3>
                        <p>While on your placement you are spending the morning observing an interdisciplinary meeting. During the meeting a course of action has been suggested for one of the patients you have been looking after, and you are certain that she would not agree with what is being suggested.</p>
                        <p>Main issues raised by this scenario:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Expressing your beliefs and opinions.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Specific principles</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Advocacy is concerned with the promotion and protection of the interests of patients and is a key part of the practitioner's role. When acting as an advocate it is essential to consult the patient or client whenever possible to ensure that their wishes are being represented. There might of course be situations when this is not possible, e.g. where the patient is unconscious. In such a situation, the Nursing and Midwifery Council Code of Conduct should be followed (Nursing and Midwifery Council 2008a).</li>
                            <li>At times it might be difficult to be assertive, particularly if you feel that your status in the organization is less valuable than that of the person you wish to address regarding your concern. Lack of assertiveness might also result if you feel that expressing your opinion might not lead to your desired outcome. While this might be the case, expressing your thoughts and opinions signals that you are actively engaged in what is happening. Expressing your opinion might also serve to highlight areas others might not have considered.</li>
                            <li>In one's personal life, there might be a preference for responding to situations in a particular way, e.g. passive behaviour; however as a healthcare professional there will be occasions when you need to speak up on behalf of the patient or client. This might involve, e.g. representing their thoughts and feelings while at a meeting.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Preparation of self</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Consider the proposal that is being put forward. How does this relate to what you know about the patient's or client's thoughts and feelings?</li>
                            <li>What other information do you need before you express your concern or opinion?</li>
                            <li>Are you the best person to raise this concern, or do you need the support of a more experienced practitioner?</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Environment</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Is this the appropriate time and place to raise your concern? It might be that only one member of the team needs to be consulted; this could reduce any anxiety that you might have.</li>
                            <li>It might be something that could be raised during the ward report rather than at the meeting.</li>
                            <li>Is the meeting one where there is free exchange of information?</li>
                            <li>Think of an example to support your concern and mentally construct your intervention.</li>
                            <li>Keep it clear and concise.</li>

                            <li>Wait for an appropriate pause in the discussion.</li>
                            <li>Sit slightly forward and establish eye contact with the person chairing the meeting or the person who last spoke about the area you wish to address. Take two deep breaths and continue to breathe, don't hold your breath and keep both feet firmly on the ground.</li>
                            <li>Indicate that you have something to say; pay attention to your body language and ensure that your hands are in a relaxed position.</li>
                            <li>Monitor the tone of your voice and speak clearly, fluently and concisely, placing emphasis as appropriate.</li>
                            <li>Listen carefully to any comments and feedback.</li>
                            <li>Clarify and correct any responses that other members of the team might have made in response to your statement.</li>
                            <li>Remember that the team might not agree with you, but you have raised the concern and they can now discuss it with the patient or their family.</li>

                        <p>In situations where you might have been anxious about expressing your opinion, it is useful to spend time exploring your contributions to the situation, so that you can build on the skills that can be used in the future.</p>

                        <p>Where we stand in relation to those in our care and our colleagues, is defined by professional boundaries or limits. Boundaries provide containment and physical and psychological safety for practitioners and those with whom they work. Boundaries also ensure that unnecessary intrusions are avoided, i.e. they clarify the extent and limits of professional practice. A sound example of a formal boundary is the law requiring nurses and midwives to meet clearly identified standards of knowledge and skill before they can register with the Nursing and Midwifery Council (2008b). This aims to ensure the safety of the public when using the nursing service (The Nurses', Midwives' and Health Visitors Act 1997). The successful management of boundaries is essential to the making, maintaining and ending of effective professional relationships.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Specific principles</h3>
                        <p>There are a number of principles that apply to the making and maintenance of professional boundaries. Boundaries can be explicit, e.g. the use of formal titles in the workplace instead of first names; or implicit, e.g. the setting-aside of a specific chair for the team leader at meetings without anyone saying this is the case, until an uninformed newcomer sits in it. The more explicit boundaries are, the easier it is for us to be clear of our roles and responsibilities in any given situation, and for colleagues and patients to understand what to expect and where individuals' responsibilities lie. Where boundaries are unclear, confusion can result and the task of care delivery will be lost in any resulting muddle.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Roles</h4>
                        <p>Effective working partnerships are based on mutual respect, which is supported by clear definitions of each other's role and limits to that role - whether a patient, client, family member or practitioner. In order to clarify roles and relationships, it is important to ensure that those with whom we work are aware of who we are and what we are there to do, i.e. the focus of professional practice, at any given time. It is also important that we ourselves and those with whom we are working are clear about these issues, as well as how they fit in with the task of the organization in which we work (Roberts 1994).</p>
                        <p>Healthcare professionals cross many established social boundaries by virtue of the intimate physical and emotional nature of their work. It is important, therefore, that we understand the crucial nature of boundaries to ensure the dignity and comfort of those in our care. Professional colleagues also need to know the purpose of our practice, our expertise and the limits to our skills. We demonstrate our capacity to make and maintain boundaries by our verbal and non-verbal skills, e.g. by introducing ourselves and stating our role, such as staff nurse/midwife, or by wearing a tidy uniform. Boundary-making skills are closely allied to assertiveness skills, because stating and demonstrating limits, need unambiguous verbal and non-verbal statements of who we are and what our roles and limits are. This means we need to use assertive verbal and non-verbal skills (see above).</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Boundary-making skills</h4>
                        <p>Sully (2003) identified a number of skills involved in making and maintaining boundaries. Self-awareness of feelings, thoughts and actions as well as the limits to our own responsibilities and abilities is required, as well as skills in negotiating explicit working contracts, including the limits to the situation or relationship, e.g. clarifying the task at hand, others' responsibilities, time and working environment.</p>
                        <p>Assertive language and non-verbal skills are required, e.g. saying 'no' clearly (Clark 2003, Ch. 4) and having an assertive as opposed to aggressive or submissive posture; agreeing and keeping to time limits, such as stating the time and duration of an interview with a client or relatives and keeping to this decision. The observation of process skills is important, e.g. raising what you observe is happening or has happened in a particular incident to keep task-focused or to clarify what has actually been happening. Active listening and immediacy skills (addressing the here-and-now) are required, as is empathy (seeing the situation from the other person's point of view), as opposed to identification with the others and the situation. This means 'being with' someone in distress (Benner 2001: 50) but not allowing any intense feelings of your own, evoked by their situation, to confuse your thoughts and actions.</p>
                        <p>Problem-solving and decision-making skills are required, as are skills in leaving the issue behind, e.g. by choosing to do so, changing clothes, not discussing the issues outside a given time limit, or informally, by changing activities then or later. The effective use of professional supervision, where exploration of practice and constructive feedback and support can be sought and given, is also important. Box 6.2 provides examples of some common boundaries.</p>

                                <li><strong>Hierarchy</strong> enables the practitioner to refer to those more senior such as the Patch Manager for guidance, or indeed to make a final decision; and to act as a support or guide to someone junior, such as the staff nurse to the student</li>
                                <li><strong>Uniform</strong> identifies each practitioner's role and status, clarifying what can and cannot be reasonably expected of the practitioner. This effectively limits and contains the individual's practice and helps ensure the recipient can identify the practitioner's social and professional role</li>
                                <li><strong>Codes of conduct</strong> clarify what is and is not acceptable practice. They should safeguard the public and support practitioners by stating clearly their responsibilities</li>
                                <li><strong>Terms of address:</strong> these set boundaries, e.g. by ensuring formality in a situation that could be embarrassing. An example of this is the consultant gynaecologist who addresses his patients, with whom he was on firstname terms, as 'madam' during a vaginal examination</li>
                                <li><strong>Contracts of employment:</strong> these agreements stipulate the responsibilities of employers as well as employees, thus providing a framework for practice and due reward and the processes to follow when the agreement is violated</li>
                                <li><strong>Time:</strong> stating the specific amount of time you have available to work with patients ensures that they know when the appointment with you will end. This can provide a sense of security, particularly for people facing frightening procedures</li>
                                <li><strong>Space</strong> by its nature contains and/or limits activity. For example, it is necessary to have enough space around a patient's bed to employ a hoist</li>
                                <li><strong>Environment:</strong> certain activities can only occur in certain places such as operating theatres.</li>

                        <p>You are going on a community visit with the health visitor. You are aware that you need to be appropriately dressed, but are unsure of the dress code.</p>
                        <p>Some issues raised by this scenario:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The need to consider the nature of the work you will be doing in the placement</li>
                            <li>The importance of considering the impact that your dress might have on the people with whom you will be working - both colleagues and clients</li>
                            <li>The variety of tasks you might be undertaking and how this might influence your choice of clothing</li>
                            <li>In the community you are likely to encounter situations in clients' homes that are unfamiliar to you.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Specific principles</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>It is important to consider not only what image you want to present, but also the cultural diversity of the community. It is important to wear clothes that will not cause offence to people of different ages, genders and cultures.</li>
                            <li>It is advisable to clarify with your supervisor or the placement manager what dress code is expected.</li>
                            <li>The nature of the work you will be doing each day, e.g. visiting patients or clients in their homes, assisting in a Child Health Clinic, or working in a Day Unit, will inform you about what clothes are appropriate for the tasks you are likely to undertake.</li>
                            <li>If you are likely to be working in a variety of different and possibly unfamiliar environments, it is advisable to wear clothes that are modest, comfortable and inexpensive but professional.</li>
                        </ul>

                            <li>What are your feelings, thoughts and actions in relation to this situation?</li>
                            <li>What working contract have you negotiated with the health visitor; e.g. place, date and time of meeting? What are you expected to do during the visit?</li>
                            <li>How assertive can you be in order to clarify what is expected of you?</li>
                            <li>Do you know how long the visit is likely to take? What will you do if the visit extends over the time agreed, or if the health visitor has to alter the arrangements?</li>
                            <li>Clothes need to be appropriate for the situation and task. What sort of clothes are you considering wearing? A useful aide mémoire is: LHSLT. Appropriate clothes are: not too low, not too high, not too short, not too long, not too tight.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <ul>
                            <li>When working in the community, it is not always possible to have much control over the environment, as much of the practice goes on in private homes. However, it is crucial that nurses and midwives can state clearly their needs for as suitable an environment as possible for carrying out their duties in environments where they have no formal control; e.g. ensuring they have the correct equipment for weighing a baby or moving and handling.</li>
                            <li>What do you know about the community in which you will be visiting, its general health, social mix and customs? Have you clarified whether or not you are visiting a home or community where there is a strict dress code such as keeping your upper arms covered?</li>
                        </ul>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Contact the health visitor by telephone or face-to-face. This personal contact supports the establishment of a working rapport. Clarify the purpose of the visit, where it is likely to happen and ask about the dress code.</li>
                            <li>Ensure you know when and where you are to meet and whether you are likely to be walking or using some form of transport.</li>
                            <li>Ask the health visitor whether what you intend to wear is appropriate in that community.</li>
                            <li>Dress neatly with clean clothes and shoes. Ensure the length of your trousers or skirts is formal and thus demonstrates professionalism. Do not wear clothes with political slogans or risqué jokes.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>Reflect on a situation from your nursing or midwifery experience when you have needed to clarify a boundary about dress at work.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>How did you feel when you decided to take the initiative and clarify the boundary of appropriate dress?</li>
                            <li>How did the person you asked respond to your taking this initiative?</li>
                            <li>What effect did their response have on your discussions about appropriate dress?</li>
                            <li>How much influence did different cultural expectations have on your choice of dress?</li>
                            <li>How will what you have learnt from this situation affect the development of your communication skills?</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Using humour to make a polite refusal</h3>
                        <p>A client who is being discharged asks you to come out for a drink that evening to celebrate 'newfound freedom'.</p>
                        <p>Some issues raised by this scenario:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The relationship between nurse and patient, or midwife and woman, is one of unequal power.</li>
                            <li>Patients and pregnant women or those who have newly delivered their babies are vulnerable. A consequence of this might be that they seek ways to overcome the power imbalance by trying to set up social situations where they can be in control. This might be precipitated by a change in their health status or situation, such as when they are being discharged and therefore feel more able to assert their autonomy.</li>
                            <li>The client might be seeking a relationship with you that is social and/ or possibly sexual. Accepting this offer would be inappropriate as your relationship is formal and based on the understanding (stated or not) that you will not abuse the power you have had entrusted to you.</li>
                            <li>There is also the issue of your vulnerability, e.g. to unfounded allegations of accepting social benefits or encouraging sexual advances, or to having your privacy violated by being waited for outside the hospital or health centre and followed home.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Preparation of self</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>What are your feelings, thoughts and actions in relation to this situation?</li>
                            <li>If you are likely to feel uncomfortable, embarrassed or offended, how may this affect your ability to respond with humour?</li>
                            <li>Think of light-hearted terms that could be used in response to the patient's or woman's own terminology, e.g. the use of the word 'freedom' could elicit a response using the word 'escaping'.</li>
                            <li>How much time have you spent working with this client? How well do you know them? Would you both enjoy a laugh together?</li>
                            <li>What are your responsibilities as a practitioner to maintain professional boundaries? How do you regard this in relation to socializing with patients, women and carers?</li>
                            <li>How assertive can you be in order to draw the professional boundaries here, while using a light-hearted response?</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Environment</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Where is this situation likely to occur? It is probably in the ward or Outpatients Department if you work in a hospital, but it could be a rehabilitation centre or a specialist clinic, or mother and baby unit.</li>
                            <li>Where is it best to address this crossed boundary? How much control over the environment do you have?</li>
                            <li>While it is essential to be respectful, in the interests of a sound therapeutic relationship and the maintenance of your client's dignity, you also need to consider your potential vulnerability to having your response to this invitation misconstrued. Avoid dealing with it where you cannot be seen and/or heard by other members of staff.</li>
                            <li>It is preferable to deal with this situation in a public place where you can both be seen, e.g. with the bed or cubicle curtains drawn open.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Putting the skills into practice</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Adopt an assertive stance - not too close in proximity (this might be interpreted as aggressive or collusive) but upright and relaxed.</li>
                            <li>Look directly at the client, bearing in mind possible cultural and gender differences in understanding non-verbal cues.</li>
                            <li>Draw the boundary by stating a clear but polite refusal, offering a lighthearted response.</li>
                            <li>Use humour, but recognize the client's need to celebrate this event.</li>
                            <li>Link your response to what the patient has said by using the assertive skill of restating or paraphrasing their words. This demonstrates empathy in that you have heard how they have experienced their situation, e.g. this client sounded as if they found a stay in hospital or the unit particularly restrictive.</li>
                            <li>Avoid put-downs and rude comments. You could say: 'So you're escaping at last! You must be looking forward to going home. A drink is a good way to celebrate with your friends and family. I'm afraid I can't join you, but have a great time!'</li>
                        </ul>
