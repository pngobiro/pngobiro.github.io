                        </h2>
                        <p>Compassion is at the heart of nursing and midwifery practice (Royal College of Nursing 2008). In order to communicate this value, practitioners need to be responsive to the social, psychological, emotional and spiritual as well as physical needs of those in their care. The practitioner-client relationship is central to the delivery of care. By the sensitive use of verbal and non-verbal skills, we can offer the core conditions of all therapeutic relationships to patients and clients - warmth and respect, empathetic understanding, openness and genuineness (Rogers 1957) (see also Ch. 1). For these reasons, we need to develop our emotional intelligence so that we are self-aware, aware of the needs of those in our care, and aware of the circumstances in which we are involved. Golman (1998: 317) describes emotional intelligence as, 'the capacity for recognizing our own feelings and those of others, for motivating ourselves, and managing emotions well in ourselves and in our relationships'.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Sundeen et al (1998) identify the components of the nurse-client relationship as:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Valuing:</strong> recognizing one's own values and respecting others' values</li>
                            <li><strong>Trust:</strong> a sense that others are able to assist in a time of distress</li>
                            <li><strong>Empathy:</strong> the capacity to be with a client and perceive accurately her or his feelings, experience and meaning</li>
                            <li><strong>Caring or love:</strong> unconditional acceptance of the other as she or he is</li>
                            <li><strong>Hope:</strong> the expectation of good in the future while recognizing the uncertainty of the future</li>
                            <li><strong>Autonomy and mutuality:</strong> the ability to be self-determining as well as sharing with others.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>When we respond compassionately to those in our care we recognize their need for comfort, and we are able to do so because we have an empathetic understanding of their needs.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Empathy</h3>
                        <p>Empathy is often defined as putting yourself in someone else's shoes. In this position, however, you ensure that the other person will go barefoot! This means they are disadvantaged and their autonomy could be compromised by our taking over their situation, even although we are trying to be compassionate and caring. Empathy is therefore better described as being alongside those in our care in order to be sensitive to their 'feelings', 'experience' and 'meanings' (Sundeen et al 1998: Ch. 5). Benner (2001: 70) describes this as 'The nurse is with the patient without fusing her [sic] own boundaries, selfhood, or integrity. Nurses are not endangered by the patient's perceptions or behavior' (Benner 2001: 70, original italics).</p>
                        <p>As empathy requires us to be self-aware and self-regulating, it is important that when we reflect-in and on-action we use our own emotions to help, rather than hinder, our abilities to address effectively the situations in which we are currently involved (see Ch. 2). As a result of unconscious psychological processes in people's motivation and relationships, particularly the transference relationship (i.e. unconscious responses to others as if they were significant people from our past), lack of awareness can prompt inappropriate responses to others, to the feelings others and the situations evoke in us (see Ch. 1). Self-awareness and self-regulation can enable us to learn from experience and develop our personal and professional skills, in order to be empathetic and offer comfort more sensitively.</p>
                        <p>Arguably, these principles apply in all healthcare, in that we work with people in need, they come to us when they are vulnerable - physically and/or emotionally and they ask for our professional involvement at a time of significance to them.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Comfort</h3>
                        <p>Comfort means: 'Relief or support in mental distress or affliction; consolation, solace, soothing' (Oxford English Dictionary 1989 Online). Christensen (1993: 116-117) describes part of the work of the nurse as 'attending', that is, being present, ministering, listening, comforting; she also describes 'enabling' those in our care as integral to giving comfort. In attending, we can offer comfort by using our empathy to inform our communication in nursing and midwifery practice. We soothe and console by our informed and sensitive use of verbal and non-verbal skills.</p>
                        <p>The scenarios in this chapter are presented to illustrate how practitioners might develop their communication skills further, in order to give empathy and comfort while carrying out their work. The specific skills that are explored here include: paraphrasing skills; the appropriate use of touch; awareness of cultural differences in the expression of distress; ensuring privacy and dignity; and providing emotional support when those we care for are experiencing intense feelings such as fear, anger and pain.</p>

                <section id="principles" class="content-section" aria-labelledby="section-heading-principles">
                    <h2 id="section-heading-principles" class="section-heading">
                        <span class="heading-icon"> </span>
                        <span class="heading-text">PRINCIPLES</span>
                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>In order to demonstrate empathy and to offer comfort, we need to consider a number of principles. When our words are congruent with our non-verbal and paralinguistic communication, others are more likely to experience us as genuine and open because we are less likely to be giving mixed messages. The skills addressed below should always be used in a relationship of respect and concern. If they are used as 'clever tricks' to pretend that we are listening in order to cover up our unwillingness to help with someone's problems, we are likely to be unsuccessful at offering empathy and comfort and, at worst, could cause offence or hurt.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Self-awareness</h3>
                        <p>People in distress or need can be very dependent on those who care for them. The practitioner-client relationship is, by its very nature, intimate (Kadner 1994). Nurses and midwives are allowed into emotional, physical and spiritual places where few others, except perhaps the most important people in clients' lives, are welcome. In order to avoid exploiting, however unintentionally, the power this gives us, we need to be very aware of the privilege we are granted by being there with people at significant times in their lives. It is therefore essential that we are prepared, throughout our professional lives, to develop our self-awareness, reflect on our work and maintain the humility that enables us to learn from practice.</p>
                        <p>The core conditions of helping (warmth and acceptance, empathy, openness and genuineness) are fundamental to all compassionate and trusting professional relationships. The capacity to 'be with' (Benner 2001: 50) those in our care, demands that we listen attentively to both their words and their non-verbal cues, e.g. choice of words, posture or physical signs, or paralinguistic changes such as tone of voice.</p>
                        <p>Demonstrating this ability takes skill and reflection-in-action and reflection-on-action (see Ch. 2). Being aware of our own thoughts, feelings and behaviour while we listen, without being distracted by them, can help us to perceive empathetically what clients are trying to convey, even when they do not have the language or capacity to say it explicitly (see Ch. 7). This ability to listen to ourselves and use our inner processes to inform our practice is described by Casement (1985) as the 'internal supervisor'.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Listening</h3>
                        <p>By listening attentively, we shut out extraneous noise and distractions, put aside our own perceptions and thus demonstrate acceptance and respect for those we are with. It is important to choose our words carefully. Using language that is familiar to the patient and avoiding jargon can be very comforting to someone who feels distressed, overwhelmed or confused.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Touch and gestures</h3>
                        <p>Gestures need to be appropriate to the moment but account should always be taken of the person's age, culture, gender and ethnicity. Touching a person's hand when they are looking lost and frightened can be very comforting but in some cultures, men might find it intrusive and inappropriate if a woman does this (see Ch. 1).</p>
                        <p>In order to be genuine (see Ch. 1), it is important that we do not try to be all things to all people, e.g. by using language or gestures familiar to our clients, but that we would ordinarily find difficult or even offensive. Since we would not usually behave like this, it may seem insincere or incongruent.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Language and paraphrasing</h3>
                        <p>Developing a wide vocabulary is helpful if we are to be able to use the skills addressed below. A rich vocabulary enables us to think of alternative words when a client does not understand. Likewise, if we want to demonstrate we have heard accurately by paraphrasing, knowing a choice of synonyms can help us find the word that exactly describes the person's experience.</p>
                        <p>That we all bring our personal histories to each encounter influences how we use, as well as perceive, language. Some terms or descriptions that may be commonly used in practice can have very inappropriate connotations for the client and accompanying relatives. An example is instructing a client to position themselves 'on all fours with your bottom in the air', when they need to be in a semi-prone position with their hips higher than their shoulders, usually prior to an examination or treatment. The client is likely to be anxious about the procedure and this undignified position can exacerbate their distress. An alternative instruction could be: 'Please would you kneel, then lean forward and rest on your forearms, so that your hips are higher than your shoulders'. Using terminology that could, at least, be perceived as undignified and, at worst, possibly remind them of very distressing personal experiences such as physical or sexual abuse, can add to their stress and discomfort. Being sensitive to the possible implications of our instructions helps us to offer comfort empathetically, as well as to avoid eliciting distress, however unintentionally.</p>
                        <p>A warm and gently modulated voice is crucial if we are to demonstrate empathy and to offer comfort. Strident and loud tones are jarring, can be anxiety-provoking and may be perceived as disrespectful.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Body language</h3>
                        <p>Being aware of our body language is essential if we are to demonstrate empathy and offer comfort. People in distress can find that fidgeting or the enthusiastic 'doing' of tasks adds to their discomfort. In order to be there with them, and demonstrate we are listening, we need to be still and quiet. Lack of fidgeting increases the impact of our communication (McFall et al, 1982). It is also necessary to be aware that the position/location of your hands in relation to your body reveals a lot. If, for example, the practitioner or student stands with folded arms while the client is trying to communicate, this might suggest disinterest on the part of the practitioner or student.</p>

                <!-- START: paraphrasing-skills -->
                <section id="paraphrasing-skills" class="content-section" aria-labelledby="section-heading-paraphrasing-skills">

                        <span class="heading-text">Paraphrasing skills</span>
                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>A paraphrase is a shortened statement of what another has said or written. The meaning is not changed but the words are different. Bayne & Tschudin (1998) describe paraphrasing as having two parts: reflection of the spoken words and what is not said but implied.</p>
                        <p>The value of paraphrasing is that, through the use of this skill, we can demonstrate we are listening attentively and have heard what the other person is telling us. When a practitioner uses this skill, the client can feel supported and understood. Paraphrasing is also a sound way to check and clarify understanding without using questions, which can feel intrusive (see Ch. 5).</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Waiting with a patient</h3>
                        <p>You are waiting with a patient in the endoscopy waiting area. She has never been through this procedure before and looks very anxious. She says: 'It's odd, you know. I've had a number of operations and investigations, but they've always been with a general anaesthetic so I've not had to bother about what is going on. This is the first time I've had to be awake while they look inside me. It feels awful - as if I will be right there and involved but not able to do anything to keep control of myself.'</p>
                        <p>Some issues raised by this scenario:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>This patient has had considerable experience of medical investigations, but never without an anaesthetic. It would be understandable for practitioners to assume that someone with her history would not find yet another investigation any more anxiety-provoking than those she has had before, particularly as this one does not require the intervention and risk of an anaesthetic.</li>
                            <li>It is often at the last minute that people disclose their anxiety or distress. Time needs to be taken to listen to them and to respond empathetically. If necessary, procedures need to be delayed to ensure that the patient is fully conversant with what they are about to go through and their consent to the procedure remains valid.</li>
                            <li>It is important to explain to the patient that you will share her anxiety with the team so she does not have to worry about repeating it to them. This is important not only for the patient's emotional support but excessive anxiety can lead to physiological changes such as a significantly raised blood pressure. The team needs to be aware of her situation so they are able to decide whether they need to monitor her physiological state in a particular way, or approach the procedure differently, as well as being able to offer her appropriate comfort and support.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Specific principles</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The value of paraphrasing is that it demonstrates to clients that you have understood their story. Clients will tell you how supportive it feels to be heard accurately. Paraphrase demonstrates this and the client thus experiences an empathetic response from you. If, however, what you say is not exactly as the clients meant it, they are able to tell you again of their experience. By offering back what you have now understood by paraphrasing again, you can clarify with them exactly what it is they would like you to appreciate.</li>
                            <li>It is important to consider what exactly the patient is telling you. What is she anxious about? It might be lack of control during the procedure and perhaps fear of humiliation, or she might be frightened of pain or of what they might find.</li>
                            <li>In this situation the patient should not be rushed into the procedure if there is still any doubt about her awareness of what she is about to face and what the risks might be.</li>
                            <li>In order to help the patient to feel heard and supported at the end of the discussion, it is important, whenever possible, to summarize the conversation. This confirms what has been decided or considered and also demonstrates closure of the interaction, which contains the situation and can help the client to feel supported.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Note:</strong> A summary is longer than a paraphrase as it covers more content, but like a paraphrase, it addresses the significant issues and keeps the overall meaning of any interaction.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Preparation of self</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Consider what you think the patient might be telling you and what she might be feeling. Try to put these views to one side so they do not influence what you hear.</li>
                            <li>Think about what you have noticed about her paralinguistics. Has her voice suddenly become wavering or very soft? This might convey fear or that she is near to tears.</li>
                            <li>How will the time, place and manner in which the patient has told her story influence the language you choose and the tone of your voice?</li>
                            <li>Think about how you are feeling. You might feel apprehensive that the patient is about to change her mind about having the endoscopy and the fuss this might cause. You might feel under pressure to ensure that she goes ahead with the procedure as she has waited a long time for it; or you might be feeling that you need to get back to the ward and the patient's disclosure will delay this, as it complicates things. Try to put these feelings to one side so they do not influence what you hear.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Environment</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Waiting areas outside theatres can be noisy and busy. It is important therefore to ensure that you notice where you are placed. Ideally you will be positioned away from any thoroughfare in a quiet part of the room.</li>
                            <li>Consider where you will position yourself in relation to your patient. You need to be close enough for her to see you and for you to hear each other, but take care not to assume a proximity that might seem discourteous or intrusive.</li>
                            <li>If a porter is hovering in preparation to take the patient into the theatre, it might be necessary to ask for some privacy, as you want to talk to the patient. This would also indicate to her that time was being made for her.</li>
                        </ul>

                            <li>Position yourself where the patient can see and hear you, but ideally not where you can be overheard. Ensure that you are not standing over her and that you are at eye level with one another. If necessary, find something to sit on.</li>
                            <li>Paraphrase what she has said. You might say: 'You're wondering about what it will be like to be awake and involved for the first time during an investigation. The thought of being out of control is a bit frightening.'</li>
                            <li>Allow her to express her anxieties, and explore with her what would help her in this situation.</li>
                            <li>Once you have explored together what would be helpful for her in this situation (it might have been that she just needed to express her fears), demonstrate closure of the interaction by summarizing what has been significant to her and how you have agreed to help.</li>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">A distressing interlude</h3>
                        <p>A colleague, Peter, asks if he can talk to you about a situation in practice that he found distressing. You agree and make time to meet him. He says: 'Earlier today I was with a new physiotherapist when she worked with Miss Rushton, who has to learn how to walk again after her hip replacement. The whole process seemed so difficult for her. As she got out of bed I thought she was unnecessarily exposed and I was able to cover her by helping her put on her dressing gown. The physio then started to encourage Miss Rushton to walk. She was very frightened she'd fall again and grabbed on to the table and didn't want to let go. The physio was kind and encouraging, but didn't seem to understand why Miss Rushton was so anxious, although I tried to explain that this was the first time she had tried to walk since her fall. I didn't know how to help and felt very inadequate'.</p>
                        <p>Some issues raised by this scenario:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Peter has recognized the need to support and encourage Miss Rushton and how important teamwork is in this situation.</li>
                            <li>He seems to have a number of issues that concern him and his practice. He has asked you, as a colleague and a peer, for help to explore them.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Specific principles</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Peter is asking for peer supervision, i.e. the opportunity to explore this situation with someone where the relationship is between equals, as opposed to between individuals with differences in power and authority.</li>
                            <li>In this situation, Peter needs time to explore his experience. Agree to meet him when you have adequate time rather than rush the meeting.</li>
                            <li>Remember that discussing Peter's practice in this scenario will inevitably mean talking about the patient. Maintaining Miss Rushton's confidentiality is therefore essential. Where you agree to meet must therefore be private so your conversation is not overheard.</li>
                            <li>Miss Rushton's physical and emotional wellbeing are paramount. Being unaware of her reasons for being anxious, and therefore unempathetic in response to her fears, might lead to greater resistance to walking and could ultimately hinder her return to independent mobility. For example, she might fear that she will be discharged before she feels ready and able to cope.</li>
                            <li>It is important to consider how best to help Miss Rushton to find the courage to try to walk, without being inappropriately controlling or not being encouraging enough out of sympathy for her distress. Peter seems to be aware of this but hasn't said so explicitly.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <ul>
                            <li>The skilful use of paraphrase will enable him to feel supported by you. Use questions sparingly as these might sound as if you are interrogating him when he feels sensitive about his practice (see Ch. 5).</li>
                            <li>Paraphrasing can help Peter clarify his thoughts and feelings and consider options for future practice.</li>
                            <li>It is important to remember how affirmative non-verbal cues such as affirming nods, and sounds such as 'Mmm' can be encouraging to and perceived as supportive of the person telling their experiences.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Preparation of self</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Recognize that Peter is asking for support from you as an equal.</li>
                            <li>Consider what Peter's concerns might be, e.g. Miss Rushton's distress, his sense of inadequacy, the physiotherapist's seeming lack of empathy. Try to put these views to one side so they do not influence what you hear and how you respond.</li>
                            <li>Think about what you noticed in the way Peter first told you of his experience. Did he seem tense? What was the tone of his voice? Was he relaxed or did he fidget? What did his manner convey to you?</li>
                            <li>How did the time, place and manner in which he told you of his concerns influence your decision about how you would explore the issues with him?</li>
                            <li>Think about how you are feeling. You might well have been in a similar situation in the past. How might your experience influence how you respond to your colleague's concerns? Because you have been in a similar situation and it raises uncomfortable feelings for you, you might feel the need to soothe Peter's anxieties rather than enable him to explore them with you.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Environment</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Agree when, where and for how long you will meet.</li>
                            <li>It is important to find a room that is private and where you are not overheard and are unlikely to be disturbed (see Ch. 6). Ideally, the room is a space that has no particular affiliation for Peter or you, as this can influence subtly how each of you behaves.</li>
                            <li>Ensure that you are able to sit comfortably, as this is mutually respectful and encourages a more relaxed interaction.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Putting the skills into practice</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Before you meet, arrange the room so that you can both sit and are able to see and hear each other easily. Ensure, as far as possible, that you won't be disturbed.</li>
                            <li>Greet Peter with a smile and position yourself so you are in comfortable proximity to him and can maintain adequate eye contact. Sit quietly and listen attentively.</li>
                            <li>Invite Peter to repeat the story by saying something like: 'You had a difficult experience today when you were working with Miss Rushton and the physiotherapist.'</li>
                            <li>When Peter has again described the situation you might paraphrase it as: 'So when you and the physio were helping Miss Rushton to walk, you felt that her anxiety and need for privacy were really not understood by the physio. This meant that you found it hard to know how to intervene effectively.'</li>
                            <li>If Peter replies: 'It wasn't just that I didn't know how to intervene effectively with the physio: it was that I felt so sorry for Miss Rushton because she was so frightened, and the physio just didn't seem to grasp just how frightened she was. Although I was able to encourage Miss Rushton, I felt at a loss as to how to explain this to the physio, especially as I had never worked with her before.'</li>
                            <li>You might paraphrase this as: 'Mmm. You wanted to encourage and support Miss Rushton who was frightened, but felt hindered by the fact that you didn't know the physio and didn't want to challenge her, in front of your patient, about her seeming lack of understanding.'</li>
                            <li>Peter might then reply: 'Yes, I really felt uncomfortable because I was torn between not embarrassing the physio and caring for Miss Rushton. It was difficult to know what to say, but talking about it has helped me to see my ethical as well as practical dilemma more clearly.'</li>
                            <li>This process of using paraphrase has enabled you both to clarify not just how Peter was feeling, but also what his specific difficulties were. In addition, the skill here was to enable Peter to recognize the different dimensions of the situation he was in. By paraphrasing back to him what you heard him tell you, you demonstrate support and empathy.</li>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>'Touch is one of the most universal non-verbal ways of communicating caring' (Sundeen et al 1998: 159). We use it in formal and informal situations to demonstrate human contact such as when we shake hands on first meeting, or when we touch each other in shared amusement. Much of nursing and midwifery practice consists of using touch to carry out technical tasks. How we touch those in our care can convey respect and empathy or, if harshly or inconsiderately done, it can convey lack of care or even disrespect. Using touch skillfully and thoughtfully can convey that you are able to 'be with' your patient (Benner 2001). The scenario below provides an example of the expert interpretation of the need for touch, as is evident in the following account.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">The comfort of touch</h3>
                        <p>An acutely distressed woman, who had just learned about the extent of her relative's cancer, was hurrying along a hospital corridor seeking privacy in which to weep. An experienced staff nurse, who did not know her, stopped when she saw her and said: 'You look upset, can I help you? Are you all right?' This compassionate intervention enabled the relative to weep openly and say what had happened. The staff nurse gathered her into her arms, ushered her into an alcove to protect her from prying eyes and allowed her to cry. The woman never forgot how comforting that touch was at a time of acute loneliness.</p>
                        <p>The rapid assessment of this woman's need, the questions that focused on the immediate situation and the seemingly intuitive use of touch is a sound example of Benner's (2001: 215) description of the expert who is able to engage meaningfully in the situation and rapidly grasp the problem. This intervention was risky, but risk is also in the nature of expertise (Benner 2001).</p>
                        <p>It is important to note that in a different situation or with different people, such a generous use of touch might well have been inappropriate. If the person does not welcome your use of touch, they are likely to remain stiff and try to back away or extricate themselves. This is the cue to retreat slightly and stay close but not within their personal space.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Meeting a distressed relative</h3>
                        <p>You are going on your break. As you walk through the hospital grounds you see the relative of one of the women on your caseload, sitting on a bench with her head in her hands. As you pass, she takes out a handkerchief and wipes her eyes. She has obviously been crying. You know her partner Tania is at that moment in theatre and that the outcome for their unborn baby is uncertain. Recognizing the relative's distress you approach her and say: 'How are you, Sarah?'</p>
                        <p>Some issues raised by this scenario:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Sarah might be apprehensive about how their relationship might be perceived.</li>
                            <li>This situation is an example of the importance of unconditional positive regard and empathy, which might be inadvertently overlooked.</li>
                            <li>It is also a situation that has the potential for evoking strong emotional responses, both by what this couple is facing, but also from the nature of their relationship. It is therefore one in which emotional intelligence is crucial, so that the practitioner is aware of their feelings about these circumstances, but also very sensitive to Sarah's anxieties and needs.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Specific principles</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>As with all communication skills, touch needs to be used with care, i.e. it must always be based on the needs of the distressed person and on the awareness of the practitioner's own motives for intervening. It should always be offered respectfully.</li>
                            <li>Non-verbal communication is interpreted within the context in which it is offered. How it is offered and interpreted also depends on each individual's personal history and experience (see Ch.1).</li>
                            <li>When we use touch, we need to be mindful of culture, age, ethnicity and gender, as these have a significant impact on how our gesture of comfort is received. In some cultures it is unacceptable to be touched at all by people who are not intimates, unless it is in the administration of specific physical care.</li>
                            <li>Touching hands is a common form of contact in formal and informal situations. It can be experienced as less intrusive than contact closer to the body.</li>
                            <li>In providing midwifery and nursing care, there is often a significant physical component such as when palpating a woman's abdomen or when injections are given.</li>
                            <li>How we approach and touch people conveys our sense of their bodily integrity, especially as we frequently need to move into their intimate personal space. This in turn demonstrates our respect and empathy for them.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Preparation of self</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Consider the differences between this scenario and the example given at the introduction of this section. Here you know the person: in the first example, the nurse and the woman were strangers. How do you think this might influence your approach to Sarah and your use of touch?</li>
                            <li>As self-awareness is integral to effective communication, consider how your attitudes towards same-sex partnerships might influence the manner in which you intervene. You will want to demonstrate empathy but might be unsure about how best to do this. Be aware of your feelings and how they might influence the way you communicate verbally and non-verbally.</li>
                            <li>Consider how to position yourself. If you sit down next to Sarah, you will be more or less level with her, but if the bench is narrow you might find you are too close. You might need to perch on the arm of the bench, or squat discreetly beside it. It is best to avoid remaining standing and leaning over towards Sarah as this can feel intrusive or dominating.</li>
                            <li>Will you use touch, and if so, in what way?</li>
                            <li>How will your awareness of Sarah's relationship with your patient/client and the place of the interaction, influence the language you choose and the tone of your voice? If Sarah describes herself as 'gay' or lesbian, then it would seem appropriate that you use the same word to describe their relationship.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Environment</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>You are in the garden and so in an exposed place. It is important to try and make the space around you personal and private, e.g. by positioning yourself in a way that excludes onlookers or other people who might want to sit on the same bench. One way of doing this is by facing Sarah and having your back to the surrounding grounds.</li>
                            <li>Bearing in mind that your break time is limited, you will need to decide how you will manage the time available to be with Sarah.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Putting the skills into practice</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Approach Sarah and greet her by name. If necessary, remind her of your name. Position yourself so you can shut out any interested onlookers.</li>
                            <li>You might say: 'I can see you're upset. Is there anything I can do to help?'</li>
                            <li>Wait for her reply. Unless she communicates clearly that she doesn't want to talk to you, you might ask if you can sit down.</li>
                            <li>Sit facing her but in a position that doesn't crowd her and is not too direct: sideways on to someone often feels like a less direct or dominant position.</li>
                            <li>Say something that acknowledges her difficult position and how distressing it is. You might like to say how difficult it is to wait while her partner (use her name, Tania) is in theatre. This is offering Sarah the opportunity to talk.</li>
                            <li>When she starts to unburden herself, think of her need for physical comfort and the use of touch.</li>
                            <li>Be guided by your own inner feelings about what seems an appropriate non-verbal response to Sarah's distress, as well as by her posture and behaviour. For example, she might lean closer to you, indicating the need for an arm around her shoulders. On the other hand she might lean forward and talk to you with her face in her hands to hide her tears but not necessarily to shut you out. A brief touch on her shoulder as opposed to an arm around them, might seem more appropriate than no touch at all. As touching hands is a common form of contact, and can be experienced as less intrusive than contact closer to the body, you might feel easier reaching out and touching her hand, if she isn't covering her face.</li>
                            <li>After she has unburdened herself you might need to address the time, as you might be due on the ward soon. You might say: 'I need to go back to the ward now. Is there anything I can do to help when I get back?' If there is, undertake to do it if at all possible. Ask her how she is feeling now. Offer to help again if she and her partner need it or refer her to expert help if appropriate.</li>

                        <p>Think of a situation where you have tried to comfort someone in distress.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>What prompted you to intervene? Were you tempted to pass by?</li>
                            <li>Think about your thoughts and feelings as you approached the person. How did your emotional intelligence prompt your self-awareness and the awareness of the circumstances in which you found yourself? What thoughts did you have as you approached the distressed person?</li>
                            <li>How did this awareness influence your responses? How did it influence your use, or not, of touch? Consider if you would have responded differently if the person were in a similar position to Sarah in the scenario. How might this influence your responses?</li>
                            <li>Consider what you did to ensure the person's privacy. How successful were you in enabling them to explore their worries?</li>
                            <li>How did you perceive the person's response to your care? How did you end the encounter?</li>
                            <li>What, if anything, would you do differently? What are your reasons for this?</li>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Culture and communication are addressed in Chapter 1. This section will focus on cultural differences in the expression of distress.</p>
                        <p>In order to provide comfort we need to be aware that we all respond differently to distressing experiences. As culture has a significant impact on our verbal and non-verbal cues (Sundeen et al 1998) it can be difficult to attribute meaning to the non-verbal cues people give (Grasha 1995). In some cultures it is not acceptable to express uncomfortable emotions, so distress might be managed through stoical silence, whereas in others, people might need to verbalize their suffering loudly.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Reactions to distress</h3>
                        <p>Ms Leinster, a 40-year-old single woman whose father is a British army officer, is on your ward. She has just been told she has cancer. She sits quietly, looks very subdued and says little. At handover you are told that she is 'coping very well with the news'. From the end of the ward you notice that she is very still and has refused the offer of afternoon tea. The patient in the next bed has her family with her and they are all crying noisily. You go up to Ms Leinster and ask how she is.</p>
                        <p>Some issues raised by this scenario:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The patient might have been brought up in a culture where it is important not to display overt emotions. Just because she is quiet and not weeping openly does not mean she is not distressed.</li>
                            <li>The handover report demonstrates a cultural interpretation of the patient's response.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Specific principles</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>It is important to be aware of your own assumptions about the 'acceptable' way to express distress. This will help you avoid making inaccurate assessments of how troubled a person might be.</li>
                            <li>Although people express distress differently, it is important to offer comfort even though they might choose to refuse it.</li>
                            <li>The use of ritual during a major life event such as after the death of a loved one, can provide people with a source of protection and support in their community (Hoff et al 2009). As practitioners we need to accept people's different rituals and manifestations of distress in order to support them.</li>
                            <li>Whatever the religious or cultural background of the client, it is always crucial to treat their expressions of distress with respect (Neuberger 1994).</li>
                            <li>It is important always to see those in our care as individuals. When we demonstrate willingness to learn about others' cultures and religious customs we demonstrate acceptance and respect. This willingness to accept people as they are is very comforting to the distressed person and their loved ones (Neuberger 1994).</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Preparation of self</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Drawing on what you know from experience and the literature about people's responses to distressing news, consider how your patient might be feeling. Recognizing the processes of coming to terms with distressing news can help you to empathize and can inform how you respond.</li>
                            <li>Think about what you noticed about your patient's demeanour. Did she seem on the verge of tears or was she withdrawn but polite? What did her manner convey to you?</li>
                            <li>Be aware of how you are feeling. You might feel very distressed that someone in your care is having to face such a frightening diagnosis. How might your feelings influence how you open the conversation with your patient? How might they be manifest in your non-verbal cues?</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Environment</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>In a ward it is often difficult to ensure patients have privacy. In this case, the patient is quiet and subdued. If she wants to, it is important to offer to go elsewhere if she seems reluctant to talk in an open place. Drawing the screens can help.</li>
                            <li>Ensure that you make time to be with the patient. Rushing an interview with someone in distress can limit the comfort they might draw from your care. Explain to your colleagues so that they do not interrupt.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Putting the skills into practice</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Approach your patient's bed quietly. Position yourself where you can see each other but do not crowd her by coming too close.</li>
                            <li>Greet her by name and ask how she is. You might like to say how sorry you were to hear about her diagnosis. Ask her if she would like to talk about it at all.</li>
                            <li>Offer to go somewhere more private. If she chooses this option, ensure that the room is private, you are both seated comfortably and there are tissues if needed.</li>
                            <li>It is likely that, as she is reticent, she might not say very much at first, if at all. Just because she doesn't say anything does not mean your concern and presence aren't wanted or comforting.</li>
                            <li>Sitting still and quietly with the patient, even if she says little, can be comforting to her. This form of 'being there' (Benner 2001: 30) has been experienced by some people as graciousness in times of deep distress. It is the privilege of nursing and midwifery.</li>
                            <li>If your patient does want to talk to you, be guided by her. Here the use of paraphrase can help her to feel supported and heard. It also allows her to lead the conversation. Listen quietly and attentively and be aware of your body language.</li>
                            <li>When the patient appears comforted and it is appropriate to close the conversation, ask if there is anything she might like you to do before you leave and offer an example such as, asking if there is anyone you could contact for her?</li>
                            <li>Clarify with the patient what you will record in her nursing notes. Any information that needs to be shared with the team should be entered.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Reflection on practice</h4>
                        <p>Think about a similar situation from your practice where your client's display of distress was different from what you would have expected.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>How did your feelings before you approached your client influence what you said and your non-verbal cues?</li>
                            <li>How did the different manner of expressing distress influence your responses during and after the interview? You might have felt sad but honoured that the client confided in you; or at the end you might have left feeling hopeless and despondent.</li>
                            <li>How successful were you in ensuring your client's privacy?</li>
                            <li>How effective were you in allowing your client to lead the conversation and so express her feelings in her own way and time?</li>
                            <li>How empathetic and comforting do you think you appeared? What in your client's behaviour leads you to think this?</li>
                            <li>What, if anything, would you do differently? What are your reasons for this?</li>
                            <li>What have you learned about culture and people's assumptions about the expression of distress? How will this influence your practice in future?</li>
                            <li>How has your understanding of the significance of emotional intelligence informed your reflection? How do you think this understanding will enable you to develop your practice?</li>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Chaperoning a patient</h3>
                        <p>An 80 -year-old woman with abdominal pain is being seen for the first time in Outpatients by a male physician. She has never been to the hospital before and appears very nervous. You are asked to chaperone her while the physician examines her. As part of this process he does a rectal examination.</p>
                        <p>Some issues raised by this scenario:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The patient has to face strangers in an unknown environment. She has an undiagnosed problem and is likely to be nervous about the outcome of her investigations.</li>
                            <li>Not only is the environment strange and the situation potentially frightening, but she does not know the doctor or you.</li>
                            <li>Part of the examination includes a rectal examination, which can feel intrusive and embarrassing.</li>
                            <li>The patient is an older woman and the doctor is younger than she is. She might have different views from you about proper conduct between an older woman and a younger man in these circumstances (Le May 1998). It is important to ensure that your presence is supportive and promotes the dignity of the older person (Nursing and Midwifery Council 2009, Royal College of Nursing 2008).</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Specific principles</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>In this scenario the patient has never met any of the people involved in her care. She is also in an unfamiliar environment. It is important to help her feel at ease by introducing yourself and introducing her to the doctor.</li>
                            <li>People of different ages have different roles in life. This often means they have different values and 'prefer interacting with those whom they perceive in some way as equals' (Le May 1998: 94) in shared life experiences rather than try and overcome cross-generational differences in experience. It is important to take this into account when building a relationship with this patient. It might be helpful to explain that you are working 'with' her and engage her in the partnership by explaining how important it is for you that she lets you know how best to assist her during this consultation. The gender difference as well as the age difference between the patient and the doctor might add to her embarrassment.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Preparation of self</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>How do you think the patient might be feeling during the process of visiting Outpatients and having a medical consultation? How will your thoughts inform your practice?</li>
                            <li>How will you introduce yourself? How will you introduce her to the doctor? What touch do you think is appropriate during these introductions?</li>
                            <li>How will you engage her as an equal partner in her care? Consider the age differences between you.</li>
                            <li>Is gender an issue here? If it is an issue in the development of this professional relationship, how do you think it might influence the maintenance of her privacy and dignity in this situation? If a female nurse is available, it is important to ask your patient if she would prefer to be chaperoned by a woman. If however the doctor is female, and you are male, explain this to the patient and check whether she is happy for you to be with her.</li>
                            <li>Consider what you will say to the patient during the procedure and after it is over. So as not to interrupt inappropriately or confuse the patient, be sure to ask the doctor to explain everything as he/she goes along.</li>
                            <li>How will you ensure she is comfortable during and after the examination? Consider how you will use touch. Holding her hand during the procedure is more formal and remaining near her head rather than observing the procedure is important.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Environment</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Ensure your patient has sufficient time to undress. Rushing to take clothes off can feel undignified and, as an older adult, she might take a little longer.</li>
                            <li>Ensure that the curtains to the examination room are closed and that the door is shut.</li>
                            <li>Check that a modesty sheet is available for the patient so she is not unnecessarily exposed.</li>
                            <li>Ensure that all the equipment needed for the examination is readily to hand so the patient does not experience preventable delays while she is waiting or already in the process of being examined. This can add to her anxiety.</li>
                            <li>Ensure that she has somewhere to hang her clothes and a discreet place to put her underwear.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Putting the skills into practice</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Clarify with the doctor how he likes to conduct the examination and what he explains to patients during investigations.</li>
                            <li>Greet your patient by name and introduce yourself. Offer your hand to shake if this seems appropriate. It is a formal way of touching someone and can convey warmth and respect.</li>
                            <li>Explain your role and how you would like to work with her, i.e. try and engage her in a partnership with you by showing that you are equals in this endeavour. You both want to ensure that her visit runs as smoothly as possible.</li>
                            <li>Ask her to let you know how you might assist her during the consultation. Demonstrate empathy by recognizing that this is an unfamiliar situation and she might find that stressful.</li>
                            <li>The physical component to this examination is likely to feel intrusive and embarrassing. How we help to maintain this patient's dignity and privacy is a crucial part of demonstrating empathy and offering comfort, particularly as this examination will move into her intimate personal space. A supportive touch on her hand or arm might help her to feel at ease.</li>
                            <li>You might say: 'Coming to see a new doctor is often difficult, especially when we have never had an examination like this before. (Name) so that you feel as supported as possible, it is important to me that you let me know how I can help you while you are here. I will be staying with you throughout, so please let me know if there is anything worrying you.'</li>
                            <li>Introduce the doctor by name to the patient using his full name. Then introduce the patient to the doctor using her full name and title. This too demonstrates respect for her dignity.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Note:</strong> The order of this process may be culturally determined.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Check whether she would like you to remain during the initial discussion with the doctor. If she does, position yourself where she can see you and where you can respond to her needs should she ask for your assistance.</li>
                            <li>Before the examination, ask her if she needs any help to undress, explaining what clothing she needs to remove. Show her where she can put her clothes.</li>
                            <li>If she needs help to get on to the couch, assist her with this. She might just need a hand to support her as she uses the steps to get up on to the couch. A firm hand grip is supportive and can be reassuring.</li>
                            <li>When the doctor begins the examination, stand at the top of the couch where she can see you and ensure she is not unnecessarily exposed. During the rectal examination, offer to hold her hand. Encourage her to express any feelings or discomfort. You might say, 'Please do let us know if you feel discomfort or pain, because Dr (Name) would like to cause as little discomfort to you as possible.'</li>
                            <li>At the end of the examination, when the doctor has left the room, offer her a tissue to wipe away any lubricant and show her where to wash her hands.</li>
                            <li>Ask her if she needs help, and if necessary, assist her to dress. Allow her sufficient time for this, as well as to compose herself, so that she doesn't feel rushed and undignified.</li>
                            <li>After the doctor has finished the consultation, ensure that she has made arrangements to get home and can find her way out of the department. Offer a positive statement about having been with her - you might say, 'I am pleased to have met you, (Name)' when you say goodbye.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Reflection on practice</h4>
                        <p>Reflect on a similar situation where you have chaperoned a patient of a similar age, whom you had not met before.</p>
                        <ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Dealing with an angry outburst</h3>
                        <p>You are working on the postnatal ward. Mrs Ailsa Griffiths, has been waiting all morning for the neonatologist to examine the baby prior to their discharge home. Her husband Selwyn has come to collect them. He had been assured by the staff, that his wife and baby would be ready for discharge on his arrival to the ward. This was of particular importance to him because he had already had several penalty charges for exceeding parking time in the hospital car park. He is very angry and shouts so loudly in the ward that everyone present can hear. He then storms away to his wife's bed area and slams various items on the bedside locker. You realize he has been very stressed because his wife had been admitted antenatally and had had to stay in hospital until she had their baby. You seek him out to offer support.</p>
                        <p>Some issues raised by this scenario:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Selwyn is obviously distressed. Could his outburst have been foreseen?</li>
                            <li>The outburst in such a public arena is significant. It is important to consider what the reasons for this might have been. What messages might this convey?</li>
                            <li>What effect might his outburst have had on any onlookers such as other women in the ward, and staff? How could these be addressed?</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Specific principles</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Find out the reason for the situation, i.e. why his wife and their baby have not yet been seen by the neonatologist. There might have been unavoidable reasons for this unfortunate situation, but it is also important not to offer to promise to solve the difficulty if your commitment cannot be fulfilled.</li>
                            <li>It is important to be aware of your own assumptions about the 'acceptable' way to express and manage intense emotions. All individuals do this in their own way. For example, sometimes people find it easier, and perhaps safer, to do so publicly as a means of managing their feelings.</li>
                            <li>When people express intense emotions, it can spark intense feelings in us, perhaps of anxiety, fear or indeed feelings similar to theirs. When we recognize how we feel in these situations, we can manage our feelings and put them aside, in order to help the person in our care.</li>
                            <li>Be aware that after a person has had an emotional outburst, they might feel they have lost their dignity. It is important that as practitioners we do all we can to offer care that supports a person's dignity (Royal College of Nursing 2008). In situations where the person's outburst might elicit in them a sense of having lost their dignity, we need to be respectful so as not to exacerbate their uncomfortable feelings or distress.</li>
                            <li>Because of the intensity of the situation, you might feel you want to remove yourself or respond defensively, rather than go to Selwyn. Being aware of this possibility and, if you personally are not in any imminent physical danger, it is appropriate to go to and stay quietly with the person. Consider getting someone more experienced to deal with this situation. (For details on violence in healthcare, see Hoff et al 2009 and Wykes 1994).</li>
                            <li>Position yourself where Selwyn can see you and, if necessary, where you can touch him. Avoid fidgeting and position yourself where you can maintain eye contact. Standing while he is sitting down might be perceived as threatening. Be aware that intruding on his personal space can be perceived as threatening and/or challenging.</li>
                            <li>If possible, suggest that he sits down with you, as this can help reduce the physical manifestations of any further intense outbursts because when we sit we are more limited in our movements as well as more inclined to relax.</li>
                            <li>Offer him the opportunity to tell you about his feelings. This can help alleviate the intensity of his emotions, and be cathartic. By being empathetic and not avoiding his distress, you offer the opportunity for acceptance, as well as the containment of what can feel like overwhelming and unmanageable feelings.</li>
                            <li>It is also important to remember the containing nature of time limits. Once Selwyn is calmer, let him know that you will soon have to close the conversation. Give him some warning of how much longer you can stay and listen before you actually take your leave. Try as far as possible to keep to your commitment. Setting time limits is usually experienced as containing, especially as you haven't succumbed under the weight of his emotion. Offering to talk to him again after the consultant has seen their baby demonstrates that you are still willing to be there for him and accept him, despite his outburst.</li>
                            <li>If any other women or visitors comment on what has happened, you might say, 'The situation is all right now.' Be absolutely sure that Mr and Mrs Griffiths' privacy and confidentiality is maintained by not discussing any of the details of the situation.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Note:</strong> It is also important to recognize the limits to your role in the containment of intense feelings and, if necessary, refer people on to more specialist services such as counselling or psychiatric services.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Preparation of self</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>What did you feel when you witnessed Selwyn's outburst? You might have felt frightened by the intensity of his feelings, sorry that he was so stressed and perhaps angry with him for disrupting the quiet of the ward. How might your feelings influence how you approach Selwyn? How might they be manifest in your non-verbal cues?</li>
                            <li>Think about whether it might help you to talk to a colleague for a few minutes before you go and talk to Selwyn. This can help you clarify your thoughts, feelings and strategies for helping him and his wife.</li>
                            <li>Ailsa is likely also to be disappointed and let down by the neonatologist and the ward team. She has been in hospital longer than she expected and is looking forward to going home with her baby to her husband. How will you include her in the conversation? What might you say to ensure that you recognize that, as a couple and as new parents, they might share similar feelings about this prolonged wait to go home?</li>
                            <li>Consider how he might be feeling underneath the anger. He might feel let down by the neonatologist and feel that the doctor and the ward team have failed him and his family. He might also be feeling powerless to do much to change the situation.</li>
                            <li>Think about what you noticed about his non-verbal cues. Was he making violent gestures? Perhaps he seemed let down, but also frustrated. What did his overall demeanour convey to you?</li>
                            <li>Think about how much time you have available to help Selwyn. Keep this in mind so that his feelings don't seem to take over the rest of your work. How will you open the conversation with him?</li>
                            <li>When you approach him, what will you say? How will you position yourself?</li>
                            <li>Consider what options you have for following up the cause of his anger. When and how will you offer them to him and his wife?</li>
                            <li>Consider how and when you will end the conversation.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Environment</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Selwyn has sought space to express his intense feelings by going to his wife's bedside area and slamming things about on the locker. Consider how you might approach him there to speak to him while recognizing his need for dignity and privacy.</li>
                            <li>Consider if it is appropriate to stay there or move somewhere else like the office. However, as a number of people have overheard this outburst, going somewhere else might feel very exposing to him, particularly if he begins to feel embarrassed by his behaviour.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Putting the skills into practice</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Consider how you are feeling. Acknowledge your feelings and put them to one side. If you are apprehensive about how you will cope, it can help to discuss this with a colleague for the few minutes before you go and talk to Selwyn.</li>
                            <li>Wait a few moments to allow Selwyn to gather himself. This is also an opportunity for you to compose yourself if you felt discomfited by his outburst.</li>
                            <li>Ensure that you make time to be with him so you can show empathy with him about this situation. Rushing the interview might contribute to his feeling of not being heard or valued and powerless in the face of the staff and the institution.</li>
                            <li>Go to Ailsa's bed area and ask him by name if you might talk together about the situation. Wait for his response. He might take a little while to acknowledge your approach. Try and initiate collaboration. When you are with Selwyn and Ailsa ask if they would like you to close the curtains or talk in a private room such as the office, to ensure their privacy.</li>
                            <li>You might say: 'I recognize there are issues concerning the delays you have been experiencing that we need to talk about.'</li>
                            <li>Depending on his response, you might like to say how sorry you are about what has happened.</li>
                            <li>Try to arrange chairs beside the bed so that you can all sit in comfortable proximity with level eye contact. If you go to an office, arrange the chairs in a similar way. Avoid sitting behind the desk as this can be construed as setting up a barrier between them and you.</li>
                            <li>Ask Selwyn to tell you about his anger. If it seems appropriate and Ailsa has come to the office with you, invite her to say how she feels about the situation. Sit quietly with them without fidgeting or demonstrating any anxiety you might feel.</li>
                            <li>Listen quietly and attentively to the emotions expressed, the language they use and also to what they do not say (see Jacobs 2004). Be aware too of your body language. 'Being with' (Benner 2001: 50) can be comforting, even if Selwyn says a lot and seems not to want to listen to you, because you have not run away from his intense feelings.</li>
                            <li>Be guided by him in how to encourage him to talk. The use of paraphrase can help him feel he is being listened to and supported (see above). Questions can feel controlling if not sensitively used (see Ch. 5). Bear in mind that underneath his anger there might be a range of conflicting and difficult feelings about his wife's early admission and the subsequent delays in seeing the doctors, culminating in this instance, which are hard to identify and express.</li>
                            <li>When he appears calmer, encourage a partnership between him and his wife and yourself, by exploring with him options for resolving the situation now.</li>
                            <li>Before ending the encounter, ask Selwyn how he is now, say how pleased you are that he has talked to you and clarify what you have agreed can be done to deal with the situation.</li>
                            <li>Before closing the conversation, ask him and his wife if they would like to return to the ward or wait in the relative privacy of the day room. This can support Selwyn, allow for quiet conversation between the couple as well as help to address any curiosity among other people on the ward and staff. Ask him too if he would like you to be with him while he speaks to the neonatologist.</li>
                            <li>Before leaving Selwyn, say you will let him know how things are progressing, then close the conversation.</li>
                            <li>Record in Ailsa's notes exactly what happened, what you agreed to do to resolve the situation and by when. Share your decisions with the midwifery team.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Reflection on practice</h4>
                        <p>Think about a situation in your nursing or midwifery experience when you have had to deal with an angry outburst.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>What did you feel at the time? You might have felt frightened by the intensity of the feelings and angry about the disruption it caused. How did this influence what you said to the person and your non-verbal cues?</li>
                            <li>How did you feel during and after the interaction with the angry person? You might have felt embarrassed about the cause of the outburst, but relieved that you were able to demonstrate empathy in such a difficult situation. How did your feelings influence your practice?</li>
                            <li>How successful were you in ensuring privacy and dignity for all involved, while at the same time allowing the angry person to express their feelings in their own way and time?</li>
                            <li>How empathetic and comforting do you think you were? What leads you to think this?</li>
                            <li>What, if anything, would you do differently? What are your reasons for this?</li>
                            <li>What have you learned about helping people to express and manage their intense emotions? How will this influence your practice in future?</li>
                        </ul>
