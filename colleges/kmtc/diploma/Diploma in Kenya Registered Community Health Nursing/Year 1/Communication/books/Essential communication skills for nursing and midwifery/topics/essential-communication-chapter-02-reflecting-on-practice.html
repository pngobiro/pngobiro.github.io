                            <p>A wealth of untapped knowledge is embedded in the practices and the 'know how' of expert nurse clinicians, but this knowledge will not expand or fully develop unless nurses systematically record what they learn from experience ... There is much to learn and appreciate as practising nurses uncover meanings acquired as a result of helping, coaching and intervening in the significantly human events that comprise the art and science of nursing.</p>

                        <p>Practitioners' ability to reflect on practice is fundamental to their development as sound, creative and responsive professionals. Their ability to transform their practice through the processes of reviewing their inner experiences of their work and relating them to the outer realities, e.g. contextual and interpersonal, of their experiences, takes courage and a willingness to be open to new ideas and perspectives. The capacity to reflect upon and transform practice of necessity therefore takes into account practitioners' feelings as well as their thoughts. Johns (2005: 2) describes reflection as a process that is both subjective and particular. It is a fusion of sensing, perceiving, intuiting and thinking related to a specific experience in order to develop insights into self and practice.</p>
