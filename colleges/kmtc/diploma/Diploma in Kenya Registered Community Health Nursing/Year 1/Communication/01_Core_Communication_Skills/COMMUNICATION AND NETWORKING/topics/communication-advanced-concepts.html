                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h3>1. Physical Barriers</h3>
                        <p>Marked out territories, empires and fiefdoms into which strangers are not allowed. Closed office doors, barrier screens, and separate areas for people of different status.</p>
                        
                        <h3>2. Perceptual Barriers</h3>
                        <p>Thoughts, assumptions and perceptions shape our own realities. A traveller was walking down a road when he met a man from the next town. "Excuse me," he said. "I am hoping to stay in the next town tonight. Can you tell me what the townspeople are like?" Well," said the townsman, "how did you find the people in the last town you visited?" "Oh, they were an irascible bunch. Kept to themselves. Took me for a fool. Over-charged me for what I got. Gave me very poor service." "Well, then," said the townsman, "you'll find them pretty much the same here."</p>

                        <h3>3. Emotional Barriers</h3>
                        <p>The emotional barrier is comprised mainly of fear, mistrust and suspicion. The roots of our emotional mistrust of others lie in our childhood and infancy when we were taught to be careful about what we said to others.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Mind your P's and Q's."</li>
                            <li>"Don't speak until you're spoken to."</li>
                            <li>"Children should be seen and not heard."</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Excessive fear stunts our development</p>

                        <h3>4. Cultural Barriers</h3>
                        <p>When you a group and wish to remain in it, you will need to adopt the behaviour patterns of the group. The group rewards such behaviour through acts of recognition, approval and inclusion.</p>

                        <h3>5. Language Barriers</h3>
                        <p>Our language may present barriers to others who are not familiar with our expressions, buzz-words and jargon. to talk to them in their own language.</p>

                        <p><strong>6. Gender Barriers.</strong> Societal stereotypes, assumed gender roles.</p>
                        <p><strong>7. Interpersonal Barriers.</strong> Stage fright, a language barrier, lack self-awareness, sensitivity and flexibility. Cultural factors -language, belief, morality, perspective, and customs. Situational factors- physical and social environments.</p>
