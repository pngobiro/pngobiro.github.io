                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Problem Analysis to Identify Interests and Goals</h4>
                        <p>Effective negotiators must have the skills to analyze a problem to determine the interests of each party in the negotiation. A detailed problem analysis identifies the issue, the interested parties and the outcome goals.</p>
                        <p>For example, in an employer and employee contract negotiation, the problem or area where the parties disagree may be in salary or benefits. Identifying the issues for both sides can help to find a compromise for all parties.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Preparation Before a Meeting</h4>
                        <p>Before entering a bargaining meeting, the skilled negotiator prepares for the meeting. Preparation includes determining goals, areas for trade and alternatives to the stated goals.</p>
                        <p>Negotiators study the history of the relationship between the two parties and past negotiations to find areas of agreement and common goals. Past precedents and outcomes can set the tone for current negotiation</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Active Listening Skills</h4>
                        <p>Negotiators have the skills to listen actively to the other party during the debate. Active listening involves the ability to read body language as well as verbal communication. It is important to listen to the other party to find areas for compromise during the meeting. Instead of spending the bulk of the time in negotiation expounding the virtues of his viewpoint, the skilled negotiator will spend more time listening to the other party.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Keep Emotions in Check</h4>
                        <p>It is vital that a negotiator have the ability to keep his emotions in check during the negotiation. While a negotiation on contentious issues can be frustrating, allowing emotions to take control during the meeting can lead to unfavorable results.</p>
                        <p>For example, a manager frustrated with the lack of progress during a salary negotiation may concede more than is acceptable to the organization in an attempt to end the frustration.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, employees negotiating a pay raise may become too emotionally involved to accept a compromise with management and take an all or nothing approach, which breaks down the communication between the two parties.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Clear and Effective Communication</h4>
                        <p>Negotiators must have the ability to communicate clearly and effectively to the other side during the negotiation. Misunderstandings can occur if the negotiator does not state his case clearly. During a bargaining meeting, an effective negotiator must have the skills to state his desired outcome as well as his reasoning.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Collaboration and Teamwork</h4>
                        <p>Negotiation is not necessarily a one side against another arrangement. Effective negotiators must have the skills to work together as a team and foster a collaborative atmosphere during negotiations. Those involved in a negotiation on both sides of the issue must work together to reach an agreeable solution.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Problem Solving Skills</h4>
                        <p>Individuals with negotiation skills have the ability to seek a variety of solutions to problems. Instead of focusing on his ultimate goal for the negotiation, the individual with skills can focus on solving the problem, which may be a breakdown in communication, to benefit both sides of the issue.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Decision Making Ability</h4>
                        <p>Leaders with negotiation skills have the ability to act decisively during a negotiation. It may be necessary during a bargaining arrangement to agree to a compromise quickly to end a stalemate.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Maintaining Good Relationships</h4>
                        <p>Effective negotiators have the interpersonal skills to maintain a good working relationship with those involved in the negotiation.</p>
                        <p>Negotiators with patience and the ability to persuade others without using manipulation can maintain a positive atmosphere during a difficult negotiation.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Ethics and Reliability</h4>
                        <p>Ethical standards and reliability in an effective negotiator promote a trusting environment for negotiations.</p>
                        <p>Both sides in a negotiation must trust that the other party will follow through on promises and agreements.</p>
                        <p>A negotiator must have the skills to execute on his promises after bargaining ends.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">7 rules of power of negotiation</h3>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Rule No 1 - Everything is negotiable</h4>
                        <p>This does not mean you are always going to get what you want or win every negotiation, but you must remember that everything is potentially up for negotiation.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Rule No 2-Know what you want before negotiating</h4>
                        <p>Always know the result you want - your bottom line - before commencing negotiations. It's a bit like when you're planning your holiday</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Rule No 3 - Aim for a Win/Win negotiation</h4>
                        <p>Win/win is created when we help another person to get what they want while we get what we want so that both parties feel they have won.</p>
                        <p>Never offend the other party. build a rapport with the other party during the initial stages</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Rule No. 4 - Treat Negotiating as a Game</h4>
                        <p>When it comes to negotiations, you need to be involved but not too much. If you are too emotionally involved, you will lose your perspective and make emotional rather than subjective decisions.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Rule No 5-Never believe anyone else is entirely on your side.</h4>
                        <p>Trust yourself; you have your own interests entirely at heart. everybody's interest is different, each has their own goals and yours are always going to be different and sometimes conflict with mine.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Rule No 6 - Strive to be innocent</h4>
                        <p>To Power Negotiators, smart is dumb and dumb is smart. When you are negotiating, you're better off acting as if you know less than everybody else does, not more. Try.. "I don't know ... I'm new to this, you're the experts.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Rule 7. Ask Questions</h4>
                        <p>Power Negotiators are never afraid to ask the other party questions or for advice. Asking questions tends to establish a climate of trust. If you are not happy with the response you get try and ask another question such as, "Why do you say that?" "I don't know, what do you think?" Even if you know the answers. it diffuses the competitive spirit of the other side. It buys you some thinking time and it forces the other party to better justify their stated position.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Professional negotiation</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Follow a Process. before you go into a negotiation, take some time to think about what the ideal solution would be for you if this negotiation worked out perfectly.</li>
                            <li>Prepare the other side first.</li>
                            <li>Be easy to work with.</li>
                            <li>strive for a win-win solution.</li>
                            <li>think long term.</li>
                            <li>the law of four.</li>
                            <li>be prepared to renegotiate.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Negotiation tactics</h3>
                        <p>Negotiation tactics are the detailed methods employed by negotiators to gain an advantage.</p>
                        <p>Negotiation Tactics are often deceptive and manipulative and are used to fulfil one party's goals and objectives - often to the detriment of others. - 'win-lose' by nature.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Dealing With Difficult Negotiators</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Be calm. No matter how others act, what strategy they use or what behavior they demonstrate, we need to stay in control.</li>
                            <li>Be prepared. Forewarned is forearmed.</li>
                            <li>Be focused. Ignore the noise and listen for the music.</li>
                            <li>Be blunt. If they're tough, we need to be assertive in equal or greater measure.</li>
