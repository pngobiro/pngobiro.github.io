                            <li><strong>Listening.</strong> You understand what the other person is trying to say, and can respond appropriately</li>

                            <li><strong>Picking the Right Medium.</strong> Example, serious conversations (layoffs, resignation, changes in salary, etc.) are almost always best done in person. You might want to convey a letter, email.</li>

Even when you disagree with an employer, co-worker, or employee, it is important for you to understand and respect their point of view.</li>
                            <li><strong>Open-Mindedness.</strong> A good communicator should enter into any conversation with a flexible, open mind.

                            <li><strong>Confidence.</strong><br>It is important to be confident in your interactions with others. Confidence shows your co-workers that you believe in what you're saying and will follow through. firm but friendly tone. Be careful not to sound arrogant or aggressive.</li>
                            <li><strong>Respect.</strong><br>People will be more open to communicating with you if you convey respect for them and their ideas.<br>Simple actions like using a person's name, making eye contact, and actively listening when a person speaks will make the person feel appreciated.</li>
                            <li><strong>Feedback.</strong><br>Giving feedback involves giving praise as well - something as simple as saying "good job" or "thanks for taking care of that" to an employee can greatly increase motivation. or through email, phone calls, or weekly status updates</li>
