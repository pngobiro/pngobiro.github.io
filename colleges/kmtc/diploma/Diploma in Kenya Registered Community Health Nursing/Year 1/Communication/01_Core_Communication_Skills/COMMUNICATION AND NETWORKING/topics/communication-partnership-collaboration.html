                        <p>Partnerships are formed when 2 or more individuals decide to carry on business together.

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Nine Characteristics of Partnership</h3>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">1. Existence of an agreement:</h4>
                        <p>Partnership is the outcome of an agreement between two or more persons to carry on business. This agreement may be oral or in writing.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">2. Existence of business:</h4>
                        <p>Partnership is formed to carry on a business a "Business" includes every trade, occupation, and profession. Business, of course, must be lawful.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">3. Sharing of profits:</h4>
                        <p>The purpose of partnership should be to earn profits and to share it. In the absence of any agreement, the partner should share profits (and losses as well) in equal proportions.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">4. Agency relationship:</h4>
                        <p>The partnership business may be carried on by all or any of them acting for all. Thus, the law of partnership is a branch of the law of Agency. To the outside public, each partner is a principal, while to the other partners he is an agent. It must, however, be noted that a partner must function within the limits of authority conferred on him.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">5. Membership:</h4>
                        <p>The minimum number of persons required to constitute a partnership is two. The Act, however, does not mention the upper limit. For this a recourse has to be taken to the Companies Act, 1956 [Section 11 (1) & (2)]. It states that the maximum number of persons is ten, in case of a banking business and twenty, in case of any other business.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">6. Nature of liability:</h4>
                        <p>The nature of liability of partners is the same as in case of sole proprietorship. The liability of partners is both individual and collective. The creditors have a right to recover the firm's debts from the private property of one or all partners, where firm's assets are insufficient.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">7. Fusion of ownership and control:</h4>
                        <p>In the eyes of law, the identity of partners is not different from the identity of partnership firm. As such, the right of management and control vests with the owners (i.e., partners).</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">8. Non-transferability of interest:</h4>
                        <p>No partner can assign or transfer his partnership share to any other person so as to make him a partner in the business without the consent of all other partners.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">9. Registration of firm:</h4>
                        <p>Registration of a partnership firm is not compulsory under the Act. The only document or even an oral agreement among partners required is the 'partnership deed' to bring the partnership into existence.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">How partnership works</h3>
                        <p>The partners in a business partnership invest in the business, and each investor/partner has a share in the profits and losses. The partnership income tax is paid by the partnership. The profits and losses are divided among the partners, based on their agreement.</p>

                        <p>Positive outcomes are to improve services, empowerment, autonomy and informed decision making.

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Intrasectorial and Intersectoral Collaboration</h3>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Intrasectorial collaboration</h4>
                        <p>Refers to "the collective actions involving more than one specialised agency, performing different roles for a common purpose in a way that is more effective, efficient or sustainable than could be achieved by the entity acting alone".</p>
                        <p>Intrasectorial collaboration: "actions undertaken by sectors within the health sector,"</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Intersectoral collaboration (ISC)</h4>
                        <p>Is the joint action taken by health and other government sectors, representatives from private, voluntary and non-profit groups, to improve the health of populations.</p>
                        <p>Intersectoral action for health as "actions undertaken by sectors outside the health sector,"</p>
                        <p>It provides a collective approach to address the social determinants of health. ISC makes it possible to work across structural levels, attract a diversity of participants and decision makers, address a variety of health factors, and mobilize social capital to address health equity. This approach can coordinate policies to limit structured inequality among governments, service providers, community members, the private sector, and many other stakeholders. It is especially important when health is not the explicit focus of the policy.</p>
                        <p>ISC often involves small groups of people from different sectors of society working across formal organizational boundaries to coordinate and provide services and programs to address health equity. This can take the form of inter-agency meetings, community coalitions, coordinated care teams, information systems links, and co-location of officials in program delivery.</p>
                        <p>Intersectoral action for health as "actions undertaken by sectors outside the health sector, possibly, but not necessarily, in collaboration with the health sector, on health or health equity outcomes or on the determinants of health or health equity."</p>
                        <p>ISC addresses the social and economic factors that influence the health of a population within and between sectors at the local, regional, provincial, national, and global levels.</p>
