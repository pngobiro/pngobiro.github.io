Allows the original sender to evaluate how the message was interpreted and to make any necessary adjustments or clarification.

Feedback can be verbal or non-verbal.

- We must adjust our communication styles so that patients can understand.

\section*{Effective Communication}

\section*{Communication}
- Why is this important to us as health care workers?
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_13_adf5afa50683204d5645g-21.jpg?height=957&width=1009&top_left_y=797&top_left_x=742)

\section*{Nonverbal Communication}
- It is not necessary to speak in order to send a message.
- Health care workers need to be aware of both their own and patients' nonverbal behaviors because these are an important part of any communication process.
- When verbal and nonverbal messages agree, the receiver is more likely to understand the message being sent.

\section*{Nonverbal Communication}
- Eye Contact
- Lets others know that you are paying attention.
- Facial Expressions
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_13_adf5afa50683204d5645g-23.jpg?height=301&width=600&top_left_y=774&top_left_x=1409)
- Ex: smile, frown.
- Make sure that the verbal message matches your facial expression.

\section*{Reflection:}
- How might understanding nonverbal communication benefit you in the health care field?

Written Communication

Documentation

\section*{Recording and Reporting}
- In health care, an important part of effective communication is reporting or recording all observations while providing care.
- Your ability to observe patient behavior and symptoms will directly affect their care.

\section*{Documentation}
- A record of the patient's progress throughout treatment. Purpose is to record patient care and prove accountability for care given
- Many people are responsible for documenting information on patients.
- Documentation must be accurate, concise, and complete.
-Writing should be neat and legible.
- Spelling and grammar should be correct.

\section*{Documentation}
- All records must contain certain information:
- Patient name, address, age, identification \#.
- Diagnosis and physician's orders.
- Other information may be required:
- Care or treatment given and how patient tolerated it.
- Time of treatment.
- Observations that would be helpful to other health care workers.

\section*{Documentation}
- All documentation must be signed with the name and title of the person recording the information.
- Errors should be crossed out neatly with a straight line, have "error" recorded by them, and show the initials of the person making the error. Never use 'white out'!
- Never skip lines! Write under the previous documentation.
- Patient documentation is a legal record, admissible in a court of law.

\section*{Documentation}
- If you do not write it down, it did not happen!
- Use blue or black (depending on your facility policy) ink for all documentation.
- Entries should be in short phrases. You do not need to write in complete sentences.
- Time should be recorded in military (24 hour) time.
