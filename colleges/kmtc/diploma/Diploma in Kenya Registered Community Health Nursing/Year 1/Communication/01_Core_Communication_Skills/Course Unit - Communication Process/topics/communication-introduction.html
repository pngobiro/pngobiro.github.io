                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Communication is the exchange of information between two or more persons who are interacting with each other in such a way that the information is understood. It defines the transfer of meaningful information and the establishment of commonality with the audience.</p>
                        <p>The component of communication are easily remembered using the acronym: MSCREFS, which refers to "M" - message; "S" - source (sender); "C" - channel; "R" - receiver (audience); "E" - effects; "F" - feedback; and "S" - social. The characteristics of these elements are discussed as follows:</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">"M" - Message</h3>
                        <p>The message is the information intended to be passed to the audience, and it needs to bear a purpose and relevant facts to be communicated to the audience. The content of the message should suit the level of the audience.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">"S" - Source (Sender)</h3>
                        <p>This is the origin of the message, conveying the message to its destination. The source of the message determines the clarity of the message to the audience, and it should consider the environment before communicating.</p>
                        <p>The characteristics of the "source" that influence communication include the mood, knowledge of the subject matter, attitude, language , knowledge of the audience, socialcultural background, economic status, and age/sex/religion.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">"C" - Channel</h3>
                        <p>This is the medium that is used to convey a message from the source to the destination (receiver). The communication channel used to send the message should suit the needs of the audience. Communication is achieved through three main methods, namely verbal, nonverbal, and written communications.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Verbal communication</strong> - verbal communication is expressed through conversations, including face-to-face interactions, telephone calls, radio and television broadcasts. It involves the act of talking and listening, and the tone of voice can communicate feelings and emotions that are as significant as the words being spoken.</li>
                            <li><strong>Non-verbal communication</strong> - this is what is known as body positioning, gestures and facial expression. It is also referred to as "body language" since it can be used to communicate as much as words. The most common body signs that can be observed from clients/patients include beckoning, crying, wriggling, facial expression, yawning and restlessness. It is through the body language that we express our attitudes towards an issue or a personal behaviour.</li>
                            <li><strong>Written communication</strong> - this involves circulating messages through the print media (such as newspapers, newsletters, letters, posters, circulars, memoranda), or through electronic media (including emails). In the health facilities, this mode of communication can be channelled through policy documents, procedure manuals, circulars, memoranda, letters, posters, journals, patients' notes or care plans, files, and observation charts.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">"R" - Receiver (Audience)</h3>
                        <p>This is the person(s) who receive the message conveyed from the source. The receiver (audience) should be psychologically ready to receive the message that has been sent to him/her. Such characteristics that influence the message conveyed include the mood of the receiver, attitude towards the message sent or language used, the education level, and the cultural and socio-economic background of the audience.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">"E" - Effects</h3>
                        <p>This is the impact or outcomes after sending the message to the receiver (audience). The effect may be defined as the desired impact or outcomes that are expected over a period of time after sharing the health message. The impact or outcomes are observed after individuals, families, or communities have acquired the desired knowledge, attitude and change in their behaviour, such as female genital mutilation (FGM).</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">"F" - Feedback</h3>
                        <p>This is the process of finding out whether the communicated message has been understood as intended. To ensure that the receiver has understood the message, you should ask him/her to paraphrase the message. Feedback is important since it reinforces the understanding of the message.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">"S" - Social Setting</h3>
                        <p>The social setting refers to the environment in which the message is conveyed from the source (sender) and that of the receiver (receiver). It is important to consider social setting when selecting avenue to share a healthy message, such which should be free from unnecessary noises and/or disturbances.</p>
