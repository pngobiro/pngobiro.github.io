                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Communication can be classified in formal, informal, or unconscious, and are detailed as indicated hereunder.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Formal Communication</h3>
                        <p>Formal communication is the official way of communicating with people (employees) in an organization. The information may wither be oral or written. The message flows from the top to bottom, following the hierarchy or chain of command in a particular organization.</p>
                        <p>The communication mainly involves giving instructions to be followed and clarifying the staff in the organization it emphasizes the use of available resources to achieve the desired goals. Formal communication flows in three directions, namely downward, upward, and horizontal communication.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Downward communication:</strong> this is where the communication flows from the top management to the lower level, and the communication channels used here include oral messages (such as telephone calls), written communication (such as circulars, letters, memos, pamphlets, or posters). The advantage of this communication is that the message is received immediately it is sent and it is not distorted; the disadvantage is that it does not receive feedback immediately.</li>
                            <li><strong>Upward communication:</strong> this type of communication flows from the staff at lower and middle levels to the top management. This enables a feedback to be provided immediately in indicating the success or failure in achieving the desired goals of the organization. The staffs at the lower levels are in a position of asking for clarification of unclear goals and request for resources to improve efficiency in the organization.</li>
                            <li><strong>Horizontal communication:</strong> in this communication, the flow occurs between the heads of the departments or supervisors, who are set and the same level, in which they exchange ideas on common goals in order to improve management operations in the organization.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Informal Communication</h3>
                        <p>This is an unofficial form of communication between groups of people in an organization. The messages are discussed casualty and are not recognized by the management. This form of communication may also be referred to as "grapevine" communication whereby the message is considered to be half-truth. This may eminate from the staff at the lower or middle levels in the organizations.</p>
                        <p>"Grapevine" communication is common in organizations where a certain cadre of staff feels that their management fails to clarify issues. The "grapevine" should not be ignored since it gives a warning of impending issues of concern to the employees, and likewise a chance to ventilate their feelings/views in the organization. The top management should give the organization current information so to avoid such gaps created by this form of communication.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Unconscious (Non-Verbal) Communication</h3>
                        <p>This is a type of communication that is also known referred to as "body language" communication. It is where usually the sender of the message is not aware that their behaviours are sending wrong signals. Such example include when one appears quite casual when giving important information, and the recipient will therefore misrepresent the information because of the manner it was conveyed.</p>

                        <p>This will include intrapersonal communication, interpersonal communication, small-group communication, and mass communication.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Intrapersonal Communication</h3>
                        <p>This is a form of communication that is extremely private and restricted to one self, and it will include the silent conversations that people have within themselves, whereby they juggle roles between the sender and the receiver, who are processing their thoughts and actions. Analysing such process of communication it will be found that it can either be conveyed verbally to someone or stay conferred as thoughts.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Interpersonal Communication</h3>
                        <p>This form of communication takes place between two individuals, which is a one-one-one conversation. Here, the two individuals involved will swap their roles between who is the sender and who is the receiver in order to communicate in a clear manner.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Small-Group Communication</h3>
                        <p>This is a kind of communication that can take place when more than two people are involved. Here, the number of people will be small enough to allow each of the participants to interact and converse with the rest; for example, in a board meeting and press conference. Unless a specific issue is being discussed, small group discussions can become chaotic and difficult to interpret.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Mass Communication</h3>
                        <p>This is a form of communication that is used to reach out to many people at the same time through the media of mass circulation or coverage for example television media, radio, and newspapers.</p>

                            <p><strong>Q. What are the various to effective communication?</strong></p>
                        </aside>
                        <p>Barriers are the factors that prevent communication, and the message may be interfered with by some disturbances such which increases the difficulty in perception or prevents some elements of the message from reaching the receiver. The barriers to effective communication may be due to any breakdown in the six elements of the communication process - including the source, message, channel, receiver, effect, and social setting. They are discussed as follows:</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Barriers Resulting from the Source</h3>
                        <p>The source (sender) should have a sound understanding of his/her audience and a good knowledge of the subject of the message. The audience will determine the level of the language and vocabulary to be used, and thus the source (sender) should appreciate the culture, values, and psychological factors of the audience. There are physical barriers such which may be attributed to climate - such as cold weather, etc. system overload may occur where an individual sends or receives too much information at the same time.</p>
                        <p>The use of appropriate language according to the level and age of the receiver is duly required. Privacy and confidentiality of the patient when taking history is important, and where such is not observed, then the readiness of the recipient to talk freely is restricted hence leading to communication breakdown.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Barriers Affecting the Message</h3>
                        <p>The message is what the sender wishes to convey to the audience. For the message to be well and effectively received, the sender must plan it well with the need of the audience in mind. The sender may ask himself/herself of what he/she wants the receiver to know, how does he/she expect the receiver to feel upon conveying the message to him/her, and does he/she want to change the behaviour of the receiver? In order to avoid failure in communication, one has to address the following:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The message must be expressed in simple language, and it should be short and clear to the point. The delivery of the message should involve proper communication posture, and a stressing of the keywords</li>
                            <li>The message must be problem-cantered. It must address a felt health concern or issue affecting the individual or the community</li>
                            <li>The message should be culturally relevant and not offensive to the values and believes of the community or individuals and religious beliefs.</li>
                            <li>The message must fall within the socio-economic abilities of the audience. Do not propose solutions that are beyond the reach of your audience</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Barriers Resulting from the Receiver</h3>
                        <p>The receiver of the message should be prepared physically, psychologically and socially, such which should enable him/her to readily understand the issue with the message.</p>
                        <p>If the sender slammers and speaks in audibly this could result to poor delivery of message. If the message is received in a noisy environment, then the receiver will not hear it well; nor likewise if it is transmitted to the receiver when he/she is emotionally disturbed.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Barriers Resulting from the Social Setting</h3>
                        <p>The social setting is the environment in which the message is transmitted, and the selected venue for receiving the message had different posters that are not relevant to the health message given, hence, they will at as distractors and hence decreasing the level of concentration. Noise or rain can also result in communication broken down.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Barriers Affecting the Communication Channel/Medium</h3>
                        <p>Communication channels are means by which a message travels from the source to the receiver. A breakdown in communication may occur due to the following factors:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>In verbal communication, the sender may speak in such a low voice that the receiver cannot hear well; for example, when one talks to a large crowd in a low voice without an amplifier;</li>
                            <li>When the channel selected to transmit the message is through the mass media like the radio, television or print media, such as newspapers, films, and magazines, without considering the socio-economic status of the receiver.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Barriers Affecting the Effect/Impact of Communication</h3>
                        <p>The receiver of the message may be emotionally disturbed and therefore does not understand the message as intended. The sender of the message may fail to involve the receiver (audience) in the planning phase and therefore disregard the cultural beliefs of the community</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Barriers Affecting Feedback</h3>
                        <p>Feedback is an evaluation to assess if the intended message is understood by the receiver (or audience). A breakdown in communication occurs when the sender receives a negative response, indicating that he message is not understood.</p>
                        <p>Breakdown in communication may occur:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>If the sender of the message does not clarify all points to enable that the receive understand it;</li>
                            <li>That sometimes the receiver does not understand the message and fails to ask for clarification;</li>
                            <li>That the sender of the message might use symbols that the receiver interprets wrongfully without asking for clarification;</li>
                            <li>That the sender of the message may speak in an inaudible voice, for the audience might not understand the questions asked during the evaluation hence giving a wrong feedback;</li>
                            <li>That the receiver of the message may have a negative or different attitude towards the message given. This can lead to misleading the seriousness of the message; and</li>
                            <li>Overload of the system (too much messages) sent as thus the receiver does not comprehend all the messages</li>
                        </ul>
