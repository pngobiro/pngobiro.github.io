                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Therapeutic Communication</h3>
                        <p>By definition, therapeutic communication is defined as a purposeful form of conversation designed to help a client to achieve identical health-related goals through participation in a focused relationship. Therapeutic conversation helps to make illness bearable by reinforcing self-esteem and supporting the natural healing powers of a person.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">The Purpose of Therapeutic Communication</h3>
                        <p>The purpose of therapeutic communication is to provide a safe place for the client to explore the meaning of the illness and provide information and emotional support that the client needs to achieve to gain maximum health and wellbeing. That is, in short, the nurse functions as a skilled companion, using communication as a primary tool to achieve health goals.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Therapeutic Communication Skills</h3>
                        <p>These include active listening, observation, asking questions, and listening responses, which are further classified as follows:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Active listening responses:</strong> minimal verbal cues, clarification, restatement, paraphrasing, reflection, summarization, silence, and touch;</li>
                            <li><strong>Observation:</strong> facial expression, vocal tones, gestures, and body positions; and</li>
                            <li><strong>Asking questions:</strong> open-ended questions, closed-ended questions, and circular questions.</li>
                        </ul>

                <!-- START: active-listening -->
                <section id="active-listening" class="content-section" aria-labelledby="section-heading-active-listening">
                    <h2 id="section-heading-active-listening" class="section-heading">
                        <span class="heading-icon"></span>
                        <span class="heading-text">Active Listening</span>
                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>This is defined as dynamic and interactive process in which a nurse hears a client's message, decodes its meaning and provides feedback to the client, regarding the nurse's understanding of the message. The following are therapeutic listening responses: minimal verbal cues, clarification, restatement, paraphrasing, reflection, summarization, silence, and touch.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Minimal Verbal Cues</h3>
                        <p>Minimal verbal cues should be simple and encouraging hence leading to ease of communicating interest, which occurs through body languages (such as smiling, nodding, leaning forward, etc), and will be to encourage the clients in order to continue with the story. Having minimal cues will also promote client with comfort in sharing intimate information; and having short phrases, such like "go on", "and", "then", will also provide a steam towards going on.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Clarification</h3>
                        <p>Clarification seeks to understand the message of the client by asking for more information or for elaboration on a point. The strategy is most useful when parts of a client's communication are ambiguous or not easily understood. Failure to ask for clarification when part of the communication is poorly understood means that the nurse will act on incomplete or inaccurate information.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Restatement</h3>
                        <p>This is an active listening strategy used to broaden a client's perspective or when the nurse needs to provide a sharper focus on a specific part of the communication. It is like bracketing a phrase in a paragraph, acting as a brief interruption designed to highlight a defined element of a message.</p>
                        <p>Restatement is effective when the client overgeneralizes or seems stuck in a repetitive line of thinking; for example, "let me see if I have the right..." as a way of putting emphasis onto a point.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Paraphrasing</h3>
                        <p>This is a response strategy designed to help the client elaborate more on the content of a verbal message. The nurse takes the original message and transforms it into his/her own words without losing the meaning. For the client, hearing his/her own words in a slightly different way provides a new means of hearing these concerns within a broader framework. The paraphrase statement is shorter and a little more specific than the clients' initial statement, such as, "let me see if I have this right..."</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Reflection</h3>
                        <p>This is a listening response that focuses on the emotional overtones of a message, such which helps the client to classify important feelings and experience in relation to a particular situation or event. Such is used in the following ways:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Reflection on vocal tone:<br>"I can feel the sense of anger and frustration in your voice..."<br>"I understand how you feel or I know how you feel..."</li>
                            <li>Linking feelings with the content message: "It sounds like you feel     because     "</li>
                            <li>Linking current feelings with the past experience:<br>"It seems as if this experience reminds you of the feelings you had with other health workers."</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The nurse needs to know enough about the client to respond emphatically and accurately to the clients' feelings.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Summarization</h3>
                        <p>This is an active listening skill that is used to review the content and process. Summarization pulls several ideas and feelings together, either from one interaction or a series of interactions. The nurse reduces a lengthy interaction or discussion to a few sentences. A summary statement is particularly useful before moving on to a different topical area.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Silence</h3>
                        <p>Silence used deliberately is a powerful listening response. The use of a pause can be very helpful during this type of interaction since it allows the client to think and/or rethink; while at the same time allowing the nurse to step back for a moment and process on what he/she heard before making his/her response. Long silence becomes uncomfortable, and the silent pause should just be a brief disconnection followed by a verbal comment.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Touch</h3>
                        <p>This is a vital form of communication throughout life, whereby it gives a powerful response for used when words would seem to break the mood. A hand tenderly placed on a frightened mother's shoulder or a gentle squeeze of the hand can speak for more adequately than words in times of deep emotion, whether sadness or joy. Touch can deepen the meaning of the language.</p>

                        <p>This is an important skill of communication that normally elicits non-verbal clues. It is a situation whereby the client communicates without putting the communication in words. There are very many different 'channels' of non-verbal communication, including facial expression, vocal tones, gestures, and body positions (including body movement, touch, and personal space).</p>
                        <p>It is necessary to watch non-verbal clues as they signal how the patients are feeling over a given situation, which are best evidenced through body language. Facial expressions, particularly around the eyes, are a major source of information that can be received when interpreted immediately and accurately. A person's facial expression indicates whether the person is happy, confident, sad, hostile, annoyed, pleased, among other interpretations.</p>

                        <span class="heading-text">Asking Questions</span>
                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Questions are important forms of communication in all phases of the nurse client relationship, and they are a primary means of obtaining information from a client. The information needed and condition of the client help dictate the number and type of questions. These questions fall into three categories, including open-ended questions, closed-ended questions, and circular questions.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Open-Ended Questions</h3>
                        <p>An open-ended question is similar to an essay question, which is open to interpretation and cannot be answered by the 'yes', 'no', or any other one-word response. Such questions are designed to permit the client to express the problem or health need in his/her own words.</p>
                        <p>They give a friendly approach that respects the individual and gives the client as much control as possible in responding,; for example, a good starting question is like this:</p>
                        <blockquote><p>Will you please tell me a little about yourself, and why you came to the clinic today?</p></blockquote>
                        <p>Open-ended questions usually begin with such words like "how", "what", "where", "when", "in what manner", "can you tell me...", and they can be used like in the following sample questions:</p>
                        <blockquote><p>Q. What are your plans after discharge?<br>Q. Tell me about the accident</p></blockquote>
                        <p>These questions are general rather than specific and open to a variety of answers. By using active listening responses, open-ended questions one can elicit more information from the clients. In emergencies or other circumstances when information is needed quickly, it may require the use of focused or closed-ended questions.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Focused Questions</h3>
                        <p>These questions limit the response to certain information area but require more than a "yes" or "no" response. The nurse uses focused questions to obtain data that are more specific. The following are examples of focused questions:</p>
                        <blockquote><p>Q. Tell me more about the pain in your arm<br>Q. You mentioned that you had the problem with your back before, how did this problem develop in the beginning?<br>Q. Can you give me a specific example of what you mean by ....</p></blockquote>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Closed-Ended Questions</h3>
                        <p>These resemble multiple-choice questions with limited answer options. The answer to a closed-ended question limits the expression of clients\ feelings and it may take many questions to obtain the same information. They are useful in emergency situations when the goal is to obtain information quickly and the clients' emotional reactions are of secondary importance.</p>
                        <p>Clients with limited social skills can respond better to closed-ended questions, and such will include the following examples:</p>
                        <blockquote><p>Q. When was your last tetanus shot?<br>Q. Does the pain radiate don your left shoulder and arm?<br>Q. When was your last meal?<br>Q. Have you had these symptoms before?</p></blockquote>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Circular Questions</h3>
                        <p>These questions focus on the interpersonal context in which an illness occurs. They are designed to identify family relationships and differences on the impact of an illness on individual family members. They focus on the impact of an illness or injury on the functioning of the family system. The nurse uses the information the family provides as the basis for additional questions.</p>
                        <p>Consider when the nurse asks a family that is coping with a terminally ill patient, she might ask such a question:</p>
                        <blockquote><p>Q. What has been your biggest challenge in taking care of your mother at home?</p></blockquote>
                        <p>The response of the family members might include such case examples:</p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <p><strong>The Daughter:</strong> my biggest challenge has been finding a balance between caring for my mother and also caring for my children and husband</p>
                            <p><strong>The Son-in-law:</strong> For me, the biggest challenge has been convincing my wife that I can take over for a while in order for her to get some rest; I worry that she will become exhausted.</p>
                            <p><strong>The Mother:</strong> I have appreciated all the help that they give me. My biggest challenge is to continue to do as much as possible for myself so that I do not become too much of a burden to them. Sometimes I wonder about moving a palliative care setting or hospice.</p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p>Other examples of circular questions include:</p>
                        <blockquote><p>Q. Who will be most relieved when father wakes up or gets better?<br>Q. Who is the most anxious or fearful person about this illness?<br>Q. What is the worst thing that could happen because of father's illness?</p></blockquote>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Asking Follow-Up Questions</h3>
                        <p>This comes after the nurse has asked preliminary questions about a topic, whether they have been open, closed, focused, or circular, and/or is there a need to make a follow up so as to get more information. Follow-up questions directly relate to the initial data and ask the client to expand on a particular topic. For example,</p>
                        <blockquote><p>"Now that you have told me about how you handle your diabetic diet in general, can you tell me about any other modifications that you have to make when you are ill or stressed?"</p></blockquote>

                            <p><strong>Q. Develop interpersonal skills that are necessary for establishing a therapeutic nurse-patient relationship</strong></p>
                        </aside>
                        <p>The interpersonal skills that are necessary for establishing a therapeutic nurse-patient relationship will include self-awareness, therapeutic use of self, empathy, self-disclosure, empowerment, and setting limits.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Self-Awareness</h3>
                        <p>This is a process that requires nurses to examine their personal values, personal biases and prejudices that are not projected to the client. It allows them to treat each client with respect - that is, a person having value, even if they cannot approve the patient's character or behaviour.</p>
                        <p>It is about discovery-learning of new information about the self, as well as being aware of the existing biases and prejudice. The nurse should observe their behaviours as well as those of the client, with self-scrutiny and total honesty in assessment of their behaviour in interaction with the patients. The nurse can likewise create a safe trustworthy and caring relationship.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Therapeutic Use of Self</h3>
                        <p>This is the ability to be fully and uniquely present with another human being, and is also defined as a "healing presence". It is the condition of being consciously and compassionately in the present moment with another or with others. Presence involves the capacity to know when to provide help and when to stand back, when to speak frankly and when to hold comments, because the client is not ready to hear them. Being fully present with another brings comfort and strength to the client.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Empathy</h3>
                        <p>This assures a client that the nurse has truly heard and understood the client's perspectives. It can also be described as being able to fully understand the experience of another without loss of self, and as the capacity "to see with the eyes of another, to hear with the ears of another, and to feel with the heart of the other".</p>
                        <p>Empathy allows the nurse to fully perceive the depth of the client's anger, fear, and anxiety without being overwhelmed by it, and such also requires a response from the listener. An accurate empathetic response captures the essence of the client's feelings and both parties that they are talking about the same thing.</p>
                        <p>Empathetic responses allow clients to feel respected, well understood, and well validated, for example, giving a response by quoting "I see you feel overwhelmed by this news..." Likewise, the nurse will be brief and use his/her own words in asking for validation of what he/she is observing. Sometimes, a gentle touch delivered simultaneously can enhance the effect of an empathetic response.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Self-Disclosure</h3>
                        <p>This refers to the intentional revelation of personal experiences or feelings that are similar to those of the patient/client. Appropriate self-disclosure can facilitate the relationship, providing the client with information that is both immediate and personalized.</p>
                        <p>Self-disclosure can be relevant when it fits the goals of the conversation at hand. They are enhanced by the following guidelines in helping clients to open up at a therapeutic level:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The use of self-disclosure to help the clients open up to the nurse, and not to meet the nurse's own needs;</li>
                            <li>Keeping the disclosure process as brief as possible; and</li>
                            <li>The nurse getting not implying that his/her experience is exactly the same as the client's</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Empowerment</h3>
                        <p>This is defined as helping people to develop knowledge skills and other resources that they need so as to set their own health problems and to take a primary role in their health care. It is also described as enabling people to choose to take control over their own lives and likewise make decisions about them.</p>
                        <p>It is the concept of being with a client as a guide and providing direction rather than doing things a client; that is, by choosing treatment options; and setting goals - for example, giving the client information about what to expect after surgery, whom to contact in case of pain or getting to experience side effects.</p>
                        <p>Empowerment emphasizes on allowing clients to do so as much for themselves as possible while providing enough support necessary for them to feel successful. These will get to create self-esteem in them.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Setting Limits (Professional Boundaries)</h3>
                        <p>This is a therapeutic relationship represented with invisible structures imposed by legal moral and professional standards of nursing that respect nurse and client rights. For example, such will include defining time, purpose and length of contact, maintaining confidentiality regarding what the client says and providing an appropriate setting for the relationship in healthcare (that is, maintaining objectivity).</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>In 1952, Peplau described four sequential phases of a nurse-client relationship, each characterized by specific tasks and interpersonal skills. The phases run from preinteraction/orientation phase, working (active intervention), implementation (exploitation) phase, and termination (resolution) phase. Each phase serves to broaden and likewise deepen the scope of emotional connection with client. They are discussed hereunder and summarized in the Phase Table.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Pre-Interaction (Orientation) Phase</h3>
                        <p>This sets the stage for the rest of the relationship, and correlates with the assessment phase of the nursing process. Once the nurse and the client together define the problem in the orientation phase, they can then move on to the working phase.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Working (Active Intervention) Phase</h3>
                        <p>This is sub-divided into two aspects - identification and exploitation. The 'identification' component focuses on mutual clarification of ideas and expectations, and corresponds to the planning phase of the nursing process; while the 'exploitation' component uses the client's personal strengths and community resources to help the client resolve healthcare issues that are parallel to the implementation phase.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Implementation (Exploitation) Phase</h3>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Termination (Evaluation/Resolution) Phase</h3>
                        <p>This phase corresponds with the evaluation phase of the nursing process, where the nurse assists the client in evaluating the resolution of issues that initially brought the client into treatment.</p>
