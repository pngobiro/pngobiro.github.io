                <div class="content-block">
                   <p>There are basically five levels of communication namely:-</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Intra-personal communication</strong>
                           <p>It takes place within an individual although one may talk out loud to him or herself. It is the simplest form of communication i.e. if one had to give a speech the time you will take thinking what you will say is called Intrapersonal communication. It also happens when one is thinking on how to handle or solve some issues to him/her.</p>
                        </li>
                         <li><strong>Inter-personal communication</strong>
                           <p>It is the ability to communicate to one another and be understood by them. This communication happens between two people it is complex because it involves a sender and a receiver and is prone to barriers of communication.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Group communication</strong>
                             <p>This is a communication among a least three to twenty people individually and this type of communication is used for problem solving. It is also a complex level of communication because it involves a sender and a receiver and is always affected by barriers of communication.</p>
                        </li>
                         <li><strong>Mass communication</strong>
                            <p>It is where one person is speaking to many people and the many people are anonymous to him/her. You must use a medium in this kind of communication e.g. electronic and print media. It is normally used in advertisements, news reporting. It is a complex kind of communication since it requires a sender and a receiver and is affected greatly by barriers of communication.</p>
                         </li>
                         <li><strong>Cyber-Matic communication</strong>
                            <p>This is the level of communication that happens between man and machine e.g. computers phones, vehicles ATM machines etc. it is also a complex level of communication since it must have a sender and a receiver and is prone to barriers of communication.</p>
                         </li>
                    </ol>

                <h2>üìö THE 7 CS OF COMMUNICATION</h2>
                 <div class="content-block">
                      <p>Written communication occupies important positions in the communication sphere. Written communication has adequate attention to certain principles necessity. The essential of any written communication are principles of unity coherence and emphasis the principles along with others essentials of effective communication are language, planning and organization and makes the written communication effective.</p>
                     <p>The 7 Cs of communication include:-</p>
                     <ol>
                        <li><strong>Clarity</strong>
                            <p>Communication should be correctly planned and expressed in a logical way and the writing should make sure that the idea moves smoothly from the beginning to the end. The massage must be clear that even the dullest man should understand clearly.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Completeness</strong>
                            <p>It is an essential factor for effective communication. A message should be organized appropriately in such a way that it must include all the important details. An incomplete message can do little to convey the information and persuade the receiver. All the aspects of the message must be grouped and brought together in logical sequence to prepare meaningful thought unit.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Coherence</strong>
                            <p>This is essential for good written communication. Clear communication in simple sentence helps the reader to understand therefore facts and figures must be stated daily in an intelligent manner.
Relation and clarity are two aspects of coherence. Coherence means knitting together of several ideas in a paragraph. Smooth flow acridity and transition aspects should be given effect to and there should not be any scope to a reader to misinterpret, misread or misspell the message.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Conciseness (straight to the point)</strong>
                            <p>This refers to the thought expressed to the fewest words. Consistent to the writing. It is achieved in writing a definite meaning should style and use of precise words. Unnecessary superlative and indirect meaning should be avoided. Care should be taken to use adjectives, judicially avoiding irrelevant details, unnecessary expression and mumble sentences. Avoid vogue words and judgmental description and should be precise and clear.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Credibility</strong>
                           <p>A good writing is always forceful and direct and has a power and capacity to produce a reaction and desired effect. Clarity in writing brings about credibility in writing because it ensures others understand it easily and clearly.
A clear and direct approach makes it possible to achieve the principle of credibility in writing. Other essential of writing like correctness and completeness add to the strength of credibility in writing.</p>
                         </li>
                         <li><strong>Correctness</strong>
                            <p>Without correctness readers may refuse your writing, communication must be correct to tone and style for expression. Spelling, grammar, format, content statistical stress etc
There should not be any inaccurate statement in the message. Efforts must be made to avoid errors and spellings, punctuation. The incorrect written document kills the reader's confidence in the writer. In the same way the incorrect statements and other miscellaneous error of the speaker ruins the listener's confidence in him and may tarnish his image and reliability too. When communication receives error, he/she searches other mistakes in the message automatically. The subject matter of communication must be correct and accurate. The message transmitted must be correct. Accuracy in writing must be achieved by checking correctly demands occur etc figures sometimes must be correct.
Over writing reassures strike over wrong spelling, fault grammar, poor sentence may destruct the readers and leads to misunderstandings therefore it is essential that the sender should verify the information before sending to the receiver. You double check for correctness and before accepting for important decision making the receiver clarify his doubt regarding the accuracy and correctness of the message.</p>
                         </li>
                        <li><strong>Continuity</strong>
                           <p>As far as possible the writer should avoid jargons and a language that is special to science, commerce, technology etc in writing the jargon should not be incorporated for this will make the writing un understandable. Simple and use of fewer words bring about continuity and grace in your writing the effect of good writing depends on its style. If one takes care of pr√©cis correct and clear in writing and if the continuity is contained in writing. The desire effect from the reader is achieved.</p>
