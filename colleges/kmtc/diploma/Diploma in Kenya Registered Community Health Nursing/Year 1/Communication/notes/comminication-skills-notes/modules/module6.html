                 <div class="content-block">
                     <p>A report is a communication of information or advice from someone who has collected and studied the facts to a person who asked for the report. Often the ultimate purpose of writing a report is to provide a basis for decision and action.</p>
                     <p><strong>Types of reports</strong></p>
                       <p>Reports can be transmitted in the form</p>
                        <ul>
                              <li>Conversation</li>

                              <li>Fill in forms</li>
                             <li>Many pages documents.</li>
                        </ul>
                       <p>Reports can also be classified according to</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Length- can be short or long</li>
                             <li>Tone- can be informal, semi formal or formal.</li>
                             <li>Subject matter- engineering, financial, marketing</li>
                            <li>Timing- daily, week ly, monthly, annually</li>
                            <li>Important- is it special, routine or urgent</li>
                             <li>Style- narrative descriptive, expository, pictorial or statistics.</li>
                        </ul>
                      <p>Note! Whatever form of a report takes, it must always be planned and communicated in a way which suits the receiver and their purpose consequently some reports will require very little planning, others will require more. Some report will be spoken others written, some will be short others long.</p>
                    <p><strong>Essentials of good report</strong></p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>The report should be unified i.e. it should be about one subject and should contain nothing that the reader does not need or nothing that is off the subject.</li>
                            <li>It should be complete i.e. include every time the reader wants</li>
                            <li>All information should be accurate and all the reasoning from the facts must be varied.</li>
                            <li>It should present the subject matter according to the logical plan based on logical analysis and classification of the materials.</li>
                            <li>It should be written in a simple consisted style is easy to read and understand.</li>
                            <li>The report should be readily intelligible to all who are likely to read it even though they may not know the details of the other subject.</li>
                           <li>The manner of presentation should make the plan clear so that the reader is never in doubt as to where they are in report and why they are there.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p><strong>Fundamental structure of a report</strong></p>
                        <p>A standard report is always divided into three parts namely</p>
                        <ul>
                           <li>Introduction</li>
                            <li>Body</li>
                            <li>conclusion</li>
                        </ul>
                         <p><strong>a) Introduction</strong></p>
                         <p>The function of introduction is to prepare a reader for the report. The structure generally follows a standard plan which has been found in practice to read the best way of avoiding incoherent, badly proportion and wrongly emphasized openings. The standard plans include</p>
                         <ul>
                            <li>A clear and unambiguous of the real subject</li>
                             <li>An indication of the purpose together with any background information necessary to clear understand of that purpose.</li>
                             <li>A brief description of the methods used to obtain the information.</li>
                             <li>A summary of conclusion, findings and recommendation in their briefest forms.</li>
                             <li>An announcement of the plan on which the body of the report in arrange.</li>
                         </ul>
                         <p>Within the structure the introduction should</p>
                         <ul>
                             <li>Be as brief as consistent with clarity</li>
                             <li>Correctly focus the reader's attentions on your real theme or purpose.</li>
                             <li>Harmonize with what follows i.e. it should promise nothing that is not done later on in the report and it should not appear in any way in consisted with final; section.</li>
                         </ul>
                         <p><strong>b) The body of report</strong></p>
                        <p>It lies between the introduction and final section. In it are set out all the facts such as characteristics of investigation, a detailed explanation of the methodology used the procedure followed and the result obtained.</p>
                       <p><strong>c) Conclusion</strong></p>
                       <p>The function of the final sector is to present clearly, briefly and finally the conclusion reached and recommendation to be made.</p>
                       <p><strong>Report formats</strong></p>
                       <ul>
                           <li>Letter report format- this is presented in the form of a report.</li>
                            <li>Schematic report format- this would use systems heading but still contains the essential elements</li>
                            <li>Mixed report format- combines aspects in a letter and schematic format.</li>
                       </ul>
                      <p><strong>Business reports</strong></p>

                        <p>An oral report is simple and easy to present. It may consist in the communication of an impression or an observation. Sometimes it can be quite useful but a written report is always preferred.</p>
                      <p><strong>Advantages of written reports ones and oral reports</strong></p>
                      <ul>
