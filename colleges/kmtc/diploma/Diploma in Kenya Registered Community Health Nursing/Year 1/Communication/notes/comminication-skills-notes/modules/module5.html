                <h2>üìö SPEECHES AND LISTENING</h2>
                 <div class="content-block">
                    <p>A speech is an art of being able to pass information through a word of mouth or verbally.
The spoken word wields great power. It can stir people to mutinies and rebellions; it can also make them dispirited and down cast. It can turn a hostile mob into a friendly gathering or a friendly gathering into a hostile gathering. It can build tension and it can relax tension. Most successful politician, a political leader, industrialists, business men and sales men success lies in their capability of making an efficient speech.</p>
                     <p><strong>Characteristics of a good speech</strong></p>
                       <ol>
                            <li><strong>It's clear</strong>
                                <p>Clarity is the first best and major characteristic of a good speech. Your speech should be eminently successful in couriering to the audience does not instantly grasp your point you have failed as a speaker</p>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>It is like an informal talk</strong>
                                 <p>A good speech is closer to personal and informal chart between two intimate friends. When you speak there should be a perfect report between you and your audience.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>It is vivid and concrete</strong>
                                 <p>Abstractions kill a speech. So make your speech vivid. Include in it concrete facts easy to comprehend and visualize.</p>
                            </li>
                           <li><strong>It is brief</strong>
                                <p>The concentration of an average audience does not last more than 15-20 minutes and so ideally your speech should not be longer than this unless the audience is motivated to know more. To achieve briefly it's desirable to include only a few points in your speech and elaborate them at some length.</p>
                             </li>
                            <li><strong>It is interacting</strong>
                                 <p>Quotations, anecdotes and humorous touches often make a speech interesting. Quotations should be from accepted authorities. They should be familiar but not worked out. Anecdotes should be new, brief and good tact. Humor should be topical, original, spontaneous and gentle.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>It is audience oriented</strong>
                                <p>A good speech is always tuned to the wan length of the audience and therefore the following points should be put into consideration:-</p>
                                  <ul>
                                      <li>Is the audience a general or specialized one? This will help you determine the depth of the subject that you can touch.</li>
                                      <li>How large is the audience? With a small audience the speech will be more like a chart. In a large gathering you will leave to be tutorial.</li>
                                      <li>What is the age-group of the lecture? Your references and illustration should confirm to the lecture of that particular age group.</li>
                                      <li>What are the social religious, political and economic views and prejudices of the lecture? What is the expected response of the audience?</li>
                                 </ul>
                             </li>
                        </ol>
