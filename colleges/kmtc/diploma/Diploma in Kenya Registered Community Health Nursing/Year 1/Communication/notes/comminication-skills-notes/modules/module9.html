                <h2>üìö PRE'CIS WRITING</h2>
                <div class="content-block">
                   <ul>
                         <li>Pr√©cis is a French word that means a summary, or an abstract.</li>
                        <li>It means a prose passage or composition from which all unnecessary or unwanted ideas and words have been removed in order to turn it unit abridged statement.</li>
                        <li>The word pr√©cis therefore means definite, exact, just or the right amount not loose or vague.</li>
                        <li>A pr√©cis is a concise and a clear statement of substance of a large passage in a connected and readable shape.</li>
                       <li>It must be accurate, brief and clear and is always in a precise writer's own words and about a third of the original passage.</li>
                         <li>Summary and abstract are other words that convey the same idea as a precise and summary is often used synonymously with pr√©cis. However there exists a distinction between the two.</li>
                       <li>A summary can also be in the form of notes with fact headings and sub headings and numbered point beneath them while a pr√©cis is always in a paragraph form.</li>
                       <li>An abstract is a summary constructed by extracting key sentences of a paragraph and putting them together correctly.</li>
                   </ul>
                    <p><strong>OBJECTIVES OF PRECISE WRITING</strong></p>
                     <ul>
                         <li>The objectives of making a precise of a long passage is that the office who has no time to read through the original be given all important ideas in the form of a summary.</li>
                          <li>Therefore the writer of the precise must put in mind the reader which only chance of reading and understanding the salient points of the passage will be through a pr√©cis.</li>
                        <li>The pr√©cis should bring out the most important facts of the passage as briefly and clearly as possible. E.g. a superior may want to know the main points in a finance minister's speech and this can only be done by coming up with a pr√©cis.</li>
                     </ul>
                      <p><strong>QUALITIES OF A GOOD PRE ºCISE</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                           <li>It should give all the important points of the original document so that the reader would lose almost nothing by reading the pr√©cis only.</li>
                           <li>Its sentence must be knit closely, clearly, and concisely.</li>
                            <li>Vague expressions or jumbled phrases have to a rounded and therefore a good pr√©cis just like any other communication should have the following qualities.</li>
                        </ul>
                     <p><strong>Conciseness</strong></p>
                        <p>This quality gives a pr√©cis its name. It's a very desirable quality since many busy men cannot find time to read through long passages or letters and reports and dejects their contents. However a part from the third rule, it can be difficult to say how long a pr√©cis should be just like a man once asked Abraham Lincoln how long a man's legs should be, Lincoln replied just long enough to reach the ground.</p>
                    <p><strong>Clarity</strong></p>
                     <p>The writer of a pr√©cis must make sure he writers what he means and write it clearly since a price is even unintelligible to the reader.</p>
                    <p><strong>HOW TO MAKE A GOOD PRESICE</strong></p>
                    <p>To make a good pr√©cis it's absolutely necessary to understand the original passage/document proper and without their comprehensive one can never turn a long passage into a pr√©cis statement.</p>
                    <p>The following steps should be following in the art of creating a pr√©cis which can only be clear though practice.</p>
                       <ol>
                           <li>Read the passage and try to get the general idea of the theme of the passage.</li>
                          <li>Read the passage again. If possible reread the passage several times and be sure that you have grassed the entire meaning of the material.</li>
                          <li>Underline/highlight all the important facts of the passage</li>
                           <li>Write down a title which sum up the theme of the passage</li>
                            <li>Rewrite in fever words what the author has said by summing up the passage in form of points and use your own language as far as possible.</li>
                             <li>Compare your points with that in passage to make sure that no important point has been overlooked and nothing insignificant has been included.</li>
                             <li>Using your own points, write down the sum and substance of the passage in a well connected and readable paragraph to be used as your rough copy</li>
                              <li>Review and rephrase your rough draft wherever desirable. Keep in mind the ABC of a good pr√©cis.</li>
                              <li>Reconsider the appropriateness of the title and amend if necessary.</li>
                       </ol>
                       <p><strong>TITLE OR HEADLINE</strong></p>
                        <p>Its best to write the title of a pr√©cis after the final draft is ready because by the time the pr√©cis maker will have thoroughly grouped the contrary idea of the original passage.</p>
                         <p>The heading of a pr√©cis must be expressed I a few words the theme of the passage.</p>
                         <p>It should like the headline of a newspaper which tells the reader in a glance what the news is all about.</p>
                         <p>Choosing of correct heading is a sure way that the pr√©cis writer understood the passage thoroughly for its difficult to choose the right topics without comprehending the first/ original passage.</p>
                         <p>There can be more than one title which can rightly head as a pr√©cis and if so the most suitable ones should be collected by the writer and therefore that title that should be selected should be that one that gives the central as main theme of the whole passage in just a few words. Long title should be avoided through.</p>
                          <p><strong>Rules of writing a precise</strong></p>
                         <p>The following rules must be followed for writing a pr√©cis.</p>
                          <ul>
                            <li>Determine the theme of the passage very carefully. It's important to final out the central idea or the theme of the original passage. Analyze the passage to final out and separate the major and main points from the minor ones and main the various points become major only in relation to the central or main theme of the passage.</li>
                            <li>Pr√©cis is not the reproduction of important points. Don't form your pr√©cis by reproducing a few sentences and deleting others. Pr√©cis writing is not an art of selection and deleting, it's the art of remodeling.</li>
                           <li>Brevity is good but not at the cost of clarity. Brevity is the soul of pr√©cis writing, but brevity is not to be achieved at the cost of clarity. If the addition or retention of a few words adds to the clarity of you pr√©cis they should be included by all means. Excess economy, leading to ambiguity and obscurity must be avoided.</li>
                           <li>Your pr√©cis ought to be intelligible even to a person who has not read the regional passage. It's extremely important since he who is familiar with original passage enjoys an additional advantages, since he is in a precision to compare the two version and the final out how far he/she has faithfully reproduced the facts or preserved the spirit of the original, while he who has not read the original passage has to judge your performances only from what you have written.</li>
                            <li>Use your own language- a pr√©cis has to be written as far as possible, in your own words, and therefore it's a test of your own comprehension as of your expression. While summarizing the original ideas you will often find that the language of the passage is a more hindrance them a help. One cannot help retaining a few significant phrases or technical term but is sure the sentence structure entirely your own.</li>
                            <li>Pr√©cis is always written in the third person- it the author has used the autobiographical form of narration or description. You should change the form. You can begin you're pr√©cis by saying another say..... Secondly, and therefore you should avoid the use of direct speech in your pr√©cis. Be careful passage is in direct speech because the use of indirect speech will makes it more compact.</li>
                            <li>Use your discretion if the passage contains statistical information- if statistical figures have been used to corroborate contain generalized facts you safely unit them, but if the figures are basic to the very understanding of the general drift of the passage they have to be retained</li>
                            <li>Observe proportion- a pr√©cis should be well proportion and each part of the original passage dealt with in accordance to its relative's importance and not according to the space according to it.</li>
                             <li>No comments place- a pr√©cis writer is not supposed to give any comment either appreciative or critical on the ideas expressed in the passage. The writer's obligation is to interpret faithfully and not evaluate the mind of the author of the original passage.</li>
                            <li>Reproduce the passage to it's a third- unless otherwise indicated, the writer of the pr√©cis is required to reduce the passage to a third of its original length.</li>
                          </ul>

                         <li>The word is derived from a French word ‚Äúessays‚Äù which means attempts.</li>
                         <li>An essay therefore is a literary composition on any subject a topic, which is not harp hazily written but comprises of paragraphs which are logically arranged and connected with one another.</li>

                    <p><strong>The art of essay writing</strong></p>

                            <li>It has assumed a great importance in competitive examination.</li>
                            <li>It's thought to be the most effective test of the ability of a candidate to express his thoughts on a topic of general interest in simple, unambiguous and impressive English, and the marks allotted to it is very high.</li>
                             <li>It's a very sensitive form of self expression and a harmonious blending of thoughts and expressions.</li>
                             <li>If the thought content is inadequate the essay becomes verbose and if the language does not properly express the thought it becomes clumsy and unimpressive.</li>

                             <li>It requires specialized skills which can be acquired only through very patient practice.</li>
                         </ul>
                     <p><strong>Guidelines for Essay Writing</strong></p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Define the scope of the Essay-</strong> it's always important to define the scope of the subject in an essay writing and its where most students falter. Many take cue from a key word in the title of the essay and write down all they know about it, and hardly realize how much off the track they are e.g. the problems of industrialization, the evils of industrialization and should Kenya be industrialized are these titles that requires different reaction when coming up with an essay about them.</li>
                            <li><strong>Jot/write/note down the ideas-</strong> after defining the scope of the assay, start thinking about it and jot down the ideas as they occur to you. The ideas should be relevant to the given subject and carry sufficient weight in them, since an essay cannot be built upon trivialities or a mere jumble of irrelevant ideas. Take care that you don't include irrelevant or shallow and you do not forcibly stretch your ideas and avoid long casual looking illustrations.</li>
                           <li><strong>Prepare the outline-</strong> arrange your ideas logically in a reflective essay and chronological one in a narrative one so that if you are writing about an event describe it as if it happened but if your subject requires arguments then they should be arranged logistically. Proper arrangement can often make up even for lack of material and your essay must have an impression that it is a well integrated pattern of thoughts.</li>
                           <li><strong>Think of attractive beginning-</strong> you must decide on how to begin your essay, and your introduction should be fresh, original and arresting, but relevant to the subject. This can be achieved by starting an essay by some observation of your own or with some quotation of a known writer, if you can think of it on a spur of the moment.</li>
                            <li><strong>The conclusion has to be stated clearly and firmly-</strong> the conclusion has to be thought forehand, even before you lay the first brick of your essay so that you can know where you will put the last one. In a descriptive as narrative essay you can sum up with the impact of the scene, the person, or the even left on your mind. In a reflective essay you can conclude by giving your own views on the subject but always be careful so that you don't leave your conclusion vague or give the impression that you have said the last word on the subject</li>

                     <ol>
                        <li><strong>Develop different points in different paragraphs-</strong> with the help of the outlines prepare clearly develop your thoughts point by point. The thought should be done in a logical manner and not in a jumbled way. Dividing the essay into various paragraph will helps in keeping your thought untangled.</li>
                          <li><strong>Revise if there is time-</strong> it's a good habit to revise your essay and it pays. The aim is to eliminate repetition of words and phrase, ambiguity of ideas or style or any digression that might have kept in.</li>
                        <li><strong>Never be irrelevant-</strong> the temptation of introduction beautiful ideas or beautiful words and phrase because they just happen to be beautiful should be resisted at all cost. However beautiful a remark, if it's out of place, it fails to attract, and therefore pertinence of an idea should be the first consideration not its beauty. Moralizing or preaching a sermon is also undesirable as it is vague generalizing, arbitrary conclusions, violent statements, false accusations, and dogmatic assertions which should be carefully avoided.</li>
                         <li><strong>Do not overload your essay with statistics-</strong> essay in bank nationalization or food crisis might need figure to endorse your stand but you should not forget that you are not writing as a student's of economics. The examiner wants to see the clarity of your ideas and the beauty of your expression, so don't allow statistics destroy the beauty of your essay.</li>
                         <li><strong>Use simple language-</strong> try to keep your language simple and elegant, simplicity is a big virtue in essay writing. Avoid verbosity, pompousness and garrulity and it's not advisable to write long, complete sentences unless you are confident that you can handle them deftly.</li>
                         <li><strong>Develop the habit of reading newspaper and periodicals-</strong> one can never write a good essay unless you have a good knowledge of the subjects, a fairly good vocabulary and a style of your own. For extensive knowledge and rich vocabulary one has to develop an interest of reading newspaper, periodicals as well as good books. You should not only train yourself to read but also to appraise what you are reading.</li>
