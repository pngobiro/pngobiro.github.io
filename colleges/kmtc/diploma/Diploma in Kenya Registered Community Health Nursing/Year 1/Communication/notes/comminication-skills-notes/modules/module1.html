                <div class="content-block">
                    <p>Communication is a process that involves transmission of information, ideas, emotion, skills and knowledge from one person to the other by use of simple words, figures, symbols, pictures, graphs and illustrations.</p>
                    <p>Communication can also be described as a way through which people relate to each other by transmitting messages and ideas to one another in a bit to establish comments among themselves. This communication is not necessarily communication of expressing ideas and feelings in words or in written. When you are angry with someone you can communicate with someone by giving a slap. People communicate through their dressing mode, the way they talk, look, smile etc.</p>
                   <p>The type of emotion you have shown is a physical or emotion expression. It is primarily through words that we communicate ideas the words are simply sign or symbol that present ideas e.g. how a symbols, idea or structure is used as a living quarter, however other people may have different ideas about the word house.</p>
                    <p>There is a need to develop the ability to properly interpret reactions what the cleaning of the eye means when someone is talking. It shows something: nodding, founding of some areas e.g. arms</p>

                <h2>üìö Social Communication</h2>
                <div class="content-block">
                   <p>This is a communication within a social setting (parents and other relatives and their kids). Social communication is always relaxed, informal and most of the times friendly and as a lot to do with spoken language in the words used and their organization.</p>
                   <p>In social communication we learn:-</p>
                     <ol>
                          <li> What we can and cannot do or say to certain people</li>
                          <li>How far we can go in terms of what subject and forms of expression are acceptable to different people</li>

                <h2>üìö Business Communication</h2>
                <div class="content-block">
                    <p>Anyone working is always involved in business communication. It is always organized carefully and more concerned with having things done than with exchanging pleasantries. It is always formal in nature and goes straight to the point.</p>

                <h2>üìö Comparison between Business and Social Communication</h2>
                <div class="content-block">
                    <p>In social telephone is an instrument for having a chat while in business it is a way of conveying information quickly and cheaply.</p>
                     <p>Social letters are full of personal news and are informal in language and style while in business letters contain factual and essential information, much shorter and use more formal style.</p>
                      <p>Social talk is unhurried, uses slangs and other expressions to be understood by a small group while business communication is carefully planned, carried out quickly as time is valued and its grammatical in its instructions.</p>
                       <p>Therefore business communication is planned in a lay out and expression and composed according to clear objective and social communication follows no rigid structure and may be spontaneous.</p>
                       <p>Communication plays a very important and in business the idea must be clear, concise and direct otherwise time and resources will be wasted as those in the receiving end try to understand what is being said.</p>

                    </figure>
                        <p><strong>Sender</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Comes up with ideas to be passed across</li>
                                 <li>He is the initiator of all the communication process.</li>
                                 <li>Must encode the message</li>
                                 <li>He must find away to send that message ie selects a channel which to send the message to the receiver.</li>
                             </ul>
                         <p><strong>Encoding</strong></p>
                         <p>Is putting the message in the simplest form that a receiver can understand and be able to reason on the same line with the sender of the same message</p>
                    <p><strong>Message</strong></p>
                    <p>This is always the information, emotions, and skills, ideas or knowledge the senders intends or want to send to the receiver. It can be in a written, verbal or non verbal form. It is generally purposed to provide/produce a reaction from the receiver.</p>
                     <p><strong>Channel/medium/ media</strong></p>
                    <p>It is referred to as means of communication through which messages are passed to the receiver e.g. print media, electronic media and by word of mouth.</p>
                    <p><strong>Receiver</strong></p>
                    <p>It is a group of people or a person to whom the communication is intended for. This is targets audience of the sender and therefore decodes the message in order to give it the meaning.</p>
                    <p><strong>Decoding</strong></p>
                    <p>This is a situation where the receiver of the message digests the information received to be able to understand what the sender wants. Decoding is trying to put meaning to the message received for one to produce the feedback or reaction. The receiver of the message can decide to take in or reject the information he/she has received and this can only happen after decoding or digesting it.</p>
                    <p><strong>Feedback</strong></p>
                    <p>It is the response or reactions from the receiver in a communication process. It provides the sender with knowledge of weather the message served its purpose or not.</p>
                     <p><strong>Barrier/noise</strong></p>
                     <p>This is anything that will interfere with communication process e.g. poor timing, poor signal, language, attitude, age and sex</p>
