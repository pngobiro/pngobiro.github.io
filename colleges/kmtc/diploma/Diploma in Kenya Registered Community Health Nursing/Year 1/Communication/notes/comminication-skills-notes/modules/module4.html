                     <p>Words are said to have no meaning but they represent arbitrary meaning associated with it. A word has a variety of meanings and the meaning attributed to the word by the communicator may not be the same as that of the receiver attributed meaning of that word.</p>
                     <p>A word can have a different meaning to different people at different occasions. It is found by experts that people attributed 14,000 different meaning to 500 commonly used English words therefore the sender and the receiver are many at times likely to contribute different meaning to the same word. Sometimes they may use different word to communicate the same meaning.</p>

                 <div class="content-block">
                    <p>This makes our message more difficult and unless effective. Our defaulters and tongue fumbles when we probe into our brain for a suitable word/phrase the words have different connotative and denotative meaning. The communicator needs to know them clearly. If the receiver does not understand that he cannot comprehend sentences.</p>

                 <div class="content-block">
                   <p>Poor knowledge of the above mentioned is a barrier to verbal communication. A good vocabulary is useless unless communicator acquires the knowledge of how ton uses it in a sentence. More than ever by the people involved in written or communication today must have superior grammar skills because an understanding of grammatical structures provides excellent.</p>

                <h2>üìö Physical Barriers</h2>
                 <div class="content-block">
                    <p>This refers to all physical interference that will affect the effectiveness of any communication process.</p>
                     <ol>
                        <li><strong>Noise</strong>
                            <p>This interferes with the transmission of the signals. Thus a disturbance is usually in the form of sounds. It can be visual. Audio or written forms technical or physical noise refers to loud noise of the machines which make it difficult for any listener to receive the wanted message. Visual noise can be experienced when a committee member arrives late at the meeting hall and interrupts the conversation.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Time</strong>
                            <p>Time can act as a barrier to communicate in several ways e.g. if the employee does not communicate with their supervisors for a long time. A guest who arrives at midnight will be able to communicate well with the host who might feel embarrassed or disturbed in his sleep.</p>
                        </li>
                         <li><strong>Distance</strong>
                            <p>The distance between the communicator and the receiver can be a strong barrier to communicator and the receiver can be a strong barrier to communicate if the technical devices of communication such as telephone are not available to link them.</p>
                         </li>
                         <li><strong>Age</strong>
                            <p>The older workers feel socially isolated and insecure because of the widening gap of communication between the older and younger workers.</p>
                         </li>
                           <li><strong>Gender</strong>
                            <p>This sounds to a distinguished honest and appropriate expression of a female's thoughts, opinions and beliefs.</p>
                         </li>

                <h2>üìö Social/Psychological Barriers</h2>
                <div class="content-block">
                    <p>This is how we identify ourselves, interpret messages and see things according to what we want to see. Thus we listen and interpret favorably messages that boost our image and reject those threatening our image.</p>
                     <ol>
                        <li><strong>Status Consciousness</strong>
                            <p>Status is a position or social rank of a person in a group. It depends on the person's abilities power and authority importance. Job skills and reflects responsibility placed on an individual by the other people in the society. The people of the lower status are normally afraid to communicate unpleasantly and unfavorably to the high status. People fear that the unpleasant facts communicated to their supervisor might bring adverse effects on them. These assumptions prove serious barriers to communicate barriers to communicate between them.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Attitude and values</strong>
                            <p>When a message is unfavorable to the receiver, he cannot be easily persuaded by it. The people in terms of their attitudes and values and opinions age the barriers to an effective communication.</p>
                        </li>
                          <li><strong>Abstracting</strong>
                            <p>We cannot communicate every detailed of our experience to others we also focus our attention on some details and do not bother the rest. This will automatically contribute in effective communication to the receiver.</p>
                         </li>
                          <li><strong>Closed mindedness/Resistance to change</strong>
                            <p>A person may close his mind to communicate reception, if he considered himself to be a person who knows all about a particular subject. It is very difficult to communicate with a man who has deeply rooted prejudiced mind; such a man is prepared to receive any message on a subject about which he assumes to know everything. This too will bring ineffective communications.</p>
                         </li>
                        <li><strong>Bad listening</strong>
                             <p>Misunderstanding and conflicts can be reduced for people would listen to the message with enough attention. Most people do not listen very well due to various destruction, emotions, excitement indifference lack of interest in message contents are strong barriers to communication.</p>
                        </li>
                         <li><strong>Emotions</strong>
                             <p>Negative emotions are obstacle in the communication. The perplexed, nervous and excitement state of mind never allows smooth flow of communication.</p>
                         </li>
                         <li><strong>Defensive and fear</strong>
                             <p>This is the compelling need to justify ourselves even when we know that we are very wrong and fear is an effect of great potency in determining what an individual will perceive, thing and do. Its evidence of anxiety and tension and gives rise to slow thinking.</p>
                         </li>
                          <li><strong>The source of communication</strong>
                            <p>The communication may not be effective if the receiver has any suspicion or prejudice against the source of communication. This is because people tend to react to their attitude of the source than facts themselves.</p>
                         </li>
                          <li><strong>Inattentiveness</strong>
                           <p>People tend to become inattentive while receiving messages especially those containing new ideas. Sometimes people get destructed. At times after</p>
                         </li>
                        <li><strong>Faulty transmission</strong>
                            <p>This can happen during translation which should be in simple language. During this process of interpretation, simplification and translation a part of the message gets lost or distorted.</p>
                         </li>
                          <li><strong>Poor Retention</strong>
                            <p>People tend to retain just 50% of what they have been told. Poor retention may lead to imperfect response which may hinder the communication process.</p>
                         </li>
                           <li><strong>Unsolicited Communication</strong>
                            <p>People don't pay much attention to unwelcome or unwanted kinds of information.</p>
