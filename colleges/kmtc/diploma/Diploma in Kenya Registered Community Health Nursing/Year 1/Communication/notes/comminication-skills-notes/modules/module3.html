                <div class="content-block">
                     <p>There are basically two broad types of communication that can further be subdivided into so many others according to the direction of low of the information, relationship between the sender and the receiver and even the means adopted.</p>
                    <p>The two types of communication are:-</p>
                      <ol>
                           <li>Internal communication</li>

                <h2>üìö Internal Communication</h2>
                 <div class="content-block">
                     <p>This is communication that happens within an organization e.g among workers/employees, from the management to the employees or from the employees to the management. It is simply the exchange of information internally Internal communication can also happen in two ways which is either Formal communication or Informal communication</p>
                       <p><strong>a) Informal Communication</strong></p>
                        <p>Internal communication can happen internally in a formal or official way. When communicating formally we can make use of</p>
                         <ul>
                            <li>Emails</li>
                             <li>Letters</li>
                             <li>Faxes</li>
                             <li>Job specification</li>
                         </ul>
                      <p><strong>b) Informal Communication</strong></p>
                        <p>Communication internally can also happen in an informal manner which may not be official but socially. It happens through</p>
                         <ul>
                             <li>Verbal Communication</li>
                             <li>Non-Verbal Communication</li>
                              <li>Gossips/Grapevine Communication</li>
                         </ul>
                      <p><strong>c)</strong> Internal communication can also be classified according to the direction of flow of the message, means of communication adopted, relationship between the sender and the receiver and methods and equipments used.</p>

                <h2>üìö Internal Communication according to the flow of the message</h2>
                <div class="content-block">
                      <p><strong>a) Vertical communication</strong></p>
                       <p>In this case the information either flows from the management to junior employees or from the junior employees to the management. It is also referred to as upward or downward communication as shown in the diagram below.</p>
                       <p><strong>b) Diagonal communication</strong></p>
                       <p>In this case information flows diagonally whereby a senior officer in a different department shares information with a junior person in a different department and vice versa.</p>
                       <p><strong>c) Horizontal communication</strong></p>
                        <p>In this case the information is shared among members of the same organization that holds the same status eg when head of departments meet to share information.</p>

                <h2>üìö External Communication</h2>
                 <div class="content-block">
                    <p>This is a situation where the organization exchanges information with the outside world or it external individuals and firms. This also happens in two ways where we have information generated and information needed.</p>
                     <p><strong>a) Information generated</strong></p>
                        <p>Information generated is the type of communication that comes from the organization or company targeting the outside world, individuals or other firms.</p>
                         <p>Some of the people the company may be targeting may include the customers whom the company will be informing them of the availability and cost of their goods and services especially through adverts.</p>
                         <p>The other group would be the local residents whom the company will be informing them of pollution and job opportunities in the organization/company.</p>
                         <p>The company may also target the government bodies in their external communication where they will be informing them of the profits and loss data and VAT returns of the company in a financial year.</p>
                     <p><strong>b) Information needed</strong></p>
                     <p>This is the external communication where the company or the organization receives information from the outside world. Some of the people who may communicate to the organization include the Government bodies who will be giving Laws and EU regulations, statistics on industry to the company. Others are customers who will be placing their orders and market research data to the company. Others are suppliers who will be telling the organization of their prices and delivery dates.</p>

                <h2>üìö VERBAL COMMUNICATION</h2>
                 <div class="content-block">
                    <p>Verbal communication refers to spoken messages. We use or transmit sounds. All communication (verbally) generally involves both verbal and none verbal symbols. Mostly we spend great deal of the time participating in verbal communication both in speakers and listeners. Written communication means communication through written materials or printed words.</p>
                    <p>This is primarily verbal in nature however there is a non verbal dimension in written communication also like printed material is formal in nature while handwritten communication also like printed material is formal in nature while handwritten are personal touch.</p>
                    <p>Both verbal and written deals with correction and sending of messages. They however defer in ways which they are processed. Oral messages are continuous with words and sound spoken or and altered in connected ways. This are processed collectively with no emphasis/flow on individual word but in written communication words are distinct from each other being surrounded by wide space in all sides. Written or printed words are processed as individual units. Verbal and written communication also defers in form and style while oral communication is person spontaneous and flexible. Written communication is more formal and follows rules of grammar strictly.</p>

                <h2>üìö EFFECTIVE VERBAL COMMUNICATION</h2>
                <div class="content-block">
                     <p>For one to be an effective verbal communicator there are several factors that you have to put into consideration.</p>
                     <ol>
                         <li><strong>Pronunciation</strong>
                             <p>All the language units must be pronounced properly and clearly. The message will never be intelligible unless articulation every syllable. Sometimes it happens that a person who is able to articulate is able to pronounce property. The words in English must be stressed into exact syllable.</p>
                         </li>
                         <li><strong>Clarity, conciseness and completeness</strong>
                             <p>It is essential that the message should be brief and conscience to the point and complete or every side aspect. The briefing should not be achieved at the cost of clarity and completeness. Too much talking may lead to misunderstanding and over communication but too little may lead to understanding and under communication.</p>
                         </li>
                         <li><strong>Vocabulary</strong>
                             <p>They communication must have good vocabulary. He should use the best words to convey correct meaning if the person who communicates orally has inadequate vocabulary. The listener will receive incorrect and confused meaning.</p>
                         </li>
                         <li><strong>Self confidence</strong>
                              <p>If the communicator lacks self confidence, it is likely that he will not be able to emphases the message on the listener. He must have sufficient knowledge on the subject that he intend to talk about.
He must plan his message carefully before importing it to the receiver. The logical sequence of various idea of a message is an outcome of organizing and planning the message. Adequate planning preparation and organization of the message help the speaker to rise his moral and self confidence.</p>
                         </li>
                           <li><strong>Pitch</strong>
                            <p>There are three patterns:-</p>
                             <ul>
                                <li>Rising pitch</li>
                                <li>Falling pitch</li>
                                <li>Dividing pitch</li>
                             </ul>
                            <p>It is essential to use the correct pitch of sound the vacation is the pitch sounds. Can help the speaker to create interest and hold the attention of the listeners. The variation of sounds can help the speaker to create influence and hold the attention of the listeners.</p>
                         </li>
                         <li><strong>Tone and style</strong>
                            <p>The message must make appeal not only to the intellect but also to the heart of the listener. The words impact the intended meaning when they are one spoken in the tone and style that suit the occasion. The tone of the voice gives the listeners idea about the feeling associated with the word.</p>
                         </li>
