                    <p><strong>Planning and conducting an interview</strong></p>

                            <li><strong>Preparation-</strong> the preparation for an interview should consider the purpose of the interview, important information required and familiarizations with it a convenient setting and the people involved in the interview.</li>

                         </ul>
                   <p><strong>How to conduct yourself during an interview</strong></p>
                        <p>Part of your preparation should be to anticitipate the questions that you might be asked. Your certificate and testimonials should be well prepared. Remember to carry only the originals of all this to an interview room. They should be kept in a neat closed folder that can protect documents from dirt, sun rains, and handling to avoid contamination.</p>
                        <p>Avoid A4 envelops size for keeping the certificates they are easily prone to wear and tear and further more it does not work well for your image. Imagine walking into an interview well dressed with an old brown soup stained envelope turn at the edges.</p>
                        <p>Most important however your appearance for that interview and the impression is the last that you will create in this process. Always remember first impression is the last impression the manner in which we dress speaks volumes to support ourselves, dress constitutes a vital part, it doesn't need to be a brand new but should be clear, neat and well fitting.</p>
                        <p>For an interview on should dress formally which include one foot wear which should be well polished, neat and clean. You may be academically bright, well mannered but the dressing style and hair could just let you down.</p>
                        <p>The miniskirts or hipsters are no if you are going for a formal job unless it is a modeling job. Avoid trendy wear i.e. design casuals like jeans, tight fitting shirts, screaming colors, color clashing, stylish hairs, excessive make ups, canvas, open shoes, military or timberlands boots. The dressing cord should be strictly formal. For men a well cut out and neat suit should do. You cannot wear a blue court and a red trouser and white shoes.</p>
                        <p>The preferable color should be black, grey and blue. These colors reflect a serious person. A blue court and a grey trouser are okay. Any court won on a black trouser looks good. Avoid neckties that are shouting in color e.g. bright red, yellow and cream colors. Stick to conservative colors (black, blue and grey). Neckties should be well tied, so that length reaches the area below the stomach. For ladies, also stick to these conservatives colors. A skirt, trouser or suit of the above colors will do well. Neck scurf would be a good compliment. Avoid long skirts, if it is trouser it should not be too tight. High heeled shoes are okay as long as they make you feel comfortable. Don't put them on if they give you problems when walking. Surely you would not want to trip one when you have walked out the interview room.</p>
                        <p>The hair recommended one is combined it backwards and then typing it with a ribbon, hair band or you could plait it in cornrows have it blown out but at least it should be neat and smart. For men we recommend well trimmed hair. Avoid bold or punk shaving. Teeth should be clean; no foul smell should manatee from your mouth, body as clothes. If you use any kind of perfume, it should not be too strong. Make sure that your nails are clean. Before you enter the interview room always knocks at the door even its wide open. Don't just walk in and when allowed in you should walk briskly with confidence don't sit wait to be told. Shoulders should be pulled up and head held erect. Salute the interviewers in a polite manner. Don't wave to them. Reach others nicely in a proper way of shaking hands. Handshaking must be warm, heartily and of a good grip accompanied by a warm and polite good morning, good afternoon or good evening.</p>
                        <p>Carry yourself gracefully. Ask the interviewer whether you can take a sit e.g. may I have a sit will be polite than just offering yourself a sit. Don't cross your legs or arms, arms should be well rested on the table with minimal gesturing and gesture only when you stress a point and always make direct eye contact while talking to others because eyes reflect what is inside the heart.</p>
                        <p>Avoid using expressions such as ammm........., yeah, ok, I mean eeeee........ Make yourself audible enough; voice must be firm, crisp and ringing. Avoid clearing your throughout as you attempt to speak. Blowing your nose during an interview is a minus.</p>
                        <p>This doesn't work to your verbal skills and manners. Smile and if the interviewers crack jokes don't laugh too loudly. Always appear energetic, active and keen. Show enthusiasm, urge and interest, towards the interviewers, always be self confidence and optimistic but don't overdo.</p>
                         <p>If you are asked questions that you do not know well. Always admit you do not know rather than attempting to answer something you do not know.</p>
                        <p>They are really not testing your knowledge but the manner approach that you use. After the interview is over, remember to thank the interviewers for their time and finish with a remark ‚ÄúI hope to hear from you soon". Walk out of the room with the same confidence and always close the door behind you gentle without turning your back.</p>
                         <p>Formal report is one in which is presented according to as established procedure to a prescribed authority. Informal are usually in form of a person to person communication. It may range from short statements of facts on a single page to a more developed presentation taking several pages. An informal is usually submitted in the form of a letter or memorandum.</p>
                  <p><strong>Tricks for a job hunting interview</strong></p>
                       <p>Some of the questions asked are:</p>
                           <ul>
                               <li><strong>Tell me something about yourself.</strong> Say you will be happy to talk about yourself and ask what the interviewer wants to know. If this point is clarified, response if not tell why you feel your skills will contribute to the job and the organization.</li>
                                <li><strong>What is important to you in a job</strong> mention specific rewards other than pay cheque e.g. challenging the feeling of the accomplishment and knowing that you have made a contribution. The feeling that I have succeeded in accomplishment a difficult task and the ability to overcome any challenges caused by my job.</li>
                                <li><strong>Why do you want to work for this organization</strong> site its reputation? The opportunities it offers and the working conditions. Stress that you want to work for this organization and not just any other organization. The kind of work your esteemed organization is involved in particularly interacts me, or this a reputable and successful organization in the area of customer service and rehabilitation or street children and I have been always yearning to be part of that success which I believe I will be able to achieve if given a chance to work with you.</li>
                              <li><strong>Why should we employ you</strong> point out your academics preparation, job skills and enthusiasm about working for the firm. Mention your performance in school or previous employment as evidence of your ability to learn and to become productive quickly. If the job involves the management responsibility refer to past activities as part of proof of your ability to get along with others and work as a team.</li>
                             <li><strong>If we hire you how long will you stay with us</strong> as long as my position allows me to learn and to advance at a pace with my abilities.</li>
                            <li><strong>What is your greatest strength?</strong> I can see something that needs to be done and do it or am willing to make decision or I can work well with others or I can organize my time efficiently.</li>
                           <li><strong>What is your greatest weakness?</strong> Identify one or two such as the following; I tend to drive myself too hard or I expect others to perform beyond their capabilities and I like to see the job done quickly and am critical if it's not.</li>
                          <li><strong>What you did not like in the previous jobs you held</strong> discuss the things you did not like but avoid making negatives reference to any of your former employers.</li>
