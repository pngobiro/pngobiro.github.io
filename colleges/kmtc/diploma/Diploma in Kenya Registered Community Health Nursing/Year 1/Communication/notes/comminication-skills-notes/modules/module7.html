                     <p><strong>How to write a job application letter</strong></p>
                       <p>Application letter are probably one of the most important documents you will ever write in your life</p>
                       <p>This is sometimes referred to as ‚Äúcover letter‚Äù and is normally accompanied by a resume. What should be born in mind is that this letter is what sells you to the employer.</p>
                       <p>It's like a product which is well researched , advertised promoted, priced, distributed, and added value so that it can attract many clients as possible with the hope that one will eventually buy it.</p>
                       <p>The down side of it is that, there will be quite a number of people will be jostling for the same position and the competition will be stiff to the point of retrace.</p>
                       <p>The struggle goes down to survival for the fittest and defiantly you will need some survival skills to make it.</p>
                        <p>Ask yourself what makes me to stand out of the crowd to convince this employer that I have what it takes to do this job? Why should the employer hire you than someone else?</p>
                        <p>The employer on the other hand when looking at your letter is asking himself; what is it for me? How can this person be of value to me? What do I stand to gain if I hire him or her?</p>
                        <p>Application are not written to get the job rather it is to convince the employer to give you an interview where you will get a better opportunity to sell yourself more and even better, before the employer makes a decision to here you or not.</p>
                        <p>In this letter you must therefore makes a good imprison of yourself</p>
                        <p>Make your letter strong enough to convince your potential employer that your distinctive background qualifies you for the job, but the letter should not be long that may turn your readers off.</p>
                        <p>Remember to use miniskirts analogy the letter just like a miniskirt; it should be short enough to arouse interest but long enough to cover the subject.</p>
                        <p>Present the details that you would want to make your reader to want to keep reading it.</p>
                         <p>The letter should not be more than a page long, in the length balance your words to fit in the length.</p>
                         <p>Be profession, make sure your letter is professional I formal, style, grammar.</p>
                         <p>Maintain a cautious positive bright time throughout the letter and estimate all errors.</p>
                         <p>Remember that the readers/ employer often deselect the applicants because of the appearance of the letter.</p>
                        <p><strong>Writing a winning application letter/cover letter</strong></p>
                           <p>First for the purpose of introduction it's important to obtain a name for your salutation if you don't have one. For example you might call the company and ask who receives the application instead of generally addressing the letter as dear sir/madam.</p>
                           <p>If would be better if it was addressed to specifically someone senior e.g. ‚ÄúDear Mr. Juma John"</p>
                            <p>Specify the position you are applying for, where you got the information about the organization e.g. I wish to apply for the position of a reporter as a advertised in the daily nation of august 7, 2009.</p>
                             <p>The kind of work your organization is involved particularly interest me. It would be helpful to conduct a reconnaissance study learn as much as possible about the people you want to work for.</p>
                            <p>This will enable you to speak for the right people and address their needs properly. It also shows that you have been sufficiently keen to learn something about them.</p>
                             <p>"Every time you get a letter from a job applicant which refers to something my company has done or reacts with a quickened interest in me‚Äù says human resource manager.</p>
                             <p>Provide a general statement of how your education and work experience and work experience(if any) qualify you for the position e.g. my diploma in mass communication and journalism combine with computer courses and work experience, prepare me for this position. You could also start with this statement like (I hold a high diploma in mass communication and journalism with a bias in a marketing and public relation, my major interest include ‚Äúwriting and reporting of political issues affecting our daily lines, writing educative articles and generally bringing up a positive change in the whole society through my writing and reporting. Make it abundantly clear that you are ready to work for the people you are writing for. Quote statements like I believe my educational qualifications and my skills makes me the right person for this job.</p>
                            <p>There'll if you have ever worked even as a volunteer, quote this experience. It doesn't matter if you worked for a day or two. State the kind of work you were doing, task and responsibility. What were your duties, what have you gained from the experience these would include skills such as team player, interpersonal skills, interpersonal motivation etc. remember that these skills must be related to the needs of your potential employer just must relate the needs of your customers to your product or services.</p>
                            <p>If the job involves a team work, skills such as a ability to relate well with others would be more appropriate than a do it yourself kind of thing skill.</p>
                            <p>Conclude with a clear, courteous request to set up an interview. You are requesting and not demanding for the job. The date and the venue of the interview should be at the convenience of the interviewer. However you are welcome to suggest a range of dates and places convenient to you especially when you travel at your own experience, employer should contact you. If you ask for a phone call, give your phone number, the day and times of the week that you can be reached e.g. my resume is enclosed, should you need to contact me please feel free to do so on................. Both day and night. I would welcome any opportunity for an interview. Thanking you in anticipation.</p>
