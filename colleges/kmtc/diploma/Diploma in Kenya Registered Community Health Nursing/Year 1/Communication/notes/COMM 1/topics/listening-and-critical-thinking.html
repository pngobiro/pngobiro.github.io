                        <p>The listening process involves receiving oral stimuli (music, words or sounds) in the ear (Hearing). The ear translates the vibration from oral stimuli into sensation that is registered by the brain (Listening). The brain, using attention and working memory, interprets the sensation and gives it meaning (Interpretation). The interpreted message is then stored in short term memory for immediate use (Retaining) or long term memory for future recall (Recalling).</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">2.5.1 Important aspects of the Listening Process</h3>
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li><strong>Attention</strong> - At any one time there are many oral-auditory stimuli such that our mind has to focus on specific stimuli and block others. This process is called attention. Attention is selective or automatic.
                                <ol type="i">
                                    <li><strong>Selective attention</strong> - This is sustained focus we give to information we deem important. Selective attention can be obstructed by our mind's instinct to pay automatic attention to certain stimuli.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Automatic attention</strong> - this is instinctive focus we give to stimuli signaling a change in our surrounding. We give automatic attention to stimuli that we deem important or that which we perceive to signal danger. Automatic attention, therefore, competes with selective attention.</li>
                                </ol>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Working memory</strong> - This is the part of our consciousness that interprets and assigns meaning to stimuli we pay attention to. We may use it without 'thinking' about it. It looks for shortcuts when processing information e.g. patterns of letters or words in assigning meanings. The working memory works in conjunction with the long term memory.</li>
                            <li><strong>Short term memory</strong> - Once information is interpreted in working memory it is either sent to the short term or the long term memory. The short term memory is part of the memory that acts as a temporary storage place for information. The information stored in short term memory is that which we want to use immediately but not necessarily in future. It is the least efficient of our memory resources because information stored here is easily forgotten unless some strategy like rehearsal is used. Unfortunately most people, students included, rely on short term memory for information that deserves to be recalled in the long term.</li>
                            <li><strong>Long term memory</strong> - This is the permanent storage place for information including past experiences, language, values, knowledge, images of people, memories of sights, sounds, smells and even fantasies. Unlike short term memory, long term memory has no known limitation on the quantity or duration of stored information. Long term memory is organized in schema, which are organizational filling systems for thoughts held in long term memory. We access such information through stimulus cues that constitute words, images, sights, smells or tastes that serve as triggers, which signal the mind to activate information held in schema. If we encounter information for first time, which is not in the long term memory, a new schema will be created and this information stored. The long term memory plays a key role in the listening process because it is instrumental in recalling stored information and helps in creating meaning between what we hear and our background knowledge.</li>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>There are various types of listening, which can be used for various purposes either independently or in combination. These are:</p>
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li><strong>Active listening</strong> - It involves listening with a purpose and comprises:
                                <ol type="i">
                                    <li>Listening carefully using all our available senses.</li>
                                    <li>Paraphrasing what we hear both mentally and verbally.</li>
                                    <li>Checking our understanding to ensure accuracy.</li>
                                    <li>Providing feedback positively or negatively.</li>
                                </ol>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Empathetic listening</strong> - It is a form of active listening where we attempt to understand the other person by perceiving their world view as if it is our own. It is putting ourselves in the shoes of another person in order to feel and understand what the person is going through. This kind is very useful in sustaining relationships, counseling process, resolving disputes, as well as dealing with traumatic situations.</li>
                            <li><strong>Critical listening</strong> - This is listening that analyses, evaluates, critiques or challenges a speaker's message by evaluating its accuracy, meaningfulness and utility. This goes hand in hand with critical thinking and it involves asking question such as:
                                <ol type="i">
                                    <li>Is the speaker's message possible? Is it realistic?</li>
                                    <li>Does the speaker back up his or her claims? Are these claims reliable?</li>
                                    <li>Is the speaker credible or an authority?</li>
                                    <li>Is the message free of contradiction and inconsistencies?</li>
                                </ol>
                                <p>Critical listening is very useful when we are confronted with persuasive messages such as advertisements, political communications, propaganda and the like.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Listening for enjoyment</strong> - This type of listening helps us to relax like when we enjoy listening to, for instance, music.</li>
                            <li><strong>Reflective listening</strong><br>This refers to attentively listening to the speaker's actual words, as well as tone of voice, and observing the body language and emotions displayed. Reflective listening is particularly an important tool in one-on-one situations. It is not practical in a speaker-audience situation.</li>
                            <li><strong>Passive listening</strong><br>This means concentrating at a low level and absorbing just enough of the speaker's words to stay involved in a conversation or speech. Such listening is characterized by:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Listeners remembering little of what is said</li>
                                    <li>Listeners let the speaker's inflection or tone of voice signal when they should react by nodding, smiling or saying, "I see"</li>
                                    <li>Listeners may suggest that the speaker has the listener's attention, even though that may not be the case</li>
                                    <li>It is appropriate when you listen for pleasure and when it doesn't matter whether or not you retain what you hear</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>

                        <p>Effective listening is a life-long skill that is of paramount importance in academic life. There are various ways of improving listening skills that can make your life in academics and beyond very fruitful. Strategies that improve your listening skills include:</p>
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li>Listen and think critically - This involves analyzing the speaker, the situation and the message in order to make critical judgment about messages being presented.</li>
                            <li>Identifying and understanding barriers to the listening process and genuinely working towards eliminating them. Such barriers may include noise of various types, which should be eliminated in the listening process.</li>
                            <li>Identifying patterns in what we are listening to - Understanding the overall message, its main points and the supporting points is essential in having a graphical impression of messages and is an important aid in the recall process.</li>
                            <li>Applying memory retention skills such as:
                                <ol type="i">
                                    <li>Rehearsing and rephrasing what we listen to.</li>
                                    <li>Using mnemonic devices (using a series of letters forming a meaningful or pronounceable word where each letter stands for a particular concept, idea or point for easy recall).</li>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">2.8.1 Overcoming listening barriers</h3>
                        <p>Becoming an effective listener requires conscious effort and practice. Listening barriers are any distractions that interfere with listening, for example:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Not concentrating on what is being said</li>
                            <li>Being distracted by noise</li>
                            <li>Talking instead of listening</li>
                            <li>Having preconceived thoughts and opinions</li>
                            <li>Not being interested in what is being said</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>These can be overcome through:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Concentrate on the speaker's message - it is your responsibility to stay focused.</li>
                            <li>Use filters to manage and control noise - control the two basic kinds of noise; 1)external noise, which includes sounds from conversations, radio, television, CD players, machinery etc and 2) internal noise, which includes distractions such as pain, fatigue, preoccupation with other thoughts, hunger, worry or a personality conflict with the speaker. To this end, you can turn down the volume of unnecessary sounds, take a pain reliever or get enough sleep.</li>
                            <li>Resist talking instead of listening - it is impossible to be both sender and receiver of information at the same time. You can even become your own distraction.</li>
                            <li>Focus on the message - make sure that your own ideas do not interfere with listening to the ideas of another.</li>
                            <li>Listen with a positive attitude - you do not have to agree with the speaker, but good listening requires you to keep an open mind and believe that the speaker might have something useful to offer.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">2.8.2 Improving listening skills</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Paraphrasing:</strong> this is summarizing the speaker's message in your own words and allowing the speaker to correct any discrepancies from the intended message. That is, the listener crystallizes his/her own understanding of the content presented.</li>
                            <li><strong>Evaluate your skills:</strong> everyone has listening weakness; you must therefore identify your weaknesses.</li>
                            <li><strong>Prepare yourself physically and mentally:</strong> listening is a combination of physical and mental activities.</li>
                            <li><strong>Set listening priorities:</strong> because you are bombarded with several messages at once, decide which ones deserve your focus.</li>
                            <li><strong>Make efficient use of available time:</strong> do not rush through your conversation as you may lack full understanding of the message.</li>
                            <li><strong>Listen attentively:</strong> be attentive and show interest in the speaker's message.</li>
                            <li><strong>Listen for ideas and feelings:</strong> look out for factual information as well as the speaker's tone of voice.</li>
                            <li><strong>Establish eye contact:</strong> do not stare at the speaker, instead, glance away periodically to reflect on the topic.</li>
                            <li><strong>Use body language to show you are listening:</strong> body language can convey you level of interest. Employ appropriate non-verbal cues.</li>
                            <li><strong>Overlook personal characteristics of the speaker:</strong> do not prejudge a speaker on the basis of distracting personal characteristics such as mannerisms, voice, speech patterns or appearance.</li>
                            <li><strong>Choose strategic seating:</strong> posture can affect listening; therefore choose a physical location that is conducive, comfortable and practical.</li>
                            <li><strong>Ask questions if permitted:</strong> this helps clarify the speaker's information.</li>
                            <li><strong>Take notes:</strong> jot down key ideas or concepts for further referencing.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>One method to help you retain the content of a speaker's message is to think of the strategies represented by the letters in the sentence "IS A FACT":</p>
                        <p><strong>Identify</strong> - identify the speaker's ideas and connections among the ideas</p>
                        <p><strong>Summarize</strong> - summarize the main points of the message</p>
                        <p><strong>Assess</strong> - assess the correctness or validity of the message</p>
                        <p><strong>Formulate</strong> - formulate appropriate questions</p>
                        <p><strong>Associate</strong> - associate the speaker's ideas with other known concepts</p>
                        <p><strong>Consider</strong> - consider specific ways the information might be used</p>
                        <p><strong>Take notes</strong> - take notes to assist in better recall (to bring to mind)</p>
