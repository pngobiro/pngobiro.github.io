                    </h2>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">8.1.1 Emails</h3>
                        <p>Electronic mail, more commonly referred to as E-mail, is written communication just like memos and letters. The primary difference is the method of transmission. E-mail messages are sent instantly through the internet via the modem on your computer and the modem in the recipient's computer.</p>
                        <p>The use of E-mail today is so quick, easy and inexpensive that its use is increasing at a phenomenal rate. In order to ensure that communication via E-mail is appropriate, follow the following guidelines:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Use the correct address:</strong> one typographical error in the address means that your E-mail will not be delivered; therefore, always check the accuracy of an E-mail address.</li>
                            <li><strong>Use a greeting:</strong> use a greeting to personalize the E-mail message.</li>
                            <li><strong>Use a subject line:</strong> subject lines identify the main content of the email. They should be concise phrases that clearly identify the content of the message.</li>
                            <li><strong>Limit the length, topics and recipients:</strong> limit your E-mail message to one topic, which makes writing a subject line much easier. E-mail messages are supposed to be brief and should be a maximum of about 25 lines of text. Send the E-mail only to those who need the information. Information overload and Email overload have a negative effect on productivity.</li>
                            <li><strong>Watch the tone of your E-mail:</strong> E-mail recipients could have trouble capturing the emotions in your Email. Therefore, avoid sarcasm in any form of written communication since it can be misinterpreted. Do not use all-capital letters in your E-mail as it is considered as shouting to your reader.</li>
                            <li><strong>Use a closing:</strong> sign out appropriately at the end of your E-mail message.</li>
                            <li><strong>Check spelling and grammar:</strong> always read and proofread your E-mail before sending it. If your message contains errors, people may assume that you are uneducated. After all, misspelled words are a turnoff and do not convey a professional image.</li>
                            <li><strong>Do not send confidential information:</strong> E-mail is not always private or confidential. A good rule to follow is: Do not send anything by E-mail that you wouldn't be willing to have published in the Daily Nation newspaper.</li>
                            <li><strong>Know your company policy:</strong> find out what your company's policy on E-mail is and follow it. This is critical in a professional environment since your company owns the E-mail system.</li>
                            <li><strong>Spamming:</strong> this is sending unsolicited E-mail, particularly advertisements, to others. It is the electronic version of junk mail. Such mail is a turnoff.</li>
                            <li><strong>Reply to E-mails:</strong> responding or not responding to E-mails is a form of communication too! It is common courtesy to, and unprofessional to ignore, an E-mail that asks for a response.</li>
                            <li><strong>Attachments:</strong> it is best to inform your recipient that your are attaching a file to an E-mail and disclose what the attachment it, especially with the increase in computer viruses.</li>
                            <li><strong>Viruses:</strong> this is a self-replicating code planted illegally in a computer program for the purpose of damaging or shutting down a system or network. Unfortunately, it is through attachments to E-mails that many computer viruses are spread to other computers. If you do not know the sender or you are not expecting an attachment, be cautious opening it.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">8.1.2 Memos</h3>
                        <p>Originally the word 'memorandum' came from the Latin memorare - to remember- and meant literally 'a thing to be remembered'. However, memos now have a rather wider use in business than simply a memory aid as, together with the telephone, they have become the main method of internal communication within organizations. Their use provides written record.</p>
                        <p>Memos are also a logical way to coordinate the efforts of many people within an organization - especially large and diverse organizations and for those who do not have access to E-mail.</p>
                        <p>There can be no fixed rules about the style of language which is appropriate for an internal memorandum. It will depend on several factors such as:</p>
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li>Nature of the message - information, enquiry, request, reprimand, congratulations and so on.</li>
                            <li>Context of the message - potential reaction of the reader, what has gone before, how much the recipient knows already, urgency of the situation and priority of any action required - routine, emergency, crisis, follow-up instructions to all staff and so on.</li>
                            <li>Status and personality f the recipient - position in the organization, known tastes and attitudes on written style and methods of working, technical/practical background, educational level and so on.</li>
                            <li>Relationship between sender and recipient - friendly, distant, informal, formal and so on. (A neutral tone may be necessary where there will be several recipients.)</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">8.1.2.1 The following are the advantages of Memos:</h4>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Memos are quick:</strong> using technology can reduce the time needed to write and send memos. Many software programs include memo templates that make it easy to compose a memo. By using E-mail and fax machines, a writer can quickly transmit memos to recipients.</li>
                            <li><strong>Memos are inexpensive:</strong> compared with telephone calls and meetings, memos are a cost-effective way to transmit messages within an organization because all recipients receive the same information.</li>
                            <li><strong>Memos are convenient:</strong> memos offer access to people who are not seen on a regular basis. Memos also minimize interruptions for the receiver. In addition, reading a memo requires less time than a phone call or a personal visit.</li>
                            <li><strong>Memos are a written record:</strong> memos serve as a written record for both the reader and the writer. They can clarify instructions or information given orally and can help prevent misunderstandings.</li>
                        </ol>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Memos and E-mails are used for a variety of purposes. The main purposes are to request, to inform, to report, to remind, to transmit and to promote goodwill.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>To request</strong><br>Use memos or E-mails to ask for information, action or reaction. Messages written for this purpose take the direct approach as in the following examples:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>We need a list of your new products, in order to advice our clients.</li>
                                    <li>Please make arrangements for a one-day seminar for all trainees.</li>
                                    <li>Please review this proposal and give me your comments about it.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>To inform</strong><br>Use memos to communicate procedures, policies and instructions. If the message contains good news, use the direct approach; if the message contains bad news, use the indirect approach. For example:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Our fire safety procedure requires immediate assembly by all people at a designated fire assembly point.</li>
                                    <li>Company policy does not permit the removal of company property outside its premise.</li>
                                    <li>You will need your national ID card to access the building.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>To report</strong><br>Use memos or E-mails to convey organized data such as schedules, sales figures, names of clients. For example:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Below is our schedule for the completion of the renovation of the KeMU Towers.</li>
                                    <li>Here is a list of the students who will attend the inter-university athletic competition.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>To remind</strong><br>Use memos or E-mails as reminders about deadlines, important meetings etc. such reminders should be both brief and use the direct approach. For example:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>The new students' orientation will take place on 20<sup>th</sup> August 2010.</li>
                                    <li>Our appointment with the insurance sales person should be on your calendar for Monday, April 3, 2010 at 2 p.m in the board room.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>To transmit</strong><br>Use memos or E-mails to tell readers about an accompanying message. The message should describe, explain or simply identify the attachment or enclosure. For example:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Attached are the handouts for the previous class discussions.</li>
                                    <li>Enclosed, please find my resume for your perusal.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>To promote goodwill</strong><br>Use memos or E-mails to establish, improve and maintain goodwill. These messages can congratulate, welcome or convey appreciation. For example:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Congratulations on your promotion!</li>
                                    <li>Welcome to KeMU, where the Future is!</li>
                                    <li>Thank you a job well done!</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ol>
