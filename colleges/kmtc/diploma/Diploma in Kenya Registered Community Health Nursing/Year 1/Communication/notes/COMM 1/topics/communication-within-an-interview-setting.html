                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>There are six common types of interview information:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Statements of description</strong> - the interviewee is required to provide information concerning something he has observed or experienced and may be questioned much as a witness is by a lawyer.</li>
                            <li><strong>Statements of factual knowledge</strong> - the interviewee is required to pass on an explanation of information he possesses, for example and interview with an expert or specialist.</li>
                            <li><strong>Statements of behavior</strong> - the interviewee defines the previous, present and future behavior of the interviewee.</li>
                            <li><strong>Statements of attitude and belief</strong> - here, information is of a more subjective nature revealing attitudes, personality, ambition and motivation; these statements represent the interviewee's evaluations (good/bad) and opinions of the truth and falseness about things.</li>
                            <li><strong>Statements of feelings</strong> - here, information reveals physical and/or emotional levels which reflect the state of the individual.</li>
                            <li><strong>Statement of value</strong> - these statements convey long-standing belief systems that are highly treasured by the respondent, for example, "the essential quality in anyone is commitment - a willingness to see things through and stick at the job despite difficulties."</li>
                        </ol>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The questions you are asked during a job interview will be determined by the type of interview that you are given.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Screening interview</strong><br>This is conducted to determine if you have the skills and qualifications for the job. It may be conducted over the telephone and may also serve as a preliminary screening of your communication and interpersonal skills. Keep your responses concise; giving too much information in a screening interview can hurt you.</li>
                            <li><strong>One-on-one interview</strong><br>As the label implies, in a one-on-one interview, you will be interviewed by one person only. The interviewer wants to see if you will fit in with the company and determine how your skills will benefit the company.</li>
                            <li><strong>Panel or committee interview</strong><br>This type of interview is fairly common today as companies look for ways to make better hiring decisions. The interview team members usually take turns asking interview questions. When answering questions, focus your attention on the person who asked the question rather than the whole group.</li>
                            <li><strong>Group interview</strong><br>In a group interview, several applicants meet with one or two interviewers. This type of interview is designed to uncover leadership potential among the applicants and to see how you interact with others.</li>
                            <li><strong>Stress interview</strong><br>A stress interview is a deliberate attempt to put you under stress to test how you react under pressure. Some techniques used in stress interviewing are:
                                <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                   <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">✓</span><span class="item-text">Rapidly firing questions at you.</span></li>
                                   <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">✓</span><span class="item-text">Placing you on the defensive with irritating questions and sarcastic comments.</span></li>
                                   <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">✓</span><span class="item-text">Long periods of silence after you answer a question.</span></li>
                                </ul>
                                Remain calm during this type of interview</li>
                            <li><strong>Unstructured interview</strong><br>An unstructured interview usually consists of one or two broad questions such as, "why don't you tell me about yourself?". The purpose is to find out if the applicant is wise enough to focus on his/her qualifications for the job and to find out how good his/her communication skills are.</li>
                            <li><strong>Behavioral interview</strong><br>In a behavioral interview, the idea is to see how a candidate handled a situation in the past. The theory is that past behavior is a good predictor of future behavior. The interviewer uses questions and statements to get applicants to relate specific examples of how they have successfully used the skills required in the job. An example of a behavioral interview question is, "Tell me about a conflict you had with a co-worker and how you handled it".</li>
                            <li><strong>Situational interview</strong><br>This interview is similar to a behavioral interview. Instead of asking candidates to relate past experiences, the applicant is given a situation, then asked, "How would you handle this".</li>
                            <li><strong>Disciplinary interview</strong><br>A disciplinary interview is a formal discussion between the supervisor and the employee, typically behind closed doors, usually in the supervisor's office or in a conference room. At this point, the employee is alerted to the fact that future infractions/misconduct will not be tolerated, resulting in further disciplinary action based on the severity of the offense.</li>
                            <li><strong>Appraisal interview</strong><br>This interview comprises an evaluation of the interviewee's performance over a period of time, and a review of the tasks and objectives for the year ahead. The appraisal interview is used as a management tool for the Personnel Department and for managers when planning future training programmes.</li>

They may lose interest in you; worse still, they may even think you are bored and uninterested. So, concentrate on projecting your voice in a dynamic, enthusiastic tone. Above all, aim at variety - variety of pitch, volume and speed.</li>
                            <li><strong>Unresponsiveness</strong><br>When people are nervous they are often also less responsive than normal. The interviewer wants to hear about you, so if they should ask a question which appears to require only a 'yes' or 'no', try to expand your answers beyond a simple 'yes' or 'no'.</li>
                            <li><strong>Deliberate unresponsiveness</strong><br>You may of course be asked a question which you really cannot or do not want to answer. Women, for example, may be asked questions which they consider embarrassing, or even illegal, like, 'Won't you leave to have a baby before long?' Always try to answer honestly if you can - this might be an opportunity to offer your opinion about women working - but always avoid a direct refusal to answer or an argumentative answer. It is far better to adopt the 'political response'.</li>
                            <li><strong>Inappropriate language</strong><br>You should also try to avoid using slang or excessively casual language - ok, no way, I mean, like, you know..., like I said, yeah. Such expressions are not typical of a business professional.</li>
                            <li><strong>Unnatural posture</strong><br>Slumping or sitting like a stiff tin soldier are both frequent symptoms of nerves. The best impression is created by sitting up straight with legs crossed. This position looks good and allows you to lean forward a little towards the interviewer to make special points or to show special attention.</li>
                            <li><strong>A negative start</strong><br>Watch the opening of an interview. Avoid making remarks that create a 'negative set' for the rest of the interview such as, 'I'm not really sure that my background is suitable for this job' or 'I'm afraid I haven't had any experience'.</li>
