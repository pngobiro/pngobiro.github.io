                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>There are various types of essays, which can be classified according to the purpose for which they are written as discussed below.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">5.7.1 Descriptive Essays</h3>
                        <p>Effective descriptive essays create word pictures of objects, persons, scenes, events or situations. In creating images it is important to create sensory impression. Sensory impressions are created by use of words that appeal to our senses of sight, hearing, smell, touch and taste. Descriptive writing in general, can appear on its own or as part of some other form of writing, for instance, in writing history, biography, fiction, poetry, journalistic cases, advertisement e.t.c.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">5.7.1.1 Characteristics of effective description</h4>
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li>They employ precise sensory impression, which capture the features that they describe, with appropriate words by likening the objects they describe with images and things that the reader can easily recognize.</li>
                            <li>Effective descriptions take a vantage point, that is, they do not present every detail observed, but select what details to include or exclude. They also describe objects starting from one point to the other e.g. from bottom up, left to right or vice versa, front to back, general to specific, inside out, and so on.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">5.7.2 Narrative Essays</h3>
                        <p>Narration is a process of relating events that occurred where they occurred, when they occurred and who was involved and probably why. It involves the answering of the 5 wh- and how reporters' questions, namely, what happened, who was involved, where, when, why and how.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">5.7.2.1 Characteristics of effective narration</h4>
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li>Effective narration selects and relates significant events of what happened. The significant events are determined by purpose of narrative. The purpose of your narrative may lead to the decision as to which of the questions above would be major and which will be minor in your narration.</li>
                            <li>Do not bring up unrelated events because narration is discriminative.</li>
                            <li>Follow logical and understandable time sequence. Basically there are three sequences that you can follow:
                                <ol type="i">
                                    <li>Chronological sequence, which starts at the beginning of events and follow the events as they progress to end.</li>
                                    <li>Starting from the end and then flashback to the first event, then proceed chronologically.</li>
                                    <li>Start in the middle of the story then go the beginning and then proceed chronologically to the end.</li>
                                </ol>
                            </li>
                            <li>Good narration usually has a point that can be drawn from the story. The point might be Sharing experience in order to tell a moral or just to amuse.</li>
                            <li>Conversation can be important in advancement of narrative by adding impact to it. You therefore need to know how to punctuate conversation. Avoid using vague speech tags such as: he said, or she asked, in the statement of who spoke unless these words are the logical choices instead be more precise to increase vitality for instance, she purred, he burst out. The conversation should be realistic.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">5.7.3 Persuasive Essays</h3>
                        <p>Persuasive essays are intended to encourage others to adopt a view or take a particular action. Persuasion as a skill is used in a variety of ways e.g. when seeking employment, in advertisement, when you want to make change in group, in law courts, in debates, when appealing for help and so on.</p>
                        <p>Persuasion is concerned with action and motivation, for instance, when we encourage people to buy specific products, we are motivating them to take certain actions. The details used in persuasion are determined by views and knowledge of the audiences. It involves asking the questions:</p>
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li>Who am I talking to?</li>
                            <li>Who disagrees with me on these issues?</li>
                            <li>Who might I influence?</li>
                            <li>How might I influence them?</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Persuasive details should be arranged carefully so as to achieve the desired effect. One way of doing this is to arrange points in the order of forcefulness. Persuasive essays may incorporate narration, description, illustration, comparison and contrast, definition and explanation. Persuasive writers can speculate about what would happen if their views were or were not adopted. Objections to a point of view in a persuasive essay should be raised and countered.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">5.7.4 Expository Essays</h3>
                        <p>Expository essays are those that set out to explain something. What is explained is the subject of the essay. The purpose of exposition is to enable readers to understand something, for instance, what something is, how something works, a relationship between one thing and another, how different parts of something are related, why something happened the way it did e.t.c. There are various types of exposition some of the common ones are:</p>
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li><strong>Definitions:</strong> in these types of exposition the writer intends to make readers understand concepts, ideas, a theory, object and so on. It entails saying what something is, its characteristics and probably how it is distinct as an entity.</li>
                            <li><strong>Illustrations:</strong> these are also called exemplifications. This type of writing helps the reader to concretize an idea. You can use comparison and contrast to illustrate an idea or use a more familiar object to illustrate a more complex or abstract idea.</li>
                            <li><strong>Analytic expositions:</strong> these expositions analyze or reveal certain properties that are not accessible to a casual observer. They entail breaking material into constituent parts in order to show the hidden nature and how the parts relate to each other. They may also show how each of these parts contribute to the total shape of a whole thing.</li>
                            <li><strong>Comparison-contrast expositions:</strong> These show the similarities and differences of an idea, object or thing.</li>
                            <li><strong>Cause-effect expositions:</strong> these expositions show the relationship between cause and effect of something or vice versa. Many things can be explained by identifying what causes them or alternatively explaining the effect, for instance diseases. In these types of expositions you must convince the reader that the cause will be capable of producing the effect in the manner that you are suggesting. Cause-effect expositions must be presented clearly and systematically in order to be convincing.</li>

                        <p>Argumentation involves convincing others of the correctness of a given view. The product of argumentation is an argument either for or against a certain idea. Argumentative essays involve debates and discussions about a view or idea that has opposing views. Most arguments for which essays are written tend to be matters of policy, theory, interpretation, the best way to do something and other issues whose working and interpretation are not settled.</p>

                            <li><strong>Reasonableness:</strong> arguments have to appeal to reason, that is, the grounds used to support a given position should be relevant and adequate.</li>
                            <li>The weighing of evidence for or against an argument should not be biased. Matters of fact should not be distorted or ignored.</li>
                            <li>No irrelevant or inconsequential issues should be brought to the argument.</li>
                            <li>Arguments should appeal to logic. A good argument should be logical where the conclusion put forward should have been logically derived from the premises which are sound. The argument put forward should not suffer fallacies (faulty argument).</li>
                            <li>Arguments should be consistent and clear, that is, key concepts of an argument should be clearly defined and the argument should not have internal contradictions. Your position in the argument should be clearly stated and the evidence that supports your argument should be clearly presented. Evidence presented in argument could be:
                                <ol type="i">
                                    <li>Testimony, which is a story or statement given by someone who has experienced something relevant to subject of debate.</li>
                                    <li>Evidence from authority or expert, which is a statement or position by somebody who by training or experience is believed to be capable of giving reliable opinion, for instance, a doctor in a medical argument or a professor in a given subject.</li>
                                    <li>Statistical evidence, which are figures that support a position. Statistics should be from a reliable source and must be current.</li>

                        <p>This section will deal with referencing techniques, which are established conventions used in citation and documentation of sources of information. Most disciplines/subjects or institutions prefer certain documentation and referencing techniques.</p>
                        <p>In academic writing, it is a standard practice to make reference to what other scholars have said about various subjects of your interest or as part of your research work as you write your assignments and term papers. You will therefore need to show what authors'/scholars' work you have read and how these works have influenced your thinking/writing. You do this by citing and making reference to the authors and their works in an orderly manner for three reasons:</p>
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li>To let the reader know whose ideas you are using</li>
                            <li>To enable your reader to check your information</li>
                            <li>To provide information for your reader.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">5.8.1 Important terminologies in referencing and documentation</h3>
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li><strong>Citation</strong> is a reference to a document. It should include all the bibliographic details needed to trace the document. Citation is done within the text.</li>
                            <li><strong>Footnotes</strong> are listed at the bottom of the page on which a reference or citation occurs in the text. A number is placed in the text to indicate the cited work and again at the bottom of the page in front of the footnote. Footnotes are used when only a small number of references need to be made.</li>
                            <li><strong>Reference list</strong> is the list of citations (material cited) in a written work. It shows the authority on which you base statements in the text, shows how well acquainted (how widely read) you are with the subject, and is a starting point for anyone else wanting to find out about the subject. Reference writing is currently the preferred mode of documentation.</li>
                            <li><strong>Bibliography</strong> is a list of documents (books, articles, and papers) read for a specific essay or assignment. All these references are not necessarily included in the list of references.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">5.8.2 Techniques of Documentation and Referencing.</h3>
                        <p>There are various referencing techniques. They include: Harvard reference system, APA (American Psychology Association), MLA (Modern Language Association), Chicago style of documentation, among others. KEMU favours the use of Harvard reference system, which we shall look at below.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">5.8.2.1 The Harvard Reference System</h4>
                        <p><strong>a) Citing works within the text</strong></p>
                        <p>The system requires you to cite the author's surname, the year of publication, and the page reference immediately after the quoted material, e.g.: 'Alongside this normative perspective that emphasizes the centrality of the West in the formation of modernity, there are alternative approaches to modernity' (Kane 2003:5).</p>
                        <p>No comma is needed after author's name (not 'Kane, 2003'). Be consistent with punctuations. For example, where a colon is used after year of publication, either put a space before the page numbers ('Amin 2002: 65') or not ('Amin 2002:65'). Separate publications by different authors by semicolons ('Amin 2002; Diaw 1994') and the same author's by a comma ('Mkandawire 1999, 2002').</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>b) Writing references/bibliography</strong></p>
                        <p>With this system it is essential that the bibliography or references list every work cited by you in the text. Where there are two or more works by one author in the same year, distinguish them as by use of letters of the alphabet (e.g. Olukoshi 1998a, 1998b, etc.). Type the bibliography or reference list in the order: author, initials, date, title, place of publication, publisher.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>c) Example of Bibliography Using Harvard System</strong></p>
