                        <p>Reading is the process of interpreting, analyzing and understanding written messages. Reading for study at university level is an active integration of the text involving interpretation and thinking as you read. Reading is, therefore, a dynamic process involving the following properties:</p>
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li>Decoding or interpreting written symbols</li>

                            <li>It is an interaction of the language of the text and background knowledge of the reader, such that, the written message focuses the reader on what background knowledge (in long term memory), the reader should bring to the interpretation of written message being read.</li>

                        <p>Before we engage in reading we need to establish the purpose for which we seek to read. Generally speaking, we engage in reading for the following purposes:</p>
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li>We read to entertainment or leisure</li>
                            <li>To acquire information and knowledge</li>
                            <li>As a means of preparing for successful life i.e. as means of acquiring useful life skill.</li>
                            <li>To improve quality of life.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>At the university level reading is particularly more focused and rigorous and would normally entail the following purposes:</p>
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li>To gain an overall understanding of main ideas presented in some reading.</li>
                            <li>To find specific information such as a name, date or a definition of a concept.</li>
                            <li>To gain understanding of material so as to recall it as presented in the text.</li>
                            <li>To evaluate, critique or analyze some material.</li>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Types of reading refer to styles we may adopt in our reading as determined by the purpose for which we are reading. Types of reading include:</p>
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li><strong>Scanning</strong> - This style or technique is used when you are looking for a name, definition or any other specific piece of information in a text like a house in classified ads, addresses or phone in a directory, an important concept, information for a research essay in a library catalogue, table of content, index page etc. In using the technique you move your eye quickly over the page to find particular words or phrases that are relevant to specific information you are looking for.
                                <p>While scanning, a good reader should first:</p>
                                <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                    <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">✓</span><span class="item-text">Ensure that the text he/she is scanning is the correct text and that he/she knows precisely what he is looking for.</span></li>
                                    <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">✓</span><span class="item-text">Try to determine the text structure or its style of arrangement, i.e. clues or signals which can assist in understanding the text pattern.</span></li>
                                    <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">✓</span><span class="item-text">Scan with speed without reading extraneous or irrelevant material.</span></li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Skimming</strong> - In this technique you read quickly through a text in order to get a grip of the main ideas or general information about the text. In using this technique you intend to get a general grasp of ideas presented by the author. This technique is useful when:
                                <ol type="i">
                                    <li>Trying to decide if a book in library is useful or right for your studies.</li>
                                    <li>Previewing books or texts before detailed reading.</li>
                                    <li>Refreshing your understanding of a text after you have read it in detail.</li>
                                </ol>
                                <p>You can skim:</p>
                                <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                    <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">✓</span><span class="item-text">Introductory paragraphs - to give the general theme</span></li>
                                    <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">✓</span><span class="item-text">Concluding paragraph</span></li>
                                    <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">✓</span><span class="item-text">Transitional paragraphs</span></li>
                                    <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">✓</span><span class="item-text">Subheadings</span></li>
                                    <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">✓</span><span class="item-text">Italicized, underlined and boldfaced items</span></li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>As an efficient reading strategy, skimming is a very useful skill both for recreational and study reading. In study reading, it is useful for the following reasons:</p>
                                <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                    <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">✓</span><span class="item-text">It can be used at the preliminary stages of selecting texts for research or selecting reserved and supplementary literature. It helps determine which texts merit more careful and thorough reading and which specific parts of those texts are worth spending time on.</span></li>
                                    <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">✓</span><span class="item-text">It can be used as an exercise for improving speed and therefore performance and for coping with high quantity work. It can enable a reader cover a lot of material in a short time, therefore saving time.</span></li>
                                    <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">✓</span><span class="item-text">It is one of those skills used in the reading for the main idea only when the supporting details or other extraneous materials are not important.</span></li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Active/detailed reading</strong> - This technique is used in serious study. It calls for an active involvement in the reading process. In this type of reading you need to interrogate or think over what you read so as to both evaluate what you have read and facilitate recall of read material. This is the kind of reading that is most extensively used at university during study. As you use this type of reading the following tips are important.
                                <ol type="i">
                                    <li>Always make notes</li>
                                    <li>Pick out what you think are the important points of what you are reading by highlighting these points.</li>
                                    <li>Record main headings as you read, this helps you to see the flow of your reading and notes.</li>
                                    <li>As you prepare for active reading note down questions you want the material to answer.</li>
                                    <li>After you have read a section of text and have made a summary of what you have read in your notes, skim through the text and check how accurate your summary is. As you do this, fill in gaps that you may notice in your notes.</li>
                                </ol>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Extensive reading</strong> is purposeful, organized, wide reading of long texts such as journals, novels, magazines, periodicals etc, especially those that relate to one's area of study, to enrich one's vocabulary, which is basic to all good reading.</li>
                            <li><strong>Intensive reading</strong> is a concentrated, thorough and comprehensive reading style. It is applied when one wants to understand the contents of the reading deeply. It is an intellectually involving affair int hat the reader will be trying to evaluate how the ideas involved could be applied or adapted to different situations. It is also analytical, critical and interpretive. It could involve a paragraph, a whole passage or even a whole book, like in the case of a literature book.</li>
                            <li><strong>Light reading</strong> - this is the type of reading that we apply when reading papers and novels for leisure. This does not involve any critical assessment or appraisal of the material one is reading. It is fast and superficial.</li>
                            <li><strong>Word by word reading</strong> - this is the style used by beginners when they are reading for the first time and in an attempt to understand each word or phrase at a time. It is also applicable when one is reading scientific or mathematics process or formula.</li>
                        </ol>

                            <li>Reduce certain poor reading habits</li>

                            <li><strong>Vocalization (sounding out)</strong><br>This is reading aloud (the tendency to register the sound of the words as you read), which wastes time and creates a sub-process as follows:<br>According to Pearson (1981), the reading process involves a) visual perception, b) response to visual stimuli, c) transmission to brain, d) decoding (giving meaning), e) vocalizing, f) response to mental stimuli (understanding or not). As a result, vocalization slows down this reading process. Henry Pearson (1981) observed that reading aloud takes at least twice as long as reading silently and yet it is not any more effective.</li>
                            <li><strong>Sub-vocalization</strong><br>This is where the reader makes a conscious effort not to move his/her lips when reading but his/her internal speech organs, larynx or vocal cords are mechanically working. That is, the tendency to internally acknowledge or pronounce the sound of the words in your head.</li>
                            <li><strong>Finger reading, pointing at words and head movement</strong><br>These habits not only affect the rate of reading but also affect the comprehension, since they prevent the reader from grasping full phrases and clauses, therefore hindering him/her from understanding the ideas expressed fully.</li>
                            <li><strong>Narrow recognition span and poor rhythmic eye movement</strong><br>Recognition span is the number of words a reader can recognize while eyes are fixed at one point. Fixations are the stops a reader takes to take in a word or phrase and then move on to the next. A narrow recognition span wastes time and energy and therefore affects one's rate and comprehension. Efficient readers take in several words per fixation, which should be at least a phrase. Thus, rhythmically, eyes should move systematically from the middle of one phrase to another.</li>
                            <li><strong>Regression (backtracking while reading)</strong><br>This is glancing back and re-reading words, phrases and sentences that have already been read. It is a characteristic of lacking concentration and poor reading. It affects comprehension because it interrupts the reading process (though process). An efficient reader should move forward at all times.<br><strong>NB:</strong> Regression is different from review, which is done after, for clarification.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <p>One important technique that has been developed for effective reading and comprehension is summed up as SQ3R, which stand for:</p>
                        <p>S - Survey<br>Q-Question<br>R-Read<br>R-Recall<br>R - Review</p>
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li><strong>Survey</strong> - stands for a rapid preview of material in order to get an overview a topic, chapter, or book. The idea here is to look for main points of the text, its content and approach. In doing this:
                                <ol type="i">
                                    <li>Read the title to help give you an idea of the subject.</li>
                                    <li>Read the introduction or summary to see what the author thinks are the key points.</li>
                                    <li>Notice boldface headings to see what the structure of the text is.</li>
                                    <li>Notice any maps, charts or graphs which give a summation of ideas in the text.</li>
                                    <li>Notice reading aids and any questions at the end of chapter because they are meant to help you understand and remember.</li>
                                </ol>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Question</strong> - When reading you should develop a questioning attitude. Questions help your mind to engage and concentrate. This is because your mind is actively engaged when it is looking for answers to questions. In using questions as you read, keep in mind the following:
                                <ol type="i">
                                    <li>Try to turn bold face headings into questions you think the section should answer.</li>
                                    <li>Ask yourself:
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>What is the main point being made here?</li>
                                            <li>What is author trying to explain here?</li>
                                            <li>Have I understood the argument and conclusion?</li>
                                        </ul>
                                    </li>
                                </ol>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Read</strong> - After formulating questions you can start reading the material carefully in detail. The approach you take in reading may depend on subject. If the subject is complex your reading may be slower and if the subject is familiar, you might adopt a faster pace. How you read may also be determined by your personal approach. As you read:
                                <ol type="i">
                                    <li>Remember to take notes.</li>
                                    <li>Engage actively with your material.</li>
                                    <li>Look for answers to questions you have set for yourself and make up new questions if necessary.</li>
                                </ol>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Recall</strong> - After each section, stop and think back to your questions. See if you can answer them from memory. If not take a look back at the text. Do this as often as you need to. As you do this you may highlight important points of your notes.</li>
                            <li><strong>Review</strong> - Once you have finished reading, for instance, a whole chapter or section, go back over all questions in all headings to see if you can still answer them. If not, look back and refresh your memory. Do this as an important part of your revision for exams.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <p>Notes are a shortened version of information. Note taking is an integral part of reading, listening as well as during revision or study.</p>

                        <ol>
                            <li>Taking notes helps you to learn and understand by translating what you are studying into your own words and thereby helping you to understand and remember what you are studying.</li>
                            <li>Taking notes helps you concentrate while you are studying because the note taking process helps you process and digest the information.</li>
                            <li>Making notes helps you assess information because you are selecting the most important parts of what you are reading or hearing. Through making notes, you are also spotting the key issues and ideas of the materials.</li>
                            <li>Note taking also helps you think about the subject. Writing down ideas often produces ideas about other ideas you already know. This makes you think and connect what you are noting down with what you already know. This process, therefore, makes remembering of information more likely.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">3.7.2 How to Take Notes</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li>You should only choose the main points of what you are reading or listening to. Do not record all the materials from your source.</li>
                            <li>Show the difference between main points, supporting points and examples. This can be done by use of highlighting through the use of colours, underlining, or using various types of font or bolding for the different aspects of your notes.</li>
                            <li>Listen, read or watch closely the source of notes while carefully thinking about the subject and decide which part of source material are most useful, then put them down in your own words as your notes.</li>
                            <li>Brevity is important in taking notes. Use abbreviations wherever possible. You could also achieve brevity by adopting mathematical or scientific symbols or device your own personal code of symbols and signs.</li>
                            <li>Use note cards and list each new idea on a new line</li>
                            <li>Use phrases, not complete sentences to save time</li>
                            <li>Use abbreviations when possible</li>
                            <li>Never take verbatim notes, unless you need a direct quote</li>
                            <li>Use pen rather than pencil</li>
                            <li>Use underlining and asterisks to indicate important points</li>
                            <li>Number items, put information in bulleted lists, or use an outline to make it easier to review notes</li>
                            <li>Leave space in the margins for additional notes</li>
                            <li>Write on only one side of the paper or note card</li>
                            <li>Watch for clues: repetition of words or topics, handouts with key phrases or terms</li>
                            <li>Create networks, just in case you miss out important points during a lecture</li>
                            <li>Use a second note page for listing questions and their answers</li>
                            <li>Begin each day's notes with a heading that includes the name or number of the course, instructor's/speaker's name, date and topic of the day</li>
