                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The term communication comes from a Latin word 'communicare' which means to make common or share. Therefore, communication is a process by which meaning is exchanged between individuals or an individual and a group through a common system of symbols, signs and behavior.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The definition of communication is shared in the Webster's Dictionary as "sending, giving, or exchanging information and ideas," which is often expressed nonverbally and verbally.</li>
                            <li>A plethora of authors have defined communication including Gamble and Gamble, who define communication as a desirable or accidental transfer of meaning.</li>
                            <li>Communication is also a process of sharing or exchanging ideas, information, knowledge, attitude or feelings through certain signs, symbols and behavior.</li>
                            <li>Communication is more than transfer of ideas and thoughts; it is a dynamic process of action and interaction towards desired goals.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">1.2.1 Key phrases of definition</h3>
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li>Communication is a process: it is an activity which is an exchange of meaning that is dynamic. Communication is therefore not static. Communication as a process is a concept whose critical element is the changing nature of its occurrence.</li>
                            <li>Communication involves meaning: meaning is shared understanding of message. The understanding of the meaning of another person's message only occurs when you elicit common meanings for words, phrases, and non-verbal messages.</li>
                            <li>Communication is a system of symbols, signs and behavior: the system may be in form of language, gesture, demeanor, facial expressions e.t.c.</li>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Communication is central to human life. You cannot avoid communication and you will engage in communication nearly every minute of every day in your life. In addition, communication plays a major role in every aspect of your life. Effective communication therefore both enhances your daily life and at the same time solves problems in your professional and personal life. Communication experts believe that poor communication is at the root of many of our problems.</p>
                        <p>Therefore there are various reasons why studying communication is important:</p>
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li>Studying communication helps in understanding and insight of oneself and others.
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Self awareness is the way we see ourselves. Most of our self knowledge comes from communication with ourselves (intrapersonal communication) and communication with other people (interpersonal communication). The message and feedback we receive from others helps improve our self concept.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>Studying communication and using it effectively can lead to more positive feelings of ourselves. Effective communication can improve our self worth by enabling us to positively project ourselves in what is called image management.</li>
                            <li>Studying communication can increase our knowledge about human relationships because studying communication includes learning about how people relate with one another and about what communication is appropriate for a given situation.</li>
                            <li>Studying communication can teach us important life skills. For instance it can help us acquire problem solving skills. Studying communication is also instrumental in helping us acquire important life skills such as decision making skills, public speaking e.t.c. All these skills are important in academic and career development.</li>
                            <li>Studying communication can help us succeed professionally. Employers regard highly written, oral and other communication competencies. The ability to listen and analyze messages is usually considered an essential professional skill. Entrepreneurs too regard communication skills as top priority skills for success.</li>
                            <li>Poor communication may lead to misunderstanding, frustration, being ignored by others, unsuccessful careers, among many other negative consequences.</li>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Elements of communication are the components that constitute the communication process. These are:</p>
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li><strong>People</strong><br>These are the participants in the communication process. People are involved in communication in two roles. They are sources and receivers of messages. Sources initiate/compose the intended message. S/he encodes the message, while receivers are the intended target of messages, i.e. a receiver is the person who receives, decodes, comprehends and attaches meaning to the message sent. The participants' knowledge, interest and emotional state will affect how the message is sent or received. In the communication process, people are sources and receivers of a message simultaneously and continually.</li>
                            <li><strong>Message</strong><br>This is the verbal or non-verbal form of idea, thought or feeling that one person (source) wishes to communicate to a group of people (receivers). The message, therefore, is the content of interaction. A message may be easy to understand or long and complex, it may also be intentional or unintentional.</li>
                            <li><strong>Channel</strong><br>This is the means by which a message moves from a source to a receiver. It is also called the medium of transmission. The medium may be in form of sound waves (in oral-auditory messages) or as light waves (in visual communication such as written communication).</li>
                            <li><strong>Feedback</strong><br>This is the receiver's verbal, non verbal or written response to the message from the source. Feedback is part of any communication situation such that even non-response is feedback.</li>
                            <li><strong>Code</strong><br>This is the systematic arrangement of symbols used by the source or receiver to create meaning in the mind of another person(s) or receiver(s). The code may be in form of
                                <ol type="i">
                                    <li>Language you choose to communicate in e.g. English, Kiswahili or Sheng.</li>
                                    <li>Grammatical structure, for instance, a statement, question etc.</li>
                                    <li>Words and phrases you choose to use.</li>
                                    <li>Non-verbal codes you may choose.</li>
                                </ol>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Encoding and decoding</strong><br>Encoding is the act of putting ideas and thoughts into a code, while decoding is interpreting/making sense those ideas or thoughts.</li>
                            <li><strong>Noise</strong><br>Noise is any interference in encoding or decoding process that reduces the clarity of a message. Noise can be in the form of:
                                <ol type="i">
                                    <li>Physical noise, which can be in form of distracting sounds or sights. Such noise is usually easier to prevent in a speaking or listening situation. For example, closing doors to a noisy room, wearing ear plugs etc.</li>
                                    <li>Psychological/noise, mental and emotional interferences that distract communication, such as day dreaming, pain, hunger and the like.</li>
                                    <li>Semantic noise, which is the use of expressions that are unknown to the receiver or are too complex in grammatical structure. They include language differences, inattention and misunderstanding caused by different interpretations of a word or an expression. Cultural diversity can also lead to semantic noise.</li>
                                </ol>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>There are important properties of communication that we need to keep in mind as we study and employ communication. The properties constitute the invaluable attributes of communication:</p>
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li>Communication is inescapable: communication is always occurring in human life at various levels, for instance, at the intra-personal level when you are thinking, planning, meditating, as well as when you are observing, gathering information and making conclusions. It also occurs at the interpersonal level as you interact with one another.</li>
                            <li>Communication is irreversible: you cannot take back something once it is communicated. Even if you can, what has been communicated cannot entirely be erased. Traces of the effect of the communication will always remain.</li>
                            <li>Communication is dynamic: all elements in communication (i.e. setting, participants, their knowledge, their roles etc) affect each other as communication progresses.</li>
                            <li>Every communication interaction has a content dimension and relationship dimension: Content dimension is the information or message that a source desires to communicate, which has to be packaged in a strategic manner to elicit a desired reaction. The relationship dimension of communication constitutes the elements in the communication that seek to signal and acknowledge the state of the social relation between the communicating parties. The relationship dimension 'oils' the attainment of communication goals. For instance if you lecturer entered into the lecturer room with an unzipped trousers and you wanted to alert him to this fact, you will not just blurt out to him the content of what you want to say to him! You will need to do a lot of damage control about the awkward situation, while at the same time recognizing his superior position in relation to you as a student. Just think of the exact kind of language you would use and point out the content and relationship dimension of what you will say.</li>
                            <li>Communication is contextual: communication does not occur in a vacuum. It involves various aspects of context of communication. The context of communication is the environment in which communication takes place. The context of communication involves:
                                <ol type="i">
                                    <li>Psychological context: that is the needs, desires, values, personality, and so on that people communicate and bring to the communication activity.</li>
                                    <li>Situational context: this involves the place and time of communication, which affects what and how we communicate.</li>
                                    <li>Environmental context: this involves the physical features of the communication setting, such as, noise level, cultural context, objects available in setting e.t.c.</li>
                                </ol>
                            </li>
                            <li>Communication is complicated: Communication is complicated in several respects. For instance:
                                <ol type="i">
                                    <li>It involves choice about multiple aspects of message i.e. we have to make verbal and code choices, as well as non-verbal behavioral aspects to be used in communication. We also have to make choices of channel, and all these aspects must be combined strategically in order to pass across a unified message.</li>
                                    <li>Communication is also complicated because of our differing perception of the same object that we may wish to communicate about.</li>
                                </ol>

                        <ol type="i">
                            <li>Intrapersonal communication: this is the process of sharing meaning within oneself in the mind, which involves such activities as reflection, problem solving, planning, and solving internal conflict among others. This is a continuous process we always engage in but rarely realize we are involved in it.</li>
                            <li>Inter-personal communication: this involves exchanging meaning between at least two people in a situation that allows mutual opportunities for both speaking and listening. Interpersonal communication can be of two types:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Dyadic communication: involves two people in communication such as a doctor and a patient, a lecturer and a student.</li>
                                    <li>Small group communication: involves three to ten people such communication includes that which takes place in families and work groups.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>Public communication: it involves one person communicating to a large group of people.</li>
                            <li>Mass communication: this is communication mediated via a technological transmission system involving a source (professional communicator often representing an organization), and a large number of unseen receivers spread over a wide geographical area. The transmission system might be in the form of electronic, audio, audio-visual signal or visual technologies such as publication in form of books or newspapers.</li>
                        </ol>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">b) Communication Categorized by Channel or Medium</h4>
                        <ol type="i">
                            <li>Verbal communication: this type of communication relies on the oral-auditory signal for communication.</li>
                            <li>Graphic communication: this communication is also known as visual communication. It involves visual representation of ideas facts and objects other than written communication e.g. cartoons, graphs, charts, models, objects etc.</li>
                            <li>Written communication: this is the use of visual symbols, representing language, on a surface which is read by receivers.</li>
                            <li>Non-verbal communication: this is the use of visual or oral auditory signals that do not primarily rely on language or verbalized message for communication to take place. This form of communication is also known as paralinguistic communication and would include forms such as gestures, posture, distance, facial expression, rate of speech, pause, voice quality, and so on.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">1.6.1 Categories of non-verbal communication</h3>
                        <p>Non-verbal communication can be divided into 5 categories:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Paralanguage</strong><br>This includes non-verbal communication such as tone, pitch, quality, rate of speech, laughing, crying, belching or even hesitating or sighing. Paralanguage can help reinforce a verbal message, for example, a father says, "awwww" to his daughter who has just fallen.</li>
                            <li><strong>Kinesics/body language</strong><br>Body language is the gestures, movements and mannerisms by which a person communicates with others. Physical attributes such as appearance, facial expressions, eye contact and posture all contribute to kinesics or body language. For example:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Physical appearance includes clothes, jewelry and grooming. Wearing the appropriate clothing to specific events demonstrates taste and style.</li>
                                    <li>Facial expressions indicate our emotions: happy, sad, confused, angry etc. Eye contact may convey confidence, honesty and interest in the conversation.</li>
                                    <li>Gestures can express many things: a friendly wave to say hello etc.</li>
                                    <li>Posture sends a message. Standing or sitting erect denotes that you are paying attention to the matter at hand, leaning forward conveys increased interest.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Environment</strong><br>Our environment communicates many different messages. For example:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>A large desk in a corner office with windows communicates high status within an organization</li>
                                    <li>Fast food restaurants are deigned to move customers through quickly by using plastic seats that is comfortable for about 10 minutes</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Touch</strong><br>Touch, or haptic communication, is a primary method for achieving connection with people, indicating intention, or expressing emotion. The use of touch can be culturally bound. For example:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>In a business setting, the most appropriate form of communication is the handshake</li>
                                    <li>Haptic communication is status-driven. That is, a manager may give an employee an encouraging pat on the back, but not vice versa</li>
                                    <li>People in business must avoid touch that could be considered condescending or sexual harassment</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Space</strong><br>Space, as it relates to non-verbal communication, is the physical distance maintained with others. How you use space to communicate depends on:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Cultural norms</li>
                                    <li>Your relationship with the receivers of your communication</li>
                                    <li>The activities involved</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>Space generally falls into 4 categories:</p>
                                <ol type="a">
                                    <li>Intimate distance: this distance is reserved for personal expression with those we know well</li>
                                    <li>Personal distance: this distance is used for casual and friendly conversations</li>
                                    <li>Social distance: this distance is used in the workplace for business-related conversations, small meetings and social functions. It is also used for other conversations that are not personal in nature</li>
                                    <li>Public distance: this distance is usually for public speaking. In a personal conversation, this distance would constitute a huge communication barrier</li>
                                </ol>
                            </li>
                        </ol>

                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                           <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">✓</span><span class="item-text">Avoid conflicting signals: messages are made stronger when both the verbal and non-verbal communications convey the same thing.</span></li>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">c) Other types of communication categorized by direction of flow</h4>
                        <p>Communications creates links between people for different functions or purposes. If several links are missing, broken or not aligned properly, the communication becomes wobbly and may eventually break. The following are communication situations that represent a different flow of communication depending on the purpose:</p>
                        <ol type="i">
                            <li><strong>Upward communication</strong><br>This is communicating with people who rank above you, such as your boss or instructor.</li>
                            <li><strong>Lateral or horizontal communication</strong><br>This is communicating with people who are at the same rank or level as you - your co-workers or classmates.</li>
                            <li><strong>Downward communication</strong><br>This is communicating with people who rank below you, such as the people you might manage at work.</li>
                            <li><strong>Internal communication</strong><br>This is a communication situation that takes place in a company or an organization. Internal communication is the transmittal of information between and among persons within a business or organization. It is used to accomplish company goals and objectives. For example, managers communicating deadline on assignments or employees seeking promotions.</li>
                            <li><strong>External communication</strong><br>This is the transfer of information to and from people outside the company or organization. The goal is to persuade the recipients to respond favorably to company needs. For example, a job advert tries to attract qualified personnel to fill a certain position.</li>
                            <li><strong>Cross-cultural communication</strong><br>This refers to communicating, either in writing, verbally or non-verbally, with people who are from a culture different from your own. This calls for an understanding and respect of cultural differences and being adaptable.</li>
                            <li><strong>Grapevine communication</strong><br>This refers to informal communication within a company/organization, where information spread bypasses the formal communication structure. It spreads in random ways, irrespective of the authority levels.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> The direction your communication flows at any given time will influence how you communicate the words you use and the method you choose.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Human communication is fraught with problems and difficulties such as:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Differences in opinion</strong><br>Our worldviews are largely determined by our past experiences. As vast as these experiences are, so are the perceptions and interpretations of the world that people have. Age, nationality, culture, education, occupation, sex, status, personality etc, all bring to bear the difference in perception.</li>
                            <li><strong>Jumping to conclusions</strong><br>We often see what we expect to see, thus hear what we expect to hear, rather than what is actually intended. This may lead us to unnecessary conclusions.</li>
                            <li><strong>Stereotyping</strong><br>Our experiences could run us the risk of treating different people as if they were the same.</li>
                            <li><strong>Lack of knowledge</strong><br>Communication is adversely affected if it is exchanged between persons whose knowledge of the particular subject is varied or whose backgrounds regarding the subject are too different.<br>It requires skill on the part of the communicator to be aware of the discrepancy between the levels of knowledge, thus communicate accordingly.</li>
                            <li><strong>Lack of interest</strong><br>This is lacking alertness to the message being sent. As an effective communicator, you should avoid assuming that your interest in the specific subject is everyone's interest, thus angle your message to appeal to the interests and needs of the receiver.</li>
                            <li><strong>Difficulties with expression</strong><br>This refers to difficulty expressing or conveying your message as clearly as possible. It includes lack of vocabulary as well as lack of confidence, both of which can be overcome by improving your vocabulary and preparing carefully respectively.</li>
                            <li><strong>Emotions</strong><br>Both the receiver and communicator could harbor strongly felt emotions that could prevent almost anything from being communicated. Such emotions could entirely distort the communication and should be avoided.<br>However, any audience knows that a speaker without emotion and enthusiasm is likely to be a dull speaker. Emotion just needs a clear balance.</li>
                            <li><strong>Personality</strong><br>Our personality traits/behaviors can affect the behavior of others in a communication situation. We may not be able to change the personalities of others, but at least we should be prepared to consider our own personality to see if change in behavior may result in more satisfactory relationships, thus better communication.</li>
                        </ol>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Effective communication must apply the following 7 essentials, whether you are speaking or writing. Using these 7Cs will ensure that your communication is coherent and easy to follow.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">1. Clarity</h4>
                        <p>This refers to being specific rather than vague while communicating. You must communicate so clearly that you cannot be misunderstood, i.e. it is not enough to communicate so you can be understood.</p>
                        <p>Ask the following key questions to test how clear your communication is:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Have you used familiar words, short sentences?</li>
                            <li>Have you presented only one idea in each sentence?</li>
                            <li>Have you avoided "business" and technical terms?</li>
                            <li>Have you used the reader's language?</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">2. Completeness</h4>
                        <p>Complete communication includes enough details so that the recipient will not need to ask for more information. For example - if you receive a message from your lecturer asking you to pick your graded papers on Wednesday, how do you know which Wednesday it should be?</p>
                        <p>To be complete, a communication should answer the following questions: Who? What? Where? When? Why? How? or How much?</p>
                        <p>Ask the following key questions to test how complete your communication is:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Have you given all the facts?</li>
                            <li>Have you covered the essentials?</li>
                            <li>Have you answered all his/her questions?</li>
                            <li>Did you PLAN what you said?</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">3. Conciseness</h4>
                        <p>1.9.1.1 Concise communication avoids unnecessary words that could hamper the same communication. Such extra words may clutter the message and distort it all together. Conciseness makes the message more understandable and comprehensible.</p>
                        <p>For conciseness:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Eliminate wordy expressions</li>
                            <li>Include only relevant material</li>
                            <li>Avoid unnecessary repetition</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Look at the following examples:</p>
                        <div class="table-container">
                            <table class="content-table">

                                </thead>
                                <tbody>

                        <p><strong>In-class exercise:</strong></p>
                        <p>Revise the following statement, which is too wordy and eliminate seven unnecessary words ('fillers').<br>"I am writing this letter to inform you that your airline tickets will be mailed ten days before your scheduled departure".</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">4. Consistency</h4>
                        <p>All communication should be consistent in FACT, TREATEMENT and SEQUENCE.</p>
                        <p>Consistency in fact refers to agreement with a source document or an established fact. For example, an exam scheduled for 31<sup>st</sup> April should be questioned since April has only 30 days.</p>
                        <p>Consistency in treatment means treating similar items the same way. For example using the courtesy title (Mr., Mrs., Miss., or Ms.) with names of all recipients of a letter or indenting all paragraphs in a report.</p>
                        <p>Consistency in sequence refers to the arrangement of listings such as alphabetical, chronological or numerical order. For example, if an exam is scheduled for 3days, the dates should be given in chronological order: June 14, June 15 and June 16.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">5. Correctness</h4>
                        <p>This refers to all the information in the message being accurate - the content, the spelling, the capitalization and the punctuation. The following guidelines can ensure your communication achieves correctness:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Use the correct level of language</li>
                            <li>Check accuracy of figures, facts and words</li>
                            <li>Maintain acceptable writing mechanics</li>
                            <li>There should be proper grammar, punctuation, spelling and paragraphing</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Ask the following questions to test for correctness:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Have you checked all facts for correctness?</li>
                            <li>Have you spelled the reader's name correctly?</li>
                            <li>Have you verified all numbers and amounts?</li>
                            <li>Is the appearance of the letter effective? Is it clean, well-spaced?</li>
                            <li>Have you checked your spelling, punctuation, grammar, etc.?</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">6. Consideration</h4>
                        <p>This refers to the use of the 'You-attitude' instead of the 'I' or 'We-attitude'. Consideration applies sympathy, the human touch and understanding of human nature. It means the message is sent with the receiver in mind. You should try to visualize your readers; their desires, problems, emotions, circumstances and possible reaction to your communication.</p>
                        <p>The following actions can ensure that your communication is considerate:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Focus on 'You-attitude' instead of 'I' or 'We'</li>
                            <li>Show audience benefit or interest in the receiver</li>
                            <li>Emphasize positive pleasant facts</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>This refers to the building of goodwill at all times.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Be sincerely tactful, thoughtful and appreciative</li>

                        </ul>
                        <p>Ask the following questions to test your communication for courtesy:</p>
                        <ul>

                        <p><strong>NOTE: Concreteness:</strong> (sometimes used in the place of consistency - either one of them is ok.)</p>
                        <p>This refers to when communication is specific definite unambiguous and vivid rather than vague and general. The following guidelines lead to concreteness.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Use specific facts and figures</li>
                            <li>Put action in your verb</li>
                            <li>Choose vivid image building words.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Ask the following questions to test your communication for concreteness:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Have you given the crisp details the client needs?</li>
                            <li>Have you made the details razor and needle-sharp?</li>
                            <li>Have you flashed word pictures, made facts vivid?</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The chief art in communication is to know:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>How much to put in.</li>
                            <li>What to leave out.</li>
                            <li>When to quit.</li>
