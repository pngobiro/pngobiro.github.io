CRITICAL AND CREATIVE THINKING
}

\section*{Objectives}
- Describe the principles and concepts of critical and creative thinking.
- Demonstrate skills in critical and creative thinking.
- Apply the theories in critical and creative thinking.
- Evaluate the credibility, reliability or relevance of problem solving skills.
- Apply decision making skills.

\section*{Intoduction}
- Critical thinking is the ability to analyze, evaluate, and assess information, ideas, or arguments objectively.
- It involves logical reasoning, evidence-based decisionmaking, and the evaluation of the quality and validity of information.
- Critical thinking helps individuals make well-informed judgments and avoid bias or fallacious reasoning.
- Key skills in critical thinking include analyzing evidence, identifying assumptions, recognizing logical fallacies, and drawing well-supported conclusions.
- Creative thinking is the process of generating new, innovative ideas and solutions to problems or challenges.
- It encourages thinking "outside the box" and embracing diverse perspectives and approaches.
- Creative thinking is essential for problem-solving, design, art, and any field that values originality.
- Key skills in creative thinking include brainstorming, lateral thinking, pattern recognition, and the ability to take risks and explore unconventional ideas.
- Thinking is the way that the mind makes sense of the world.
- There is no way to understand anything except through thinking.
- Everything we know, believe, want, fear and hope for, our thinking tells us.
- Critical thinking Is a self-directed Process by which we take deliberate steps to think at the highest level of quality.
- Critical Thinking is not driven by answers
- It IS driven by the questions that you ask
- Thinking can be of the highest order, executive functioning that analyses and assess
- Thinking can also be instinctive, automatic and spontaneous all these are unconsciously guided
- The unconsciously guided thinking includes ideas that are valid, as well as nonsense, confusion, stereotypes, prejudices.
- The key is that we cannot distinguish the difference between high and low quality, this thinking mode as goes without assessing itself. (green thinking)
- The highest thinking order is called Red Thinking.
- In this mode the thinking stops and assesses itself before going forward.
- This mode of thinking the person is disciplined, Seeks the truth, there is self assessing, critical thinking, self correcting and Probing.
- In red thinking mode, we actively work to eliminate prejudices, biases, dysfunctional thinking from our thinking.
- We actively work on our thinking.
- We rigorously apply intellectual standards to our
- creativity is the abiliyty to imagine or invent something new
- it is not a talent but a skill that can be learnt
- it empowers people by adding strenghts to their natural abilities which improves teamwork and production
- it is the most important human resource, without creativity there would be no progress as people would be repeating the same pattern ever.
- critical thinking is disciplined thinking governed by clear intellectual standards like clarity, precision, accuracy, relevance, consistacy, logical correctness, competencies and fairness.

\section*{Phases of critical and creative thinking}
- Critical and creative thinking can be broken down into phases that help structure the thought process:
- Both critical and creative thinking involve stages of preparation, ideation, evaluation, and reflection, but the emphasis and approach differ.
- Critical thinking leans toward a systematic and analytical process, while creative thinking often involves allowing more freedom for ideas to emerge and develop.
- Combining both approaches can lead to well-rounded problem-solving and innovation.

\section*{Critical thinking phases}
- Identify the Problem: Begin by recognizing the problem or issue that needs to be addressed.

\section*{Critical thinking}

\section*{Objective}
- By the end of this lesson, you shall be able to apply the concepts and principles of critical thinking.

\section*{Definition of Critical Thinking}
- The term is interchangeable in health care with terms such as clinical reasoning and clinical judgment.
- It is the intellectually disciplined process of actively and skillfully conceptualizing, applying, analyzing, synthesizing, and/or evaluating information gathered from, or generated by, observation, experience, reflection, reasoning, or communication, as a guide to belief and action" (Scriven and Paul 2007).
- There is a say; "Education is not the learning of facts, but the training of the mind to think." Albert Einstein
-Critical thinking means making reasonable, intelligent decisions about what to believe and what to do. That is, it;
1. Clarifies goals
2. Examines assumptions
3. Finds hidden values
4. Evaluates evidence
5. Assesses conclusions
-Critical thinking is general term given to a wide range of cognitive and intellectual skills needed to:
1. Effectively identify, analyze and evaluate arguments
2. Discover and overcome personal prejudices and biases
3. Formulate and present convincing reasons in support of conclusions
4. Clarifies goals, examines assumptions,
5. Finds hidden values, evaluates evidence and assesses conclusions

\section*{Why Critical Thinking}
-Emergency medical technicians need critical thinking;
1. To probe
2. To inquire
3. For gaining reliable information that enables a balanced approach to issues, problems and questions
4. As a rationale for applying critical thinking skills
1. Since there is hunger for knowledge (never enough for success in life)
2. Because information is changing very fast (learners use critical thinking skills to invent and critic new information
3. Help solve problems effectively giving rationale
4. Improve academic results and liberates students to go beyond what is taught in class
5. Carry out disciplined enquiry and enhance 'Self worth

\section*{Types of Critical Thinking}
2. Types of thinking?

\section*{Stages of Critical Thinking}
1. Take in the information (i.e., in what you have read, heard, seen or done)
2. Understand - Comprehend the key points, assumptions, arguments and evidence presented
3. Analyze - Examine how these key components fit together and relate to each other.
4. Compare - Explore the similarities, differences between the ideas you are reading
- Synthesize - Bring together different sources of information to serve an argument or idea you are constructing.
- Make logical connections between the different sources that help you shape and support your ideas.
- Evaluate - Assess the worth of an idea in terms of its relevance to your needs,
- Apply - Transfer the understanding you have gained from your critical evaluation and use in response to questions, assignments and projects. then justify action taken

\section*{Metacognition}

Metacognition is thinking about one's own thinking.
More specifically, "metacognition is being aware of one's thinking as one performs specific tasks and then using this awareness to control what one is doing" (Jones \& Ratcliff, 2013).

For a person to have Metacognition, one must have created a premise on which to base arguments on e.g.; "All emergency medical technicians trainees have first aid training background-John is first aid trainee; Therefore John has undergone first aid training course;

\section*{Examples of Critical Thinking}
- Professors are intelligent- Otieno is a professor; Therefore, he is intelligent

All doctors must do internship-That lady is a doctor, she must have done internship

Spinach contain iron-All Kenyans should eat spinach, to prevent irondeficiency condition

\section*{Assignment.}
- Read and make note on the blooms taxonomy of learning.

\section*{Clinical Reasoning and Argument Formation}

\section*{Introduction}
- Clinical reasoning is a process by which clinicians collect cues, process the information, come to an understanding of a patient problem or situation, plan and implement interventions, evaluate outcomes, and reflect on and learn from the process (Hoffman, 2007; Kraischsk \& Anthony, 2001; Laurie et al., 2001).
- Clinicians with effective clinical reasoning skills have a positive impact on patient outcome.
- Educational practices must help students engage with patients with a deep concern for their well being
-The process consists of eight steps as shown on the diagram;
- Collect Cues-Review current information (e.g., handover reports, patient history, patient charts, results of investigations and medical assessments previously undertaken)
- Gather new information (e.g., undertake patient assessment)
- Recall knowledge (e.g., physiology, pathophysiology, pharmacology, epidemiology, therapeutics, culture, context of care, ethics, law etc.
4. Process Information- Here the clinician
interprets: analyze data to come to an understanding of signs or symptoms. Compare normal Vs abnormal;

Discriminate: distinguish relevant from irrelevant information; recognize inconsistencies, recognize gaps in cues collected;

Relate: discover new relationships between them;
Infer: make deductions or form opinions that follow logically by interpreting subjective and objective cues;
consider alternatives and consequences and match current situation to past situations or current patient to past patients (usually an expert thought process).
5. Predict an outcome (usually an expert thought process).
6. Synthesis and Evaluate-Synthesize facts and inferences to make a definitive diagnosis of the patient's problem, 'Describe a desired outcome within a given time frame; 'Select a course of action between different alternatives available
7. Evaluate the effectiveness of and actions outcomes- Ask if the situation has improved
8. Contemplate what has been learnt from the process and what you could have done differently.

\section*{Argument Formation}

Argument is an activity that we engage in with others, or a rationale for some conclusion

Arguments set up reasons in such a way that, if one accepts those reasons, they are likely to be persuaded of a particular position

\section*{Some Characteristics of Arguments}

Arguments have reasons
Are meant to be persuasive
- Always have a conclusion

\section*{The Process of Argument}

Recognition stage- the participants recognize that they have something to argue about

Initiation stage- the participants get after it. It is marked by initial contributions to the argument

Elaboration stage-the participants fill out their case in support of the claims or positions they seek to defend

Resolution stage-the participants finally resolve their dispute.
-The following words are used to Indicate Argument;
- 'Therefore...
- 'Because....
- 'So...
- 'Thus...
- 'If.....then...
-Words Indicating Inference ie words that signal that an upcoming statement can serve as a premise in support of another statement in the immediate vicinity;
- 'After all...
- 'Given that..
- 'In as much as....
- 'Since..
- 'In view of the fact that..
-And the ones indicating Conclusion are;
- 'Therefore...
- 'In Short...
- 'We can conclude...
- 'So..
- 'Thus....
- 'Finally...

\section*{Cognitive Bias}

\section*{Definition.}
- A cognitive bias is a systematic error in thinking that occurs when people are processing and interpreting information in the world around them and affects the decisions and judgments that they make.
- Cognitive biases are often a result of your brain's attempt to simplify information processing.

Biases often work as rules of thumb that help you make sense of the world and reach decisions with relative speed.

Some of these biases are related to memory. The way you remember an event may be biased for a number of reasons and that, in turn, can lead to biased thinking and decision-making.

Other cognitive biases might be related to problems with attention. Since attention is a limited resource, people have to be selective about what they pay attention to in the world around them.
- The concept of cognitive bias was first introduced by researchers Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman in 1972
-Cognitive Bias vs. Logical Fallacy
A logical fallacy stems from an error in a logical argument.
- Cognitive bias is rooted in thought processing errors often arising from problems with memory, attention, attribution, and other mental mistakes.

\section*{Signs of Cognitive Bias}
- Everyone exhibits cognitive bias. Some signs that you might be influenced by some type of cognitive bias include:

Only paying attention to news stories that confirm your opinions
Blaming outside factors when things don't go your way

Attributing other people's success to luck, but taking personal credit for your own accomplishments

Assuming that everyone else shares your opinions or beliefs
Learning a little about a topic and then assuming you know all there is to know about it

\section*{Types of Cognitive Bias}
- Actor-observer bias.
- This is the tendency to attribute your own actions to external causes while attributing other people's behaviors to internal causes.
- For example, you attribute your high cholesterol level to genetics while you consider others to have a high level due to poor diet and lack of exercise.
- Anchoring bias.
- This is the tendency to rely too heavily on the very first piece of information you learn.
- For example, if you learn the average price for a product is a certain value, you will think any amount below that is a good deal, perhaps not searching for better deals. You can use this bias to set the expectations of others by putting the first information on the table for consideration
- Attentional bias.
- This is the tendency to pay attention to some things while simultaneously ignoring others.
- For example, when making a decision on which car to buy, you may pay attention to the look and feel of the exterior and interior, but ignore the safety record and gas mileage.
- Availability heuristic
- This is placing greater value on information that comes to your mind quickly.
- You give greater credence to this information and tend to overestimate the probability and likelihood of similar things happening in the future.

Confirmation bias: This is favoring information that conforms to your existing beliefs and discounting evidence that does not conform. False consensus effect: This is the tendency to overestimate how much other people agree with you.
- Functional fixedness: This is the tendency to see objects as only working in a particular way.
- For example, if you don't have a hammer, you never consider that a big wrench can also be used to drive a nail into the wall..
- This could extend to people's functions, such as not realizing a personal assistant has skills to be in a leadership role
- Halo effect.
- Your overall impression of a person influences how you feel and think about their character.
- This especially applies to physical attractiveness influencing how you rate their other qualities.
- Misinformation effect
- This is the tendency for post-event information to interfere with the memory of the original event.
- It is easy to have your memory influenced by what you hear about the event from others. Knowledge of this effect has led to a mistrust of eyewitness information.

Optimism bias: This bias leads you to believe that you are less likely to suffer from misfortune and more likely to attain success than your peers. Self-serving bias: This is the tendency to blame external forces when bad things happen and give yourself credit when good things happen. For example, when you win a poker hand it is due to your skill at reading the other players and knowing the odds, while when you lose it is due to getting dealt a poor hand.

\section*{${ }^{\bullet}$ Causes of Bias}
mental shortcuts, known as heuristics, that often play a major contributing role.
- Other factors that can also contribute to these biases:

Emotions
Individual motivations
Limits on the mind's ability to process information
Social pressures
- Cognitive bias may also increase as people get older due to decreased cognitive flexibility. ${ }^{1}$

\section*{-Impact of Cognitive Bias}
- Cognitive biases can lead to distorted thinking.

Conspiracy theory beliefs, for example, are often influenced by a variety of biases. ${ }^{2}$
- But cognitive biases are not necessarily all bad.
- Psychologists believe that many of these biases serve an adaptive purpose: They allow us to reach decisions quickly.
- This can be vital if we are facing a dangerous or threatening situation.

\section*{Tips for Overcoming Bias}

\section*{Being aware of bias:}

Consider how biases might influence your thinking.
In one study, researchers provided feedback and information that help participants understand these biases and how they influence decisions.
The results of the study indicated that this type of training could effectively reduce the effects of cognitive bias by $29 \% .^{3}$
- Considering the factors that influence your decisions:
- Are there factors such as overconfidence or self-interest at play?
- Thinking about the influences on your decisions may help you make better choices.
- Challenging your biases:
- If you notice that there are factors influencing your choices, focus on actively challenging your biases.
- What are some factors you have missed? Are you giving too much weight to certain factors?
- Are you ignoring relevant information because it doesn't support your view?
- Thinking about these things and challenging your biases can make you a more critical thinker.

Logical thinking is the act of analyzing a situation and coming up with a sensible solution.
- Similar to critical thinking, logical thinking requires the use of reasoning skills to study a problem objectively, which will allow you to make a rational conclusion about how to proceed.

\section*{Importance of logical thinking}

\section*{1. Problem solving}
- Logical thinking allows us to understand problems and solve them better. Problem-Based Learning is an excellent way to improve skills in this area and is one of the techniques used in schools from the earliest stages of education.

\section*{2. Abstraction skills}

Logic allows us to anticipate and think about situations and objects that we are not observing at the moment.
- An education that fosters logic also fosters creativity and will lead to people with the ability to use abstract thinking.

\section*{3. Developing critical thinking}

The promotion of logical thinking leads to the development of critical thinking, capable of reasoning and selecting from all opinions and statements while avoiding generalizations and prejudices.

\section*{4. Ease of assimilation}
- Logical thinking makes it possible to classify and order large amounts of information. It also strengthens both long and short-term memory.

\section*{5. A tool for the future}
- A large part of the information languages required by the new digital professions are based on logical formalizations, which will help future professionals to be better and more capable.

\section*{Critical thinking verse logic}
- Using logic, a person evaluates arguments and strives to distinguish between good and bad reasoning, or between truth and falsehood.

Using logic, you can evaluate ideas or claims people make, make good decisions, and form sound beliefs about the world.
- The following questions are ones you may apply to formulating a logical, reasoned perspective:
a. What's happening? Gather the basic information and begin to think of questions.
b. Why is it important? Ask yourself why it's significant and whether or not you agree.
c. What don't I see? Is there anything important missing?
a. How do I know? Ask yourself where the information came from and how it was constructed.
b. Who is saying it? What's the position of the speaker and what is influencing them?
c. What else? What if? What other ideas exist and are there other possibilities?

\section*{Six Thinking Hats}

\section*{Definition of the six thinking hats}
- The six thinking hats is a method used to amplify creative conversations, by making sure that a broad variety of viewpoints and thinking styles are represented.
- Using six roles (or "hats"), the framework - developed by Dr. Edward de Bono - allows teams to more easily structure abstract thinking for productive results.
- The six hats are:
1) The white hat: This is the objective hat, which focuses on facts and logic
2) The red hat: This is the intuitive hat, focusing on emotion and instinct
3) The black hat: This is the cautious hat, used to predict negative outcomes
4) The yellow hat: This is the optimistic hat, used to look for positive outcomes
5) The green hat: This is the creative hat, where ideas are abundant and criticism spare
6) The blue hat: This is the hat of control, used for management and organization
- The six thinking hats are used to divide up the team into different groups (the white hat group, the red hat group, etc.).
$>$ Each group talks about the product from their hat's perspective, i.e., the logical components, the emotional components, and so on.
- This allows for more focused collaboration among smaller groups that can later rejoin with stronger ideas and goals.

\section*{History of the six thinking hats}
- The six thinking hats were first published in 1985 by the respected psychologist Dr. Edward de Bono.

The inspiration for writing the book came from structuring creative thinking, which often leads to confusion and disagreement, especially in groups of people.
- The "hats" allow for organized and effective group thinking.

\section*{Benefits of the six thinking hats technique}
- While deploying the six thinking hats technique can initially feel awkward, it's worth persevering. The benefits speak for themselves:
- Organization
- The six thinking hats technique promotes a highly organized thinking process.
- By considering various perspectives on a problem or decision, you can assign weight to information and eliminate unnecessary details, leading to streamlined decision-making and team consensus.

\section*{- Creativity}
- The six thinking hats technique encourages teams to explore situations and propose innovative ways to address them.
- This pushes individuals and groups to challenge their capabilities, generate more creative ideas, and combine diverse perspectives.

\section*{- Productivity}
- The six hats technique enables people to achieve more in less time by strengthening skills like organization and creative thinking.
- Individuals work together more effectively and can feel empowered by a clear direction for the discussion.
- Quality decision-making
- It's crucial that teams can clearly define the context of the discussion to reduce conflicts and encourage proactive thinking.
- Focusing on one perspective at a time allows the group to make quality decisions as each hat contributes its unique viewpoint.
- Inclusivity
- The six thinking hats technique allows individuals to think outside of their bubbles.
- They're responsible for viewing the problem in a way that represents a specific group of people, leaving preconceptions at the door.
Each hat needs to be represented during the meeting.
- This allows the group to concentrate collectively on one perspective at a time, fostering minimal conflict and shared understanding while ensuring everyone is fully immersed in the discussion.

\section*{- Interpersonal skills}
- The six thinking hats technique enhances listening and communication skills.
- It helps individuals become more persuasive when presenting their ideas, more supportive of others during discussions, and more confident in offering solutions and resolving possible conflicts.

\section*{Using the six thinking hats in agile}
- The six thinking hats technique is perfect for agile retrospectives, especially if your team is growing tired of the typical retrospective format.
- The six hats technique still lets us look at what went right and what went wrong, but it helps us see how these results will affect each perspective the hats represent.
- The first time you run the six thinking hats technique in your retrospective will take a little longer than usual, but you'll find your team is far more engaged in the process.
- Plus, it helps uncover a wider range of perspectives to guide your next sprint.

\section*{How to run a six thinking hats exercise and examples}
- Six Thinking Hats is the perfect technique to look at decisionmaking from different perspectives.
$>$ It introduces an organized parallel thinking process and it helps participants to be more mindfully involved and focused during discussion.

This technique can be applied in many ways, both in groups and as individuals.
- After deciding on the problem or situation you need to discuss, try these approaches:

\section*{In groups}
- Start by assigning a moderator for the group who will wear the blue hat.
- The moderator should set an agenda prior to the meeting and be familiar with the Six Thinking Hats concept.
- Then, each participant should have an easy way to see what perspective they have to take depending on what hat they have.

A name tag with their respective hat color or a sign on the table in front of them should do the job.
- Make sure everyone has a way to record their ideas, so they can clearly show which hat they were wearing at that particular time.

If the group is large, break it into smaller groups.
- You can assign a hat to each group to discuss their approach, or you can have all groups wear the same hat to discuss the same perspective before proceeding to the next hat.
- It's a good idea to rotate the hats between each group to foster as many new ideas as possible and make everyone think about the issue from different perspectives.
- In order to improve teamwork and collaboration, you can also make each group and sub-group wear only one hat at a time.

\section*{Individually}

When you deal with an issue, but you have to solve it alone, it's best to use a template which has every hat along with a section to record your notes.
- The straightforward way to do this is to work your way through each hat one at a time while making notes from each point of view.
- Try not to jump around switching from one hat to another before you are done with it - that can get confusing.

\section*{The Emergency Medicine Approach to Diagnosis}

\section*{Emergency Department Goals:}
- Rule out life-threatening conditions
-Narrow down possible diagnoses
- Institute urgent treatment
- Consider referral to the patient's physician or specialist for further evaluation if needed

Quickly rule out or identify and treat immediate life threats
Focus on red flags indicating serious conditions
Obtain information from patient, family, and friends
Conduct a physical exam

\section*{Secondary Assessment}

Gather information to formulate a differential diagnosis
Look for signs and symptoms guiding further questions and tests

\section*{Limitations in Emergency Department:}

Limited time and resources
Not all tests are immediately available
Working with less information compared to an office setting

\section*{Diagnostic Process:}

Physician works with available information
Orders necessary tests, but not all may be possible in the ED
Considers additional information from laboratory tests

\section*{Busy Environment:}

Physicians often handle multiple patients simultaneously
Frequently interrupted with additional information or questions
Requires efficient and quick decision-making

\section*{Final Diagnosis:}

May range from specific conditions (e.g., appendicitis) to general descriptions (e.g., abdominal pain of unknown cause)

\section*{Disposition:}

Determine appropriate course of action, whether it be treatment, further tests, or referral to another healthcare professional.

\section*{The EMS Approach to Diagnosis}

\section*{EMS Approach to Diagnosis:}

Similarities with emergency physicians, but with limited resources and treatment options

Focus on time efficiency, as EMTs are typically one-on-one with patients

Works in an uncontrolled environment, facing challenges like patient aggression or environmental hazards

\section*{Field Tools and Technology:}

Limited tools compared to an emergency department
- Can assess vital signs and blood oxygen levels, but lacks extensive diagnostic capabilities like blood tests and imaging studies (X-rays, ultrasound, CT scans)

\section*{Education and Training:}

EMTs have narrower education focused on conditions with high morbidity or mortality

Emergency physicians undergo extensive postgraduate training, spending years in medical school and supervised patient care to develop assessment and management skills

\section*{Diagnostic Process:}

Primary assessment: Immediate life threat identification and treatment Secondary assessment: History, physical exam, vital signs, and limited tests

Special attention to identifying red flags during assessment Simultaneous treatment, e.g., administering oxygen

\section*{Differential Diagnosis:}

EMT creates a mental list of possible causes or diagnoses List may be short, focusing on serious conditions associated with the patient's presentation

Example: abdominal pain - considerations may include abdominal aortic aneurysm, gastrointestinal bleeding, dehydration, and other potential causes

\section*{Further Evaluation in the Field:}

Depending on the situation, there may be limited further evaluation en route to the hospital

Consideration of additional evaluation results helps narrow the list of possible diagnoses

Diagnosis may sometimes be a restatement of the chief complaint, especially if no life-threatening conditions are present

\section*{Time and Resource Constraints:}

EMT's diagnostic steps are often abbreviated or limited due to time and resource constraints in the field

\section*{Treatment Emphasis:}

Focus on administering important treatments as quickly as possible Treatment may be limited to what is beneficial and not harmful in the field environment

\section*{How an EMT can learn to think like an experienced physician}

\section*{Love Ambiguity:}

Acknowledge and embrace uncertainty inherent in EMS.
Understand the nature of working in unknown situations with limited resources.

Recognize the importance of making rapid decisions despite incomplete information.

\section*{Understand Limitations:}

Recognize the imperfection of humans and technology.
Accept that errors happen and individuals may have different approaches. Consider the reliability and bias of information sources, including crew members, patients, and bystanders.

Be cautious of potential biases or limited EMS familiarity in information providers.

\section*{Flexibility in Strategies:}

Acknowledge that no single strategy works for every situation. Be flexible and ready to adapt approaches to different EMS calls. Develop a broader list of differential diagnoses, ruling them in or out as needed.

\section*{Build a Strong Foundation of Knowledge:}

Acquire an in-depth understanding of signs and symptoms of common conditions.

Stay updated on new information related to associated conditions.
Develop both thinking processes (tools) and knowledge (supplies).

\section*{Organize Data:}

Create elaborated knowledge by linking signs and symptoms to associated diseases.

Reflect on how the presence or severity of a symptom changes the probability of a particular disease.

\section*{Change Thinking Patterns:}

Compare and contrast conditions to understand commonalities and differences.

Rephrase patient symptoms to align more closely with disease descriptions.

\section*{Learn from Others:}

Utilize exposure to expert clinicians to observe their problemsolving processes.

Ask experts to verbalize their thought processes when solving problems.

\section*{Reflect on Experiences:}

Learn not only from mistakes but also from successes.
Evaluate your performance after patient contacts, identifying strengths and areas for improvement.

Identify knowledge gaps and seek further education to enhance accuracy and efficiency.

\section*{Continued Investigation:}

After reaching a possible diagnosis, continue gathering data to rule in or rule out conditions.

Be aware that a patient may have multiple issues, and keep searching for causes.

Acknowledge the possibility of an incorrect conclusion and continue considering alternative diagnoses.

\section*{Development Process:}

Recognize that critical thinking skills are developed through study, practice, and reflection.

Understand that becoming proficient takes time, and overconfidence can be risky.
Know and respect the boundaries of your knowledge, skill, and judgment.
Strive for continuous learning through study and observation of experienced providers.
Prioritize safe and appropriate patient care over the pressure to reach a diagnosis quickly.

\section*{CRITICAL THINKING}

Critical thinking is defined as the mental process of actively and skillfully perception, analysis, synthesis and evaluation of collected information through observation, experience and communication that leads to a decision for action. In nursing education there is frequent reference to critical thinking and to the significance that it has in daily clinical nursing practice. Nursing clinical instructors know that students face difficulties in making decisions related to clinical practice. The main critical thinking skills in which nursing students should be exercised during their studies are critical analysis, introductory and concluding justification, valid conclusion, distinguish of facts and opinions, evaluation the credibility of information sources, clarification of concepts and recognition of conditions. Specific behaviors are essentials for enhancing critical thinking. Nursing students in order to learn and apply critical thinking should develop independence of thought, fairness, perspicacity in personal and social level, humility, spiritual courage, integrity, perseverance, self-confidence, interest for research and curiosity. Critical thinking is an essential process for the safe, efficient and skillful nursing practice. The nursing education programs should adopt attitudes that promote critical thinking and mobilize the skills of critical reasoning.

\section*{1. INTRODUCTION}

Critical thinking is applied by nurses in the process of solving problems of patients and decisionmaking process with creativity to enhance the effect. It is an essential process for a safe, efficient and skillful nursing intervention. Critical thinking according to Scriven and Paul is the mental active process and subtle perception, analysis, synthesis and evaluation of information collected or derived from observation, experience, reflection, reasoning or the communication leading to conviction for action.

So, nurses must adopt positions that promote critical thinking and refine skills of critical reasoning in order a meaningful assessment of both the previous and the new information and decisions taken daily on hospitalization and use of limited resources, forces you to think and act in cases where there are neither clear answers nor specific procedures and where opposing forces transform decision making in a complex process.

Critical thinking applies to nurses as they have diverse multifaceted knowledge to handle the various situations encountered during their shifts still face constant changes in an environment with constant stress of changing conditions and make important decisions using critical thinking to collect and interpret information that are necessary for making a decision.

Critical thinking, combined with creativity, refine the result as nurses can find specific solutions to specific problems with creativity taking place where traditional interventions are not effective. Even with creativity, nurses generate new ideas quickly, get flexible and natural, create original solutions to problems, act independently and with confidence, even under pressure, and demonstrate originality.

The aim of the study is to present the basic skills of critical thinking, to highlight critical thinking as an essential skill for nursing education and a fundamental skill for decision making in nursing practice. Moreover to indicate the positive effect and relation that critical thinking has on professional outcomes.

\section*{2. CRITICAL THINKING SKILLS}

Nurses in their efforts to implement critical thinking should develop some methods as well as cognitive skills required in analysis, problem solving and decision making. These skills include critical analysis, introductory and concluding justification, valid conclusion, distinguishing facts and opinions to assess the credibility of sources of information, clarification of concepts, and recognition conditions.

Critical analysis is applied to a set of questions that relate to the event or concept for the determination of important information and ideas and discarding the unnecessary ones. It is, thus, a set of criteria to rationalize an idea where one must know all the questions but to use the appropriate one in this case.

The Socratic Method, where the question and the answer are sought, is a technique in which one can investigate below the surface, recognize and examine the condition, look for the consequences, investigate the multiple data views and distinguish between what one knows and what he simply believes. This method should be implemented by nurses at the end of their shifts, when reviewing patient history and progress, planning the nursing plan or discussing the treatment of a patient with colleagues.

The Inference and Concluding justification are two other critical thinking skills, where the justification for inductive generalizations formed from a set of data and observations, which when considered together, specific pieces of information constitute a special interpretation . In contrast, the justification is deduced from the general to the specific. According to this, nurse starts from a conceptual framework-for example, the prioritization of needs by Maslow or a context-evident and gives descriptive interpretation of the patient's condition with respect to this framework. So, the nurse who uses drawing needs categorizes information and defines the problem of the patient based on eradication, nutrition or need protection.

In critical thinking, the nurses still distinguish claims based on facts, conclusions, judgments and opinions. The assessment of the reliability of information is an important stage of critical thinking, where the nurse needs to confirm the accuracy of this information by checking other evidence and informants.

The concepts are ideas and opinions that represent objects in the real world and the importance of them. Each person has developed its own concepts, where they are nested by others, either based on personal experience or study or other activities. For a clear understanding of the situation of the patient, the nurse and the patient should be in agreement with the importance of concepts.

People also live under certain assumptions. Many believe that people generally have a generous nature, while others believe that it is a human tendency to act in its own interest. The nurse must believe that life should be considered as invaluable regardless of the condition of the patient, with the patient often believing that quality of life is more important than duration. Nurse and patient, realizing that they can make choices based on these assumptions, can work together for a common acceptable nursing plan.

\section*{3. CRITICAL THINKING ENHANCEMENT BEHAVIORS}

The person applying critical thinking works to develop the following attitudes and characteristics independence of thought, fairness, insight into the personal and public level, humble intellect and postpone the crisis, spiritual courage, integrity, perseverance, self-confidence, research interest considerations not only behind the feelings and emotions but also behind the thoughts and curiosity.

\section*{Independence of Thought}

Individuals who apply critical thinking as they mature acquire knowledge and experiences and examine their beliefs under new evidence. The nurses do not remain to what they were taught in school, but are "open-minded" in terms of different intervention methods technical skills.

\section*{Impartiality}

Those who apply critical thinking are independent in different ways, based on evidence and not panic or personal and group biases. The nurse takes into account the views of both the younger and older family members.

\section*{Perspicacity into Personal and Social Factors}

Those who are using critical thinking and accept the possibility that their personal prejudices, social pressures and habits could affect their judgment greatly. So, they try to actively interpret their prejudices whenever they think and decide.

\section*{Humble Cerebration and Deferral Crisis}

Humble intellect means to have someone aware of the limits of his own knowledge. So, those who apply critical thinking are willing to admit they do not know something and believe that what we all consider rectum cannot always be true, because new evidence may emerge.

\section*{Spiritual Courage}

The values and beliefs are not always obtained by rationality, meaning opinions that have been researched and proven that are supported by reasons and information. The courage should be true to their new ground in situations where social penalties for incompatibility are strict. In many cases the nurses who supported an attitude according to which if investigations are proved wrong, they are canceled.

\section*{Integrity}

Use of critical thinking to mentally intact individuals question their knowledge and beliefs quickly and thoroughly and cause the knowledge of others so that they are willing to admit and appreciate inconsistencies of both their own beliefs and the beliefs of the others.

\section*{Perseverance}

The perseverance shown by nurses in exploring effective solutions for patient problems and nursing each determination helps to clarify concepts and to distinguish related issues despite the difficulties and failures. Using critical thinking they resist the temptation to find a quick and simple answer to avoid uncomfortable situations such as confusion and frustration.

\section*{Confidence in the Justification}

According to critical thinking through well motivated reasoning leads to reliable conclusions. Using critical thinking nurses develop both the inductive and the deductive reasoning. The nurse gaining more experience of mental process and improvement, does not hesitate to disagree and be troubled thereby acting as a role model to colleagues, inspiring them to develop critical thinking.

\section*{Interesting Thoughts and Feelings for Research}

Nurses need to recognize, examine and inspect or modify the emotions involved with critical thinking. So, if they feel anger, guilt and frustration for some event in their work, they should follow some steps: To restrict the operations for a while to avoid hasty conclusions and impulsive decisions, discuss negative feelings with a trusted, consume some of the energy
produced by emotion, for example, doing calisthenics or walking, ponder over the situation and determine whether the emotional response is appropriate. After intense feelings abate, the nurse will be able to proceed objectively to necessary conclusions and to take the necessary decisions.

\section*{Curiosity}

The internal debate, that has constantly in mind that the use of critical thinking is full of questions. So, a research nurse calculates traditions but does not hesitate to challenge them if you do not confirm their validity and reliability.

\section*{4. IMPLEMENTATION OF CRITICAL THINKING IN NURSING PRACTICE}

In their shifts nurses act effectively without using critical thinking as many decisions are mainly based on habit and have a minimum reflection. Thus, higher critical thinking skills are put into operation, when some new ideas or needs are displayed to take a decision beyond routine. The nursing process is a systematic, rational method of planning and providing specialized nursing. The steps of the nursing process are assessment, diagnosis, planning, implementation, evaluation. The health care is setting the priorities of the day to apply critical thinking. Each nurse seeks awareness of reasoning as he/she applies the criteria and considerations and as thinking evolves.

\section*{Problem Solving}

Problem solving helps to acquire knowledge as nurse obtains information explaining the nature of the problem and recommends possible solutions which evaluate and select the application of the best without rejecting them in a possible appeal of the original. Also, it approaches issues when solving problems that are often used is the empirical method, intuition, research process and the scientific method modified.

\section*{Experiential Method}

This method is mainly used in home care nursing interventions where they cannot function properly because of the tools and equipment that are incomplete.

\section*{Intuition}

Intuition is the perception and understanding of concepts without the conscious use of reasoning. As a problem solving approach, as it is considered by many, is a form of guessing and therefore is characterized as an inappropriate basis for nursing decisions. But others see it as important and legitimate aspect of the crisis gained through knowledge and experience. The clinical experience allows the practitioner to recognize items and standards and approach the right conclusions. Many nurses are sensing the evolution of the patient's condition which helps them to act sooner
although the limited information. Despite the fact that the intuitive method of solving problems is recognized as part of nursing practice, it is not recommended for beginners or students because the cognitive level and the clinical experience is incomplete and does not allow a valid decision.

\section*{Research Process / Scientifically Modified Method}

The research method is a worded, rational and systematic approach to problem solving. Health professionals working in uncontrolled situations need to implement a modified approach of the scientific method of problem solving. With critical thinking being important in all processes of problem solving, the nurse considers all possible solutions and decides on the choice of the most appropriate solution for each case.

\section*{The Decision}

The decision is the selection of appropriate actions to fulfill the desired objective through critical thinking. Decisions should be taken when several exclusive options are available or when there is a choice of action or not. The nurse when facing multiple needs of patients, should set priorities and decide the order in which they help their patients. They should therefore: a) examine the advantages and disadvantages of each option, b) implement prioritization needs by Maslow, c) assess what actions can be delegated to others, and d) use any framework implementation priorities. Even nurses make decisions about their personal and professional lives. The successive stages of decision making are the Recognition of Objective or Purpose, Definition of criteria, Calculation Criteria, Exploration of Alternative Solutions, Consideration of Alternative Solutions, Design, Implementation, Evaluation result.

\section*{The contribution of critical thinking in decision making}

Acquiring critical thinking and opinion is a question of practice. Critical thinking is not a phenomenon and we should all try to achieve some level of critical thinking to solve problems and make decisions successfully.

It is vital that the alteration of growing research or application of the Socratic Method or other technique since nurses revise the evaluation criteria of thinking and apply their own reasoning. So when they have knowledge of their own reasoning-as they apply critical thinking-they can detect syllogistic errors.
