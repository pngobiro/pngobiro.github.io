                        <p>Clinical reasoning is a process by which clinicians collect cues, process the information, come to an understanding of a patient problem or situation, plan and implement interventions, evaluate outcomes, and reflect on and learn from the process (Hoffman, 2007; Kraischsk & Anthony, 2001; Laurie et al., 2001).</p>

                            <li>Educational practices must help students engage with patients with a deep concern for their well being.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The process consists of eight steps:</p>

                            <li><strong>Collect Cues</strong>-Review current information (e.g., handover reports, patient history, patient charts, results of investigations and medical assessments previously undertaken)</li>
                            <li><strong>Gather new information</strong> (e.g., undertake patient assessment)</li>
                            <li><strong>Recall knowledge</strong> (e.g., physiology, pathophysiology, pharmacology, epidemiology, therapeutics, culture, context of care, ethics, law etc.)</li>

                                    <li><strong>Discriminates:</strong> distinguish relevant from irrelevant information; recognize inconsistencies, recognize gaps in cues collected;</li>
                                    <li><strong>Relates:</strong> discover new relationships between them;</li>
                                    <li><strong>Infers:</strong> make deductions or form opinions that follow logically by interpreting subjective and objective cues; consider alternatives and consequences and match current situation to past situations or current patient to past patients (usually an expert thought process).</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Predict an outcome</strong> (usually an expert thought process).</li>
                            <li><strong>Synthesize and Evaluate</strong>-Synthesize facts and inferences to make a definitive diagnosis of the patient's problem, 'Describe a desired outcome within a given time frame; 'Select a course of action between different alternatives available.</li>
                            <li><strong>Evaluate the effectiveness</strong> of and actions outcomes - Ask if the situation has improved.</li>
