                            <li>List may be short, focusing on serious conditions associated with the patient's presentation</li>
                            <li>Example: abdominal pain - considerations may include abdominal aortic aneurysm, gastrointestinal bleeding, dehydration, and other potential causes</li>

                            <li>Depending on the situation, there may be limited further evaluation en route to the hospital</li>
                            <li>Consideration of additional evaluation results helps narrow the list of possible diagnoses</li>
                            <li>Diagnosis may sometimes be a restatement of the chief complaint, especially if no life-threatening conditions are present</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Time and Resource Constraints:</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>EMT's diagnostic steps are often abbreviated or limited due to time and resource constraints in the field</li>
                        </ul>
