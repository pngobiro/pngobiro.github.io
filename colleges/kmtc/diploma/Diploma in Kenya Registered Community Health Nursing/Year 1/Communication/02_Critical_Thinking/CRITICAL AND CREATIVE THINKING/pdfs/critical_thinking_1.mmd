CRITICAL AND CREATIVE THINKING
}

\section*{Objectives}
- Describe the principles and concepts of critical and creative thinking.
- Demonstrate skills in critical and creative thinking.
- Apply the theories in critical and creative thinking.
- Evaluate the credibility, reliability or relevance of problem solving skills.
- Apply decision making skills.

\section*{Intoduction}
- Critical thinking is the ability to analyze, evaluate, and assess information, ideas, or arguments objectively.
- It involves logical reasoning, evidence-based decisionmaking, and the evaluation of the quality and validity of information.
- Critical thinking helps individuals make well-informed judgments and avoid bias or fallacious reasoning.
- Key skills in critical thinking include analyzing evidence, identifying assumptions, recognizing logical fallacies, and drawing well-supported conclusions.
- Creative thinking is the process of generating new, innovative ideas and solutions to problems or challenges.
- It encourages thinking "outside the box" and embracing diverse perspectives and approaches.
- Creative thinking is essential for problem-solving, design, art, and any field that values originality.
- Key skills in creative thinking include brainstorming, lateral thinking, pattern recognition, and the ability to take risks and explore unconventional ideas.
- Thinking is the way that the mind makes sense of the world.
- There is no way to understand anything except through thinking.
- Everything we know, believe, want, fear and hope for, our thinking tells us.
- Critical thinking Is a self-directed Process by which we take deliberate steps to think at the highest level of quality.
- Critical Thinking is not driven by answers
- It IS driven by the questions that you ask
- Thinking can be of the highest order, executive functioning that analyses and assess
- Thinking can also be instinctive, automatic and spontaneous all these are unconsciously guided
- The unconsciously guided thinking includes ideas that are valid, as well as nonsense, confusion, stereotypes, prejudices.
- The key is that we cannot distinguish the difference between high and low quality, this thinking mode as goes without assessing itself. (green thinking)
- The highest thinking order is called Red Thinking.
- In this mode the thinking stops and assesses itself before going forward.
- This mode of thinking the person is disciplined, Seeks the truth, there is self assessing, critical thinking, self correcting and Probing.
- In red thinking mode, we actively work to eliminate prejudices, biases, dysfunctional thinking from our thinking.
- We actively work on our thinking.
- We rigorously apply intellectual standards to our
- creativity is the abiliyty to imagine or invent something new
- it is not a talent but a skill that can be learnt

\section*{Elements of critical thinking}
- Critical thinking involves several key elements that work together to enable individuals to analyze information, solve problems, and make reasoned decisions. These elements include:
- Purpose: Defining the specific goal or objective of your thinking. Why are you thinking about this issue or problem? What do you want to achieve?
- Questioning: The ability to ask relevant and meaningful questions. This includes identifying assumptions, seeking evidence, and evaluating arguments.

- Evaluation: Assessing the quality and credibility of information, arguments, and solutions to make wellfounded judgments.
- Problem-Solving: Applying critical thinking to solve complex problems by identifying and evaluating potential solutions.
- Decision-Making: Making decisions based on rational and informed reasoning rather than emotion or bias.
- Creativity: Encouraging creative thinking and exploring alternative perspectives and solutions
- Open-Mindedness: Being receptive to different viewpoints and willing to revise your thinking in light of new information or evidence.
- Reflection: Continuously reflecting on your thinking process and being aware of your own biases and assumptions.

\section*{Phases of critical and creative thinking}
- Critical and creative thinking can be broken down into phases that help structure the thought process:
- Both critical and creative thinking involve stages of preparation, ideation, evaluation, and reflection, but the emphasis and approach differ.
- Critical thinking leans toward a systematic and analytical process, while creative thinking often involves allowing more freedom for ideas to emerge and develop.
- Combining both approaches can lead to well-rounded problem-solving and innovation.

\section*{Critical thinking phases}
- Identify the Problem: Begin by recognizing the problem or issue that needs to be addressed.

- Make Informed Decisions: Select the most suitable solution based on evidence and logical reasoning.
- Implement the Decision: Put the chosen solution into action and monitor its progress.
- Reflect and Adjust: After implementation, reflect on the results and adjust the approach if necessary.

\section*{Creative thinking phases}
- Preparation: Gather knowledge and information related to the problem or challenge. This phase involves research and understanding the context.
- Incubation: Allow ideas to simmer in your mind without actively trying to solve the problem. This phase often occurs unconsciously.
- Illumination: The "Aha!" moment when a creative idea or insight emerges. This can happen unexpectedly.
- Evaluation: Assess the feasibility and practicality of the creative idea.
- Elaboration: Develop the idea further, fleshing it out and refining it.
