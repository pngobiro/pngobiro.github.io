                        <p>A cognitive bias is a systematic error in thinking that occurs when people are processing and interpreting information in the world around them and affects the decisions and judgments that they make.</p>
                        <p>Cognitive biases are often a result of your brain's attempt to simplify information processing.</p>
                        <p>Biases often work as rules of thumb that help you make sense of the world and reach decisions with relative speed.</p>
                        <p>Some of these biases are related to memory. The way you remember an event may be biased for a number of reasons and that, in turn, can lead to biased thinking and decision-making.</p>
                        <p>Other cognitive biases might be related to problems with attention. Since attention is a limited resource, people have to be selective about what they pay attention to in the world around them.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The concept of cognitive bias was first introduced by researchers Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman in 1972.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Cognitive Bias vs. Logical Fallacy</h4>
                        <p>A logical fallacy stems from an error in a logical argument.</p>
                        <p>A cognitive bias is rooted in thought processing errors often arising from problems with memory, attention, attribution, and other mental mistakes.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Signs of Cognitive Bias</h3>
                        <p>Everyone exhibits cognitive bias. Some signs that you might be influenced by some type of cognitive bias include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Only paying attention to news stories that confirm your opinions</li>
                            <li>Blaming outside factors when things don't go your way</li>
                            <li>Attributing other people's success to luck, but taking personal credit for your own accomplishments</li>
                            <li>Assuming that everyone else shares your opinions or beliefs</li>
                            <li>Learning a little about a topic and then assuming you know all there is to know about it</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Types of Cognitive Bias</h3>
                        <p><strong>Actor-observer bias:</strong> This is the tendency to attribute your own actions to external causes while attributing other people's behaviors to internal causes. For example, you attribute your high cholesterol level to genetics while you consider others to have a high level due to poor diet and lack of exercise.</p>
                        <p><strong>Anchoring bias:</strong> This is the tendency to rely too heavily on the very first piece of information you learn. For example, if you learn the average price for a product is a certain value, you will think any amount below that is a good deal, perhaps not searching for better deals. You can use this bias to set the expectations of others by putting the first information on the table for consideration.</p>
                        <p><strong>Attentional bias:</strong> This is the tendency to pay attention to some things while simultaneously ignoring others. For example, when making a decision on which car to buy, you may pay attention to the look and feel of the exterior and interior, but ignore the safety record and gas mileage.</p>
                        <p><strong>Availability heuristic:</strong> This is placing greater value on information that comes to your mind quickly. You give greater credence to this information and tend to overestimate the probability and likelihood of similar things happening in the future.</p>
                        <p><strong>Confirmation bias:</strong> This is favoring information that conforms to your existing beliefs and discounting evidence that does not conform.</p>
                        <p><strong>False consensus effect:</strong> This is the tendency to overestimate how much other people agree with you.</p>
                        <p><strong>Functional fixedness:</strong> This is the tendency to see objects as only working in a particular way. For example, if you don't have a hammer, you never consider that a big wrench can also be used to drive a nail into the wall. This could extend to people's functions, such as not realizing a personal assistant has skills to be in a leadership role.</p>
                        <p><strong>Halo effect:</strong> Your overall impression of a person influences how you feel and think about their character. This especially applies to physical attractiveness influencing how you rate their other qualities.</p>
                        <p><strong>Misinformation effect:</strong> This is the tendency for post-event information to interfere with the memory of the original event. It is easy to have your memory influenced by what you hear about the event from others. Knowledge of this effect has led to a mistrust of eyewitness information.</p>
                        <p><strong>Optimism bias:</strong> This bias leads you to believe that you are less likely to suffer from misfortune and more likely to attain success than your peers.</p>
                        <p><strong>Self-serving bias:</strong> This is the tendency to blame external forces when bad things happen and give yourself credit when good things happen. For example, when you win a poker hand it is due to your skill at reading the other players and knowing the odds, while when you lose it is due to getting dealt a poor hand.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Causes of Bias</h3>
                        <p>Mental shortcuts, known as heuristics, often play a major contributing role. Other factors that can also contribute to these biases:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Emotions</li>
                            <li>Individual motivations</li>
                            <li>Limits on the mind's ability to process information</li>
                            <li>Social pressures</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Cognitive bias may also increase as people get older due to decreased cognitive flexibility.<sup>1</sup></p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Impact of Cognitive Bias</h3>
                        <p>Cognitive biases can lead to distorted thinking.</p>
                        <p>Conspiracy theory beliefs, for example, are often influenced by a variety of biases.<sup>2</sup></p>
                        <p>But cognitive biases are not necessarily all bad. Psychologists believe that many of these biases serve an adaptive purpose: They allow us to reach decisions quickly. This can be vital if we are facing a dangerous or threatening situation.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Tips for Overcoming Bias</h3>
                        <p><strong>Being aware of bias:</strong> Consider how biases might influence your thinking. In one study, researchers provided feedback and information that help participants understand these biases and how they influence decisions. The results of the study indicated that this type of training could effectively reduce the effects of cognitive bias by 29%.<sup>3</sup></p>
                        <p><strong>Considering the factors that influence your decisions:</strong> Are there factors such as overconfidence or self-interest at play? Thinking about the influences on your decisions may help you make better choices.</p>
                        <p><strong>Challenging your biases:</strong> If you notice that there are factors influencing your choices, focus on actively challenging your biases. What are some factors you have missed? Are you giving too much weight to certain factors? Are you ignoring relevant information because it doesn't support your view? Thinking about these things and challenging your biases can make you a more critical thinker.</p>

                        <p>Logical thinking is the act of analyzing a situation and coming up with a sensible solution. Similar to critical thinking, logical thinking requires the use of reasoning skills to study a problem objectively, which will allow you to make a rational conclusion about how to proceed.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Importance of logical thinking</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Problem solving</strong><br>Logical thinking allows us to understand problems and solve them better. Problem-Based Learning is an excellent way to improve skills in this area and is one of the techniques used in schools from the earliest stages of education.</li>
                            <li><strong>Abstraction skills</strong><br>Logic allows us to anticipate and think about situations and objects that we are not observing at the moment. An education that fosters logic also fosters creativity and will lead to people with the ability to use abstract thinking.</li>
                            <li><strong>Developing critical thinking</strong><br>The promotion of logical thinking leads to the development of critical thinking, capable of reasoning and selecting from all opinions and statements while avoiding generalizations and prejudices.</li>
                            <li><strong>Ease of assimilation</strong><br>Logical thinking makes it possible to classify and order large amounts of information. It also strengthens both long and short-term memory.</li>
                            <li><strong>A tool for the future</strong><br>A large part of the information languages required by the new digital professions are based on logical formalizations, which will help future professionals to be better and more capable.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Critical thinking versus logic</h3>
                        <p>Using logic, a person evaluates arguments and strives to distinguish between good and bad reasoning, or between truth and falsehood.</p>
                        <p>Using logic, you can evaluate ideas or claims people make, make good decisions, and form sound beliefs about the world.</p>
                        <p>The following questions are ones you may apply to formulating a logical, reasoned perspective:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>a. What's happening? Gather the basic information and begin to think of questions.</li>
                            <li>b. Why is it important? Ask yourself why it's significant and whether or not you agree.</li>
                            <li>c. What don't I see? Is there anything important missing?</li>
                            <li>a. How do I know? Ask yourself where the information came from and how it was constructed.</li>
                            <li>b. Who is saying it? What's the position of the speaker and what is influencing them?</li>
                            <li>c. What else? What if? What other ideas exist and are there other possibilities?</li>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Definition of the six thinking hats</h3>
                        <p>The six thinking hats is a method used to amplify creative conversations, by making sure that a broad variety of viewpoints and thinking styles are represented. Using six roles (or "hats"), the framework - developed by Dr. Edward de Bono - allows teams to more easily structure abstract thinking for productive results.</p>
                        <p>The six hats are:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>The white hat: This is the objective hat, which focuses on facts and logic</li>
                            <li>The red hat: This is the intuitive hat, focusing on emotion and instinct</li>
                            <li>The black hat: This is the cautious hat, used to predict negative outcomes</li>
                            <li>The yellow hat: This is the optimistic hat, used to look for positive outcomes</li>
                            <li>The green hat: This is the creative hat, where ideas are abundant and criticism spare</li>
                            <li>The blue hat: This is the hat of control, used for management and organization</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>The six thinking hats are used to divide up the team into different groups (the white hat group, the red hat group, etc.). Each group talks about the product from their hat's perspective, i.e., the logical components, the emotional components, and so on. This allows for more focused collaboration among smaller groups that can later rejoin with stronger ideas and goals.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">History of the six thinking hats</h3>
                        <p>The six thinking hats were first published in 1985 by the respected psychologist Dr. Edward de Bono. The inspiration for writing the book came from structuring creative thinking, which often leads to confusion and disagreement, especially in groups of people. The "hats" allow for organized and effective group thinking.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Benefits of the six thinking hats technique</h3>
                        <p>While deploying the six thinking hats technique can initially feel awkward, it's worth persevering. The benefits speak for themselves:</p>
                        <p><strong>Organization</strong><br>The six thinking hats technique promotes a highly organized thinking process. By considering various perspectives on a problem or decision, you can assign weight to information and eliminate unnecessary details, leading to streamlined decision-making and team consensus.</p>
                        <p><strong>Creativity</strong><br>The six thinking hats technique encourages teams to explore situations and propose innovative ways to address them. This pushes individuals and groups to challenge their capabilities, generate more creative ideas, and combine diverse perspectives.</p>
                        <p><strong>Productivity</strong><br>The six hats technique enables people to achieve more in less time by strengthening skills like organization and creative thinking. Individuals work together more effectively and can feel empowered by a clear direction for the discussion.</p>
                        <p><strong>Quality decision-making</strong><br>It's crucial that teams can clearly define the context of the discussion to reduce conflicts and encourage proactive thinking. Focusing on one perspective at a time allows the group to make quality decisions as each hat contributes its unique viewpoint.</p>
                        <p><strong>Inclusivity</strong><br>The six thinking hats technique allows individuals to think outside of their bubbles. They're responsible for viewing the problem in a way that represents a specific group of people, leaving preconceptions at the door. Each hat needs to be represented during the meeting. This allows the group to concentrate collectively on one perspective at a time, fostering minimal conflict and shared understanding while ensuring everyone is fully immersed in the discussion.</p>
                        <p><strong>Interpersonal skills</strong><br>The six thinking hats technique enhances listening and communication skills. It helps individuals become more persuasive when presenting their ideas, more supportive of others during discussions, and more confident in offering solutions and resolving possible conflicts.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Using the six thinking hats in agile</h3>
                        <p>The six thinking hats technique is perfect for agile retrospectives, especially if your team is growing tired of the typical retrospective format. The six hats technique still lets us look at what went right and what went wrong, but it helps us see how these results will affect each perspective the hats represent. The first time you run the six thinking hats technique in your retrospective will take a little longer than usual, but you'll find your team is far more engaged in the process. Plus, it helps uncover a wider range of perspectives to guide your next sprint.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">How to run a six thinking hats exercise and examples</h3>
                        <p>Six Thinking Hats is the perfect technique to look at decision-making from different perspectives. It introduces an organized parallel thinking process and it helps participants to be more mindfully involved and focused during discussion.</p>
                        <p>This technique can be applied in many ways, both in groups and as individuals. After deciding on the problem or situation you need to discuss, try these approaches:</p>

                            <li>Start by assigning a moderator for the group who will wear the blue hat.</li>
                            <li>The moderator should set an agenda prior to the meeting and be familiar with the Six Thinking Hats concept.</li>
                            <li>Then, each participant should have an easy way to see what perspective they have to take depending on what hat they have.</li>
                            <li>A name tag with their respective hat color or a sign on the table in front of them should do the job.</li>
                            <li>Make sure everyone has a way to record their ideas, so they can clearly show which hat they were wearing at that particular time.</li>
                            <li>If the group is large, break it into smaller groups.</li>
                            <li>You can assign a hat to each group to discuss their approach, or you can have all groups wear the same hat to discuss the same perspective before proceeding to the next hat.</li>
                            <li>It's a good idea to rotate the hats between each group to foster as many new ideas as possible and make everyone think about the issue from different perspectives.</li>
                            <li>In order to improve teamwork and collaboration, you can also make each group and sub-group wear only one hat at a time.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>When you deal with an issue, but you have to solve it alone, it's best to use a template which has every hat along with a section to record your notes. The straightforward way to do this is to work your way through each hat one at a time while making notes from each point of view. Try not to jump around switching from one hat to another before you are done with it - that can get confusing.</p>
