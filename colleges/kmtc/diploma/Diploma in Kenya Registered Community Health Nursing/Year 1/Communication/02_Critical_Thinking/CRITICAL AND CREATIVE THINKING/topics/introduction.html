                        <p>Critical and creative thinking can be broken down into phases that help structure the thought process:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Both critical and creative thinking involve stages of preparation, ideation, evaluation, and reflection, but the emphasis and approach differ.</li>
                            <li>Critical thinking leans toward a systematic and analytical process, while creative thinking often involves allowing more freedom for ideas to emerge and develop.</li>
                            <li>Combining both approaches can lead to well-rounded problem-solving and innovation.</li>
                        </ul>
