                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The process of counselling refers to the cycle of events that take place within the counsellor/patient relationship. Counselling is a dynamic process involving relation building and progressing in stages. Many models describe this process, including the GATHER steps and a three-stage model of Exploration, Understanding, and Action.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">The GATHER Steps</h3>
                        <p>There are six basic steps applied in the initial counselling process and they are remembered with the acronym or memory aid GATHER.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>G</strong>reet client and welcome him</li>
                            <li><strong>A</strong>sk the client about self and family. Ask the help he requires from you and find the reason for coming to consult you.</li>
                            <li><strong>T</strong>ell the client what you can/cannot do for him to solve the problems and emphasize on your commitment to help solve the problem</li>
                            <li><strong>H</strong>elp the client to formulate course of action and identify resources to resolve the problem</li>
                            <li><strong>E</strong>xplain available services and where they are located. Explain the cost of the services</li>
                            <li><strong>R</strong>eturn appointment. Make the next appointment with the client to enable you review the progress</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Stages of Counselling</h3>
                        <p>The counselling process is often split into three stages: exploration, understanding, and action.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Exploration Stage (Entry Phase)</h4>
                        <p>This is the beginning stage in which the counsellor helps the patient clarify their current difficulties, problems, issues, concerns, and undeveloped opportunities. Exploration means helping the clients articulates their concerns. It involves searching oneself or looking within oneself to search for hidden motives, thoughts or feelings that clients may not be aware of. The main questions in this stage are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>What is the presenting problem</li>
                            <li>What is the underlying/real problem</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The aims of exploration stage are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>To establish a working relationship</li>
                            <li>To clarify and define problems</li>
                            <li>To make an assessment</li>
                            <li>To negotiate a contract</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Patient's question: 'What are my problems, issues, concerns and what are the undeveloped opportunities?'</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Understanding Stage (Work Phase)</h4>
                        <p>This stage, also called the middle stage, is the stage of understanding and insight, promoting new perspectives, and looking at the preferred scenario. Now that rapport has developed and the patient has aired some issues, a greater depth of understanding can be reached. The understanding stage involves helping the clients develop insight into their issues. The question here is:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>What is the root cause of the real problems?</li>
                        </ul>
                         <p>The aims of understanding stage are to:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Reassess (helping client see other perspectives in their problems)</li>
                            <li>Maintain the working relationship (relationship should be free for the client to engage in deeper exploration).</li>
                            <li>To pursue the work of the contract (counseling is a contractual relationship and clients should be helped to fulfill their contract goals.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Patient's question: 'What do I need or want in place of what I have?'</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Action Stage</h4>
                        <p>The aim here is to develop goal accomplishing action strategies by helping the patient discover how to get what they want. The action stage involves helping the client to plan the course action, implementing it and if necessary reefing it. The question here is:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>What does the client plan to do as the result of this new insight?</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The aims of the action stage are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>To decide on the appropriate change</li>
                            <li>To implement the change</li>
                            <li>To transfer learning</li>
                            <li>To end the counseling relationship(termination)</li>
                        </ul>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Skills refer to the ability to do something well. i.e the expertise to perform an activity well. The HCW uses specific types of verbal and non-verbal behaviour to help patients through their process of exploration, understanding and action.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Attending and Active Listening</h3>
                        <p>Attending is paying attention to another person. It demonstrates that you are visibly tuned in to the patient. Effective attending tells the patient that you are listening and puts you in a position to listen carefully to the patient's concerns.</p>
                        <p><strong>Active Listening</strong> involves: </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Listening to and understanding the patient's verbal messages</li>
                            <li>Observing and reading the patient's non-verbal behaviour; posture, facial expressions, movement, tone of voice</li>
                            <li>Listening to the context; the whole person in the context of the social settings of their life</li>
                            <li>Listening to sour notes; things the patient says that may have to be challenged</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">SOLER (Attending Skills)</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>S</strong> - Sitting squarely facing another person is considered a basic posture of involvement.</li>
                            <li><strong>O</strong> - Open posture should be adopted. Crossing the legs and arms can be a sign of lessened involvement.</li>
                            <li><strong>L</strong> - Leaning forward towards the patient at times is a natural sign of involvement.</li>
                            <li><strong>E</strong> - Eye contact should be maintained, without staring or glaring.</li>
                            <li><strong>R</strong> - Being relatively relaxed and natural when doing all of the above is important.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Basic Counselling Skills</h3>
                        
                        <h4>Social Skills</h4>
                        <p>These skills facilitate interpersonal interaction and provide a chance for counselee and counselor explore each other. They communicate interest, guidelines and trust.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Greeting skills:</strong> Use customary ways at greeting people nicely as you do mutual self introduction e.g. Good morning: My name is...</li>
                            <li><strong>Politeness skills:</strong> Is an expression of one's sensitivity to the feelings, gratitude to others e.g. use expressions of courtesy like "excuse me please", "thank you" "how kind are you"</li>
                            <li><strong>Kindness skills:</strong> Expresses ones good wishes for others and readiness to do something for others.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Responding</h4>
                        <p>Responding is the first essential step in effectively helping a client. It helps the counselor to enter into the clients frame of reference. The accurate response becomes a mirror-image of the clients experience and leads to more self exploration. To respond to feeling and content use the format: "You feel....................because ....................."</p>

                        <h4>Questioning</h4>
                        <p>The counselor may respond using questions to assist in deeper self exploration. The counselor may ask "how, when, where, who" but avoid "why" as it has a judgemental connotation. Ask open-ended question that is relevant to the client e.g. how does that make you feel? What plans do you have?</p>

                        <h4>Paraphrasing</h4>
                        <p>A skill that allows the counsellor to confirm and clarify statements made by the patient by repeating them using different words. Paraphrasing shows that you have both heard and understood the patient.</p>

                        <h4>Reflecting Feelings</h4>
                        <p>This involves understanding a patient's emotional responses and communicating this back to them. For example, if a patient says, 'I am worried that I will suffer a lot with HIV.' the counsellor might reflect these feelings back to the patient by saying: 'You are feeling anxious and fearful about the discomfort and pain that HIV may bring you.'</p>

                        <h4>Clarifying</h4>
                        <p>Prevents misunderstanding and helps people focus and sort out what has been said. For example, if a patient says, 'I can't exclusively breastfeed my baby.' the counsellor may ask: 'In what way is exclusive breastfeeding a concern for you?'</p>

                        <h4>Summarizing</h4>
                        <p>Summarizing pulls the threads together so that the patient can see the whole picture and gain greater understanding of it. It helps to ensure that the patient and the counsellor understand each other correctly. Use summarizing throughout the entire the counselling session.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Core Conditions as Skills</h3>
                        
                        <h4>Unconditional Positive Regard (UPR)</h4>
                        <p>This is an attitude of positive regard, its an attitude of "no strings attached". You respect the client as he is, respect implies that the counselor recognizes the clients freedom and his right to determine and make his own decisions.</p>

                        <h4>Genuineness</h4>
                        <p>Genuineness means being congruent. As a counselor, you need the characteristics of being genuine. Your non-verbal and verbal communication is in accord. It means having no façade mask, having no defenses, you are an integrated person.</p>

                        <h4>Empathy</h4>
                        <p>Roger says empathy is sensing the client's private world as if it were your own Without ever losing the "as if" "quality". You ask client what he is feeling so that you can feel with them and understand how they are feeling.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Challenging / High Functioning Skills</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Advance level empathy:</strong> Used to evoke clients feeling and meaning that already reside in them. It's sensing by the counsellor of what the client implies but perhaps not directly stated in his disclosure.</li>
                            <li><strong>Confrontations:</strong> Refers to the action initiated by the counsellor based on the understanding of the client. The counsellor observes some discrepancies on the client's behaviors and bring this to the client's awareness.</li>
                            <li><strong>Immediacy:</strong> This is used to explore the counsellor client relationship in the here and now therapy. It involves dealing with counsellor client feelings.</li>
                            <li><strong>Concreteness:</strong> This is the counsellor's ability to get the client to be specific in what they are saying. It enables the client to point out the main issue and stop generalization.</li>
                            <li><strong>Self-disclosure:</strong> This is the sharing of experiences that are similar to the clients' which the counsellor has solve successfully. The counsellor shares something personal for the benefit of the client to manifest solidarity in human struggle with difficulties.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <span class="heading-text">Termination of Counselling</span>
                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Termination means ending the counselling relationship. Termination is decided by the counsellor when the patient shows signs of improvement and the ability to solve their problems. As a good counsellor, you should prepare your patient to be ready for termination of counselling relationships.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Techniques of Termination</h3>
                        <p>The counsellor introduces the idea of termination and encourages the patient to rely on themselves instead of the counsellor. Self-reliance gradually separates the counsellor and the patient. Both counsellor and patient agree to reduce the number of sessions and to complete all pending issues before termination. There are some patients who may require further counselling support after termination. In this case, encourage gradual termination and allow the patient the opportunity to visit you when the need arises. The actual process of separation may be challenging for the patient and they may exhibit one or more of the reactions listed below.</p>

                        <h4>Denial</h4>
                        <p>Denial is experienced when the counsellor informs the patient of their intention to terminate the counselling sessions. The denial is characterized by a feeling of shock, disbelief, panic and refusal to accept the idea of terminating counselling relationships. The patient refuses to believe the counsellor can really stop the counselling sessions. You can help the patient at this stage by convincing them that they are doing very well and there is need to stop the counselling for a while to see how they progress alone. You can identify specific changes which have occurred since commencing counselling sessions.</p>

                        <h4>Anger</h4>
                        <p>Anger is experienced by the patient for losing a person so good and helpful. The patient keeps on asking why such a thing should happen only to them and not to somebody else. Patients may become very angry and sometimes refuse to eat. As a counsellor you should assist the patient to overcome the state of anger by letting them express their feelings about what is happening. Encourage them to continue expressing the feelings and accept the termination.</p>

                        <h4>Bargaining</h4>
                        <p>Bargaining is where the patient tries to change the counsellor's mind about the idea of termination. The patient tries to prolong the counselling sessions by setting unrealistic goals. The patient may come up with arguments to support the unrealistic goals hoping the counsellor will change their mind. As a counsellor you should listen attentively to their complaints and/or arguments and then emphasize the achievements they have made alone and the necessity for them to be independent.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Depression</h4>
                        <p>Depression occurs when the patient realizes the counsellor is serious and will definitely terminate the counselling relationships. The patient may feel very sad after realizing that there is nothing they can do to change the situation. They may experience a feeling of hopelessness and despair. They may also withdraw from their friends. A feeling of depression may also be characterized by anorexia and insomnia.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Acceptance</h4>
                        <p>Acceptance results when the patient accepts the reality of termination. They start to plan ways of coping with the new situation without the help of the counsellor. The patient gains confidence that they have the ability to manage their own affairs independently.</p>
