\subsection*{1.1. DEFINITION OF TERMS:}

\section*{GUIDANCE:-}

Guidance has been defined as "a process of helping an individual understand himself and his world" (Sherzer \& Stone, 1976). It is also defined as "a process concerned with determining and providing for the developmental needs of a group and at personal level" (MOEST Kenya, 1997).

Can you coin your own definition of Guidance?
From the definitions above, you realize that Guidance is an on going process aimed at assisting an individual be aware of his/her identity, resources, and limitations in order to adjust well in life. One has to be aware of his world in terms of the resources available to be used by the individual to exploit his full potential, and lead a productive happy life. We all need guidance through out life.

\section*{COUNSELLING}

Counseling is an interactive process involving the counselee who is vulnerable and who needs assistance and the counselor who is trained and educated to give this assistance. The goal is to help the counselee learn to deal more effectively with himself and the quality of his environment.

From these definitions you realize that Counseling involves a relationship between a counselor and client. Through which the client is helped to explore his thoughts, feelings and behavior to gain selfunderstanding that leads to decision making and taking relevant action to deal with the issues/problems. Thus counseling is a process of empowering a person to solve his problems or "helping a person help himself".

NOTE: What Counseling is not:-
- Counseling is not a conversation- it is not simply two people, exchanging information and opinions.
- Counseling is not discussion- different points of view are not being argued.
- Counseling is not an interrogation. The client is not being morally evaluated, pardoned or absorbed by the counselor.
- Counseling is not the giving of information - The client does not come to the counselor only for information although information may sometimes be given.
- Counseling is not about influencing attitudes, beliefs,behaviours by counselor - the client is not persuaded, compelled, or threatened to change his attitudes to those of the counselor.

\section*{OTHER TERMS}
* Psychotherapy:- This refers to treatment by psychological means, problems of an emotional nature in which a trained person deliberately establishes a professional relationships with the client with the objective of removing, modifying and retarding existing symptoms of behaviour and personality growth and development (Wolberg U, L.R, 1967).
* Psychoanalysis:- A method of treatment for mental and nervous disorders which was originally developed by Sr. Freud. It consists of analyzing motives and feelings which have been repressed and helping the individual to redirect his energies in a more constructive manner.
* Psychosomatic illness:- A physical illness which is caused by an emotional disturbance.
* Frustration:- Refers to tension or imbalance felt by an individual when talking about human needs and defence mechanisms. There is a delay or blockage in the event of a need. It's a feeling which one experiences when one is unable to satisfy his desires.

\subsection*{1.2 DICHOTOMY OF GUIDANCE AND COUNSELLING}

Guidance and Counseling are like the two sides of the same coin. There are similarities between the two process.Olu Makinde (1984) advanced the following distinctions between Guidance and Counseling as follows:-
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|}
\hline & GUIDANCE & & COUNSELLING \\
\hline 1. & Guidance is the "body" of psychotherapy. & 1. & Counseling is the "heart of Psychotherapy. \\
\hline 2. & Guidance is knowledge based. It deals with facts; principles, methods and cognitions. & 2. & Counseling is affective: It is valueoriented; deals with perception, motivation, needs and feelings. \\
\hline 3. & Guidance is less personal and less intimate. It is usually structured and more public. & 3. & Counseling is more personal, intimate and less structured. It is interpersonal, private and confidential. \\
\hline 4. & Guidance is informative and didactic & 4. & Counseling is largely emotional, flexible and less didactic. \\
\hline 5. & Guidance is usually initiated by counselor. & 5. & Counseling is usually initiated by the client. \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

As noted earlier, there are similarities between the process of Guidance and that of Counseling as follows:-
1. Both Guidance and Counseling assist individuals understand themselves and their worlds.
2. Both processes help individuals to find solutions to their problems.
3. Both are concerned with individual's personal development and individual's behavioral process.
4. Both are based on the recognition of the dignity and worth of the individual client as well as his/her right to make choices.
5. Both are oriented towards co-operation and not compulsion.

\subsection*{1.3 IMPORTANCE OF GUIDANCE AND COUNSELING PROGRAM IN SCHOOLS}

\section*{TOPIC: 2}

\section*{FOUNDATIONS OF GUIDANCE AND COUNSELLING}

In this topic, we are going to focus on how formal Guidance and Counseling evolved in the developed and developing countries. We shall also compare the formal Guidance and Counseling with the traditional one.

\section*{HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT IN DEVELOPED COUNTRIES}

The formal Guidance and Counseling was first concepturealized in the U.S in the $17{ }^{\text {th }}$ century. It was started in response to various problems such as poor working conditions, economic and political problems, immigration, child labour, and increased crime. Several stages in evolution of Guidance and Counseling came up to address these problems. These included:
i) The vocational Guidance movement

This emphasized the need for vocational information, planning and guidance to help people prepare for the world of work. In vocational planning students need to be assisted in :-
a) Taking a critical individual analysis of their aptitudes, interest and personality traits.
b) Getting adequate information of the world of work such as structure of the world of work, how workers function, how traits contribute to workers function etc.
ii) The mental hygienic movement
- Focused on mental health
- Conditions in mental health hospitals
- Establishment of mental health institutions:
- Psychiatry
- Psychotherapy
- Social work
- Counselling
- Guidance and Counseling in schools started
- Welfare of workers during industrial revolution
- Project of training house wives to cancel others.

The founder, Clifford Beers (1909) was a wealthy Young man who became interested in problems of mental health. After, confinement for mental breakdown. He wrote a book "entitled" A mind that found itself. Through his book he highlighted to the public the deplorable conditions in mental hospitals and aroused interest in mental problems. As a result, institutions for psychiatry, psychotherapy, social worker and counseling to help people adjust to their problems started. Personnel at work started also to look into the welfare of workers as
industrial revolution commenced. Mrs. Lee (Morical) started a project of training housewives to counsel others as peers or as paraprofessional counselors.
iii) The child Guidance movement

This was started by Dr. William Heally (1909). Healy and his wife (A couple) started a clinic in Chicago as a result of treating physical illness of children from broken homes especially slum areas. They realized the need to treat both physical and psychological problems of the children. Other child guidance clinics later started.
iv) The testing movement

Alfred Bunnet developed the "Intelligence scale" in 1905 to measure IQ. This was a big step forward in the development of measurement techniques that gave a greater degree of objectivity to the process of Educational and vocational planning for children and young adults. Bunnet stimulated the need for identifying and assisting mentally retarded children. Since this development more standardized tests (psychological tests) have constructed to measure intelligence, aptitude, achievement, personality values and vocational interests.
v) Dean of Girls movement

Ella Flaff-Young (1913) recommended the extension of vocational Guidance to other schools in the city of Chicago. He also recommended appointment of women counselors in mixed high schools to cater for social Guidance of girls as the boys went to the principal as counselor and friend. Young also recommended that women counselors would only teach regular classes so as to organize for social life needs of the girls. The counselor would be paid \&300 extra for this responsibility. This pioneered the Guidance movement especially determining the place of Deans in secondary schools.

\subsection*{2.2 GUIDANCE AND COUNSELLING MOVEMENT IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES}

Modern Guidance and Counseling in developing countries can be traced back in 1959 in Nigeria. The Catholic sisters at St. Theresa's college Ibadan started to organize formal career guidance service for the upper class students a few months before the school certificate examinations began. Like in U.S.A the emphasis was on
- Vocational information,
- Awareness of the world of work
- The need for these services was felt more due to rapid pace of industrialization, urbanization growth and uneven distribution of wealth as well as start of universal free primary education. The Catholic sisters felt the need for their graduating students to be informed).
- The world of work and occupational information).
- Being trained in human relations(personnel issues)
- Guest speakers from various government departments and other officials were invited to give lecturers and seminars to students on employment opportunities. This vocational movement spread to other parts of Nigeria leading to formation of Ibadan careers council "in 1962 and later the "counseling Association of Nigeria(CAN) was lauched in 1976 with Olu Makinde as the first President". CAN got affiliated to the American personnel and Guidance Association (APGA) to draw inspiration strength and support. CAN also started a journal called "the counselor"

Since 1971 most universities in Nigeria started Guidance and Counseling departments to train potential counselors for high schools and colleges. According to Makinde, guidance and Counseling in the Educational system in Nigeria was a matter of concern. Many Educationists thought Guidance and Counseling can be handled by any teacher even with no training in this area. The career masters were just appointed with no training having no insight of the function of a Guidance Counselor. This is similar to the Kenya situation as we are going to note.

In Kenya formal Guidance and Counseling are concepts of the 70's. The Guidance and Counseling unit was started in 1971 in the Ministry of Education after a conference in 1967 on careers. Teachers, Educators and employers met to determine the criteria for selecting school leavers for public and private jobs.

\section*{(Nairobi Careers Council)}

The unit was charged with 3 responsibilities
i) To offer educational guidance and Counseling to help in planning suitable programs to prepare youth for man-power needs in Kenya.
ii) To give personal/psychological counseling for those students with Maladjustments e.g. unhappiness annoyance, anxiety, neurosis, excess frustration etc.
iii) To give vocational guidance and counseling to assist young People in vocational choice based on their interests and uptitudes.

In 1984, a circular was sent to all heads of secondary schools instructing them to start Guidance and Counseling units/departments. The heads were to constitute guidance and counseling committee composed of 6-8 interested members of staff for the following functions:-
a) To assist in the evaluation of Guidance programme
b) Make recommendations to the administration concerning development of guidance and counseling.
c) Keep staff members and parents informed about the progress of guidance and counseling.
d) Participate in planning and conducting special guidance projects such as surveys of students problems, occupational surveys etc.
e) Recommend specialists and consultants as guest speakers whenever possible.

Just like in Nigeria implementation of the Guidance programme in Kenyan schools has taken a slow pace. Some of the constraints that have hindered effective implementation of Guidance and Counseling program are:
- Lack of finances for training and resources like reference materials.
- Lack of trained personnel in Guidance and Counseling.
- Ignorance of role of guidance and counseling among staff and students.
- Peer pressure discouraging others to go for counseling.
- Conflict in role of discipline and that of Guidance and Counseling.
- Lack of clear policy from the government on guidance and counseling.
- Time limitation for teacher counselor and for students.
- Negative effect of the print and electronic media advertising drug casual sex which give discourages.
- Cultural beliefs and practices.
??? Can you cite more constraints?

\subsection*{2.3 TRADITIONAL GUIDANCE AND COUNSELING NOT FOR GP 11}

The concepts of Guidance and Counseling have been in existence as long as humanity has lived. Through the ages people have sought to understand themselves, offer counsel/advice assist in developing potentialities and getting aware of the opportunities in life. Elders and chiefs were sought by the youth for Guidance although they did not elaborate on career guidance since there were limited occupational opportunities. The youth assumed roles based on age and gender. Skills were handed down through on job training (apprenticeship) e.g. potters, medecinemen, blacksmith. Preventive approach was mainly used in traditional Guidance and Counseling geared towards avoiding suicide, irresponsible behaviour etc.

It was done in a casual way as people went on with usual routines like cooking, cultivating, grazing etc. During festivals and ceremonies, in initiation rites, marriage/weddings, funerals etc guidance was given.

Some of the goals of traditional Guidance and Counseling were; educating children on acceptable behaviour, about their religion, to teach youth to be honest being involved in economic social cultural activities, relating with others especially members of opposite sex, preparing for initiation, marriage and adult life. Youth were also trained to control their emotions and exercise self-control.

The agents of traditional Guidance and Counseling were: parents and members of extended family, elders, peer group members, those in authority like elders, chiefs, traditional doctors, palmists, soothsayers/fortune tellers and astrologers were also sought for advice. The methods used in the traditional guidance and counseling included oral explanation like story telling, proverbs/riddles, songs and dances during festivals or rituals and also visits to grand parents, uncles, aunts, medicine men etc.
??? Can you compare traditional Guidance and Counseling and the formal Guidance and Counseling????
The following are some skills used by traditional practioners as compared to modern Guidance and Counseling:
1. Invitation- The traditional practitioners knew when to invite people for guidance and counseling while modern counselors wait for clients in the office.
2. Knowledge. Traditional knew the culture; people's background- had an idea of prevailing issues- modern live in a complex society.
3. Use of local language:- This helps to release tension and makes communication better. Modern counselors use foreign language mostly, hindering clear communication.
4. Non-verbal communication:- The traditional counselors understand these well as they come from same cultural background with client. Modern counselors may not understand nonverbal communication from all clients.
5. Interaction:- Traditional counselors were interested in the questions "why and how" to get out of a problem, but modern counselors are interested in what happened e.g. psychoanalysis that focuses on past experiences.
6. Social skills:- Traditional counselors were familiar with the customary behaviour in the community they belonged to makling it easier to establish ropport with client. Modern counselors might be ignorant of the social skills of different ethnic groups.

Note that the traditional Guidance and Counseling was offered to all at no charge(except medicine men who would charge affordable fee inform of goods). Modern counselors are not accessible by all people who need help and they charge for their services since it is a profession for them.

\section*{TOPIC 3}

\section*{THEORIES OF COUNSELLING}

Theories are reasoned suppositions put forward to explain facts or events. They are explanations of the general principles of art or science. Theories help us understand a phenomenon or behaviour. Theories of counseling are derived from theories of psychology. These theories help us to be able to predict behaviour understands the emotional problem a client might have and also how the client's behaviour can change.

A counselor has to choose a counseling theory that will guide his practice in order to deliver counseling services effectively. There are many counseling theories but we shall only focus on three, namely:
- Psychoanalytic theory
- Behavioral theory
- Humanistic theory

\section*{PSYCHONALYTIC THEORY}

This theory was advanced by Sigmund Freud (1856-1939). It is considered the first force/thrust in attempting to understand the human mind and behaviour. Psychoanalysis involves analysis of the unconscious motivations that influence behaviour.

\section*{KEY CONCEPTS}
a) Human behaviour is deterministic. Our behaviour is determined by irrational forces, unconscious motivations, biological and instinctual drives.
b) Behaviour is influenced by conflicts in the personality structure consisting of ID, Ego and superego. The Id operates with the "pleasure Principle" I.e. desire to satisfy instinctual needs and avoid pain. The Id is largely unconscious, does not think only wishes. It is irrational. The Ego is in touch with reality. It is the executive that governs controls and regulates personality. It meditates between the instincts and the surrounding environment. It is the seat of intelligence and rationality. It operates on the "Reality Principle " as it does realistic and logical thinking. The superego is the person's moral code being concerned with whether an action is good or bad, right or wrong. It is the judicial arm of personality. It represents the ideal, the values or ideals of society as handled down from parents to children. It strives for perfection. Superego operates with the "moral code principle"
c) Behaviour is influenced by experiences or conflicts in the first six years of life. According to Freud, an individual goes through the five psychosexual stages namely:- oral, anal, phallic, latency and genital stage. If one does not negotiate these stages successfully, fixation results and this affects later behaviour.
d) Anxiety, (a state of tension) develops due to conflict between id, Ego and superego trying to control the available psychic energy. Anxiety motivates behaviour. To cope with anxiety and avoid being overwhelmed, the ego employs defence mechanisms. These ego defenses are normal behaviours and have adaptive value but should not be overused or become a lifestyle to avoid reality. Some defence mechanisms include projection, repression, denial, reaction formation, compensation etc.

\section*{GOALS OF THERAPY}
1. To bring the unconsciousness
2. To strengthen the Ego
3. To help client gain insight into the origin of his problems.

\section*{TECHNIQUES OF COUNSELLING}

\section*{1. Free association}

The client is allowed to talk freely anything that comes to mind however illogical, painful or irrelevant it might seem. Freud called this, talking cure or catharsis.

\section*{2. Analysis of dreams}

Freud viewed dreams as the royal road to the unconscious. The client narrates the dreams he/she has had and the therapist assists in analyzing them though there is no universal interpretation of dreams.

\section*{3. Analysis of transference}

A client might attach feelings he has for another person to counselor. The counselor's role is to facilitate that transference as it helps the client ventilate some emotions like anger, making the client feel better. Note that a counselor might also attach some feelings for another person to a client. This is called counter-transference. The counselor has to be aware of this feeling, otherwise it can affect the therapy.

\section*{4. Analysis of Resistance}

The client might have experienced some painful events in the past which are repressed in the unconscious. There may be resistance when trying to get in touch with those painful experiences. The counselor has a role to break that resistance.

\section*{5. The Freudian slip}

Freud said that there is no slip of the tongue. What comes out as a slip of the tongue is infact, the unconscious getting access to the conscious.

\section*{BEHAVIORAL THERAPY}

These were advanced by B.F. Skinner, John B. Watson, Albert, and Bandura Ivan Pavlov among others. The behavioral approach is regarded as the $2^{\text {nd }}$ force/thrust in psychotherapy. There are four behavioural theories namely:- classical conditioning, operant conditioning, social learning and cognitive behaviour theory. We are going to focus on the first three theories.

\section*{KEY CONCEPTS:-}
1. Behavour is learned
2. Behaviour can be unlearned
3. Behaviour can be relearned
4. Behaviour is the problem not the symptom.
5. Human beings are both products and producers of the environment.

\section*{GOALS OF COUNSELLING}
1. To eliminate maladaptive behaviour.
2. To help clients to relearn more effective behaviour pattens,
3. To help clients to change their problematic behaviour.

\section*{1. Classical Conditioning}

This was developed by Ivan Pavlov. He experimented with dogs in modification of behaviour. He conditioned the dog to salivate on hearing a bell because the dog was trained to associate the bell with food. This implies that people who are subjected to some severe conditions and react in certain ways will always react in similar way when exposed to similar conditions. This means that behaviour can be learnt and can be sustained by reinforcement. Behaviour can also be unlearnt by, refusing to reward it.

\section*{2. Operant(instrumental) Conditioning}

Operant means that all organisms works in a given environment, resulting to some consequences. It is instrumental because there is sorely responsible for generating rewards for its behaviour. B.F. Skinner advanced this theory after experimenting with rats. A rat in a box stepped on a bar of a food delivering system accidentally, causing food pellets to come out. The rat continued this action to get more food. Similarly human beings have to learn to operate in their environment (home, school, work, town) in order to receive positive consequences. For instance a husband may show love to the wife to create a satisfying relationship. Thus behavioral counselors will teach clients techniques that will help them operate on the environment to get what they want.

\section*{3. Social Learning Theory}

Albert Baudura developed this theory. Social learning refers to observational or imitation learning. An individual learns in his environment as he/she interacts and observes others. Social learning guides ones behaviour to comply with societal norms values and beliefs. This helps a person adjust well in society. Bandura experimented with dolls. Children treated a doll the way they saw adults treat it. They learnt by observing similarly clients can learn by observing the counselors. So counselors have a challenge to encourage this modeling process by making every effort to be desirable models.

\section*{Techniques of Counseling}
1. Use of systematic desensitization - This introduces the client to a feared object slowly until he/she unlearns the fear.
2. Use of flooding. The client is exposed to the feared object in abundance to unlearn the fear.
3. Use of self-management techniques
4. Use of aversive therapy/stimulation. Behaviour is associated with painful stimulation causing the client to unlearn it.

\section*{HUMANISTIC APPROACH}

\section*{PERSON CENTERED THEORY}

Carl Rogers (1902-1987) developed the person centered theory. Note that there are other humanistic theories like get start theory, but we shall only focus on person centered theory. This theory is considered humanistic because of the positive view of human being it holds. It emphasis on the respect and uniqueness of a person.

\section*{Key Concepts}
1. A client is viewd as trustworthy
2. Clients have potential and are capable of self-direction
3. Clients can make constructive changes. They are the experts of their problems
4. Clients are able to live effective and productive lives.
5. Psychological disturbance results when a persons ideal self and real self in conflict.

\section*{COUNSELLING TECHNIQUES}

There are not techniques per se but Carl Rogers proposed three core conditions that help in a therapeutic relationship. These are:-
i) Empathy
ii) Unconditional positive regard
iii) Genuineness

Empathy- refers to counselor's ability to tune in to the wave length of the client. It is to enter into the client's world to try and understand how they are experiencing their world. Accurate emphatic understanding is very important as it helps the client to feel understood.

Unconditional- positive regard means communicating a respecting, caring attitude to the client. It is being nonjudgmental and accepting the client's feelings, thoughts and behaviour are not judged.

Genuineness- means being real or congruent during therapy. The counselor has to be himself, no façade to be able to model genuineness to the client. These core-conditions help the client to be open to experience and realize his potential in dealing with his/her issues.

\section*{TOPIC 4}

\section*{GUIDANCE AND COUNSELLING SERVICES IN SCHOOLS}

Any guidance and Counseling program should encompass the major components. These are:-
i) Educational Guidance

This is the help given to students on choice of subjects/courses based on their interests and abilities. Students are also assisted on academic problems such as under achieving, poor reading techniques etc.
ii) Vocational guidance

This enables the individuals to comprehend the world of works students are assisted in choosing careers in line with their talents, interests and training and job opportunities available. Each individual has to be prepared to participate in occupations of economic and social value. All must be helped to appreciate the dignity of labour so as to co-operate in the task of nation building.
iii) Personal/Psychological Counseling

This is the assistance given to individuals showing personality maladjustment such as anxiety, excessive frustration, unhappiness, extreme anger, mobility of aspirations achieved, partial or total failure etc.

Those with adjustment problems like loneliness (home-sickness) in ability to socialize also need counseling. These personal problems are detrimental to academic achievement; hence they should be addressed to by the counselor in the institution or suitable referral be made. These three components of Guidance and Counseling are covered in the program by offering the following services:-

\section*{1. ORIENTATION OR ADAPTIVE SERVICES}

These help students to adjust better in any new environment. As students are admitted in new institutions many get lost socially and psychologically. Thus orientation services help the students to adjust to the new physical environment, rules and regulations governing students conduct facilities in the institutions, teaching staff and the Guidance and Counseling program in the school.

\section*{2. APPRAISAL/INVENTORY SERVICES}

This involves collection of personal data of a student through interview, observation, testing, history etc on each student. The information helps one know his strengths and weaknesses so as to make reasonable choices. The analysis of this objective data also helps in understanding the client in order to give realistic help in problem-solving or decision-making.

\section*{3. INFORMATION OR DISTRIBUTIVE SERVICES}

These services are aimed at providing students with better knowledge of educational, vocational and social opportunities so as to make informed choices and decisions. Sufficient, reliable up-to-date information assists one to make realistic decisions.

\section*{4. PLANNING AND PLACEMENT SERVICES}

This aids individuals to get admission into a school, college, job or secure admission in hospital for treatment. The students are helped in making necessary applications.

\section*{5. FOLLOW -UP- RESEARCH AND EVALUATION SERVICES}

These are not direct services to the students/clients but they help the institution's officials appraise the program. Follow-up studies of past students and those still in school help evaluate the effectiveness of the program. Research provides information on whether the students are being prepared for life in the institution and outside.

\section*{5. COUNSELLING SERVICE}

This service is the heart of the work of Guidance and Counselors. Counseling is concerned with feelings, attitudes and emotional disposition of an individual about himself and the situation he is facing. Counselor attempts to help a student better understand himself in relating to his present and future decisions or problems. Rogers (1961) referred to counseling as a series of direct contacts with the
individual which aims to offer assistance in changing attitudes and behaviour. Students with psychological problems or maladjusted behaviour can be assisted through Counseling.

\section*{TOPIC: 5}

\section*{APPROACHES TO GUIDANCE AND COUNSELLING}

Kottman (1977) came up with the following approaches that can be used in offering Guidance and Counselling services.

\section*{1. CRISIS APPROACH}

This involves taking action when a problem or crisis has already occurred. The counselor is expected to use crisis intervention techniques to fix the problem for example after death of a loved one, car, plan, or train crash/accident, rape etc. As a result of these problems trauma results which need to be addressed through debriefing. Debriefing is a form of counseling that helps the affected person(s) to express emotions caused by the traumatic incident. This help to process the painful feeling of fear, anger, bitterness etc and the persona gets emotionally relieved.

\section*{2. REMEDIAL/REHABILITATIVE APPROACH}

This focuses on measurable weaknesses and tries to remediate them. The purpose is to avoid possible crisis in that particular area. It involves teaching skills and social skills that students do not have, negotiation skills can be taught to assist in solving interpersonal problems.

\section*{3. PREVENTIVE MODEL}

In this approach, the counselor tries to identify problems and prevent them from happening. These problems can potentially affect large numbers of students. Prevention is mainly done through dissemination of relevant information. Issues such as drug and substance eating disorders dropping out of school, teenage pregnancies HIV/Aids etc can be addressed through the preventive approach.

\section*{4. DEVELOPMENTAL APPROACH}

The counselor identifies some specific skills and experiences that the students need to make them successful in school life. It is based on student outcome, some of the skills that can be used are teaching sharing information role playing coaching, tutoring, and counseling. The skills taught may
encompass all areas of student interest i.e. academic, social, spiritual, personal and vocational/career domains. For example a student who is weak in social aspect may be given training in assertiveness, to avoid being manipulated by others or to withstand peer pressure.

\section*{COUNSELLING ETHICS}

Counselling, like any other profession has ethical standards to guide those involved in it. Ethical standards are a framework from which to work. They consist of values such as confidentiality, competence and responsibility. The purposes of a code of ethics are:-
- Promote unity and pride of the profession
- To give professional standards in situations of conflict.
- Helps to clarify to the counselee the counselors responsibilities.
- Protects clients from malpractice by unqualified counselors
- Provides uniformity in the profession.
- Protects the counselors in cases of legal suits.
- Enhances individual development by promoting high standards of professional conduct.

We are going to focus on five broad principles of counseling ethics namely:Autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficience, justice and fidelity.

\section*{1. AUTONOMY}

The counselor has to allow the client to be independent and free to make their choices .The client has a right as he/she wish even if others disagree. The counselor does not decide what is best for the client neither does he impose his values on the client. This means respecting the client's decisions or choices.

\section*{II. BENEFICENCE}

This refers to the counselor's responsibility to promote the welfare of the client. Whatever is done in counseling should be for the benefit of the client. For example, a counselor will operate within his level of competence, and if he is not able to help a client he will refer the client.

\section*{III NON-MALEFICENCE}

A counselor should avoid any harm on a client. He/She has responsibility to ensure the client does not worsen through negligence or recklessness. A counselor is expected to practice within the limits of his competence. A counselor has to observe confidentiality. If client's information has to be used in research or training consent of the client should be sought or the identity of the client should be sought or the identity of the client should be disguised.

\section*{IV JUSTICE}

This refers to counselor's responsibility to treat all clients equally regardless of their age, gender, race, ethnicity, cultural background, socioeconomic status, disability, life style orientation and religion. Every person should be accorded access to counseling services and be treated fairly. Counselors should not exhibit prejudice or discrimination.

\section*{V. FIDELITY}

This means being royal or faithful to the client. It refers to promise keeping. The counselor has to maintain confidentiality as promised, and keep the appointments with clients.

\section*{FUNCTIONS OF COUNSELLING TEACHERS}

\section*{TOPIC 7}

\section*{COUNSELLING PROCESS AND SKILLS}

Counselling is a dynamic process involving relation building and progressing in stages. Many practicing counselors see counseling process as consisting of three stages. These are:-
- Exploration
- Understanding and
- Action

Self exploration is aimed at helping the counselee identify the real problem. After the presenting the problem to the counselor, the counselor may use his expertise. i.e. skills and attitudes to find out whether the presented problem is the real problem. The counselor takes time to explore. The two questions assist the counselor in the exploration stage.
i) What is the presenting problem?
ii ) What is the real problem?
Self understanding helps one get insight on the nature of the problem. Once one understands the root cause of the problem.

Action refers to counseling plan on how to deal with the new insight gained from exploration and selfunderstanding. Example:- James realized that he is losing temper too often and he wants to control it. In exploration he asks what makes me get angry so many times? This helps him understand where he is in his world with respect to where he wants to be i.e devices the steps to take in order to control his anger i.e action.

When a counselee comes for help with a personal problem he wants to change something in himself to solve it's attitude:- perception of self of others, haits of general change of behaviour.

There is no permanent solution to a problem without some change in the counselee. (Fuster 1998) to change one has to go through the learning processes involving:- exploration.

\section*{EXPLORATION}

Exploration means helping the clients articulates their concerns. It involves searching oneself or looking within oneself to search for hidden motives, thoughts or feelings that clients may not be aware of.
To explore the client has to be helped to talk about themselves and their concerns in a specific and focused way. The main questions in this stage are:-
- What is the presenting problem
- What is the underlying/real problem the client is encouraged to focus on self and not others.
- The counselor puts aside his/her own curiosity, interest and interpresentation to allow the client to explore.

The aims of exploration stage are:-
- To establish a working relationship
- To clarify and define problems
- To make an assessment
- To negotiate a contract

The stage involves application of the foundations skills:-
- Attending a working relationship
- To clarify and define problems
- To make an assessment
- To negotiate a contract.

The stage involves application of the foundations skills:-
- Attending skills.
- Core conditions (sympathy)
- Unconditional positive regard and genuineness.

\section*{UNDERSTANDING}

The understanding stage involves helping the clients develop insight into their issues. Clients are helped to free themselves and their concerns in a near and more empowering light. Client is challenged to review and question their current frame of reference and embrace more liberating perspective. Challenging helps client face aspects of themselves and their concerns which they may be avoiding or overlooking. This stage involves journeying deeper into oneself to clarify the impact of feelings, values and beliefs on the current behaviour.

\section*{The question here is:-}

What is the root cause of the real problems?
The aims of understanding stage are to:-
- Reassess(helping client see other perspectives in their problems)
- Maintain the working relationship (relationship should be free for the client to engage in deeper exploration).
- To pursue the work of the contract (counseling is a contractual relationship and clients should be helped to fulfill their contract goals.

\section*{ACTION}

The action stage involves helping the client to plan the course action, implementing it and if necessary reefing it. After self-exploration and understanding the client is more clear about his/her concerns. The client is then ready to plan and take effective action.

Action planning involves a careful evaluation of alternative goals/strategies to reach the goal set. The action, plan is initiated in the counseling session, but more of the implementation is done outside the session. The transfer of learning to other settings is critical if the counseling goals are to be achieved.

The question here is:-
- What does the client plan to do as the result of this new insight?
- The aims of the appropriate change
- To decide on the appropriate change
- To implement the change
- To transfer learning
- To end the counseling relationship(termination)

\section*{BASIC COUNSELLING SKILLS}

Skills refer to the ability to do something well.i.e the expertise to perform an activity well (NB. Techniques are more intellectual than skills. Therefore one has to be taught how to do or use the techniques.

\section*{ATTENDANCE}

Attending is paying attention to another person. It includes:-
a) Social Skills such as :-
- Greeting skills:- Use customary ways at greeting people nicely as you do mutual self introduction e.g. Good morning: My name is
- Politeness skills:- Is an expression of one's sensitivity to the feelings, gratitude to others e.g. use expressions of courtesy like "excuse me please", "thank you" "how kind are you"
- Kindness skills:- Expresses ones good wishes for others and readiness to do something for others.

These social skills facilitate interpersonal interaction and provide a chance for counselee and counselor explore each other. They communicate interest, guidelines and trust. Appreciate and practice them daily.

\section*{b) Skill of Attending Physically and Psychologically}

The counselor must be aware of the body language. We communicate more non-verbally i.e with body language.
" $80 \%$ of your interpersonal communication is through our body language and $20 \%$ with words". To attend physically- welcome counselee warmly, show interest and place of the meeting, ensure the room is clean, well ventilated,
- Be relaxed, sit facing the counselee, keep eye-contact lean forward.
- Avoid distracting behaviour like yarning, fidgeting etc
- Consider cultural practices/norms.

\section*{c) Observing Skills of Responding}

Responding is the first essential step in effectively helping a client. It is regarded as the first stage in counseling process. Responding helps the counselor to enter into the clients frame of reference in order to accurately understand how she experiences the world. It is giving feedback to what client said.

The accurate response becomes a mirror-image of the clients experience and leads to more self exploration. It shows the client that counselor is full in tune with the client experience and has understood where the client is and the psychological need one has. After collecting the nonverbal data through the eyes and the verbal data through the ears, capture the feeling experience and the reason for the feeling and communicate this to the client thus:
i) Respond to feeling and content use the format:-

You feel....................because ....................." for example a client says: I cant concentrate on my studies all the time the thoughts of that girl come into my mind and cant get "rid of them"
Counselor responds
"You feel frustrated with yourself because you cannot succeed in brushing aside those thoughts and study well as you would like to"
ii) Respond with a summary (summarizing or paraphrasing summarize what the client has expressed through feelings and words to stimulate him to more self-exploration. Let the client approve the summary or modify it for any omissions.

\section*{d) Questioning}

The counselor may respond using questions to assist in deeper self exploration. The counselor may ask"how, when, where, who but avoid "why" as it has a judgemental connotation or it may put the client on the defensife. Ask open-ended question that is relevant to the client e.g. how does that make you feel? What plans do you have?

\section*{e) Unconditional Position Regard (UPR)}

This is an attitude of positive regard, its an attitude of "no strings attached". You cant set conditions for the relationship. (You don't say, I will only help if ....). This means that you respect the client as he is, respect implies that the counselor recognizes the clients freedom and his right to determine and make his own decisions. Respect also means acceptance of the client as he is and appreciate at him as a person of worth. If counselor is able to communicate respect, then the client won't feel isolated, will create a situation of confidence and trust in. You give some warmth to the client but it has to be non-possessive warmth

\section*{f) Genuineness}

Genuineness means being congruent. As a counselor, you need the characteristics of being genuine as you have to be 3 levels.
- Level of experience a girl feeling jealous of another girl.
- Level of awareness of experience she is aware of feelings of jealousy by speaking ill of the other girl.

In counseling one has to be honest or transparent. Your non-verbal and verbal communication is in accord. Genuineness is being at one self. It means having no façade mask, having no defenses, you are an integrated person. It involves being spontaneous.

You proceed from your natural feelings, dispositions or particular mood without constraints. You can share personal experiences with clients though it is very confidential. You become a model for someone to imitate but disclosure for a counselor should be done carefully only if it will help client.
g) Empathy

Its good as a counselor to have empathy for some one going through problems. Its sharing the problem with the other person and you feel with them but you are not doing anything to correct the situation so as to help the client feel his load has been lifted. It can be referred to as "walking a mile in a client's experience in an intellectual way.

Roger says empathy is sensing the client's private world as if it were your own Without ever losing the "as if" "quality". You ask client what he is feeling so that you can feel with them and understand how they are feeling. Ask the client whether what you are seeing is the person is feeling. A counselor tries to enter clien's frame of reference.
h) Self-Disclosure

This is an attitude that consists in the counselor's willingness to reveal to the consulee his own personal feelings, attitudes, opinions and experiences for the benefit of the counselee. This helps the client to open up as the counselor is authentic and the client feels his case is not isolated since the counselor had a similar experience.

\section*{TOPIC 8}

\section*{METHODS OF COUNSELLING}

\section*{INTRODUCTION}

There are two ways in which counseling may be conducted:
i) Individual counseling
ii) Group counseling

Whatever the method the counselor chooses to use should be the best in the given situation and that it will help the counselee gain insight into his/her abilities, interests, aspirations and other personality traits.

Conditions to be satisfied before any method is chosen
i) The guidance and counselor must be acknowledgeable, counselor must be knowledgeable, conscious and secure, while the clients are not.
ii) There should be two or more persons in the counseling situation.
iii) The clients must come on his/her own, be invited or referred by someone.
iv) The client should enter into a conducive climate where acceptance respect (regard) goal setting, learning and alternatives are possible.

\section*{A) INDIVIDUAL COUNSELING}
- It is an ideal method of counseling and involves one client and one counselor.
- It requires more time ( 45 minutes - 1 hour) the client has a chance to sometimes choose a counselor.
- It is more confidential and private which helps the client to open up more and express the self without fear because they are only two people.
- It requires more trust by client in the counselor. There is close interaction between the counselor and the client i.e. better understanding.
- The client can trust one person to keep the information in confidence.
- Counselor can concentrate better when dealing with one case.

\section*{B) GROUP CONSELLING}
- This could be one counselor to a group of clients or more than one counselor to a group of clients.
- It requires that the clients have a similar issue or problem.
- For a group of counselors, their training skills should be the same and also their interests and experiences.
- The method could be informative e.g. giving general information to students on: education, vocation, health, social and ethical issues, sex and sexuality relationships, HIV/Aids etc.
- The clients must all be (easily) reached at the time and venue required.
- Care must be taken to avoid hurting some people with regards to very confidential/personal matters at the expense of others.
- Members of the group and the counselors must agree on the issues to be addressed as a group. ( not private).
- It focuses on thoughts; values purpose attitudes, behaviour and goals of an individual and the total group.
- It is necessary and potentially a significant part of all comprehensive guidance and counseling programmes.

\section*{GOALS OF GROUP COUNSELLING}
1. To help each member of the group to know and understand himself and others.
2. To enable individuals develop increased self-acceptance and a feeling of personal worth.
3. To develop social skills and interpersonal abilities which enable one to cope with developmental tasks in personal and social areas.
4. To develop increased self direction
- Problem solving ability
- Self dignity and decision making skills and finally transfer these skills to use in real life situations.
5. To develop sensitivity to the needs of others; which results in increased recognition of responsibility for one's behaviour (thus by treasuring how to identify with feelings of others).
6. To learn to be an active listener who hears not only what is said but also the feeling that accompany what has been said.

\section*{C) WHY GROUP COUNSELLING IS USED IN SCHOOLS}
- It gives a sense of belonging, acceptance and understanding of the self and others.
- Groups are a way of life in schools i.e. positive and negative groups.
- Groups counseling promotes optimum human growth and interpersonal relationships children can express their hopes, and fears verbally and non-verbally and gain a growing awareness at how they affect others.
- Students/pupils are able to try out new behaviours which they may be able to test in more structured situations.
- They are able to learn various skills such as control of emotions delayed gratification etc
- Pupils/students feel less isolated and lonely that they are not alone in their fears/concern.

\section*{ADVANTAGES OF GROUP COUNSELLING}
i Many clients can be dealt with all at the same time, saves time.
ii Issues that many fear to raise individually are discussed in general.
iii Counselors can get various opinions and suggestions or problems in a group within a short time.
iv) A lot of information can be passed on to a group within a short time.
v) It is easier due to assistance from each other i.e. counselor and clients.

Note:
The objective of group counseling is to produce more competent individuals and not to produce better groups. Text book by: Muro 2 Kotman Library Reserve section

\section*{TOPIC 9}

\section*{REFERAL SERVICES}

\section*{MEANING AND REASONS FOR REFERAL}

Referral means transferring a client to another counselor or agency for further assistance or specialized help.
In a school situation a counselor may be faced with cases he does not have the competence to handle effectively. Other cases require specialist in particular areas e.g. psychiatrist, lawyer. There are other cases that are referred to agencies that offer financial assistance which a counselor cannot offer. Sometimes a client may request to be referred if a counselor has relocated, or the client is not making any progress or the client may not be comfortable with the counselor's way of working. If a friend, or relative seeks counseling. Also if a counselor gets attracted to the client or vice-versa, the counselor should refer the client.

There are other cases in a learning institution that requires referral such as:
- Students abusing drugs
- Sexual or physical assault- rape
- Mental retardation and mental disturbance
- Employment needs or placement

For effective referral the counselor requires
- Good judgment in assessing the need and service needed
- Knowledge of the available specialists and services.
- Skills in assisting the client and their families to make use of referral services.

The referral process involves
i) Discussing with the client on the use of referral and letting the client decide whether to accept or reject. For teenagers and children parents have to be involved.
ii) Informing the clients/parents of the available referral services location, length of sessions, charges and counseling approach.
iii) The counselor can help in making arrangements for the referral, then the client can take action to go.
iv) The counselor may follow-up to keep reassuring the client in order to avoid feelings of rejection after referral.

\section*{Counselling－notes}

\section*{COUNSELLING}

\section*{INTRODUCTION TO COUNSELLING}

Counselling is NOT:
- Giving advice.
- Having a discussion.
- An interrogation.
- An investigation.
- Indulging in curiosity.
- Solving other people's problems.
- Making others do what one wants.
- About threatening others to change their attitudes.

DEFINITION OF COUNSELING: "Counseling is essentially a process in which the counselor assists the counselee to make interpretations of facts relating to a choice, plan or adjustment which he needs to make." -Glenn F. Smith
"Counseling is a series of direct contacts with the individual which aims to offer him assistance in changing his attitude behaviors." - Carl Rogers

The counsellor helps the client to work through the issues by listening, reflecting, paraphrasing, summarizing and responding with understanding to both how she sees herself and her concerns. Also, the counsellor strives to provide a safe and secure environment for the client's self-exploration, and creates a warm, caring and trusting relationship. Further, he or she communicates genuineness, empathy, and unconditional positive regard (UPR), in order for the client to discover herself. Finally, the counsellor helps the client work out some SMART options, and leaves it to her to select the best one

\section*{The aims of counselling}

Counselling must always be based on the needs of the client. Counselling the following major aims (Egan, 1998):
1) Help the client understand the problems they are experiencing
2) Give them information they are lacking to solve problems
3) Assist them to understand alternative approaches to solving the problems facing them
4) Help them to explore the problems and clarify conflicting issues
5) Assist them to adjust to the problem or to find better ways of coping/living with the problem
6) Assist others who may be experiencing similar problem

\section*{Types of Counselling}

Different patients come for counselling with various problems. The type of counselling is, therefore, determined by the nature of problems presented by the patients.

\section*{Individual Counselling}

Individual counselling occurs when a counsellor is working with only one person at any given time, i.e. when a nurse is dealing with a single patient.

\section*{Group Counselling}

This occurs when a counsellor is working with more than one person at any given session. Group counselling is recommended for people facing the same problem, for example, alcoholics. In group counselling individuals need each other's support and encouragement to change their behaviour.

For example, Alcoholic Anonymous (AA), is an association formed by alcoholics who have or are trying to stop drinking and provides group counselling and support for each other. People are encouraged to discuss personal experiences and changes in their daily life.

\section*{Marital Counselling}

This occurs when the counsellor is working with married couples. Marital counselling is conducted by a trained therapist who understands the problems and trials of marriage and married life. Marital counselling is done when both couples are present. The counsellor assists the couple to understand their problems and to find solutions to their problems.

\section*{Family Counselling}

This occurs when a counsellor is working with more than two members of a family at any given session. Family counselling focuses on family issues and is conducted when all the family members concerned are present. Effective counselling cannot occur if some family members are excluded from counselling sessions.

\section*{Special Group Counselling}

The special group is composed of any group of people who require counselling to enable them to adjust better in their life. For example:
- Drug and substance abusers
- Rape victims and rapists
- HIV/AIDS infected and affected people
- Terminally ill people of all categories
- Families/individuals with handicapped persons
- Marital or family disputes
- Those who need abortion or have procured abortion
- People requiring reproductive health/family planning assistance
- Those experiencing sex difficulties/impotence
- Retirees
- Retrenchees

\section*{Qualities of a Good Counsellor}

\section*{Patience}

A good counsellor should be very patient with their patient, no matter how many times the patient repeats themselves. You should not hurry the patient at all or show impatience. Nor should you show you are bored or tired of holding long discussions. You should only go to the next step of explaining when the patient has understood clearly the content of the information you are giving. If you are patient, your patient will feel that you accept themselves as a person and are interested in what they are talking about. This encourages the patient to open up even more.

\section*{Warmth}

You should show warmth without being possessive during counselling. Smile and show a lot of concern and acceptance to the patient.

\section*{Confidentiality}

Confidentiality means keeping all the information given by the patient secret. As a counsellor, you should not let anyone know what your patient has discussed with you.

To maintain confidentiality, counselling should be done on an individual basis (where appropriate) and in a private room. You, as a counsellor, have an obligation to treat all the information you have been given with confidence. The patient consults you because they believe that all information they disclose will remain secret. It is unprofessional to disclose any information obtained from a patient during counselling except to other professionals who have are involved in the care.

\section*{Honesty}

Honesty refers to the act of telling the truth to the patient. As a good counsellor you should always tell your patient the truth. You should never tell a lie to your patient. If, for example, you are not sure of something, tell them simply that you will go to look for information. Honesty is exercised by both patient and counsellor. You should encourage your patient to be very honest on the information they are giving. Similarly, you should not hide any information of concern to your patient. Being honest makes the patient regard you as a dependable and trustworthy counsellor.

\section*{Empathy}

Empathy is defined as the ability to imagine oneself in the position of another person, and thus, share and understand that person`s feelings. Empathy is the ability of the counsellor to put themselves in the position of the patient by understanding their feelings. As a counsellor, you should understand what your patient is feeling and communicate this understanding to them.

Empathy involves being very close to the patient and sharing your thoughts and feelings. When you share your feelings with the patient they feel accepted, loved and understood.

Empathy is characterized by both sharing and separateness. Although as a counsellor you share thoughts and feelings with the patient, the counsellor should remain separate and retain objectivity. This allows you to give objective responses to assist the patient in making the right decisions.

\section*{Observance}

A good counsellor must be very observant. As you listen to your patient talking, observe their facial expressions and try to interpret the meaning of any nonverbal communication. Facial expressions may reveal painful memories expressed in the form of anger, sadness and frustrations.

Listen very carefully to the patient, observing if their facial expressions correspond with their speech. Observe carefully any mood swings and their relevance to the conversation. The observations are made to detect any inappropriate behaviour expressed by the patient. Close observation also makes the patient feel the counsellor is interested in the conversation.

\section*{Accepting}

Being accepting means the patient is accepted the way they are. The counsellor recognises the basic rights of the patient, whether they are good or bad. When the patient feels that they are accepted as a person with their own rights, they are encouraged to disclose information.

As a counsellor you should be nonjudgmental. You should avoid criticizing the patient even if you feel they are wrong. You should listen carefully when the patient is talking to understand the message they are conveying. You can only give suggestions and not criticism.

\section*{Avoiding Embarrassment}

Embarrassment is a situation where one feels uncomfortable in a social setting. You can avoid embarrassing your patient by holding the counselling session in a private room. You can also avoid embarrassing the patient by understanding the cultural background of their community. Try to avoid sensitive probing questions which make the patient develop feelings of guilt. Probing questions are statements which focus on the experiences, feelings and thoughts of the patient.

As a counsellor, you should observe and interpret nonverbal communication after asking a sensitive probing question. You can restate the same question in a different fashion if you note your patient is uncomfortable.

\section*{Relevant Discussion}

Relevant discussion means that the counselling session is confined to the topic. During counselling the patient is given sufficient time to narrate their story. The counsellor listens and observes the patient carefully to pick up the core information related to the problem. The counsellor encourages the patient to come out with core information while noting any deviations or irrelevant information. The counsellor assists the patient in keeping focused on solving the problem.

\section*{Respect Opinion}

This means the counsellor accepts the patient as a human being with their own rights to make decisions concerning their welfare. The counsellor should know that the patient has the ability to give constructive ideas to solve their problem. The counselling relationship improves when the patient becomes aware their views are respected.

The counsellor recognises that the patient is better placed to know their own problems and has the resources to solve them. This means that the counsellor accepts the views of the patient in principle even if they may not be good. The counsellor's role is to provide the patient with additional information and to suggest alternative options of solving the problem. The patient is, therefore, assisted to solve his problems through the counselling process.

\section*{Process of Counselling}

The process of counselling refers to the cycle of events that take place within the counsellor/patient relationship. The counsellor tries to establish a good interpersonal relationship with the patient during the interview. The establishment of a good rapport enables the patient to voluntarily give information related to the problem facing them without any fears. The following section explores the best way to conduct a counselling session. Just compare this with what you have been doing in your health facility.

The role of a Health Care Worker (HCW) is to support and assist the patient by practicing
- Listening to the patient
- Understanding the choices that need to be made
- Helping the patient explore their options and circumstances
- Helping the patient develop self-confidence enabling them to carry out the decision made

The HCW is not responsible for resolving all of the patient's worries and concerns or for the decisions the patient ultimately makes

\section*{The Steps in the Counselling Process}

When you counsel a patient, you progress through a series of interconnected and overlapping stages to help them make informed decisions. Both you and the patient actively participate as you exchange information and discuss the patient's feelings and attitudes about the matter at hand.

There are six basic steps applied in the initial counselling process and they are remembered with the acronym or memory aid GATHER.
$\checkmark$ Greet client and welcome him
$\checkmark$ Ask the client about self and family. Ask the help he requires from you and find the reason for coming to consult you.
$\checkmark$ Tell the client what you can/cannot do for him to solve the problems and emphasize on your commitment to help solve the problem
$\checkmark$ Help the client to formulate course of action and identify resources to resolve the problem
$\checkmark$ Explain available services and where they are located. Explain the cost of the services
$\checkmark$ Return appointment. Make the next appointment with the client to enable you review the progress

\section*{Stages of Counselling}
the counselling process is often split into three stages: exploration, understanding, and action.

\section*{Exploration Stage}

This is the beginning stage in which the counsellor helps the patient clarify their current difficulties, problems, issues, concerns, and undeveloped opportunities. The aim here is to establish a relationship with the patient so that they feel safe enough
to explore the issues that they face by identifying and clarifying problem situations, unused opportunities and the key issues calling for change. It is essential to concentrate on the patient's agenda, not to impose one's own agenda or try to satisfy one's own curiosity. The counsellor should also help the patient to be specific and focus on core concerns.

The communication skills used to establish rapport are grouped in the acronyms CLEAR and ROLES
- The acronym CLEAR represents verbal expression
- C - Clarify the needs of the clients
- L - Listen attentively to what the client is telling you
- E - Encourage interaction. Talk to the client and let him respond
- A - Acknowledge what the client says and probe for more information
- R - Reflect back to the client, clarify what the client says and summarize

The acronym ROLES represent non-verbal expression
- R - Relax before the client in a good setting
- O - Open up and establish a good rapport. Be empathetic and avoid crossing your arms across the chest
- L - Lean forward a bit towards the client and use bodily language i.e. Postures and gestures to show that you care.
- E - Eye contact. Keep looking at the client. Retain interest and attention.
- S - Sit squarely before the client in a respectable/ comfortable position

Patient's question: 'What are my problems, issues, concerns and what are the undeveloped opportunities?'

\section*{Understanding Stage}

This stage, also called the middle stage, is the stage of understanding and insight, promoting new perspectives, and looking at the preferred scenario. Now that rapport has developed and the patient has aired some issues, a greater depth of understanding can be reached. The preferred scenario helps patients determine what they want and need. Extra skills are needed to draw together themes, offer new perspectives, provide accurate empathy, work in the here and now, promote selfdisclosure, help them set appropriate goals and be genuine in support. The patient must feel supported, yet challenged, to face the difficulties ahead. By the end of this stage the patient will have an idea of how they want to change.

\section*{Patient's question: 'What do I need or want in place of what I have?'}

\section*{Action Stage}

The aim here is to develop goal accomplishing action strategies by helping the patient discover how to get what they want. The key tasks here are to help the patient find a realistic set of choices, make decisions and formulate an action plan, and to assist the patient in the implementation of the plan. It is the patient who chooses the course of action, and the counsellor needs to know different decision-making strategies and problem-solving techniques to help the patient do this. In some models, the action or implementation stage is left to the end, while in others it is acknowledged that patients need to act from the beginning, both within the counselling session and in their daily lives.

\section*{Communication Skills for Counselling}

The HCW uses specific types of verbal and non-verbal behaviour to help patients through their process of exploration, understanding and action. These are basic communication skills. People use them knowingly or unknowingly every day in their day to day life.

\section*{Active Listening}

Active listening seems like a simple concept to grasp yet people often fail to listen to one another. Active listening helps establish rapport, trust, and bridge differences; it helps patients disclose their feelings; it helps gather information and create a base of influence; it helps patients assume responsibility. People want the presence of the other person, not only the physical presence, but also their presence psychologically, socially and emotionally. Listening is an important part of effective communication.

Complete listening involves:
- Listening to and understanding the patient's verbal messages
- Observing and reading the patient's non-verbal behaviour; posture, facial expressions, movement, tone of voice
- Listening to the context; the whole person in the context of the social settings of their life
- Listening to sour notes; things the patient says that may have to be challenged

Barriers to listening, both internal and external, should be worked on and avoided. The session should not be interrupted by phones, note taking, noises and visitors.

\section*{Attending Skills}

Attending demonstrates that you are visibly tuned in to the patient. Effective attending tells the patient that you are listening and puts you in a position to listen
carefully to the patient's concerns. Attentive presence invites patients to open up and explore the significant dimensions of their problem situations. To attend to patients, counsellors can use the SOLER skills.

\section*{SOLER (Attending Skills)}

S - Sitting squarely facing another person is considered a basic posture of involvement. If for any reason facing the person squarely is too threatening, then an angled position may be more helpful. It is the quality of your presence that is most important.

O -Open posture should be adopted. Crossing the legs and arms can be a sign of lessened involvement with others or less availability to them. Open posture may signify that you are open to the patient and to what the patient is saying.

L - Leaning forward towards the patient at times is a natural sign of involvement. It is a sign of bodily flexibility or responsiveness that enhances the counsellor's communication with the patient.

E - Eye contact should be maintained, without staring or glaring. Maintaining good eye contact is a way of communicating your presence and interest. It is helpful for counsellors to explore with their supervisor why they may be uncomfortable or unwilling to maintain eye contact with certain patients.

R - Being relatively relaxed and natural when doing all of the above is important. Do not fidget or chat nervously. Feeling comfortable with your body can be a vehicle of personal contact and expression.

These external behaviour help to convey your respect and genuine caring. However, these are just guidelines and not rigid rules, and counsellors must take into consideration the patient's culture as well as their own.

\section*{Paraphrasing}

A skill that allows the counsellor to confirm and clarify statements made by the patient by repeating them using different words. For example, if a patient says, 'I'm not able to tell my partner about my HIV test result.' the counsellor may paraphrase by saying: 'Talking to your partner about your HIV test result sounds like something that you don't feel you're able to do.' The Counsellor can then say: 'Let's talk about that.' Paraphrasing shows that you have both heard and understood the patient.

\section*{Reflecting Feelings}

This involves understanding a patient's emotional responses and communicating this back to them. For example, if a patient says, 'I am worried that I will suffer a lot with HIV.' the counsellor might reflect these feelings back to the patient by saying: 'You are feeling anxious and fearful about the discomfort and pain that HIV may bring you.'

\section*{Questioning}

Helps the counsellor to identify, clarify and break problems down into more manageable components. Open-ended questions that begin with 'how', 'what' or 'when' encourage responses that can lead to further discussion. For example, a counsellor may ask: 'What concerns do you have about having an HIV test?'

\section*{Clarifying}

Prevents misunderstanding and helps people focus and sort out what has been said. For example, if a patient says, 'I can't exclusively breastfeed my baby.' the counsellor may ask: 'In what way is exclusive breastfeeding a concern for you?'

\section*{Summarizing}

Summarizing pulls the threads together so that the patient can see the whole picture and gain greater understanding of it. It helps to ensure that the patient and the counsellor understand each other correctly.
- The counsellor should review the important points of the discussion and highlight any decisions made.
- Use summarizing throughout the entire the counselling session.
- Offer support and encouragement to patients to help them carry out the decisions they have made.
- Agree on the return date and on any assignments the patient is expected to do at home.
- Ensure the patient has enough time to ask questions.

\section*{Termination of Counselling}

Termination means ending the counselling relationship. Termination is decided by the counsellor when the patient shows signs of improvement and the ability to solve their problems. As a good counsellor, you should prepare your patient to be ready for termination of counselling relationships.

\section*{Techniques of Termination}

The counsellor introduces the idea of termination and encourages the patient to rely on themselves instead of the counsellor. Self-reliance gradually separates the counsellor and the patient. Both counsellor and patient agree to reduce the number of sessions and to complete all pending issues before termination. There are some
patients who may require further counselling support after termination. In this case, encourage gradual termination and allow the patient the opportunity to visit you when the need arises. The actual process of separation may be challenging for the patient and they may exhibit one or more of the reactions listed below.

\section*{Denial}

Denial is experienced when the counsellor informs the patient of their intention to terminate the counselling sessions. The denial is characterized by a feeling of shock, disbelief, panic and refusal to accept the idea of terminating counselling relationships. The patient refuses to believe the counsellor can really stop the counselling sessions. You can help the patient at this stage by convincing them that they are doing very well and there is need to stop the counselling for a while to see how they progress alone. You can identify specific changes which have occurred since commencing counselling sessions.

\section*{Anger}

Anger is experienced by the patient for losing a person so good and helpful. The patient keeps on asking why such a thing should happen only to them and not to somebody else. Patients may become very angry and sometimes refuse to eat.

As a counsellor you should assist the patient to overcome the state of anger by letting them express their feelings about what is happening. Encourage them to continue expressing the feelings and accept the termination.

\section*{Bargaining}

Bargaining is where the patient tries to change the counsellor's mind about the idea of termination. The patient tries to prolong the counselling sessions by setting unrealistic goals. The patient may come up with arguments to support the unrealistic goals hoping the counsellor will change their mind.

As a counsellor you should listen attentively to their complaints and/or arguments and then emphasize the achievements they have made alone and the necessity for them to be independent.

\section*{Depression}

Depression occurs when the patient realizes the counsellor is serious and will definitely terminate the counselling relationships. The patient may feel very sad after realizing that there is nothing they can do to change the situation. They may experience a feeling of hopelessness and despair. They may also withdraw from their friends. A feeling of depression may also be characterized by anorexia and insomnia.

\section*{Acceptance}

Acceptance results when the patient accepts the reality of termination. They start to plan ways of coping with the new situation without the help of the counsellor. The patient gains confidence that they have the ability to manage their own affairs independently.

\section*{CHALLENGING SKILLS}

They are also called high functioning skills

\section*{- Advance level empathy}
- Used to evoke clients feeling and meaning that already reside in them.
- It's sensing by the counsellor of what the client implies but perhaps not directly stated in his disclosure.
- It helps the counsellor uncover the most deeply protected client's feelings which he is scarcely aware of.

\section*{- Confrontations}
- Refers to the action initiated by the counsellor based on the understanding of the client
- The counsellor observes some discrepancies on the client's behaviors and bring this to the client's awareness.

\section*{- Immediacy}
- This is used to explore the counsellor client relationship in the here and now therapy.
- It involves dealing with counsellor client feelings.
- It refers to the immediate interaction of the counsellor and client relationship

\section*{- Concreteness}
- This is the counsellor's ability to get the client to be specific in what they are saying
- It enables the client to point out the main issue and stop generalization

\section*{- Self-disclosure}
- This is the sharing of experiences that are similar to the clients' which the counsellor has solve successfully.
- The counsellor shares something personal for the benefit of the client to manifest solidarity in human struggle with difficulties

\section*{Theoretical Approaches to Counselling}

\section*{Introduction}

In the previous section counselling was defined as a process of assisting people to understand the problems they are experiencing and how to use their own resources to solve them. A sound knowledge of the theoretical approaches to counselling is important because it helps the counsellor to understand the personality of the patient. In this section you will explore four common theoretical approaches to counselling.

\section*{Objectives}

By the end of this section you will be able to:
- Describe four different theories on human behaviour
- Relate these theories to counselling

This section will highlight four different approaches to counselling, namely:
- Psychoanalytic
- Person-centered
- Behavioral
- Eclectic

You will start by exploring the psychoanalytic approach to counselling.

\section*{Freud's Psychoanalytic Approach to Counselling}

The psychoanalytic theory in counselling is based on Freud's theory of the human mind. In this theory, Freud divided the human mind to three components: the unconscious (Id), the preconscious (Ego or Self) and the conscious (Super Ego). The Id component always seeks gratification to satisfy pleasure needs and avoids pain. The Id
has no judgement value (no good, no evil) and no morality. It consists of wishful thinking and is not governed by any logic. Freud further asserted that the unconscious mind is composed of repressed past experiences, which can be aroused from the unconscious state to a conscious state.

The Ego component mediates between the Id seeking pleasure needs and the Super Ego component that seeks perfection. The Ego represents reasoning and common sense between the external world and the demands made by the Id. The Ego controls the demands the Id makes by deciding the manner of satisfying needs by suppressing their excitation. According to Freud, the preconscious mind comprises past experiences, which can be aroused with little difficulty.

The Super Ego represents the reality of the external world. The function of the Super Ego is to contain the demands of the Id through moral influence of the Ego. The conscious mind has a sense organ, which perceives stimuli coming from the environment (or external world). This theory proposes that the mind of a growing child is influenced by experiences from the parents and that of the peer group (environment).

Howard (1996) made some assumptions derived from Freud's psychoanalytic theory which he identified as useful basic insights the counsellor may consider in the course of his work.

\section*{Howard's Derivations from Freud's Psychoanalytic Theory}
- Human beings are not always conscious of what they are doing. Our thoughts, feelings, wishes and actions often pass unnoticed and unexamined.
- Even if we do notice what we are doing, we do not always know why. We may be aware without being able to explain.
- Awareness and self-awareness may be painful and uncomfortable. We actively avoid awareness of some thoughts, feelings and behaviors.
- If our avoidance is successful, we have to evade our evasiveness. We may thus become unable to see what is obvious to others.
- In so far as we find it painful to come to terms with ourselves, we remain defensive, vulnerable and liable to manipulation.
- Our guilt and shame keep facets of our personality buried.
- We all carry unfinished business from the past, unreleased traumas, unrecognized frustrations, dilemmas, and conflicts which are misunderstood and misconceived. These are liable to shape, disrupt, and disturb our dealings in the present. Usually we shall be quite unaware of what is happening.
- That which we repress is liable to threaten and haunt us, leaving us feeling uncertain and uneasy.
- Much that we avoid should be manageable if we have the courage and faith to face it. Others can help us, especially if they are experienced, skilled and have come to terms with their own personality.
- Our ability to change and be free from the past is nonetheless limited.

\section*{Interpretation of the Psychoanalytic Theory}

The psychoanalytic counsellor focuses on what happened to the patient in the past, that which has been forgotten. They also focus on what is presently happening in the life of the patient. The analysts try to understand repressed experiences which may be contributing to the current problems the patient is experiencing. As a result of understanding the problems, the counsellor is able to offer effective counselling services to the patients.

The knowledge gained in learning the psychoanalytic theory will assist you to identify patients who require referral to the psychologist for further management. It is, therefore, important that you understand this theory.

\section*{The Person-centered Approach}

The Person-centered theory is based on Maslow's theory of self-actualization. The counsellor using this approach assumes that 'self-actualization' motivates human beings to exploit their capabilities or potentialities. It is assumed that people have the capability to guide, regulate and control themselves provided that certain definable conditions exist.

In the Person-centered approach, it is assumed that an individual's psychological problems are caused by failure to actualize to the maximum. Psychological problems cause blockages to the process, and the work of counselling is to release the blockage.

\section*{Assumptions of Self-Concept}
- A person's self-concept is the way an individual perceives the self. It is the means by which an individual interacts with life in a way that allows them to meet their basic needs.
- A person's self-concept is important because self-perceptions enable the individual to understand how psychological maladjustment is maintained.
- Self-concept is viewed as a structure made of a variety of self-conceptions related to each other in different ways. This means it is a process by which they ignore, deny, distort or accurately perceive experiences.
- Congruence/Incongruence, that is, many self-conceptions may match the reality of what people experience, in which case, there is congruence between self-conception and the experience or reality. Other self-conceptions may
differ from the reality of their experiences in which case a state of incongruence exists.
- Condition of worth or incongruence implies that a self-conception is based on a condition of worth rather than the individual's own valuing process. For example, an incongruent self-concept for a person may be, 'I want to be a nurse', whereas a congruent self-perception may be 'I want to be a teacher'. Being a teacher may be based on values internalized from the parents whereas being a nurse represents the person's own valuing.
- Real-ideal implies that whereas real self-conceptions represent my perceptions of how I am, ideal-self conceptions represent how I would most like to be. Both the real and the ideal-self form parts of people's self-concept complex.

The Person-centered theory helps counsellors to identify the maladjusted behaviour of the patients. Through counselling the counsellor is able to identify the resources the patient has to sustain or correct the maladjusted behaviour. The role of the counsellor is to provide the necessary conducive climate (environment) characterized by the core conditions to enable the patients solve their own problem. There are three core conditions, namely:
- Unconditional positive regard
- Respect
- Empathy

\section*{Behavioral Theory}

The Behavioral theory of counselling is also known as 'Behaviour Therapy'. This theory is based on the principles of learning to assess the behaviour of the patients. In the behavioristics view you are born as 'blank slate' and so everything you are as an individual you have learned from other people or from your life experiences. Learning does not change you completely, so behaviour learned can be unlearned. You can unlearn thoughts, feelings and behaviour that distress you and replace them by learning better ways of thinking, feeling and behaving. This theory deals with behaviour in the here and now, the past cannot be changed and therefore it is not significant, but the future can be modified.

Behavioural psychologists design psychometric tests, numerical scores, checklists and questionnaires, which are given to the patients to respond to. The assessments are done to try to understand the human emotions and behaviour.

Nelson et al (1995) define behaviour therapy as a conditioning therapy involving the use of experimentally established principles of learning for the purpose of changing the patient's maladaptive behaviour. Thus, the counsellor using behavioural approach of counselling tries to identify the maladaptive behaviour of the patient. Nelson emphasizes the objectives the counsellor must ensure are achieved for effective counselling to occur.

\section*{Objectives of Behavioral Therapy}
- Alter the maladaptive behaviour, for example, by increasing socially assertive responses
- Optimizing the decision-making process by making a list of possible courses of action for solving the problem
- Preventing problems from occurring by implementing a system of helping young men and women to select partners if the problem involves a sexual relationship

Counsellors using the behavioral approach should set realistic goals. Some of the goals the counsellor may set are included in the list below:
- Overcoming deficits in behaviour
- Strengthening maladaptive behaviour
- Weakening maladaptive behaviour
- Encouraging the capacity to relax, to ease tension and headaches
- Encouraging adequate social skills, that is, socialize more with people, talk more with people, attend social gatherings like going to church or women group gatherings and/or men's social activities
- Capacity for self-control, that is, encourage the patient to control emotions

\section*{Assessment of the Patient's Behaviour}

The counsellor does not do the assessment but instead refers the patient to the psychologist. The assessment is necessary for the counsellor to be able to identify suitable therapeutic goals. The psychologist designs a questionnaire tool to assess the patient's overt behaviour, how they act in response to their emotions, or how they perceive the environment.

The assessment questionnaires may ask the patient to indicate what stimuli cause them to develop anxiety. Another kind of questionnaire might ask the patient to explain which types of activities, events and experiences they find most rewarding.

A questionnaire is useful in identifying actual and potential re-enforcers, which can be used together with treatment. The information identified by the psychologist assists the counsellor to set relevant treatment goals to correct the maladaptive behaviour. In effect the behavioral approach enables the counsellor to get more information about the patient so they can set realistic counselling goals.

\section*{The Eclectic Approach}

Arnold Lazarous, a clinical psychologist developed this approach. The eclectic approach (or multimodal approach) is based on the belief that there is no single psychological theory, which can effectively be used in counselling all patients. The

Multimodal approach borrows concepts and techniques from different schools of thought depending on the individual patient's unique psychological problems and circumstances. The eclectic theory describes human personality as consisting of seven modalities remembered by the acronym 'BASIC ID'. A complex chain of behaviour and other psychological processes connects the seven modalities. The counsellor tailors the therapy to the individual patient.

\section*{B-A-S-I-C-I-D}

\section*{Behaviour}

Some people may be described as doers or are action oriented. They keep themselves busy and get work done through other people.

\section*{Affect}

Some people are very emotional and may or may not express it.

\section*{Sensation}

Some people attach a lot of value to sensory experiences, such as sex, food, music and other sensory delights. Others are very much aware of minor aches and pains, and discomforts

\section*{Sensation}

Some people attach a lot of value to sensory experiences, such as sex, food, music and other sensory delights. Others are very much aware of minor aches and pains, and discomforts

\section*{Imagery}

This is thinking in pictures, visualizing real or imagined experiences, letting your mind roam.

\section*{Cognition}

Some people are very analytical and like to plan things. They like to reason things through.

\section*{Interpersonal}

This is your self-rating as a social person. This is how you interact with friends or keep aloof.

\section*{Drugs/biology}

This is being conscious of personal health and how you maintain a health state. It is being concerned with social habits, which improve the health status or contribute to poor health. For example, regular exercise, getting enough sleep and avoiding junk food improves the health status, while smoking, overeating and over drinking contribute to poor health.

\section*{Counselling Relationship}

The counselling relationship using the multi-modal approach focuses on working closely with the patient and avoiding causing any offence to their personal dignity while providing the therapeutic support required to correct or alleviate the maladaptive behaviour. The counsellor modifies their counselling approach depending on information (or complaints) obtained using the modalities of BASIC I.D.

The counsellor using multimodal counselling should be skilled in numerous theoretical approaches to be able to conduct effective counselling. For example, they could be skilled in Psychoanalytic Counselling, Person-centered Counselling, Behavioral Counselling and Cognitive Counselling. The understanding of several psychotherapeutic approaches enables eclectic counsellors to provide highly effective counselling services to their patients.

In sections four and five you covered the process of counselling, including barriers to effective counselling while in section six four psychotherapeutic approaches to counselling were introduced. There are many other counselling techniques you will come across that are not covered in this section. You can learn more techniques by reading clinical and counselling psychology textbooks.

\section*{Principles of Counselling}
1. Principle of acceptance-accept the patient with his physical, psychological, social, economic and cultural conditions
2. Principle of communication-communication should be verbal as well as non-verbal and should be skillful.
3. Principle of empathy-instead of showing sympathy put yourself in patients' shoes and then give reflections accordingly (Empathy is ability to identify with a person.
4. Principle of non-judge-mental attitude-do not criticize or comment negatively regarding patient's complaints.
5. Principle of confidentiality-always keep the patient's name, and the problem strictly secrete and assure the patient about the same.
6. Principle of individuality-treat each and every patient as unique and respect his problem as well
7. Principles of non-emotional involvement-not getting emotionally involved with the patient and avoid getting carried away with his feelings
8. Principle of Respect for the individual Respecting an individual's feelings must be an integral parts of counseling process.

\section*{BASIC PRINCIPLES OF COUNSELLING PROCESS}

According to Mc Daniel and Shaftal, the counseling process is based on some basic principles:
(a) Principle of Acceptance-According to this principle, each client must the accepted as an individual and dealt with as such. The counselor should give, due regard to the rights of the client
(b) Principle of Permissiveness: Counseling is such a relationship which develops optimism and the environment shapes according to the person. All the thoughts accept the relative relationship of counseling
(c) Principle of Respect for the Individual-All the schools of thoughts of counseling advocate for the respect of the individual i.e., respecting an individual's feelings must be an integral part of counseling process.
(d) Principle of Thinking with the Individual-Counseling emphasizes thinking with the individual. It is essential to differentiate think for whom? And 'why to think'? It is the role of the counselor the think about all the forces around the client to join client's thought process and to work collectively with the client regarding his problem
(e) Principle of Learning-All the assumptions of counseling accept the presence of learning- elements in the counseling process
(f) Principle of Consistency with Ideals of Democracy-All the principles are associated with ideals of democracy. The ideals of democracy desire to accept a person and want to respect the rights of others. The process of counseling is based upon the ideals of a person's respect. It is a process with accepts individual differences.

\section*{Barriers to Effective Counselling}

\section*{Introduction}

This section covers barriers to effective counselling, the rights of a patient, and some of the ethical issues encountered in counselling.

Many of the factors that cause breakdown in everyday communication also present barriers to counselling. These can include physical barriers, differences in sociocultural backgrounds, nonverbal communications, language barriers and the relationship between patient and counsellor.

The patient has their own rights, which the counsellor should observe and respect, it is important for the counsellor to observe a code of ethics during counselling sessions. This includes knowing when to step aside and allow more competent counsellors to take over.

\section*{Objectives}

By the end of the section you will be able to:
- Describe different types of barriers to effective counselling
- List the rights of a patient
- Explain ethical issues to be considered when counselling

Describe theoretical approaches to counselling

\section*{Types of Barriers}

Section two covered the factors that might lead to a breakdown in communication. To a great extent the counselling process is concerned with effective communication. Therefore, many of the barriers that will be covered are related to the communication skills which were explained at the beginning of this unit. Barriers to effective counselling interfere with the counselling process by making the patient unable to make informed decisions or disclose their feelings and concerns fully.

Barrier Types include:
- Physical barriers
- Differences in social and cultural background
- Inappropriate non-verbal behaviour by the provider
- Barriers caused by the patient and the counsellor
- Language and level of education
- Psychological barriers

You will explore these barriers in the following pages.

\section*{Physical Barriers}

Physical barriers refer to factors both in the environment and related to the counsellor themselves that prevent or reduce opportunities for the communication process to occur.

\section*{Interview Room}

The interview should be conducted in a quiet, private room. The room should be spacious enough to allow the counsellor and patient to sit comfortably. The room should be clean and tidy, with adequate ventilation, a good size table, comfortable chairs and no distracting equipment, or pictures on the wall. It should be free from noise and have adequate lighting. The counsellor and patient should sit facing each other.

The preparation of the room is also determined by the type of interview to be conducted. For example, if you are interviewing a patient to offer reproductive health services, visual aids on different methods of family planning should be displayed on the walls in the interview room.

\section*{Appearance}

If you do not look presentable and pleasant, the patient may have a problem listening to you and taking you seriously.

\section*{Age and Sex}

A difference in age between the counsellor and the patient may affect the outcome of the session. If the counsellor is young enough to be the patient's child, the patient might find it difficult to open up. Similarly, especially in youth counselling, it is advisable for counsellors to be the same gender as the patient. This helps the patient overcome discomfort when discussing personal and sensitive issues.

\section*{Differences in Social and Cultural Backgrounds}

When a patient comes from a different nationality, race or ethnic group, it may be difficult for you to understand the patient's beliefs, taboos and cultural practices. The patient may not be able to take your advice because perhaps the information you give them does not tally with their beliefs. As a good counsellor you should endeavor to know the patient's cultural background before you start your session.

\section*{Non-Verbal Communication}

This involves all the little things you do while you talk to a patient. The gestures you make could make the counselling session a success or failure. Some of the gestures that could make you
fail include:
- Frowning
- Showing signs of boredom or amusement
- Showing signs of disgust
- Displaying signs of disapproval towards the patient

Your response should be geared towards encouraging the patient to disclose their feelings and concerns fully to you. Therefore, try to cultivate the use of gestures that demonstrate interest and concern such as a smile and an occasional nod in appreciation of what the patient is telling you. Try to mirror their own feelings.

\section*{Barriers Caused by the Patient and Counsellor}

Barriers caused by the patient can include lack of interest and the patient's emotions. It is likely that you will encounter one or both of these barriers and you will need to motivate your patients and arouse their interest from the outset of the counselling session. Stimulate active thinking and learning while providing a shared experience. Lack of interest makes a patient inattentive and creates prejudice. If you feel that the patient is so emotionally disturbed that they will not benefit from the session, you can postpone it to another day, to give them time to deal with the emotions they are experiencing at that time.

\section*{Counsellor and Patient related Communication Barriers}
- Failure to listen may occur when the counsellor feels that they are not receiving the intended message.
- Failure to probe occurs when the counsellor does not get adequate responses from the patient. The counsellor may fail to ask the patient the relevant questions.
- Being judgmental, that is, the counsellor may approve or disapprove the statements from the patient.
- Rejection occurs when the counsellor refuses to discuss some topics with the patients. This may imply the counsellor has a right to pass judgement to the patient.
- Parroting, that is when the patient continues to repeat the same phrases even if you ask them a question in a different way.
- Defending, which is an attempt to protect something or someone from negative feedback.
- Giving advice, that is the counsellor telling the patient what he thinks should be done.
- Privacy disruption, which occurs if counselling sessions are held in a room where privacy is not observed. For example, if an interview is held in the presence of relatives or other people.
- Changing topics, that is the counsellor directing the interaction into areas of self-interest rather than following the lead of the patient.
- Failure to understand the culture, which may lead to the patient feeling that the counsellor has no respect.

\section*{Rights of a Patient}

You have seen that barriers to effective counselling may come from both the patient and the counsellor. The patient has their own rights which the counsellor should observe during counselling sessions.

\section*{Respect and Freedom from Prejudice}

The patient is a human being with their own rights to be respected. This means the counsellor should respect the patient as a person with their own culture who is entitled to give their own views. The patient has a right to receive appropriate care without any consideration of sex, race color, ethnic or political affiliation.

\section*{Privacy and Confidentiality}

Counselling sessions should be conducted in a private room. This allows the patient to share information with the counsellor freely. The patient trusts that any issues or information discussed during counselling sessions is confidential. You, as a counsellor, should never tell any other person about the discussion held without their consent, not even their
closest relatives.

\section*{Consent}

The patient should give consent on all decisions made during the sessions. No decisions should be imposed on the patient.

\section*{Right of Refusal}

The patient feels confident that they are receiving quality services from a competent counsellor. This means the patient has the right to refuse any counselling services offered by an incompetent counsellor.

\section*{Involvement}

The patient should be informed about plans of action to be carried out for their own benefit. This means the patient should be involved in planning the course of action.

\section*{Informed}

The patient should be informed about their own health status. The counsellor should answer all queries raised by the patient without any hindrances. This means that the patient must be told the whole truth about their health.

\section*{Right of Referral}

The patient expects a systematic and accurate investigations of their health concerns by a competent counsellor. The counsellor should, therefore, refer the patient if not able to meet their needs.

\section*{Ethical Issues in Counselling}

The primary role of a counsellor is to serve their patient's interests at all times. The counsellor has a responsibility to the patient in areas of confidentiality, competence, maintenance of ethical standards and possibly referrals when the need arises. The counsellor should respect the patient's rights as an individual human being. They should respect the values and beliefs of their patient.

The counsellor should never disclose any issues discussed with the patient to anyone. The function of the counsellor is to assist the patient to see themselves clearly in all their positive, negative and contradictory aspects. The counsellor does not offer the solution to the problem of their patient. The counsellor should be seen by the patient as a helper rather than an adviser.

\section*{Code of Practice}

The counsellor should observe the code of ethics at all times of their practice. The counsellor has a responsibility to take all reasonable steps to ensure that the patient does not suffer any physical or psychological harm during counselling. The counsellor's approach in counselling should make the patient feel accepted as a person with their own rights. The counsellor is responsible for setting and monitoring the boundaries between counselling and any other relationships with the patient.

The counsellor does not give advice to the patient but provides assistance so they can explore their problems. The counsellor should work together with the patient to find ways which will assist them to control their own lives. It is important for the counsellor to respect the patient's ability to make decisions and to change in line with their own beliefs and values.

The counsellor should not exploit their patients financially, sexually, emotionally, or in any other way. Engaging in sexual activity with the patient is an unethical
behaviour. It is also important that the patients are offered privacy during counselling sessions. Patients should not be observed by anyone other than the counsellor.

\section*{Terms of Counselling}

Counsellors are responsible for communicating the terms on which counselling is offered. The terms of counselling should be explained to the patient in the initial contact and should include:
- Availability of the counsellor and the specific time and location of the session.
- Expectation of fees for cancelled appointments.
- Number of counselling sessions per week/month.
- The patient should be given an opportunity to review the terms.
- The patient is made aware it is their choice to participate in the counselling process.
- Records of counselling sessions should be kept and the patient made aware of it.
- In case of need for referral, confer with the patient and get permission before consulting other counsellors.

\section*{Counsellor Competence}

Competence is an essential element in counselling and is acquired through proper training and practice. The counsellor should, therefore, work within their known limits of competence and should not offer counselling services if their ability or objectivity is impaired due to personal or emotional difficulties, illness, alcohol, drugs, or for any other reason. The counsellor should refer any patient they are unable to help to a competent person.

The counsellor should be honest and tell the truth to the patients at all times. Counsellors should not fear to tell the truth to the patients. Counsellors remain accountable for relationships with former patients and must exercise caution over entering into friendships and business relationships with them.

Any possible relationships must be discussed during counselling supervision. As a counsellor you should guard and respect the rights of the patient.

\section*{Course Objectives:}
- Provide the definition of counselling
- Discuss the different theories, principles and types of counselling
- Explain the effective phases of counselling, and outline the barriers to this process

\section*{Definition of Counselling}

Counselling is defined as a two-way face-to-face communication profess in which one person tries to help another person in order to understand a problem and identify a solution to that problem. It refers to the act of working with a client so as to help him/her to clarify his/her personal goals and find ways of overcoming their problems. The aim of counselling is to assist an individual to change behaviours that are interfering with the normal life situations.

Counselling involves providing the client with the necessary information to enable them to solve their problems or make a decision on the way forward. The main reasons why people need counselling are to:
- Help them understand the problems they are experiencing;
- Give them information that they are lacking so as to solve their problems;
- Assist them to understand alternative approaches to solving the problems that they are facing;
- Help them to explore the problems and clarify conflicting issues;
- Assist them to adjust to the problem or find better ways of coping and living with the problem; and
- Assist others who may be experiencing similar problems

\section*{Note:}
- Many people believe that counselling is able to solve all human problems and must be provided only by professional counsellors. However, this is not true. Counselling cannot solve all human problems, and you do not need to be a counsellor in order to help an individual with a problem.

Counselling can be described as being either formal or informal. Formal counselling is provided by professionals trained in counselling, such as professional counsellors, psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, and church ministers; while informal counselling is provided by people and other professionals not trained in counselling, such as doctors, nurses, teachers, lawyers, and parents. Whether counselling is either done formally or informally, the purpose is to help the individual to understand his/her problem(s) and find answers and coping mechanisms over them.

\section*{The Process of Counselling}

The process of counselling defines the procedure followed by the counsellor when he/she is conducting counselling sessions. During counselling, the counsellor tries to establish a good interpersonal relationship with the client in that process. This is to enable the client to voluntarily give information related to his/her problem without any fear(s).

\section*{Interviewing}

This is a purposeful interaction involving two or more persons whereby they exchange views with one party asking questions while the other party providing their response to those questions. In nursing, patients/clients are interviewed to gather information to enable with the planning for their care.

In counselling, interviews are conducted to gather information so as to help clients to resolve some problems. The interview that is conducted by a counsellor is called a therapeutic interview, whose purpose is to identify some social problems and psychological problems facing the client. A therapeutic interview is initiated by a client when he/she visits a counsellor/therapist, during which the counsellor should have a technique of asking questions during the interview.

Questions can be in an open-ended or closed-ended, probing, structured or unstructured form. Probing and open-ended questions are recommended for interview because the client's response is unlimited.

\section*{Preparation for Interview:}
- The interview should be conducted in a private room, which should be spacious enough to allow the counsellor and the client to sit comfortably;
- The room should have adequate furniture, which includes a good table and comfortable chairs;
- The environment should be free from noise and there should be no distracting equipment or pictures on the wall;
- The room should have adequate ventilation and lighting, and should be clean and tidy;
- The counsellor should sit in a position facing the client, and likewise the same for the client sitting in a position facing the counsellor; and
- The preparation of the room is also determined by the type of interview to be conducted. For example, if you are interviewing a client to offer reproductive health services, visual aids on different methods of family planning should be displayed on the walls in the interview room

\section*{Steps in the Counselling Process}

When you counsel a client, you progress through a series of inter-connected and overlapping stages to help clients make informed decisions. Both the client and counsellor actively participate as they exchange information and discuss the client's feelings and attitudes about the matter at hand.

There are six basic steps applied in the counselling process and they are remembered with the acronym: "GATHER", which refer to the following:
- G - Greet the client and welcome him
- A - Ask the client about himself/herself and the family. Ask the help he/she requires from you, and find out the reason for his/her coming to see you as a counsellor
- T- Tell the client what you can do or cannot do for him/her so as to resolve his/her problem; Tell him/her about the resources he/she can use to resolve his/her problems; and Tell him/her about your commitment to help solve the problem
- H - Help the client to formulate the course of action and identify resources to resolve the problem
- E - Explain available services and where they are located, and Explain the cost of these services
- R - Return appointment, make the next appointment with the client to enable the counsellor review his/her progress

\section*{Counselling Phases}

\section*{Entry Phase}

The initial contact of the counsellor and the client is very much important since it starts building up a helping relationship. This is the time the client develops faith that the counsellor is able to help him/her. During the first contact with the client, the counsellor should communicate effectively using both verbal and non-verbal forms of communication skills so as to make the client feel comfortable, and also that he/she (the client) have confidence in the counsellor.

The communication skills that are used to establish rapport are grouped in the acronyms CLEAR and ROLES, which represent verbal and non-verbal expressions respectively, and are further defined under these terms:

CLEAR:
C - Clarify the needs of the clients
L - Listen attentively to what the client is telling you
E - Encourage interaction, talk to the client and let him respond
A - Acknowledge what the client says and probe for more information

R - Reflect back to the client, clarify what he/she says and summarizes

\section*{ROLES:}

R - Relax before the client in a good position/setting
O - Open up and establish a good rapport. Be empathetic and avoid crossing your arms across the chest
L - Lean forward a bit towards the client and use bodily language; that is, postures and gestures to show that you care
E - Eye contact, keep looking at the client, and retain interest and attention
S - Sit squarely before the client in a respectable and comfortable position

The entry phase constitutes the period of welcoming the client and setting the climate for counselling. This is the beginning of establishing a rapport and a helping relationship. The aim of the entry phase is to win the confidence of the client that the counsellor has adequate knowledge and skills to help him/her to resolve the prevailing problems.

\section*{Work Phase}

The working phase is the counselling session, which starts when the counsellor convinces the client that he/she is able to offer help. The counselling sessions should take about 45-60 minutes. In this stage, the counsellor probes the client on more about the problems where he/she finds out on how the problem started and how it has been progressing. He/she also finds out about any aggravating factors to the prevailing problems.

The counsellor finds out on whether it is the first time the client is experiencing this problem and how he/she has been dealing with it. Thereafter, the counsellor can then move on to the next stage of setting goals, since he/she had all the information required necessary to solve the client's problem(s). Here, the counsellor already has identified the causes of the problem and the available resources to solve it. In this stage, the counsellor agrees with the client on the number of sessions to hold, number of issues and/or problems to discuss during the sessions, and set priorities over these issues/problems.

\section*{Termination Phase}

Termination means ending the counselling relationship, and such is decided by the counsellor when the client shows signs of improvement and ability to solve his/her problems. The counsellor introduces the idea of termination and encourages the client to rely on himself/herself instead of the counsellor, since self-reliance will come to gradually separate them both.

They both likewise agree to reduce the number of sessions and to complete all pending issues before termination. There are some clients who may require further counselling support after termination. In this case, encourage gradual termination and allow the client the opportunity to visit you (the counsellor) whenever need arises.

\section*{Types of Counselling}

Different clients come for counselling with various problems. The type of counselling is determined by the nature of problems presented by the clients, and such will include individual counselling, group counselling, marital counselling, family counselling, educational counselling, spiritual counselling, and special group counselling.

\section*{Individual Counselling}

This occurs when a counsellor is working with only one person at any one given time; for example, when a nurse is dealing with a single patient. Individual counselling is a one-on-one discussion between the counsellor and the client. The two form an alliance, relationship or bond that enables trust and personal growth. Individual counselling is aimed at helping you to cope with addiction, mental health, trauma and with stresses that can cause anxiety and depression, it's about helping you to heal from the negative things that have happen in everyday life, such as losses, separation and divorce, family conflict, violence or abuse. Individual counselling can assist in coping with stressful life situations, work/school problems, grief, and emotional distress or relationship difficulties.

\section*{Group Counselling}

This occurs when a counsellor is working with more than one person at any given session, and will always be recommended for persons facing similar problems or concerns, such as the alcoholics, where each of the individual need each other's support and encouragement to change their behaviour; for example the acronym Alcoholic Anonymous (AA) is an association formed by alcoholics who have stopped drinking and provide group counselling and support for each other. People are encouraged to discuss personal experiences and changes in their daily lives.

\section*{Marital Counselling}

This occurs when the counsellor is working with marital couples. This process is conducted by a trained therapist who understands the problems and trails of marriage and married lifestyle. Married counselling is done when both couples are present, and here the counsellor assists them to understand their problems and get ways of solving them out.

\section*{Family Counselling}

This occurs when a counsellor is working with more than two members of a family at any one given session. It focuses on family matters and is conducted when the concerned family members are all present. Effective counselling cannot occur if some family members are excluded from the process, hence they are required to be all present.

\section*{Educational Counselling}

This occurs in schools and learning institutions where students are counselled in relation to academic matters and their learning performances. The counselling specialty concerned with providing advice and assistance to students in the development of their educational plans, choice of appropriate courses, and choice of college or technical school.

\section*{Spiritual Counselling}

This is a type of counselling related to spiritual issues. It takes a look that life is innately personal and individuals want to build their own unique, flowing relationship with it, organically and without force. With the soul being the starting point individuals come from the heart, whilst not forgetting their head, and from this heart space they care for the sacred interdependence of all life.

\section*{Special Group Counselling}

The special group is composed of any group of people who require counselling to enable them to adjust better in their lives, and such include:
- Drug and substance abusers
- Rape victims and rapists
- HIV and AIDS infected and affected people
- Individuals and families and with handicapped persons, such as the blind, lamed, deaf, retarded
- Families with such disputes like marriage issues, divorce, separation, etc
- Such individuals who require to have an abortion or might have undergone through such
- Those people who require assistance for reproductive health family planning
- Those individuals who experience sexual difficulties or need in such importance
- Issues with employment, such as retrenchment,

Note:
- Counselling is a supportive relationship that is required to bear good fruits, such which is yielded by having the counsellor possessing certain qualities for use in carrying out an effective task in this mandate. These qualities are discussed as hereunder.

\section*{Qualities of a Good Counsellor}

A good counsellor is required to possess good qualities, such which include patience, warmth, confidentiality, honesty, empathy, observance, being non-judgemental, avoiding embarrassment, having relevant discussion, and respecting the client's opinions. These qualities are further discussed as follows:

\section*{Patience}

A good counsellor should be very much patient with his/her client, no matter how many times the client repeats with himself/herself. The counsellor should not hurry the client at all or show impatience; nor should you show that you are bored or tired of holding long discussions with the client. You should only go to the next step of explaining when the client has understood clearly the content of the information he/she is giving just if patient. The client will feel that you accepts him/her as a person and is interested in what he/she is talking about, such which encourages him/her to open up even more.

\section*{Warmth}

As a counsellor, you should provide non-possessive warmth in a counselling environment. How? Smile and show a lot of concern and acceptance to the client.

\section*{Confidentiality}

Confidentiality means keeping secret all the information given by the client. As a counsellor, let not anyone get to know what the client has discussed with you. To maintain confidentiality, counselling should be done individually and in a private room; and as a counsellor, one has the obligation to treat all information that you have been given with confidence. The client consults you because he/she believes that all information he/she discloses will remain secret. It will not be professional to disclose any information obtained from a client during counselling except only to other professionals who are involved in the care process.

\section*{Honesty}

Honesty refers to the act of telling the truth to the client, such which is always a great quality required as a counsellor. You should never tell a lie to your client; for is you are not sure of something, get to inform your client to wait and that you will go look for more information.

Honesty is exercised by both the client and the counsellor. Get to encourage your client to be very much honest on the information that he/she is giving. Do not hide any information of concern to the client. Being honest makes the client regard you as a dependable and trustworthy counsellor.

\section*{Empathy}

It is the ability to imagine oneself in the position of another person, and thus share and understand that person's feelings. Empathy is ability of the counsellor to put himself/herself in the position of the client by understanding his/her feelings, such which involves fitting in somebody else's shoes, and hence it means that you perceive his/her feelings and their meanings.

As a counsellor, you should understand what your client is feeling in his/her current situation and communicate this understanding to him/her. Empathy involves being very close to the client and sharing your thoughts and feelings, hence creating acceptance, love, and understanding. Empathy is characterized by both sharing and separateness. That is, even though you share your thoughts and feelings with your client, remain separate and retain objectivity.

\section*{Observance}

A good counsellor must be very much observant. As you listen to your client talking, observe the facial expressions and try to interpret the meaning of all non-verbal communications. Facial expressions may reveal painful memories expressed in the form of anger, sadness, and frustrations.

Get to carefully listen to client, observing if facial expressions correspond with the speech. Carefully observe the state of swinging, mood, and its relevance to the conversation. The observations are made to detect any inappropriate behaviour expressed by the client; and will likewise make the client get to feel that the counsellor is interested in the conversation.

\section*{Being Non-Judgemental}

Being non-judgemental means that the client is accepted the way he/she is, and that the counsellor recognizes his/her basic rights, whether they be good or not. The feelings made by the client that he/she is accepted as a person with his/her own rights encourage him/her to disclose information.

As a counsellor, you should not be judgemental, avoid being critical over the client whenever he/she is wrong, carefully listen to him/her as he/she talks so as to understand his/her message, and thereby provide suggestions and not criticism.

\section*{Avoiding Embarrassment}

Embarrassment is a situation where one feels uncomfortable in a social setting. Get to avoid embarrassing your client by holding the counselling session in a private room. You can also avoid embarrassing the client by understanding the cultural background of the community. Try to avoid sensitive probing questions that make the client to develop feelings of guilt.

Probing questions are statements that focus on the experiences, feelings and thoughts of the clients. As a counsellor, you should observe and interpret non-verbal communication after asking a sensitive probing question. The counsellor can restate the same question in a different fashion if the client looks uncomfortable.

\section*{Having Relevant Discussion}

Relevant discussion means that the counselling session is confined to the topic. During counselling, the client is given sufficient time to narrate his/her story, as the counsellor listens and observes the client carefully to pick up the core information related to the problem.

The counsellor encourages the client to come out with core information while noting any deviations or irrelevant information. The counsellor then assists his/her client to keep to the main points that will help to solve the problem.

\section*{Respecting the Client's Opinions}

This means that the counsellor accepts the client as a human being with his/her own rights to make decisions concerning his/her welfare. The counsellor should know that the client has the ability to give constructive ideas to solve his/her problem(s).

The counselling relationship improves when the client becomes aware that his/her views are respected, whereby the counsellor recognizes that the client is better placed to know his/her problems and has the resources to which have to be solved.

The counsellor likewise accepts the views of the client in principle even if they may not be good or credible. The counsellor's role is to provide the client with the additional information and to suggest
alternative option of solving the problem. The client is therefore assisted to solve his/her problems through the counselling process.

\section*{Barriers to Effective Counselling}

Counselling involves a face-to-face communication between the client and the counsellor. The factors that may lead to communication breakdown, all affect counselling.
[Ask the Class to name 10 factors that may lead to communication breakdown]

Barriers to effective counselling interfere with the counselling process by making the client unable to fully make informed decisions or disclose their feelings and concerns.
[Ask the Class to list down 4 barriers to effective counselling]
- Physical barriers
- Inappropriate non-verbal behaviour by the provider
- Differences in social and cultural background
- Barriers caused by the client and the counsellor
- Language and level of education
- Psychological barriers

\section*{Physical Barriers}

These refer to those factors both in the environment and the physical appearance of the counsellor that prevent or reduce opportunities for the communication process to occur. Such include the interviewing room, dress code and appearance age and/or gender of both the client and the counsellor.

\section*{Interviewing Room}

The interview should be conducted in a private quiet room. The room should be spacious enough to allow both the counsellor and the client to sit comfortably, and properly facing each other. It should be clean and tidy, with adequate ventilation, a good size table, comfortable chairs, and there should be no distracting equipment or pictures on the wall.

The room should be free noise, be provided with adequate lighting. The preparation of the room is also determined by the type of the interview to be conducted; for example, if you are interviewing a client to offer reproductive health services, visual aids on different methods of family planning should be displayed on the walls of the room during the interview.

\section*{Dress Code and Appearance}

If you do not look presentable and pleasant, the client might have a problem being attentive to you and likewise getting serious to be involved in the interview process. Make a keen look over the dress code, such which may not interfere with or distract the interview process.

\section*{Age and Gender}

A difference in age between the counsellor and the client may also affect the outcome of the session. If the counsellor is young enough to be the client's child, the client might find it difficult to open up. In youth counselling, it is advisable for counsellors to be of the same age group and gender as their clients, since this will help the client overcome discomfort when discussing personal and sensitive issues.

\section*{Inappropriate Non-Verbal Behaviour by the Provider}

This involves all the little things you ado while you talk to a client. The gestures that you make could either make the counselling session a success or a failure. Some of the gestures that could make you fail include frowning, showing signs of boredom or humour, showing signs of disgust, or displaying signs of disapproval towards the client.

Your response should be geared towards encouraging the client to disclose his/her feelings and concerns fully to you. Therefore, you should try to cultivate interest and concern such as a smile and an occasional nod in appreciation of what the client is telling you.

\section*{Differences in Social and Cultural Background}

When a client comes from a different nationality, race, or ethnic group, it may be difficult for you as the counsellor to really know of his/her beliefs, taboos, and cultural practices. The client may not be able to take action because perhaps the information you give him/her does not tally with his/her beliefs. As a good counsellor, you should endeavour to know of the client's cultural background before you start the session.

\section*{Barriers Caused by the Client and the Counsellor}

The barriers caused by the client include lack of interest and his/her emotional state, hence the counsellor needs to motivate the client and arouse his/her interest as soon as the counselling session starts. Likewise, get to stimulate active thinking and learning while providing a shared experience since lack of interest makes a client to become inattentive and hence create prejudice.

If you feel that the client is so emotionally disturbed that he/she will not benefit from the session, get to postpone it to another day so as to give them time to deal with the emotions they are experiencing at that time.

\section*{Other Barriers:}

Other barriers caused by factors that are related to both the counsellor and the client are summarized as follows:
- Failure to listen, by both the counsellor and the client, and it may be manifested by not receiving the intended message
- Failure to prob
- The counsellor being judgemental over the client, mostly by either approving or disapproving the client's statements
- Rejection, which may occur when the counsellor refuses to discuss some topics with the client
- Parroting, whereby the client continues repeating the same phrase even if the counsellor asks him/her question in a different version
- Defending, which is an attempt to protect something or someone from negative feedback
- Giving advice; that is, the counsellor telling the client what he thinks should be done
- Privacy disruption, which occurs if counselling sessions are held in a room where privacy is not observed. For example, if an interview is held in the presence of relatives or other persons
- Changing topic, whereby the counsellor directs the interaction into areas of self-interest rather than following the lead of the client

\section*{Theoretical Approaches to Counselling Psychoanalytic Theory (Freud's Theory)}

This is whereby the counsellor focuses on what happened to the client in the past, which has been forgotten; and also focuses on what is presently happening in the life of the client. The analysts try to understand repressed experiences that may be contributing to the current problems the client is experiencing. As a result, the counsellor can now be able to offer effective counselling services to the client. The knowledge gained in learning the psychoanalytic theory will assist the counsellor to identify those clients who require referral to the psychologists for further management.

\section*{Person-Centered Approach (Carl Rogers)}

The person-centered theory is based on Maslow's Theory of self-actualization, "The Needs Theory". Here, the counsellor assumes that "self-actualization" motivates human beings to exploit their capabilities or potentialities. It is assumed that people have the capability to guide, regulate, and control themselves, provided that certain definable conditions exist.

In this approach, it is assumed that an individual's psychological problems are caused by failure to actualize to the maximum. Psychological problems cause blockages to the process, and the work of counselling is to release the blockage.

It is assumed that this is a self-concept in which an individual perceives the self, a means by which the individual interacts with life in a way that makes him to meet his basic needs. Self-concept can also be put in as a process by which one ignores, denies, distorts, or inaccurately perceive experiences.

This theory helps counsellors to identify the maladjusted behaviour of the client. Hence, through counselling, the counsellor can be able to identify the resources the client has to sustain in order to correct the maladjusted behaviour.

\section*{Behavioural Theory}

The behavioural theory of counselling is also known as "behaviour therapy", which is based on the principles of learning to assess the behaviour of clients. The psychologists design psychometric tests,
numerical scores, checklists and questionnaires, which are given to the client to respond to. The assessments are done in order to try to understand the human emotions and behaviours of the client.

This method is used to identify, diagnose, or identify the maladaptive behaviour of the client. It is also useful in changing the client's maladaptive behaviour. It alters the maladaptive behaviour by increasing socially assertive responses. The counsellor should use the behavioural approaches with one realistic and achievable goal. Some of the goals the counsellor may set include:
- Overcoming deficits in behaviour
- Strengthening maladaptive behaviour
- Weakening maladaptive behaviour
- Encouraging the capacity to relax, to ease tension and headaches
- Encouraging adequate social skill; that is, socialize more with people , talk more with people, attend social gatherings (such as churches, women groups, men's gatherings, etc)
- Capacity of self-control; that is, encourage the client to control emotions

\section*{Eclectic (Multi-Modal) Approach}

Arnold Lazarous, a clinical psychologist developed this approach, basing on the belief that there is no single psychological theory, which can effectively be used in counselling all the clients. The approach borrows concepts and techniques from different schools of thought depending on the individuals, their uniqueness of psychological problems and circumstances. The eclectic approach advocates for a comprehensive therapy assessment using concepts drawn from various psychotherapeutic counselling theories.

\section*{Counselling Relationship}

The counselling relationship using the multi-modal approach focuses on working closely together with the clients and avoiding attacking the client's sense of dignity as a person but providing the required therapeutic support to correct or improve on the maladaptive behaviour.

The counsellor using multi-modal counselling should be skilled in numerous theoretical approaches to be able to conduct effective counselling. For example, he/she should be skilled in psychoanalytic counselling, behavioural counselling, and cognitive counselling. Understanding of several psychotherapeutic approaches enables eclectic counsellors to provide effective counselling services to their clients.
