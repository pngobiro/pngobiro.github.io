                        <p>There are two ways in which counseling may be conducted:</p>
                        <ol type="i">
                            <li>Individual counseling</li>
                            <li>Group counseling</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Whatever the method the counselor chooses to use should be the best in the given situation and that it will help the counselee gain insight into his/her abilities, interests, aspirations and other personality traits.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Conditions to be satisfied before any method is chosen</h3>
                        <ol type="i">
                            <li>The guidance and counselor must be acknowledgeable, counselor must be knowledgeable, conscious and secure, while the clients are not.</li>
                            <li>There should be two or more persons in the counseling situation.</li>
                            <li>The clients must come on his/her own, be invited or referred by someone.</li>
                            <li>The client should enter into a conducive climate where acceptance respect (regard) goal setting, learning and alternatives are possible.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">A) Individual Counseling</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>It is an ideal method of counseling and involves one client and one counselor.</li>
                            <li>It requires more time ( 45 minutes - 1 hour) the client has a chance to sometimes choose a counselor.</li>
                            <li>It is more confidential and private which helps the client to open up more and express the self without fear because they are only two people.</li>
                            <li>It requires more trust by client in the counselor. There is close interaction between the counselor and the client i.e. better understanding.</li>
                            <li>The client can trust one person to keep the information in confidence.</li>
                            <li>Counselor can concentrate better when dealing with one case.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">B) Group Counselling</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>This could be one counselor to a group of clients or more than one counselor to a group of clients.</li>
                            <li>It requires that the clients have a similar issue or problem.</li>
                            <li>For a group of counselors, their training skills should be the same and also their interests and experiences.</li>
                            <li>The method could be informative e.g. giving general information to students on: education, vocation, health, social and ethical issues, sex and sexuality relationships, HIV/Aids etc.</li>
                            <li>The clients must all be (easily) reached at the time and venue required.</li>
                            <li>Care must be taken to avoid hurting some people with regards to very confidential/personal matters at the expense of others.</li>
                            <li>Members of the group and the counselors must agree on the issues to be addressed as a group. ( not private).</li>
                            <li>It focuses on thoughts; values purpose attitudes, behaviour and goals of an individual and the total group.</li>
                            <li>It is necessary and potentially a significant part of all comprehensive guidance and counseling programmes.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Goals of Group Counselling</h4>

                        <p>Referral means transferring a client to another counselor or agency for further assistance or specialized help. In a school situation a counselor may be faced with cases he does not have the competence to handle effectively. Other cases require specialist in particular areas e.g. psychiatrist, lawyer. There are other cases that are referred to agencies that offer financial assistance which a counselor cannot offer. Sometimes a client may request to be referred if a counselor has relocated, or the client is not making any progress or the client may not be comfortable with the counselor's way of working. If a friend, or relative seeks counseling. Also if a counselor gets attracted to the client or vice-versa, the counselor should refer the client.</p>
