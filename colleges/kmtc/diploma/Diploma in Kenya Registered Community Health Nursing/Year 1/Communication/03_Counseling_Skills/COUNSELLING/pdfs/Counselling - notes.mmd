\section*{COUNSELLING}

\section*{INTRODUCTION TO COUNSELLING}

Counselling is NOT:
- Giving advice.
- Having a discussion.
- An interrogation.
- An investigation.
- Indulging in curiosity.
- Solving other people's problems.
- Making others do what one wants.
- About threatening others to change their attitudes.

DEFINITION OF COUNSELING: "Counseling is essentially a process in which the counselor assists the counselee to make interpretations of facts relating to a choice, plan or adjustment which he needs to make." -Glenn F. Smith
"Counseling is a series of direct contacts with the individual which aims to offer him assistance in changing his attitude behaviors." - Carl Rogers

The counsellor helps the client to work through the issues by listening, reflecting, paraphrasing, summarizing and responding with understanding to both how she sees herself and her concerns. Also, the counsellor strives to provide a safe and secure environment for the client's self-exploration, and creates a warm, caring and trusting relationship. Further, he or she communicates genuineness, empathy, and unconditional positive regard (UPR), in order for the client to discover herself. Finally, the counsellor helps the client work out some SMART options, and leaves it to her to select the best one

\section*{The aims of counselling}

Counselling must always be based on the needs of the client. Counselling the following major aims (Egan, 1998):
1) Help the client understand the problems they are experiencing
2) Give them information they are lacking to solve problems
3) Assist them to understand alternative approaches to solving the problems facing them
4) Help them to explore the problems and clarify conflicting issues
5) Assist them to adjust to the problem or to find better ways of coping/living with the problem
6) Assist others who may be experiencing similar problem

\section*{Types of Counselling}

Different patients come for counselling with various problems. The type of counselling is, therefore, determined by the nature of problems presented by the patients.

\section*{Individual Counselling}

Individual counselling occurs when a counsellor is working with only one person at any given time, i.e. when a nurse is dealing with a single patient.

\section*{Group Counselling}

This occurs when a counsellor is working with more than one person at any given session. Group counselling is recommended for people facing the same problem, for example, alcoholics. In group counselling individuals need each other's support and encouragement to change their behaviour.

For example, Alcoholic Anonymous (AA), is an association formed by alcoholics who have or are trying to stop drinking and provides group counselling and support for each other. People are encouraged to discuss personal experiences and changes in their daily life.

\section*{Marital Counselling}

This occurs when the counsellor is working with married couples. Marital counselling is conducted by a trained therapist who understands the problems and trials of marriage and married life. Marital counselling is done when both couples are present. The counsellor assists the couple to understand their problems and to find solutions to their problems.

\section*{Family Counselling}

This occurs when a counsellor is working with more than two members of a family at any given session. Family counselling focuses on family issues and is conducted when all the family members concerned are present. Effective counselling cannot occur if some family members are excluded from counselling sessions.

\section*{Special Group Counselling}

The special group is composed of any group of people who require counselling to enable them to adjust better in their life. For example:
- Drug and substance abusers
- Rape victims and rapists
- HIV/AIDS infected and affected people
- Terminally ill people of all categories
- Families/individuals with handicapped persons
- Marital or family disputes
- Those who need abortion or have procured abortion
- People requiring reproductive health/family planning assistance
- Those experiencing sex difficulties/impotence
- Retirees
- Retrenchees

\section*{Qualities of a Good Counsellor}

\section*{Patience}

A good counsellor should be very patient with their patient, no matter how many times the patient repeats themselves. You should not hurry the patient at all or show impatience. Nor should you show you are bored or tired of holding long discussions. You should only go to the next step of explaining when the patient has understood clearly the content of the information you are giving. If you are patient, your patient will feel that you accept themselves as a person and are interested in what they are talking about. This encourages the patient to open up even more.

\section*{Warmth}

You should show warmth without being possessive during counselling. Smile and show a lot of concern and acceptance to the patient.

\section*{Confidentiality}

Confidentiality means keeping all the information given by the patient secret. As a counsellor, you should not let anyone know what your patient has discussed with you.

To maintain confidentiality, counselling should be done on an individual basis (where appropriate) and in a private room. You, as a counsellor, have an obligation to treat all the information you have been given with confidence. The patient consults you because they believe that all information they disclose will remain secret. It is unprofessional to disclose any information obtained from a patient during counselling except to other professionals who have are involved in the care.

\section*{Honesty}

Honesty refers to the act of telling the truth to the patient. As a good counsellor you should always tell your patient the truth. You should never tell a lie to your patient. If, for example, you are not sure of something, tell them simply that you will go to look for information. Honesty is exercised by both patient and counsellor. You should encourage your patient to be very honest on the information they are giving. Similarly, you should not hide any information of concern to your patient. Being honest makes the patient regard you as a dependable and trustworthy counsellor.

\section*{Empathy}

Empathy is defined as the ability to imagine oneself in the position of another person, and thus, share and understand that person`s feelings. Empathy is the ability of the counsellor to put themselves in the position of the patient by understanding their feelings. As a counsellor, you should understand what your patient is feeling and communicate this understanding to them.

Empathy involves being very close to the patient and sharing your thoughts and feelings. When you share your feelings with the patient they feel accepted, loved and understood.

Empathy is characterized by both sharing and separateness. Although as a counsellor you share thoughts and feelings with the patient, the counsellor should remain separate and retain objectivity. This allows you to give objective responses to assist the patient in making the right decisions.

\section*{Observance}

A good counsellor must be very observant. As you listen to your patient talking, observe their facial expressions and try to interpret the meaning of any nonverbal communication. Facial expressions may reveal painful memories expressed in the form of anger, sadness and frustrations.

Listen very carefully to the patient, observing if their facial expressions correspond with their speech. Observe carefully any mood swings and their relevance to the conversation. The observations are made to detect any inappropriate behaviour expressed by the patient. Close observation also makes the patient feel the counsellor is interested in the conversation.

\section*{Accepting}

Being accepting means the patient is accepted the way they are. The counsellor recognises the basic rights of the patient, whether they are good or bad. When the patient feels that they are accepted as a person with their own rights, they are encouraged to disclose information.

As a counsellor you should be nonjudgmental. You should avoid criticizing the patient even if you feel they are wrong. You should listen carefully when the patient is talking to understand the message they are conveying. You can only give suggestions and not criticism.

\section*{Avoiding Embarrassment}

Embarrassment is a situation where one feels uncomfortable in a social setting. You can avoid embarrassing your patient by holding the counselling session in a private room. You can also avoid embarrassing the patient by understanding the cultural background of their community. Try to avoid sensitive probing questions which make the patient develop feelings of guilt. Probing questions are statements which focus on the experiences, feelings and thoughts of the patient.

As a counsellor, you should observe and interpret nonverbal communication after asking a sensitive probing question. You can restate the same question in a different fashion if you note your patient is uncomfortable.

\section*{Relevant Discussion}

Relevant discussion means that the counselling session is confined to the topic. During counselling the patient is given sufficient time to narrate their story. The counsellor listens and observes the patient carefully to pick up the core information related to the problem. The counsellor encourages the patient to come out with core information while noting any deviations or irrelevant information. The counsellor assists the patient in keeping focused on solving the problem.

\section*{Respect Opinion}

This means the counsellor accepts the patient as a human being with their own rights to make decisions concerning their welfare. The counsellor should know that the patient has the ability to give constructive ideas to solve their problem. The counselling relationship improves when the patient becomes aware their views are respected.

The counsellor recognises that the patient is better placed to know their own problems and has the resources to solve them. This means that the counsellor accepts the views of the patient in principle even if they may not be good. The counsellor's role is to provide the patient with additional information and to suggest alternative options of solving the problem. The patient is, therefore, assisted to solve his problems through the counselling process.

\section*{Process of Counselling}

The process of counselling refers to the cycle of events that take place within the counsellor/patient relationship. The counsellor tries to establish a good interpersonal relationship with the patient during the interview. The establishment of a good rapport enables the patient to voluntarily give information related to the problem facing them without any fears. The following section explores the best way to conduct a counselling session. Just compare this with what you have been doing in your health facility.

The role of a Health Care Worker (HCW) is to support and assist the patient by practicing
- Listening to the patient
- Understanding the choices that need to be made
- Helping the patient explore their options and circumstances
- Helping the patient develop self-confidence enabling them to carry out the decision made

The HCW is not responsible for resolving all of the patient's worries and concerns or for the decisions the patient ultimately makes

\section*{The Steps in the Counselling Process}

When you counsel a patient, you progress through a series of interconnected and overlapping stages to help them make informed decisions. Both you and the patient actively participate as you exchange information and discuss the patient's feelings and attitudes about the matter at hand.

There are six basic steps applied in the initial counselling process and they are remembered with the acronym or memory aid GATHER.
$\checkmark$ Greet client and welcome him
$\checkmark$ Ask the client about self and family. Ask the help he requires from you and find the reason for coming to consult you.
$\checkmark$ Tell the client what you can/cannot do for him to solve the problems and emphasize on your commitment to help solve the problem
$\checkmark$ Help the client to formulate course of action and identify resources to resolve the problem
$\checkmark$ Explain available services and where they are located. Explain the cost of the services
$\checkmark$ Return appointment. Make the next appointment with the client to enable you review the progress

\section*{Stages of Counselling}
the counselling process is often split into three stages: exploration, understanding, and action.

\section*{Exploration Stage}

This is the beginning stage in which the counsellor helps the patient clarify their current difficulties, problems, issues, concerns, and undeveloped opportunities. The aim here is to establish a relationship with the patient so that they feel safe enough
to explore the issues that they face by identifying and clarifying problem situations, unused opportunities and the key issues calling for change. It is essential to concentrate on the patient's agenda, not to impose one's own agenda or try to satisfy one's own curiosity. The counsellor should also help the patient to be specific and focus on core concerns.

The communication skills used to establish rapport are grouped in the acronyms CLEAR and ROLES
- The acronym CLEAR represents verbal expression
- C - Clarify the needs of the clients
- L - Listen attentively to what the client is telling you
- E - Encourage interaction. Talk to the client and let him respond
- A - Acknowledge what the client says and probe for more information
- R - Reflect back to the client, clarify what the client says and summarize

The acronym ROLES represent non-verbal expression
- R - Relax before the client in a good setting
- O - Open up and establish a good rapport. Be empathetic and avoid crossing your arms across the chest
- L - Lean forward a bit towards the client and use bodily language i.e. Postures and gestures to show that you care.
- E - Eye contact. Keep looking at the client. Retain interest and attention.
- S - Sit squarely before the client in a respectable/ comfortable position

Patient's question: 'What are my problems, issues, concerns and what are the undeveloped opportunities?'

\section*{Understanding Stage}

This stage, also called the middle stage, is the stage of understanding and insight, promoting new perspectives, and looking at the preferred scenario. Now that rapport has developed and the patient has aired some issues, a greater depth of understanding can be reached. The preferred scenario helps patients determine what they want and need. Extra skills are needed to draw together themes, offer new perspectives, provide accurate empathy, work in the here and now, promote selfdisclosure, help them set appropriate goals and be genuine in support. The patient must feel supported, yet challenged, to face the difficulties ahead. By the end of this stage the patient will have an idea of how they want to change.

\section*{Patient's question: 'What do I need or want in place of what I have?'}

\section*{Action Stage}

The aim here is to develop goal accomplishing action strategies by helping the patient discover how to get what they want. The key tasks here are to help the patient find a realistic set of choices, make decisions and formulate an action plan, and to assist the patient in the implementation of the plan. It is the patient who chooses the course of action, and the counsellor needs to know different decision-making strategies and problem-solving techniques to help the patient do this. In some models, the action or implementation stage is left to the end, while in others it is acknowledged that patients need to act from the beginning, both within the counselling session and in their daily lives.

\section*{Communication Skills for Counselling}

The HCW uses specific types of verbal and non-verbal behaviour to help patients through their process of exploration, understanding and action. These are basic communication skills. People use them knowingly or unknowingly every day in their day to day life.

\section*{Active Listening}

Active listening seems like a simple concept to grasp yet people often fail to listen to one another. Active listening helps establish rapport, trust, and bridge differences; it helps patients disclose their feelings; it helps gather information and create a base of influence; it helps patients assume responsibility. People want the presence of the other person, not only the physical presence, but also their presence psychologically, socially and emotionally. Listening is an important part of effective communication.

Complete listening involves:
- Listening to and understanding the patient's verbal messages
- Observing and reading the patient's non-verbal behaviour; posture, facial expressions, movement, tone of voice
- Listening to the context; the whole person in the context of the social settings of their life
- Listening to sour notes; things the patient says that may have to be challenged

Barriers to listening, both internal and external, should be worked on and avoided. The session should not be interrupted by phones, note taking, noises and visitors.

\section*{Attending Skills}

Attending demonstrates that you are visibly tuned in to the patient. Effective attending tells the patient that you are listening and puts you in a position to listen
carefully to the patient's concerns. Attentive presence invites patients to open up and explore the significant dimensions of their problem situations. To attend to patients, counsellors can use the SOLER skills.

\section*{SOLER (Attending Skills)}

S - Sitting squarely facing another person is considered a basic posture of involvement. If for any reason facing the person squarely is too threatening, then an angled position may be more helpful. It is the quality of your presence that is most important.

O -Open posture should be adopted. Crossing the legs and arms can be a sign of lessened involvement with others or less availability to them. Open posture may signify that you are open to the patient and to what the patient is saying.

L - Leaning forward towards the patient at times is a natural sign of involvement. It is a sign of bodily flexibility or responsiveness that enhances the counsellor's communication with the patient.

E - Eye contact should be maintained, without staring or glaring. Maintaining good eye contact is a way of communicating your presence and interest. It is helpful for counsellors to explore with their supervisor why they may be uncomfortable or unwilling to maintain eye contact with certain patients.

R - Being relatively relaxed and natural when doing all of the above is important. Do not fidget or chat nervously. Feeling comfortable with your body can be a vehicle of personal contact and expression.

These external behaviour help to convey your respect and genuine caring. However, these are just guidelines and not rigid rules, and counsellors must take into consideration the patient's culture as well as their own.

\section*{Paraphrasing}

A skill that allows the counsellor to confirm and clarify statements made by the patient by repeating them using different words. For example, if a patient says, 'I'm not able to tell my partner about my HIV test result.' the counsellor may paraphrase by saying: 'Talking to your partner about your HIV test result sounds like something that you don't feel you're able to do.' The Counsellor can then say: 'Let's talk about that.' Paraphrasing shows that you have both heard and understood the patient.

\section*{Reflecting Feelings}

This involves understanding a patient's emotional responses and communicating this back to them. For example, if a patient says, 'I am worried that I will suffer a lot with HIV.' the counsellor might reflect these feelings back to the patient by saying: 'You are feeling anxious and fearful about the discomfort and pain that HIV may bring you.'

\section*{Questioning}

Helps the counsellor to identify, clarify and break problems down into more manageable components. Open-ended questions that begin with 'how', 'what' or 'when' encourage responses that can lead to further discussion. For example, a counsellor may ask: 'What concerns do you have about having an HIV test?'

\section*{Clarifying}

Prevents misunderstanding and helps people focus and sort out what has been said. For example, if a patient says, 'I can't exclusively breastfeed my baby.' the counsellor may ask: 'In what way is exclusive breastfeeding a concern for you?'

\section*{Summarizing}

Summarizing pulls the threads together so that the patient can see the whole picture and gain greater understanding of it. It helps to ensure that the patient and the counsellor understand each other correctly.
- The counsellor should review the important points of the discussion and highlight any decisions made.
- Use summarizing throughout the entire the counselling session.
- Offer support and encouragement to patients to help them carry out the decisions they have made.
- Agree on the return date and on any assignments the patient is expected to do at home.
- Ensure the patient has enough time to ask questions.

\section*{Termination of Counselling}

Termination means ending the counselling relationship. Termination is decided by the counsellor when the patient shows signs of improvement and the ability to solve their problems. As a good counsellor, you should prepare your patient to be ready for termination of counselling relationships.

\section*{Techniques of Termination}

The counsellor introduces the idea of termination and encourages the patient to rely on themselves instead of the counsellor. Self-reliance gradually separates the counsellor and the patient. Both counsellor and patient agree to reduce the number of sessions and to complete all pending issues before termination. There are some
patients who may require further counselling support after termination. In this case, encourage gradual termination and allow the patient the opportunity to visit you when the need arises. The actual process of separation may be challenging for the patient and they may exhibit one or more of the reactions listed below.

\section*{Denial}

Denial is experienced when the counsellor informs the patient of their intention to terminate the counselling sessions. The denial is characterized by a feeling of shock, disbelief, panic and refusal to accept the idea of terminating counselling relationships. The patient refuses to believe the counsellor can really stop the counselling sessions. You can help the patient at this stage by convincing them that they are doing very well and there is need to stop the counselling for a while to see how they progress alone. You can identify specific changes which have occurred since commencing counselling sessions.

\section*{Anger}

Anger is experienced by the patient for losing a person so good and helpful. The patient keeps on asking why such a thing should happen only to them and not to somebody else. Patients may become very angry and sometimes refuse to eat.

As a counsellor you should assist the patient to overcome the state of anger by letting them express their feelings about what is happening. Encourage them to continue expressing the feelings and accept the termination.

\section*{Bargaining}

Bargaining is where the patient tries to change the counsellor's mind about the idea of termination. The patient tries to prolong the counselling sessions by setting unrealistic goals. The patient may come up with arguments to support the unrealistic goals hoping the counsellor will change their mind.

As a counsellor you should listen attentively to their complaints and/or arguments and then emphasize the achievements they have made alone and the necessity for them to be independent.

\section*{Depression}

Depression occurs when the patient realizes the counsellor is serious and will definitely terminate the counselling relationships. The patient may feel very sad after realizing that there is nothing they can do to change the situation. They may experience a feeling of hopelessness and despair. They may also withdraw from their friends. A feeling of depression may also be characterized by anorexia and insomnia.

\section*{Acceptance}

Acceptance results when the patient accepts the reality of termination. They start to plan ways of coping with the new situation without the help of the counsellor. The patient gains confidence that they have the ability to manage their own affairs independently.

\section*{CHALLENGING SKILLS}

They are also called high functioning skills

\section*{- Advance level empathy}
- Used to evoke clients feeling and meaning that already reside in them.
- It's sensing by the counsellor of what the client implies but perhaps not directly stated in his disclosure.
- It helps the counsellor uncover the most deeply protected client's feelings which he is scarcely aware of.

\section*{- Confrontations}
- Refers to the action initiated by the counsellor based on the understanding of the client
- The counsellor observes some discrepancies on the client's behaviors and bring this to the client's awareness.

\section*{- Immediacy}
- This is used to explore the counsellor client relationship in the here and now therapy.
- It involves dealing with counsellor client feelings.
- It refers to the immediate interaction of the counsellor and client relationship

\section*{- Concreteness}
- This is the counsellor's ability to get the client to be specific in what they are saying
- It enables the client to point out the main issue and stop generalization

\section*{- Self-disclosure}
- This is the sharing of experiences that are similar to the clients' which the counsellor has solve successfully.
- The counsellor shares something personal for the benefit of the client to manifest solidarity in human struggle with difficulties

\section*{Theoretical Approaches to Counselling}

\section*{Introduction}

In the previous section counselling was defined as a process of assisting people to understand the problems they are experiencing and how to use their own resources to solve them. A sound knowledge of the theoretical approaches to counselling is important because it helps the counsellor to understand the personality of the patient. In this section you will explore four common theoretical approaches to counselling.

\section*{Objectives}

By the end of this section you will be able to:
- Describe four different theories on human behaviour
- Relate these theories to counselling

This section will highlight four different approaches to counselling, namely:
- Psychoanalytic
- Person-centered
- Behavioral
- Eclectic

You will start by exploring the psychoanalytic approach to counselling.

\section*{Freud's Psychoanalytic Approach to Counselling}

The psychoanalytic theory in counselling is based on Freud's theory of the human mind. In this theory, Freud divided the human mind to three components: the unconscious (Id), the preconscious (Ego or Self) and the conscious (Super Ego). The Id component always seeks gratification to satisfy pleasure needs and avoids pain. The Id
has no judgement value (no good, no evil) and no morality. It consists of wishful thinking and is not governed by any logic. Freud further asserted that the unconscious mind is composed of repressed past experiences, which can be aroused from the unconscious state to a conscious state.

The Ego component mediates between the Id seeking pleasure needs and the Super Ego component that seeks perfection. The Ego represents reasoning and common sense between the external world and the demands made by the Id. The Ego controls the demands the Id makes by deciding the manner of satisfying needs by suppressing their excitation. According to Freud, the preconscious mind comprises past experiences, which can be aroused with little difficulty.

The Super Ego represents the reality of the external world. The function of the Super Ego is to contain the demands of the Id through moral influence of the Ego. The conscious mind has a sense organ, which perceives stimuli coming from the environment (or external world). This theory proposes that the mind of a growing child is influenced by experiences from the parents and that of the peer group (environment).

Howard (1996) made some assumptions derived from Freud's psychoanalytic theory which he identified as useful basic insights the counsellor may consider in the course of his work.

\section*{Howard's Derivations from Freud's Psychoanalytic Theory}
- Human beings are not always conscious of what they are doing. Our thoughts, feelings, wishes and actions often pass unnoticed and unexamined.
- Even if we do notice what we are doing, we do not always know why. We may be aware without being able to explain.
- Awareness and self-awareness may be painful and uncomfortable. We actively avoid awareness of some thoughts, feelings and behaviors.
- If our avoidance is successful, we have to evade our evasiveness. We may thus become unable to see what is obvious to others.
- In so far as we find it painful to come to terms with ourselves, we remain defensive, vulnerable and liable to manipulation.
- Our guilt and shame keep facets of our personality buried.
- We all carry unfinished business from the past, unreleased traumas, unrecognized frustrations, dilemmas, and conflicts which are misunderstood and misconceived. These are liable to shape, disrupt, and disturb our dealings in the present. Usually we shall be quite unaware of what is happening.
- That which we repress is liable to threaten and haunt us, leaving us feeling uncertain and uneasy.
- Much that we avoid should be manageable if we have the courage and faith to face it. Others can help us, especially if they are experienced, skilled and have come to terms with their own personality.
- Our ability to change and be free from the past is nonetheless limited.

\section*{Interpretation of the Psychoanalytic Theory}

The psychoanalytic counsellor focuses on what happened to the patient in the past, that which has been forgotten. They also focus on what is presently happening in the life of the patient. The analysts try to understand repressed experiences which may be contributing to the current problems the patient is experiencing. As a result of understanding the problems, the counsellor is able to offer effective counselling services to the patients.

The knowledge gained in learning the psychoanalytic theory will assist you to identify patients who require referral to the psychologist for further management. It is, therefore, important that you understand this theory.

\section*{The Person-centered Approach}

The Person-centered theory is based on Maslow's theory of self-actualization. The counsellor using this approach assumes that 'self-actualization' motivates human beings to exploit their capabilities or potentialities. It is assumed that people have the capability to guide, regulate and control themselves provided that certain definable conditions exist.

In the Person-centered approach, it is assumed that an individual's psychological problems are caused by failure to actualize to the maximum. Psychological problems cause blockages to the process, and the work of counselling is to release the blockage.

\section*{Assumptions of Self-Concept}
- A person's self-concept is the way an individual perceives the self. It is the means by which an individual interacts with life in a way that allows them to meet their basic needs.
- A person's self-concept is important because self-perceptions enable the individual to understand how psychological maladjustment is maintained.
- Self-concept is viewed as a structure made of a variety of self-conceptions related to each other in different ways. This means it is a process by which they ignore, deny, distort or accurately perceive experiences.
- Congruence/Incongruence, that is, many self-conceptions may match the reality of what people experience, in which case, there is congruence between self-conception and the experience or reality. Other self-conceptions may
differ from the reality of their experiences in which case a state of incongruence exists.
- Condition of worth or incongruence implies that a self-conception is based on a condition of worth rather than the individual's own valuing process. For example, an incongruent self-concept for a person may be, 'I want to be a nurse', whereas a congruent self-perception may be 'I want to be a teacher'. Being a teacher may be based on values internalized from the parents whereas being a nurse represents the person's own valuing.
- Real-ideal implies that whereas real self-conceptions represent my perceptions of how I am, ideal-self conceptions represent how I would most like to be. Both the real and the ideal-self form parts of people's self-concept complex.

The Person-centered theory helps counsellors to identify the maladjusted behaviour of the patients. Through counselling the counsellor is able to identify the resources the patient has to sustain or correct the maladjusted behaviour. The role of the counsellor is to provide the necessary conducive climate (environment) characterized by the core conditions to enable the patients solve their own problem. There are three core conditions, namely:
- Unconditional positive regard
- Respect
- Empathy

\section*{Behavioral Theory}

The Behavioral theory of counselling is also known as 'Behaviour Therapy'. This theory is based on the principles of learning to assess the behaviour of the patients. In the behavioristics view you are born as 'blank slate' and so everything you are as an individual you have learned from other people or from your life experiences. Learning does not change you completely, so behaviour learned can be unlearned. You can unlearn thoughts, feelings and behaviour that distress you and replace them by learning better ways of thinking, feeling and behaving. This theory deals with behaviour in the here and now, the past cannot be changed and therefore it is not significant, but the future can be modified.

Behavioural psychologists design psychometric tests, numerical scores, checklists and questionnaires, which are given to the patients to respond to. The assessments are done to try to understand the human emotions and behaviour.

Nelson et al (1995) define behaviour therapy as a conditioning therapy involving the use of experimentally established principles of learning for the purpose of changing the patient's maladaptive behaviour. Thus, the counsellor using behavioural approach of counselling tries to identify the maladaptive behaviour of the patient. Nelson emphasizes the objectives the counsellor must ensure are achieved for effective counselling to occur.

\section*{Objectives of Behavioral Therapy}
- Alter the maladaptive behaviour, for example, by increasing socially assertive responses
- Optimizing the decision-making process by making a list of possible courses of action for solving the problem
- Preventing problems from occurring by implementing a system of helping young men and women to select partners if the problem involves a sexual relationship

Counsellors using the behavioral approach should set realistic goals. Some of the goals the counsellor may set are included in the list below:
- Overcoming deficits in behaviour
- Strengthening maladaptive behaviour
- Weakening maladaptive behaviour
- Encouraging the capacity to relax, to ease tension and headaches
- Encouraging adequate social skills, that is, socialize more with people, talk more with people, attend social gatherings like going to church or women group gatherings and/or men's social activities
- Capacity for self-control, that is, encourage the patient to control emotions

\section*{Assessment of the Patient's Behaviour}

The counsellor does not do the assessment but instead refers the patient to the psychologist. The assessment is necessary for the counsellor to be able to identify suitable therapeutic goals. The psychologist designs a questionnaire tool to assess the patient's overt behaviour, how they act in response to their emotions, or how they perceive the environment.

The assessment questionnaires may ask the patient to indicate what stimuli cause them to develop anxiety. Another kind of questionnaire might ask the patient to explain which types of activities, events and experiences they find most rewarding.

A questionnaire is useful in identifying actual and potential re-enforcers, which can be used together with treatment. The information identified by the psychologist assists the counsellor to set relevant treatment goals to correct the maladaptive behaviour. In effect the behavioral approach enables the counsellor to get more information about the patient so they can set realistic counselling goals.

\section*{The Eclectic Approach}

Arnold Lazarous, a clinical psychologist developed this approach. The eclectic approach (or multimodal approach) is based on the belief that there is no single psychological theory, which can effectively be used in counselling all patients. The

Multimodal approach borrows concepts and techniques from different schools of thought depending on the individual patient's unique psychological problems and circumstances. The eclectic theory describes human personality as consisting of seven modalities remembered by the acronym 'BASIC ID'. A complex chain of behaviour and other psychological processes connects the seven modalities. The counsellor tailors the therapy to the individual patient.

This is your self-rating as a social person. This is how you interact with friends or keep aloof.

\section*{Drugs/biology}

This is being conscious of personal health and how you maintain a health state. It is being concerned with social habits, which improve the health status or contribute to poor health. For example, regular exercise, getting enough sleep and avoiding junk food improves the health status, while smoking, overeating and over drinking contribute to poor health.

\section*{Counselling Relationship}

The counselling relationship using the multi-modal approach focuses on working closely with the patient and avoiding causing any offence to their personal dignity while providing the therapeutic support required to correct or alleviate the maladaptive behaviour. The counsellor modifies their counselling approach depending on information (or complaints) obtained using the modalities of BASIC I.D.

The counsellor using multimodal counselling should be skilled in numerous theoretical approaches to be able to conduct effective counselling. For example, they could be skilled in Psychoanalytic Counselling, Person-centered Counselling, Behavioral Counselling and Cognitive Counselling. The understanding of several psychotherapeutic approaches enables eclectic counsellors to provide highly effective counselling services to their patients.

In sections four and five you covered the process of counselling, including barriers to effective counselling while in section six four psychotherapeutic approaches to counselling were introduced. There are many other counselling techniques you will come across that are not covered in this section. You can learn more techniques by reading clinical and counselling psychology textbooks.

\section*{Principles of Counselling}
1. Principle of acceptance-accept the patient with his physical, psychological, social, economic and cultural conditions
2. Principle of communication-communication should be verbal as well as non-verbal and should be skillful.
3. Principle of empathy-instead of showing sympathy put yourself in patients' shoes and then give reflections accordingly (Empathy is ability to identify with a person.
4. Principle of non-judge-mental attitude-do not criticize or comment negatively regarding patient's complaints.
5. Principle of confidentiality-always keep the patient's name, and the problem strictly secrete and assure the patient about the same.
6. Principle of individuality-treat each and every patient as unique and respect his problem as well
7. Principles of non-emotional involvement-not getting emotionally involved with the patient and avoid getting carried away with his feelings
8. Principle of Respect for the individual Respecting an individual's feelings must be an integral parts of counseling process.

\section*{BASIC PRINCIPLES OF COUNSELLING PROCESS}

According to Mc Daniel and Shaftal, the counseling process is based on some basic principles:
(a) Principle of Acceptance-According to this principle, each client must the accepted as an individual and dealt with as such. The counselor should give, due regard to the rights of the client
(b) Principle of Permissiveness: Counseling is such a relationship which develops optimism and the environment shapes according to the person. All the thoughts accept the relative relationship of counseling
(c) Principle of Respect for the Individual-All the schools of thoughts of counseling advocate for the respect of the individual i.e., respecting an individual's feelings must be an integral part of counseling process.
(d) Principle of Thinking with the Individual-Counseling emphasizes thinking with the individual. It is essential to differentiate think for whom? And 'why to think'? It is the role of the counselor the think about all the forces around the client to join client's thought process and to work collectively with the client regarding his problem
(e) Principle of Learning-All the assumptions of counseling accept the presence of learning- elements in the counseling process
(f) Principle of Consistency with Ideals of Democracy-All the principles are associated with ideals of democracy. The ideals of democracy desire to accept a person and want to respect the rights of others. The process of counseling is based upon the ideals of a person's respect. It is a process with accepts individual differences.

\section*{Barriers to Effective Counselling}

\section*{Introduction}

This section covers barriers to effective counselling, the rights of a patient, and some of the ethical issues encountered in counselling.

Many of the factors that cause breakdown in everyday communication also present barriers to counselling. These can include physical barriers, differences in sociocultural backgrounds, nonverbal communications, language barriers and the relationship between patient and counsellor.

The patient has their own rights, which the counsellor should observe and respect, it is important for the counsellor to observe a code of ethics during counselling sessions. This includes knowing when to step aside and allow more competent counsellors to take over.

\section*{Objectives}

By the end of the section you will be able to:
- Describe different types of barriers to effective counselling
- List the rights of a patient
- Explain ethical issues to be considered when counselling

Describe theoretical approaches to counselling

\section*{Types of Barriers}

Section two covered the factors that might lead to a breakdown in communication. To a great extent the counselling process is concerned with effective communication. Therefore, many of the barriers that will be covered are related to the communication skills which were explained at the beginning of this unit. Barriers to effective counselling interfere with the counselling process by making the patient unable to make informed decisions or disclose their feelings and concerns fully.

Barrier Types include:
- Physical barriers
- Differences in social and cultural background
- Inappropriate non-verbal behaviour by the provider
- Barriers caused by the patient and the counsellor
- Language and level of education
- Psychological barriers

You will explore these barriers in the following pages.

\section*{Physical Barriers}

Physical barriers refer to factors both in the environment and related to the counsellor themselves that prevent or reduce opportunities for the communication process to occur.

\section*{Interview Room}

The interview should be conducted in a quiet, private room. The room should be spacious enough to allow the counsellor and patient to sit comfortably. The room should be clean and tidy, with adequate ventilation, a good size table, comfortable chairs and no distracting equipment, or pictures on the wall. It should be free from noise and have adequate lighting. The counsellor and patient should sit facing each other.

The preparation of the room is also determined by the type of interview to be conducted. For example, if you are interviewing a patient to offer reproductive health services, visual aids on different methods of family planning should be displayed on the walls in the interview room.

\section*{Appearance}

If you do not look presentable and pleasant, the patient may have a problem listening to you and taking you seriously.

\section*{Age and Sex}

A difference in age between the counsellor and the patient may affect the outcome of the session. If the counsellor is young enough to be the patient's child, the patient might find it difficult to open up. Similarly, especially in youth counselling, it is advisable for counsellors to be the same gender as the patient. This helps the patient overcome discomfort when discussing personal and sensitive issues.

\section*{Differences in Social and Cultural Backgrounds}

When a patient comes from a different nationality, race or ethnic group, it may be difficult for you to understand the patient's beliefs, taboos and cultural practices. The patient may not be able to take your advice because perhaps the information you give them does not tally with their beliefs. As a good counsellor you should endeavor to know the patient's cultural background before you start your session.

\section*{Non-Verbal Communication}

This involves all the little things you do while you talk to a patient. The gestures you make could make the counselling session a success or failure. Some of the gestures that could make you
fail include:
- Frowning
- Showing signs of boredom or amusement
- Showing signs of disgust
- Displaying signs of disapproval towards the patient

Your response should be geared towards encouraging the patient to disclose their feelings and concerns fully to you. Therefore, try to cultivate the use of gestures that demonstrate interest and concern such as a smile and an occasional nod in appreciation of what the patient is telling you. Try to mirror their own feelings.

\section*{Barriers Caused by the Patient and Counsellor}

Barriers caused by the patient can include lack of interest and the patient's emotions. It is likely that you will encounter one or both of these barriers and you will need to motivate your patients and arouse their interest from the outset of the counselling session. Stimulate active thinking and learning while providing a shared experience. Lack of interest makes a patient inattentive and creates prejudice. If you feel that the patient is so emotionally disturbed that they will not benefit from the session, you can postpone it to another day, to give them time to deal with the emotions they are experiencing at that time.

\section*{Counsellor and Patient related Communication Barriers}
- Failure to listen may occur when the counsellor feels that they are not receiving the intended message.
- Failure to probe occurs when the counsellor does not get adequate responses from the patient. The counsellor may fail to ask the patient the relevant questions.
- Being judgmental, that is, the counsellor may approve or disapprove the statements from the patient.
- Rejection occurs when the counsellor refuses to discuss some topics with the patients. This may imply the counsellor has a right to pass judgement to the patient.
- Parroting, that is when the patient continues to repeat the same phrases even if you ask them a question in a different way.
- Defending, which is an attempt to protect something or someone from negative feedback.
- Giving advice, that is the counsellor telling the patient what he thinks should be done.
- Privacy disruption, which occurs if counselling sessions are held in a room where privacy is not observed. For example, if an interview is held in the presence of relatives or other people.
- Changing topics, that is the counsellor directing the interaction into areas of self-interest rather than following the lead of the patient.
- Failure to understand the culture, which may lead to the patient feeling that the counsellor has no respect.

\section*{Rights of a Patient}

You have seen that barriers to effective counselling may come from both the patient and the counsellor. The patient has their own rights which the counsellor should observe during counselling sessions.

\section*{Respect and Freedom from Prejudice}

The patient is a human being with their own rights to be respected. This means the counsellor should respect the patient as a person with their own culture who is entitled to give their own views. The patient has a right to receive appropriate care without any consideration of sex, race color, ethnic or political affiliation.

\section*{Privacy and Confidentiality}

Counselling sessions should be conducted in a private room. This allows the patient to share information with the counsellor freely. The patient trusts that any issues or information discussed during counselling sessions is confidential. You, as a counsellor, should never tell any other person about the discussion held without their consent, not even their
closest relatives.

\section*{Consent}

The patient should give consent on all decisions made during the sessions. No decisions should be imposed on the patient.

\section*{Right of Refusal}

The patient feels confident that they are receiving quality services from a competent counsellor. This means the patient has the right to refuse any counselling services offered by an incompetent counsellor.

\section*{Involvement}

The patient should be informed about plans of action to be carried out for their own benefit. This means the patient should be involved in planning the course of action.

\section*{Informed}

The patient should be informed about their own health status. The counsellor should answer all queries raised by the patient without any hindrances. This means that the patient must be told the whole truth about their health.

\section*{Right of Referral}

The patient expects a systematic and accurate investigations of their health concerns by a competent counsellor. The counsellor should, therefore, refer the patient if not able to meet their needs.

\section*{Ethical Issues in Counselling}

The primary role of a counsellor is to serve their patient's interests at all times. The counsellor has a responsibility to the patient in areas of confidentiality, competence, maintenance of ethical standards and possibly referrals when the need arises. The counsellor should respect the patient's rights as an individual human being. They should respect the values and beliefs of their patient.

The counsellor should never disclose any issues discussed with the patient to anyone. The function of the counsellor is to assist the patient to see themselves clearly in all their positive, negative and contradictory aspects. The counsellor does not offer the solution to the problem of their patient. The counsellor should be seen by the patient as a helper rather than an adviser.

\section*{Code of Practice}

The counsellor should observe the code of ethics at all times of their practice. The counsellor has a responsibility to take all reasonable steps to ensure that the patient does not suffer any physical or psychological harm during counselling. The counsellor's approach in counselling should make the patient feel accepted as a person with their own rights. The counsellor is responsible for setting and monitoring the boundaries between counselling and any other relationships with the patient.

The counsellor does not give advice to the patient but provides assistance so they can explore their problems. The counsellor should work together with the patient to find ways which will assist them to control their own lives. It is important for the counsellor to respect the patient's ability to make decisions and to change in line with their own beliefs and values.

The counsellor should not exploit their patients financially, sexually, emotionally, or in any other way. Engaging in sexual activity with the patient is an unethical
behaviour. It is also important that the patients are offered privacy during counselling sessions. Patients should not be observed by anyone other than the counsellor.

\section*{Terms of Counselling}

Counsellors are responsible for communicating the terms on which counselling is offered. The terms of counselling should be explained to the patient in the initial contact and should include:
- Availability of the counsellor and the specific time and location of the session.
- Expectation of fees for cancelled appointments.
- Number of counselling sessions per week/month.
- The patient should be given an opportunity to review the terms.
- The patient is made aware it is their choice to participate in the counselling process.
- Records of counselling sessions should be kept and the patient made aware of it.
- In case of need for referral, confer with the patient and get permission before consulting other counsellors.

\section*{Counsellor Competence}

Competence is an essential element in counselling and is acquired through proper training and practice. The counsellor should, therefore, work within their known limits of competence and should not offer counselling services if their ability or objectivity is impaired due to personal or emotional difficulties, illness, alcohol, drugs, or for any other reason. The counsellor should refer any patient they are unable to help to a competent person.

The counsellor should be honest and tell the truth to the patients at all times. Counsellors should not fear to tell the truth to the patients. Counsellors remain accountable for relationships with former patients and must exercise caution over entering into friendships and business relationships with them.

Any possible relationships must be discussed during counselling supervision. As a counsellor you should guard and respect the rights of the patient.
