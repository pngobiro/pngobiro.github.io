                    <p>Theories are reasoned suppositions put forward to explain facts or events. They are explanations of the general principles of art or science. Theories help us understand a phenomenon or behaviour. Theories of counseling are derived from theories of psychology. These theories help us to be able to predict behaviour, understand the emotional problem a client might have and also how the client's behaviour can change.</p>
                    <p>A counselor has to choose a counseling theory that will guide his practice in order to deliver counseling services effectively. There are many counseling theories but we shall only focus on four common theoretical approaches to counselling: Psychoanalytic, Person-centered, Behavioral, and Eclectic.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>This theory was advanced by Sigmund Freud (1856-1939). It is considered the first force/thrust in attempting to understand the human mind and behaviour. Psychoanalysis involves analysis of the unconscious motivations that influence behaviour. The counsellor focuses on what happened to the client in the past, that which has been forgotten, and also focuses on what is presently happening in the life of the client.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Key Concepts</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Human behaviour is deterministic.</strong> Our behaviour is determined by irrational forces, unconscious motivations, biological and instinctual drives.</li>
                            <li><strong>Personality Structure:</strong> Behaviour is influenced by conflicts in the personality structure consisting of ID, Ego and superego.
                                <ul>
                                    <li>The <strong>Id</strong> operates with the "pleasure Principle" i.e. desire to satisfy instinctual needs and avoid pain. The Id is largely unconscious, does not think only wishes. It is irrational.</li>
                                    <li>The <strong>Ego</strong> is in touch with reality. It is the executive that governs controls and regulates personality. It meditates between the instincts and the surrounding environment. It is the seat of intelligence and rationality. It operates on the "Reality Principle " as it does realistic and logical thinking.</li>
                                    <li>The <strong>Superego</strong> is the person's moral code being concerned with whether an action is good or bad, right or wrong. It is the judicial arm of personality. It represents the ideal, the values or ideals of society as handled down from parents to children. It strives for perfection. Superego operates with the "moral code principle".</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Influence of Early Experiences:</strong> Behaviour is influenced by experiences or conflicts in the first six years of life. According to Freud, an individual goes through the five psychosexual stages namely: oral, anal, phallic, latency and genital stage. If one does not negotiate these stages successfully, fixation results and this affects later behaviour.</li>
                            <li><strong>Anxiety:</strong> A state of tension develops due to conflict between id, Ego and superego trying to control the available psychic energy. Anxiety motivates behaviour. To cope with anxiety and avoid being overwhelmed, the ego employs defence mechanisms. These ego defenses are normal behaviours and have adaptive value but should not be overused or become a lifestyle to avoid reality. Some defence mechanisms include projection, repression, denial, reaction formation, compensation etc.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Goals of Therapy</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li>To bring the unconscious to consciousness.</li>
                            <li>To strengthen the Ego.</li>
                            <li>To help client gain insight into the origin of his problems.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Techniques of Counselling</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Free association:</strong> The client is allowed to talk freely anything that comes to mind however illogical, painful or irrelevant it might seem. Freud called this, talking cure or catharsis.</li>
                            <li><strong>Analysis of dreams:</strong> Freud viewed dreams as the royal road to the unconscious. The client narrates the dreams he/she has had and the therapist assists in analyzing them though there is no universal interpretation of dreams.</li>
                            <li><strong>Analysis of transference:</strong> A client might attach feelings he has for another person to counselor. The counselor's role is to facilitate that transference as it helps the client ventilate some emotions like anger, making the client feel better. Note that a counselor might also attach some feelings for another person to a client. This is called counter-transference. The counselor has to be aware of this feeling, otherwise it can affect the therapy.</li>
                            <li><strong>Analysis of Resistance:</strong> The client might have experienced some painful events in the past which are repressed in the unconscious. There may be resistance when trying to get in touch with those painful experiences. The counselor has a role to break that resistance.</li>
                            <li><strong>The Freudian slip:</strong> Freud said that there is no slip of the tongue. What comes out as a slip of the tongue is in fact, the unconscious getting access to the conscious.</li>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>These were advanced by B.F. Skinner, John B. Watson, Albert, and Bandura Ivan Pavlov among others. The behavioral approach is regarded as the $2^{nd}$ force/thrust in psychotherapy. This theory is based on the principles of learning to assess the behaviour of the patients. In the behavioristics view you are born as 'blank slate' and so everything you are as an individual you have learned from other people or from your life experiences.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">1. Classical Conditioning</h4>
                        <p>This was developed by Ivan Pavlov. He experimented with dogs in modification of behaviour. He conditioned the dog to salivate on hearing a bell because the dog was trained to associate the bell with food. This implies that people who are subjected to some severe conditions and react in certain ways will always react in similar way when exposed to similar conditions. This means that behaviour can be learnt and can be sustained by reinforcement. Behaviour can also be unlearnt by, refusing to reward it.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">2. Operant (instrumental) Conditioning</h4>
                        <p>Operant means that all organisms works in a given environment, resulting to some consequences. It is instrumental because there is sorely responsible for generating rewards for its behaviour. B.F. Skinner advanced this theory after experimenting with rats. A rat in a box stepped on a bar of a food delivering system accidentally, causing food pellets to come out. The rat continued this action to get more food. Similarly human beings have to learn to operate in their environment (home, school, work, town) in order to receive positive consequences. For instance a husband may show love to the wife to create a satisfying relationship. Thus behavioral counselors will teach clients techniques that will help them operate on the environment to get what they want.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">3. Social Learning Theory</h4>
                        <p>Albert Baudura developed this theory. Social learning refers to observational or imitation learning. An individual learns in his environment as he/she interacts and observes others. Social learning guides ones behaviour to comply with societal norms values and beliefs. This helps a person adjust well in society. Bandura experimented with dolls. Children treated a doll the way they saw adults treat it. They learnt by observing similarly clients can learn by observing the counselors. So counselors have a challenge to encourage this modeling process by making every effort to be desirable models.</p>

                            <li><strong>Use of systematic desensitization</strong> - This introduces the client to a feared object slowly until he/she unlearns the fear.</li>
                            <li><strong>Use of flooding.</strong> The client is exposed to the feared object in abundance to unlearn the fear.</li>
                            <li><strong>Use of self-management techniques</strong></li>
                            <li><strong>Use of aversive therapy/stimulation.</strong> Behaviour is associated with painful stimulation causing the client to unlearn it.</li>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Carl Rogers (1902-1987) developed the person centered theory. This theory is considered humanistic because of the positive view of human being it holds. It emphasis on the respect and uniqueness of a person. The Person-centered theory is based on Maslow's theory of self-actualization. The counsellor using this approach assumes that 'self-actualization' motivates human beings to exploit their capabilities or potentialities.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Key Concepts</h3>

                            <li>A client is viewed as trustworthy.</li>
                            <li>Clients have potential and are capable of self-direction.</li>
                            <li>Clients can make constructive changes. They are the experts of their problems.</li>
                            <li>Clients are able to live effective and productive lives.</li>
                            <li>Psychological disturbance results when a person's ideal self and real self are in conflict.</li>
                            <li><strong>Self-concept:</strong> This is the way an individual perceives the self. It is a structure made of a variety of self-conceptions. Congruence exists when self-conceptions match reality. Incongruence exists when they differ.</li>
                            <li><strong>Condition of worth:</strong> This implies that a self-conception is based on a condition of worth (e.g., values internalized from parents) rather than the individual's own valuing process.</li>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Counselling Techniques (Core Conditions)</h3>
                        <p>There are not techniques per se but Carl Rogers proposed three core conditions that help in a therapeutic relationship. These are:- Empathy, Unconditional positive regard, and Genuineness.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>i) Empathy</strong>- refers to counselor's ability to tune in to the wave length of the client. It is to enter into the client's world to try and understand how they are experiencing their world. Accurate emphatic understanding is very important as it helps the client to feel understood.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>ii) Unconditional-positive regard</strong> means communicating a respecting, caring attitude to the client. It is being nonjudgmental and accepting the client's feelings, thoughts and behaviour are not judged.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>iii) Genuineness</strong>- means being real or congruent during therapy. The counselor has to be himself, no façade to be able to model genuineness to the client. These core-conditions help the client to be open to experience and realize his potential in dealing with his/her issues.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Arnold Lazarous, a clinical psychologist developed this approach. The eclectic approach (or multimodal approach) is based on the belief that there is no single psychological theory, which can effectively be used in counselling all patients. The Multimodal approach borrows concepts and techniques from different schools of thought depending on the individual patient's unique psychological problems and circumstances. The eclectic theory describes human personality as consisting of seven modalities remembered by the acronym 'BASIC ID'.</p>

                        <p><strong>Behaviour:</strong> Some people may be described as doers or are action oriented. They keep themselves busy and get work done through other people.</p>
                        <p><strong>Affect:</strong> Some people are very emotional and may or may not express it.</p>
                        <p><strong>Sensation:</strong> Some people attach a lot of value to sensory experiences, such as sex, food, music and other sensory delights. Others are very much aware of minor aches and pains, and discomforts.</p>
                        <p><strong>Imagery:</strong> This is thinking in pictures, visualizing real or imagined experiences, letting your mind roam.</p>
                        <p><strong>Cognition:</strong> Some people are very analytical and like to plan things. They like to reason things through.</p>
                        <p><strong>Interpersonal:</strong> This is your self-rating as a social person. This is how you interact with friends or keep aloof.</p>
                        <p><strong>Drugs/biology:</strong> This is being conscious of personal health and how you maintain a health state. It is being concerned with social habits, which improve the health status or contribute to poor health. For example, regular exercise, getting enough sleep and avoiding junk food improves the health status, while smoking, overeating and over drinking contribute to poor health.</p>
