                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>An effective guidance counselor should possess a range of personal and professional qualities.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Patience</h4>
                        <p>A good counsellor should be very patient with their patient, no matter how many times the patient repeats themselves. You should not hurry the patient at all or show impatience. Nor should you show you are bored or tired of holding long discussions. You should only go to the next step of explaining when the patient has understood clearly the content of the information you are giving. If you are patient, your patient will feel that you accept themselves as a person and are interested in what they are talking about. This encourages the patient to open up even more.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Warmth</h4>
                        <p>You should show warmth without being possessive during counselling. Smile and show a lot of concern and acceptance to the patient. An effective counsellor should be friendly and approachable for students/clients to freely seek help without fear.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">A Good Listener</h4>
                        <p>A counsellor must be a good listener, able to listen actively and be patient with the client.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Confidentiality</h4>
                        <p>Confidentiality means keeping all the information given by the patient secret. As a counsellor, you should not let anyone know what your patient has discussed with you. To maintain confidentiality, counselling should be done on an individual basis (where appropriate) and in a private room. You, as a counsellor, have an obligation to treat all the information you have been given with confidence. The patient consults you because they believe that all information they disclose will remain secret. It is unprofessional to disclose any information obtained from a patient during counselling except to other professionals who have are involved in the care.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Honesty and Genuineness</h4>
                        <p>Honesty refers to the act of telling the truth to the patient. As a good counsellor you should always tell your patient the truth. You should never tell a lie to your patient. If, for example, you are not sure of something, tell them simply that you will go to look for information. Honesty is exercised by both patient and counsellor. You should encourage your patient to be very honest on the information they are giving. Similarly, you should not hide any information of concern to your patient. Being honest makes the patient regard you as a dependable and trustworthy counsellor. A counsellor should be genuine, sincere or honest- be yourself no mask, can self disclose or express personal feelings about an issue.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Empathy</h4>
                        <p>Empathy is defined as the ability to imagine oneself in the position of another person, and thus, share and understand that person`s feelings. Empathy is the ability of the counsellor to put themselves in the position of the patient by understanding their feelings. As a counsellor, you should understand what your patient is feeling and communicate this understanding to them. Empathy involves being very close to the patient and sharing your thoughts and feelings. When you share your feelings with the patient they feel accepted, loved and understood. Empathy is characterized by both sharing and separateness. Although as a counsellor you share thoughts and feelings with the patient, the counsellor should remain separate and retain objectivity. This allows you to give objective responses to assist the patient in making the right decisions. An effective counsellor should be able to show empathy not sympathy (pity).</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Observance</h4>
                        <p>A good counsellor must be very observant. As you listen to your patient talking, observe their facial expressions and try to interpret the meaning of any nonverbal communication. Facial expressions may reveal painful memories expressed in the form of anger, sadness and frustrations. Listen very carefully to the patient, observing if their facial expressions correspond with their speech. Observe carefully any mood swings and their relevance to the conversation. The observations are made to detect any inappropriate behaviour expressed by the patient. Close observation also makes the patient feel the counsellor is interested in the conversation.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Accepting and Non-Judgemental</h4>
                        <p>Being accepting means the patient is accepted the way they are. The counsellor recognises the basic rights of the patient, whether they are good or bad. When the patient feels that they are accepted as a person with their own rights, they are encouraged to disclose information. As a counsellor you should be nonjudgmental. You should avoid criticizing the patient even if you feel they are wrong. You should listen carefully when the patient is talking to understand the message they are conveying. You can only give suggestions and not criticism. You should be able to exercise unconditional positive regard towards the client able to tolerate anti-social behavior.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Other Important Qualities</h4>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Counselling, like any other profession has ethical standards to guide those involved in it. Ethical standards are a framework from which to work. They consist of values such as confidentiality, competence and responsibility.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Purposes of a Code of Ethics</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Promote unity and pride of the profession</li>
                            <li>To give professional standards in situations of conflict.</li>

                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Core Ethical Principles</h3>
                        <p>We are going to focus on five broad principles of counseling ethics namely: Autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficience, justice and fidelity.</p>
                        
                        <h4>I. AUTONOMY</h4>
                        <p>The counselor has to allow the client to be independent and free to make their choices. The client has a right as he/she wish even if others disagree. The counselor does not decide what is best for the client neither does he impose his values on the client. This means respecting the client's decisions or choices.</p>
                        
                        <h4>II. BENEFICENCE</h4>
                        <p>This refers to the counselor's responsibility to promote the welfare of the client. Whatever is done in counseling should be for the benefit of the client. For example, a counselor will operate within his level of competence, and if he is not able to help a client he will refer the client.</p>

                        <h4>III. NON-MALEFICENCE</h4>
                        <p>A counselor should avoid any harm on a client. He/She has responsibility to ensure the client does not worsen through negligence or recklessness. A counselor is expected to practice within the limits of his competence. A counselor has to observe confidentiality. If client's information has to be used in research or training consent of the client should be sought or the identity of the client should be sought or the identity of the client should be disguised.</p>

                        <h4>IV. JUSTICE</h4>
                        <p>This refers to counselor's responsibility to treat all clients equally regardless of their age, gender, race, ethnicity, cultural background, socioeconomic status, disability, life style orientation and religion. Every person should be accorded access to counseling services and be treated fairly. Counselors should not exhibit prejudice or discrimination.</p>

                        <h4>V. FIDELITY</h4>
                        <p>This means being royal or faithful to the client. It refers to promise keeping. The counselor has to maintain confidentiality as promised, and keep the appointments with clients.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Code of Practice and Counsellor Competence</h3>
                        <p>The primary role of a counsellor is to serve their patient's interests at all times. The counsellor is responsible for setting and monitoring the boundaries between counselling and any other relationships with the patient. The counsellor does not give advice to the patient but provides assistance so they can explore their problems. The counsellor should work together with the patient to find ways which will assist them to control their own lives.</p>
                        <p>The counsellor should not exploit their patients financially, sexually, emotionally, or in any other way. Engaging in sexual activity with the patient is an unethical behaviour. It is also important that the patients are offered privacy during counselling sessions. Patients should not be observed by anyone other than the counsellor.</p>
                        <p>Competence is an essential element in counselling and is acquired through proper training and practice. The counsellor should, therefore, work within their known limits of competence and should not offer counselling services if their ability or objectivity is impaired due to personal or emotional difficulties, illness, alcohol, drugs, or for any other reason. The counsellor should refer any patient they are unable to help to a competent person.</p>
