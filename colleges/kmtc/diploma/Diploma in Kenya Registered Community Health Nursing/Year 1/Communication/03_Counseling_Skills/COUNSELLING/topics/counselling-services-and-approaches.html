                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Any guidance and Counseling program should encompass the major components. These are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Educational Guidance:</strong> This is the help given to students on choice of subjects/courses based on their interests and abilities. Students are also assisted on academic problems such as under achieving, poor reading techniques etc.</li>
                            <li><strong>Vocational guidance:</strong> This enables the individuals to comprehend the world of works students are assisted in choosing careers in line with their talents, interests and training and job opportunities available. Each individual has to be prepared to participate in occupations of economic and social value. All must be helped to appreciate the dignity of labour so as to co-operate in the task of nation building.</li>
                            <li><strong>Personal/Psychological Counseling:</strong> This is the assistance given to individuals showing personality maladjustment such as anxiety, excessive frustration, unhappiness, extreme anger, mobility of aspirations achieved, partial or total failure etc. Those with adjustment problems like loneliness (home-sickness) in ability to socialize also need counseling. These personal problems are detrimental to academic achievement; hence they should be addressed to by the counselor in the institution or suitable referral be made.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>These three components of Guidance and Counseling are covered in the program by offering the following services:</p>

                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                <strong>ORIENTATION OR ADAPTIVE SERVICES</strong>
                                <p>These help students to adjust better in any new environment. As students are admitted in new institutions many get lost socially and psychologically. Thus orientation services help the students to adjust to the new physical environment, rules and regulations governing students conduct facilities in the institutions, teaching staff and the Guidance and Counseling program in the school.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>APPRAISAL/INVENTORY SERVICES</strong>
                                <p>This involves collection of personal data of a student through interview, observation, testing, history etc on each student. The information helps one know his strengths and weaknesses so as to make reasonable choices. The analysis of this objective data also helps in understanding the client in order to give realistic help in problem-solving or decision-making.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>INFORMATION OR DISTRIBUTIVE SERVICES</strong>
                                <p>These services are aimed at providing students with better knowledge of educational, vocational and social opportunities so as to make informed choices and decisions. Sufficient, reliable up-to-date information assists one to make realistic decisions.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>PLANNING AND PLACEMENT SERVICES</strong>
                                <p>This aids individuals to get admission into a school, college, job or secure admission in hospital for treatment. The students are helped in making necessary applications.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>FOLLOW -UP- RESEARCH AND EVALUATION SERVICES</strong>
                                <p>These are not direct services to the students/clients but they help the institution's officials appraise the program. Follow-up studies of past students and those still in school help evaluate the effectiveness of the program. Research provides information on whether the students are being prepared for life in the institution and outside.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>COUNSELLING SERVICE</strong>
                                <p>This service is the heart of the work of Guidance and Counselors. Counseling is concerned with feelings, attitudes and emotional disposition of an individual about himself and the situation he is facing. Counselor attempts to help a student better understand himself in relating to his present and future decisions or problems. Rogers (1961) referred to counseling as a series of direct contacts with the individual which aims to offer assistance in changing attitudes and behaviour. Students with psychological problems or maladjusted behaviour can be assisted through Counseling.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Kottman (1977) came up with the following approaches that can be used in offering Guidance and Counselling services.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                <strong>CRISIS APPROACH</strong>
                                <p>This involves taking action when a problem or crisis has already occurred. The counselor is expected to use crisis intervention techniques to fix the problem for example after death of a loved one, car, plan, or train crash/accident, rape etc. As a result of these problems trauma results which need to be addressed through debriefing. Debriefing is a form of counseling that helps the affected person(s) to express emotions caused by the traumatic incident. This help to process the painful feeling of fear, anger, bitterness etc and the persona gets emotionally relieved.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>REMEDIAL/REHABILITATIVE APPROACH</strong>
                                <p>This focuses on measurable weaknesses and tries to remediate them. The purpose is to avoid possible crisis in that particular area. It involves teaching skills and social skills that students do not have, negotiation skills can be taught to assist in solving interpersonal problems.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>PREVENTIVE MODEL</strong>
                                <p>In this approach, the counselor tries to identify problems and prevent them from happening. These problems can potentially affect large numbers of students. Prevention is mainly done through dissemination of relevant information. Issues such as drug and substance eating disorders dropping out of school, teenage pregnancies HIV/Aids etc can be addressed through the preventive approach.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>DEVELOPMENTAL APPROACH</strong>
                                <p>The counselor identifies some specific skills and experiences that the students need to make them successful in school life. It is based on student outcome, some of the skills that can be used are teaching sharing information role playing coaching, tutoring, and counseling. The skills taught may encompass all areas of student interest i.e. academic, social, spiritual, personal and vocational/career domains. For example a student who is weak in social aspect may be given training in assertiveness, to avoid being manipulated by others or to withstand peer pressure.</p>
