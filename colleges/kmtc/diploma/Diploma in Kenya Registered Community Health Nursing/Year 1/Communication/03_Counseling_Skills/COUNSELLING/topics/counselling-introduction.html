                        <p>Counselling is an interactive process involving the counselee who is vulnerable and who needs assistance and the counselor who is trained and educated to give this assistance. The goal is to help the counselee learn to deal more effectively with himself and the quality of his environment.</p>
                        <p>From these definitions you realize that Counseling involves a relationship between a counselor and client. Through which the client is helped to explore his thoughts, feelings and behavior to gain selfunderstanding that leads to decision making and taking relevant action to deal with the issues/problems. Thus counseling is a process of empowering a person to solve his problems or "helping a person help himself".</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>"Counseling is essentially a process in which the counselor assists the counselee to make interpretations of facts relating to a choice, plan or adjustment which he needs to make." -Glenn F. Smith</li>
                            <li>"Counseling is a series of direct contacts with the individual which aims to offer him assistance in changing his attitude behaviors." - Carl Rogers</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Counselling is defined as a two-way face-to-face communication profess in which one person tries to help another person in order to understand a problem and identify a solution to that problem. It refers to the act of working with a client so as to help him/her to clarify his/her personal goals and find ways of overcoming their problems. The aim of counselling is to assist an individual to change behaviours that are interfering with the normal life situations.</p>
