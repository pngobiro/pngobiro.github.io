                        <p>According to a circular from the MOEST inspectorate dated 6th April, 1984 the Guidance and Counselling Committee, the "Committee should comprise of volunteers members of staff with the Head as the Chairman and the teacher counselor as the Secretary" 6-8 volunteers staff members depending on size of the school complete the committee however, other teachers can also actively participate in the Guidance program by giving recommendations, acting as resource persons or assisting in other aspects. However, from the situation of the ground, the heads have many responsibilities so normally the Guidance teacher acts as Chairman of the Guidance Committee.</p>
                        <p>The functions of the Guidance Committee are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Assist in the organization/planning and appraisal of the guidance program</li>
                            <li>Help solve present and anticipated problems and make recommendations to the administration concerning further development of Guidance services.</li>
                            <li>Keep the staff members parents, BOG and other members informed about the needs and progress of the guidance programme.</li>
                            <li>Direct and participate in planning and conducting special Guidance projects such as surveys etc.</li>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Many of the factors that cause breakdown in everyday communication also present barriers to counselling. These barriers interfere with the counselling process by making the client unable to fully make informed decisions or disclose their feelings and concerns.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Physical Barriers</h3>
                        <p>These refer to those factors both in the environment and the physical appearance of the counsellor that prevent or reduce opportunities for the communication process to occur.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Interviewing Room:</strong> The interview should be conducted in a private quiet room. It should be spacious, clean, comfortable, and free from noise or distracting equipment.</li>
                            <li><strong>Dress Code and Appearance:</strong> If you do not look presentable and pleasant, the client might have a problem being attentive to you and taking you seriously.</li>
                            <li><strong>Age and Gender:</strong> A difference in age between the counsellor and the client may affect the outcome of the session. In youth counselling, it is advisable for counsellors to be of the same gender as their clients to help overcome discomfort.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Differences in Social and Cultural Background</h3>
                        <p>When a client comes from a different nationality, race, or ethnic group, it may be difficult for you as the counsellor to really know of his/her beliefs, taboos, and cultural practices. The client may not be able to take action because perhaps the information you give him/her does not tally with his/her beliefs.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Inappropriate Non-Verbal Behaviour by the Provider</h3>
                        <p>The gestures that you make could either make the counselling session a success or a failure. Some of the gestures that could make you fail include frowning, showing signs of boredom or humour, showing signs of disgust, or displaying signs of disapproval towards the client.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Barriers Caused by the Client and the Counsellor</h3>
                        <p>Other barriers caused by factors that are related to both the counsellor and the client are summarized as follows:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Failure to listen:</strong> by both the counsellor and the client, and it may be manifested by not receiving the intended message.</li>
                            <li><strong>Failure to probe:</strong> occurs when the counsellor does not get adequate responses from the patient.</li>
                            <li><strong>Being judgmental:</strong> the counsellor may approve or disapprove the statements from the patient.</li>
                            <li><strong>Rejection:</strong> may occur when the counsellor refuses to discuss some topics with the client.</li>
                            <li><strong>Parroting:</strong> whereby the client continues repeating the same phrase even if the counsellor asks him/her question in a different version.</li>
                            <li><strong>Defending:</strong> which is an attempt to protect something or someone from negative feedback.</li>
                            <li><strong>Giving advice:</strong> that is, the counsellor telling the client what he thinks should be done.</li>
                            <li><strong>Privacy disruption:</strong> which occurs if counselling sessions are held in a room where privacy is not observed.</li>
                            <li><strong>Changing topic:</strong> whereby the counsellor directs the interaction into areas of self-interest rather than following the lead of the client.</li>
                            <li><strong>Language and level of education.</strong></li>
                            <li><strong>Psychological barriers.</strong></li>

                        <p>Counselling sessions should be conducted in a private room. The patient trusts that any issues or information discussed during counselling sessions is confidential.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Consent</h4>

                        <h4>Involvement</h4>
                        <p>The patient should be informed about plans of action to be carried out for their own benefit and be involved in planning the course of action.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Informed</h4>
                        <p>The patient should be informed about their own health status. The counsellor should answer all queries raised by the patient without any hindrances.</p>

                        <p>The patient expects a systematic and accurate investigations of their health concerns by a competent counsellor. The counsellor should, therefore, refer the patient if not able to meet their needs.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Basic Principles of Counselling Process</h3>
                        <p>According to Mc Daniel and Shaftal, the counseling process is based on some basic principles:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Principle of acceptance</strong>-accept the patient with his physical, psychological, social, economic and cultural conditions. The counselor should give due regard to the rights of the client.</li>
                            <li><strong>Principle of communication</strong>-communication should be verbal as well as non-verbal and should be skillful.</li>
                            <li><strong>Principle of empathy</strong>-instead of showing sympathy put yourself in patients' shoes and then give reflections accordingly.</li>
                            <li><strong>Principle of non-judge-mental attitude</strong>-do not criticize or comment negatively regarding patient's complaints.</li>
                            <li><strong>Principle of confidentiality</strong>-always keep the patient's name, and the problem strictly secrete and assure the patient about the same.</li>
                            <li><strong>Principle of individuality</strong>-treat each and every patient as unique and respect his problem as well.</li>
                            <li><strong>Principles of non-emotional involvement</strong>-not getting emotionally involved with the patient and avoid getting carried away with his feelings.</li>
                            <li><strong>Principle of Respect for the individual</strong> - Respecting an individual's feelings must be an integral parts of counseling process.</li>
                            <li><strong>Principle of Permissiveness:</strong> Counseling is such a relationship which develops optimism and the environment shapes according to the person.</li>
                            <li><strong>Principle of Thinking with the Individual</strong>-Counseling emphasizes thinking with the individual... it is the role of the counselor the think about all the forces around the client to join client's thought process and to work collectively with the client regarding his problem.</li>
                            <li><strong>Principle of Learning</strong>-All the assumptions of counseling accept the presence of learning- elements in the counseling process.</li>
                            <li><strong>Principle of Consistency with Ideals of Democracy</strong>-The process of counseling is based upon the ideals of a person's respect. It is a process which accepts individual differences.</li>
