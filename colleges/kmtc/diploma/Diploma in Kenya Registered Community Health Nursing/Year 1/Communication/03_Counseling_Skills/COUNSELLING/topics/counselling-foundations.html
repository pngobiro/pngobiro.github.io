                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The formal Guidance and Counseling was first concepturealized in the U.S in the $17^{th}$ century. It was started in response to various problems such as poor working conditions, economic and political problems, immigration, child labour, and increased crime. Several stages in evolution of Guidance and Counseling came up to address these problems. These included:</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">i) The vocational Guidance movement</h3>
                        <p>This emphasized the need for vocational information, planning and guidance to help people prepare for the world of work. In vocational planning students need to be assisted in:</p>
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li>Taking a critical individual analysis of their aptitudes, interest and personality traits.</li>
                            <li>Getting adequate information of the world of work such as structure of the world of work, how workers function, how traits contribute to workers function etc.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">ii) The mental hygienic movement</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Focused on mental health</li>
                            <li>Conditions in mental health hospitals</li>
                            <li>Establishment of mental health institutions:</li>
                            <li>Psychiatry</li>
                            <li>Psychotherapy</li>
                            <li>Social work</li>
                            <li>Counselling</li>
                            <li>Guidance and Counseling in schools started</li>
                            <li>Welfare of workers during industrial revolution</li>
                            <li>Project of training house wives to cancel others.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The founder, Clifford Beers (1909) was a wealthy Young man who became interested in problems of mental health. After, confinement for mental breakdown. He wrote a book "entitled" A mind that found itself. Through his book he highlighted to the public the deplorable conditions in mental hospitals and aroused interest in mental problems. As a result, institutions for psychiatry, psychotherapy, social worker and counseling to help people adjust to their problems started. Personnel at work started also to look into the welfare of workers as industrial revolution commenced. Mrs. Lee (Morical) started a project of training housewives to counsel others as peers or as paraprofessional counselors.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">iii) The child Guidance movement</h3>
                        <p>This was started by Dr. William Heally (1909). Healy and his wife (A couple) started a clinic in Chicago as a result of treating physical illness of children from broken homes especially slum areas. They realized the need to treat both physical and psychological problems of the children. Other child guidance clinics later started.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">iv) The testing movement</h3>
                        <p>Alfred Bunnet developed the "Intelligence scale" in 1905 to measure IQ. This was a big step forward in the development of measurement techniques that gave a greater degree of objectivity to the process of Educational and vocational planning for children and young adults. Bunnet stimulated the need for identifying and assisting mentally retarded children. Since this development more standardized tests (psychological tests) have constructed to measure intelligence, aptitude, achievement, personality values and vocational interests.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">v) Dean of Girls movement</h3>
                        <p>Ella Flaff-Young (1913) recommended the extension of vocational Guidance to other schools in the city of Chicago. He also recommended appointment of women counselors in mixed high schools to cater for social Guidance of girls as the boys went to the principal as counselor and friend. Young also recommended that women counselors would only teach regular classes so as to organize for social life needs of the girls. The counselor would be paid &300 extra for this responsibility. This pioneered the Guidance movement especially determining the place of Deans in secondary schools.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Modern Guidance and Counseling in developing countries can be traced back in 1959 in Nigeria. The Catholic sisters at St. Theresa's college Ibadan started to organize formal career guidance service for the upper class students a few months before the school certificate examinations began. Like in U.S.A the emphasis was on</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Vocational information,</li>
                            <li>Awareness of the world of work</li>
                            <li>The need for these services was felt more due to rapid pace of industrialization, urbanization growth and uneven distribution of wealth as well as start of universal free primary education. The Catholic sisters felt the need for their graduating students to be informed).</li>
                            <li>The world of work and occupational information).</li>
                            <li>Being trained in human relations(personnel issues)</li>
                            <li>Guest speakers from various government departments and other officials were invited to give lecturers and seminars to students on employment opportunities. This vocational movement spread to other parts of Nigeria leading to formation of Ibadan careers council "in 1962 and later the "counseling Association of Nigeria(CAN) was lauched in 1976 with Olu Makinde as the first President". CAN got affiliated to the American personnel and Guidance Association (APGA) to draw inspiration strength and support. CAN also started a journal called "the counselor"</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Since 1971 most universities in Nigeria started Guidance and Counseling departments to train potential counselors for high schools and colleges. According to Makinde, guidance and Counseling in the Educational system in Nigeria was a matter of concern. Many Educationists thought Guidance and Counseling can be handled by any teacher even with no training in this area. The career masters were just appointed with no training having no insight of the function of a Guidance Counselor. This is similar to the Kenya situation as we are going to note.</p>
                        <p>In Kenya formal Guidance and Counseling are concepts of the 70's. The Guidance and Counseling unit was started in 1971 in the Ministry of Education after a conference in 1967 on careers. Teachers, Educators and employers met to determine the criteria for selecting school leavers for public and private jobs.</p>
                        <p>The unit was charged with 3 responsibilities</p>
                        <ol type="i">
                            <li>To offer educational guidance and Counseling to help in planning suitable programs to prepare youth for man-power needs in Kenya.</li>
                            <li>To give personal/psychological counseling for those students with Maladjustments e.g. unhappiness annoyance, anxiety, neurosis, excess frustration etc.</li>
                            <li>To give vocational guidance and counseling to assist young People in vocational choice based on their interests and uptitudes.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>In 1984, a circular was sent to all heads of secondary schools instructing them to start Guidance and Counseling units/departments. The heads were to constitute guidance and counseling committee composed of 6-8 interested members of staff for the following functions:</p>
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li>To assist in the evaluation of Guidance programme</li>
                            <li>Make recommendations to the administration concerning development of guidance and counseling.</li>
                            <li>Keep staff members and parents informed about the progress of guidance and counseling.</li>
                            <li>Participate in planning and conducting special guidance projects such as surveys of students problems, occupational surveys etc.</li>
                            <li>Recommend specialists and consultants as guest speakers whenever possible.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Just like in Nigeria implementation of the Guidance programme in Kenyan schools has taken a slow pace. Some of the constraints that have hindered effective implementation of Guidance and Counseling program are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Lack of finances for training and resources like reference materials.</li>
                            <li>Lack of trained personnel in Guidance and Counseling.</li>
                            <li>Ignorance of role of guidance and counseling among staff and students.</li>
                            <li>Peer pressure discouraging others to go for counseling.</li>
                            <li>Conflict in role of discipline and that of Guidance and Counseling.</li>
                            <li>Lack of clear policy from the government on guidance and counseling.</li>
                            <li>Time limitation for teacher counselor and for students.</li>
                            <li>Negative effect of the print and electronic media advertising drug casual sex which give discourages.</li>
                            <li>Cultural beliefs and practices.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><em>Can you cite more constraints?</em></p>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The concepts of Guidance and Counseling have been in existence as long as humanity has lived. Through the ages people have sought to understand themselves, offer counsel/advice assist in developing potentialities and getting aware of the opportunities in life. Elders and chiefs were sought by the youth for Guidance although they did not elaborate on career guidance since there were limited occupational opportunities. The youth assumed roles based on age and gender. Skills were handed down through on job training (apprenticeship) e.g. potters, medecinemen, blacksmith. Preventive approach was mainly used in traditional Guidance and Counseling geared towards avoiding suicide, irresponsible behaviour etc.</p>
                        <p>It was done in a casual way as people went on with usual routines like cooking, cultivating, grazing etc. During festivals and ceremonies, in initiation rites, marriage/weddings, funerals etc guidance was given.</p>
                        <p>Some of the goals of traditional Guidance and Counseling were; educating children on acceptable behaviour, about their religion, to teach youth to be honest being involved in economic social cultural activities, relating with others especially members of opposite sex, preparing for initiation, marriage and adult life. Youth were also trained to control their emotions and exercise self-control.</p>
                        <p>The agents of traditional Guidance and Counseling were: parents and members of extended family, elders, peer group members, those in authority like elders, chiefs, traditional doctors, palmists, soothsayers/fortune tellers and astrologers were also sought for advice. The methods used in the traditional guidance and counseling included oral explanation like story telling, proverbs/riddles, songs and dances during festivals or rituals and also visits to grand parents, uncles, aunts, medicine men etc.</p>
                        <p><em>Can you compare traditional Guidance and Counseling and the formal Guidance and Counseling?</em></p>
                        <p>The following are some skills used by traditional practioners as compared to modern Guidance and Counseling:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Invitation</strong> - The traditional practitioners knew when to invite people for guidance and counseling while modern counselors wait for clients in the office.</li>
                            <li><strong>Knowledge.</strong> Traditional knew the culture; people's background- had an idea of prevailing issues- modern live in a complex society.</li>
                            <li><strong>Use of local language:</strong>- This helps to release tension and makes communication better. Modern counselors use foreign language mostly, hindering clear communication.</li>
                            <li><strong>Non-verbal communication:</strong>- The traditional counselors understand these well as they come from same cultural background with client. Modern counselors may not understand nonverbal communication from all clients.</li>
                            <li><strong>Interaction:</strong>- Traditional counselors were interested in the questions "why and how" to get out of a problem, but modern counselors are interested in what happened e.g. psychoanalysis that focuses on past experiences.</li>
                            <li><strong>Social skills:</strong>- Traditional counselors were familiar with the customary behaviour in the community they belonged to makling it easier to establish ropport with client. Modern counselors might be ignorant of the social skills of different ethnic groups.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Note that the traditional Guidance and Counseling was offered to all at no charge(except medicine men who would charge affordable fee inform of goods). Modern counselors are not accessible by all people who need help and they charge for their services since it is a profession for them.</p>
