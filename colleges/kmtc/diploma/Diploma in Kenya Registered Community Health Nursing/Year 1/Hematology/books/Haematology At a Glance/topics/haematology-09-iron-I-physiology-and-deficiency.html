                        <p>Iron is contained in haemoglobin, the reticuloendothelial system (RES) (as ferritin and haemosiderin), muscle (myoglobin), plasma (bound to transferrin) and cellular enzymes (e.g. cytochromes, catalase) (Fig. 9.1). Reticuloendothelial cells (macrophages) gain iron from the haemoglobin of effete red cells and release it to plasma transferrin which transports iron to bone marrow and other tissues with transferrin receptors. Transferrin is capable of binding two iron atoms per molecule and is reutilized after giving up iron to cells. The iron-responsive-element-binding protein (IRE-BP) is an RNA-binding protein which binds to specific messenger RNA sequences and is a mechanism whereby the body's iron content regulates uptake and storage of iron by cells of the RES. When iron is in excess, transferrin receptor synthesis, and therefore iron uptake, are reduced and ferritin synthesis is increased. Iron deficiency has the opposite effects.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The average Western diet contains $10-15 \mathrm{mg}$ of iron daily, of which $5-10\%$ (about $1 \mathrm{mg}$) is normally absorbed through the upper small intestine. Absorption is adjusted to body needs (increased in iron deficiency and pregnancy, reduced in iron overload). Absorption is regulated by two proteins, DMT-1 (also called N-ramp 2) at the villous tip and HFE at the basolateral surfaces of the enterocyte. The DMT-1 level determines the amount of iron absorbed, and the DMT-1 level is in turn controlled by degree of expression of HFE. This is increased in iron deficiency. Iron in animal products is more easily absorbed than vegetable iron; inorganic iron in ferrous form is absorbed more than ferric form. Vitamin C enhances absorption; phytates inhibit it. Dietary intake makes up for daily loss (about $1 \mathrm{mg}$) in hair, skin, urine, faeces and menstrual blood loss in women. Infants, children and pregnant women need extra iron to expand their red cell mass and, in pregnancy, for transfer to the fetus.</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Blood loss (500 mL of normal blood contains $200-250 \mathrm{mg}$ iron)—dominant cause in Western countries.</li>
                            <li>Malabsorption - rarely a main cause.</li>
                            <li>Poor dietary intake—a contributory cause, especially in children, menstruating females or pregnancy, especially in developing countries.</li>

                            <li>General features of anaemia (see Chapter 6).</li>
                            <li>Special features (minority of patients): koilonychia (Fig. 9.2) or ridged brittle nails, glossitis, angular cheilosis (sore corners of mouth), pica (abnormal appetite), hair thinning and pharyngeal web formation (Paterson-Kelly syndrome).</li>
                            <li>Features resulting from an underlying cause.</li>

                        <ul>

                            <li>Blood film appearances (Fig. 9.3) include hypochromic/microcytic cells, aniso/poikilocytosis, target cells and 'pencil' cells.</li>
                            <li>Bone marrow—not needed for diagnosis: erythroblasts show ragged irregular cytoplasm; absence of iron from stores and erythroblasts.</li>
                            <li>Serum ferritin reduced, serum iron low with raised transferrin and unsaturated iron binding capacity.</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Oral iron—ferrous sulphate is best (200 mg, 67 mg iron per tablet) before meals three times daily.</li>
                            <li>A reticulocyte response begins in 7 days but treatment should be continued for 4-6 months to replenish stores.</li>
                            <li>Side effects (e.g. abdominal pain, diarrhoea or constipation) require a lower dose, taking iron with food, or a different preparation (e.g. ferrous gluconate 300 mg, 37 mg iron per tablet).</li>
                            <li>Poor response may be due to continued bleeding, incorrect diagnosis, malabsorption or poor compliance.</li>
                            <li>Prophylactic oral iron, often combined with folic acid, is given in pregnancy.</li>
                            <li>Intramuscular iron is used in patients with malabsorption or who are unable to take oral iron. Intravenous iron may cause anaphylaxis but is useful to replenish iron stores in rare cases and in renal dialysis patients receiving erythropoietin therapy.</li>
                        </ul>
