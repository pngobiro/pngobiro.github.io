                        <p>These are associated with easy bruising, purpura and ecchymosis and spontaneous bleeding from mucosal surfaces. The bleeding time, prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) and platelet count are all normal.</p>

Local treatment (e.g. nasal packing) may control bleeding; tranexamic acid helps to reduce bleeding. Chronic iron deficiency is frequent.</li>

Henoch-Schönlein purpura is an allergic vasculitis which follows an acute infection, usually in childhood, and may be associated with arthropathy, haematuria and gastrointestinal symptoms.</p>

                        <p>Excessive bleeding caused by thrombocytopenia or disordered platelet function is mucosal (e.g. epistaxis, gastrointestinal bleeding or menorrhagia) or affects the skin (purpura, petechiae and ecchymoses). Symptoms usually occur when the platelet count is &lt;10 x 10<sup>9</sup>/L but this may be higher when there is impaired platelet function.</p>

                        <p>This is rare: causes include congenital aplastic anaemia, thrombocytopenia with absent radii (TAR) syndrome or Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (thrombocytopenia with eczema and hypogammaglobulinaemia).

                        <p>The platelets are coated with autoantibody (immunoglobulin) and are removed by the macrophages of the reticuloendothelial system. Their lifespan is therefore reduced from 10-14 days to a few hours.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Autoimmune thrombocytopenia</h4>
                        <p><strong>Acute</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Usually presents in childhood (2-7 years).</li>
                            <li>Often follows a viral infection.</li>
                            <li>Purpuric rash or epistaxis frequent (Figs 29.3 and 29.4).</li>
                            <li>Typically resolves spontaneously. A minority develop mucosal bleeding and should be treated with prednisolone or intravenous immunoglobulin. Up to 20% develop chronic immune thrombocytopenia.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p><strong>Chronic</strong></p>
                        <p>Immune thrombocytopenia in adults is less likely to resolve without therapy and usually chronic. It is more common in females (M/F ratio 1:4). Autoantibody is present on the platelet surface and may also be present as free antibody in serum.</p>

                            <li>Normal haemoglobin and white cell count; platelets low, often &lt;20 x 10<sup>9</sup>/L.</li>
                            <li>Bone marrow is normal or increased numbers of megakaryocytes.</li>
                            <li>PT and APTT are normal, fibrinogen is normal.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Treatment</h4>
                        <p>Treatment, if necessary, is with the following.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Prednisolone (1 mg/kg/day, reducing over 4-6 weeks).</li>
                            <li>Intravenous immunoglobulin is valuable for obtaining a temporary rise in platelet count.</li>
                            <li>Splenectomy is required for non-responders with continuing symptoms and/or very low platelet counts.</li>
                            <li>Additional immunosuppressive therapy (e.g. azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, cyclosporin A, rhesus anti-D, vincristine) or even combination chemotherapy have been used.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Immune thrombocytopenia also occurs in association with some malignancies (e.g. chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, myelodysplasia), infections (e.g. Epstein-Barr virus, HIV, malaria) and connective tissue disease (e.g. systemic lupus erythematosus). Patients should be tested for ANF and anticardiolipin antibodies.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Alloimmune thrombocytopenia</h3>
                        <p>Transplacental passage of maternal antibody in immune thrombocytopenia can lead to neonatal thrombocytopenia, which typically resolves spontaneously over a few weeks. Mothers who have been sensitized (e.g. by blood transfusion or previous pregnancy) to platelet antigens may develop antibodies which cross the placenta and coat fetal and neonatal platelets, which are then removed in the reticuloendothelial system. Individuals with such platelet alloantibodies can also become thrombocytopenic after blood transfusion (post-transfusion purpura). The antibody usually is directed against the HPA1-a antigen on platelets.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Other causes of thrombocytopenia</h3>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Drugs</h4>
                        <p>Drugs cause thrombocytopenia by inhibiting marrow production or by an immune mechanism. The most common immune mechanism (e.g. quinine, heparin) is when the drug forms an antigen with a plasma protein, an antibody is formed to it, and circulating antigen-antibody complexes are absorbed on the platelet surface. Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia is associated with thrombosis.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Disseminated intravascular coagulation</h4>
                        <p>This is discussed in Chapter 31.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and haemolytic uraemic syndrome</h4>
                        <p>Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) and haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS) are characterized by thrombosis in small vessels, red cell fragmentation, haemolytic anaemia (Fig.29.5) and thrombocytopenia. Renal failure often occurs in HUS and fever, neurological changes and liver dysfunction in TTP. The PT and APTT are normal. TTP is caused by a deficiency—either congenital or acquired from an antibody—of a plasma protease which normally cleaves von Willebrand factor (vWF). Abnormally high molecular weight vWF complexes are present in plasma. Haemolytic uraemic syndrome occurs in childhood and follows infection with verotoxin-producing strains of E. coli; it is also associated with Shigella, Salmonella and streptococcal infection, pregnancy, autoimmune diseases and drugs (e.g. cyclosporin A). The protease levels are normal. TTP is more frequently fatal, occurs in adults and may be associated with autoimmune conditions (e.g. SLE), pregnancy and infection.</p>
                        <p>Treatment of TTP is with plasma exchange using fresh frozen plasma (FFP) as the replacement fluid. Fresh frozen plasma depleted of cryoprecipitate may be more effective, while FFP which has been solvent treated is less likely to transmit viral infection. Antiplatelet drugs (aspirin or dipyridamole), corticosteroids, splenectomy and vincristine have all been used. Response to treatment may be monitored by haemoglobin level, reticulocytes, lactate dehydrogenase, platelet count, plasma bilirubin and presence of vWF multimers in plasma. In HUS, treatment for fits, hypertension and renal failure may be needed.</p>

                        <p>These are characterized by a prolonged bleeding time with normal platelet count and disordered platelet aggregation. Inherited disorders are rare and present with bruising/excessive bleeding after surgery or injury in childhood. The most common acquired cause is aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.</p>
