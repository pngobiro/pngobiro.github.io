                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Sickle cell disease (homozygous sickle cell anaemia) is a chronic haemolytic anaemia caused by a point mutation in the $\beta$-globin gene causing substitution of valine for glutamic acid in the sixth position of the $\beta$-globin chain. This causes insolubility of Hb S in its deoxygenated state. The insoluble chains crystallize in the red cells causing sickling (Fig.17.1) and vascular occlusion. The disease is most common in Africans ($1:5$ West Africans are carriers - they have some protection against falciparum malaria). The mutant gene also occurs in other parts of the world where malaria is or was prevalent, e.g. the Middle East, Far East and the Indian subcontinent.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Clinical features</h3>
                        <p>These resemble those of other chronic haemolytic anaemias, punctuated with different types of crisis.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Vaso-occlusive with blockage of small vessels is caused by increased sickling; common precipitants are infection, dehydration, acidosis and deoxygenation. Abdominal pain is caused by infarction affecting abdominal organs; bone pain may occur in the back, pelvis, ribs and long bones. Infarction may affect the central nervous system-causing a stroke or fits-lungs, spleen or kidneys. In children the 'hand-foot syndrome' is caused by infarction of the metaphyses of the small bones.</li>
                            <li>Visceral sequestration crisis is caused by sickling with pooling of red cells in the liver, spleen or lungs. Sequestration in the lungs is partly responsible for the acute chest syndrome, though infarction and infection contribute.</li>
                            <li>Aplastic crisis occurs following infection by B19 parvovirus. This causes temporary arrest of erythropoiesis which in healthy individuals is of no consequence but in patients with reduced red cell survival, such as Hb SS, can rapidly cause severe anaemia requiring blood transfusion.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Increased susceptibility to infection. Splenic function is reduced because infarction leads to autosplenectomy in severe cases in infancy. Pneumococcal infections may lead to pneumonia and meningitis. Infarction of intestinal mucosa predisposes to Salmonella infection and osteomyelitis may result.</li>
                            <li>Other clinical features include pigment gallstones with cholecystitis, chronic leg ulcers, avascular necrosis of the femoral and humeral heads (Fig. 17.2) or other bones, cardiomyopathy, proliferative retinopathy and renal papillary necrosis (leading to polyuria, failure to concentrate urine and tendency to dehydration).</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Laboratory features</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Haemoglobin level is $7-9 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dL}$ but symptoms of anaemia are usually mild (the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ dissociation curve of Hb S is shifted to the right).</li>
                            <li>Blood film shows sickle cells, target cells and often features of splenic atrophy (see Fig.17.1).</li>
                            <li>Screening tests for sickling demonstrate increased turbidity of the blood after deoxygenation (e.g. with dithionate or $\mathrm{Na}_{2}\mathrm{HPO}_{4}$). Haemoglobin electrophoresis (Fig. 17.5) shows haemoglobin with an abnormal migration. In Hb SS there is absence of Hb A. Hb F level is usually mildly raised ($5-10\%$).</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Treatment</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>General—avoid known precipitants of sickle cell crisis, especially dehydration and infections. Give folic acid, pneumococcal, HIB and meningococcal vaccination and oral penicillin indefinitely to compensate for splenic atrophy.</li>
                            <li>Vaso-occlusive crisis is treated with hydration, usually intravenous normal saline, analgesia (e.g. diamorphine subcutaneous infusion); $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ if there is hypoxia; antibiotics if there is infection.</li>
                            <li>Red cell transfusion for severe anaemia (sequestration or aplastic crisis) or as a 3-6-month programme of therapy for patients with frequently recurring crises or for 2-3 years following central nervous system crisis.</li>
                            <li>Severe sickling or sequestration crisis (e.g. 'chest syndrome' and stroke) is treated acutely with exchange transfusion to reduce Hb S levels to &lt;30%. Pregnant patients and those undergoing general anaesthesia may need transfusion to reduce Hb S levels to &lt;30%.</li>
                            <li>Oral hydroxyurea ($20-40 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{day}$) reduces both the frequency and duration of sickle cell crisis. Although its precise mode of action is not known, it increases Hb F production, decreases intracellular Hb S concentration by increasing MCV, and inhibits prothrombotic interactions between sickle cells and the endothelium.</li>
                            <li>Bone marrow transplantation in selected cases.</li>
                            <li>Joint replacement surgery may be required for avascular necrosis (hips and shoulder).</li>
                            <li>Iron chelation therapy for patients with iron overload caused by multiple transfusions.</li>
                        </ul>
