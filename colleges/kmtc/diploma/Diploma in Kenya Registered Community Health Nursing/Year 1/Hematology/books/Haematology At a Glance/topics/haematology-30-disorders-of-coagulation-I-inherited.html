The disease is more frequent than haemophilia A; males and females are affected equally.</p>

There is poor correlation between factor XI levels and symptoms. It is generally mild, but severe spontaneous and postsurgical bleeding may occur. Congenital deficiencies of factor II, V, VII, X and XIII are rare and usually cause mild bleeding disorders. Factor XII deficiency prolongs the APTT but does not cause clinical symptoms. Fibrinogen deficiency occurs as a moderately severe autosomal recessive disorder. Dysfibrinogenaemia (presence of a functionally abnormal molecule) is both a rare autosomal dominant disorder and a more common acquired disorder (liver disease, malignancy and systemic lupus erythematosus).</p>
