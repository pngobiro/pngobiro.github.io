                        <p>Platelets have a large surface area onto which coagulation factors are absorbed. Glycoproteins GPIb and IIb/IIIa allow attachment of platelets to vWF (Fig. 28.3) and hence to endothelium. Collagen exposure and thrombin promote platelet aggregation and the platelet release reaction whereby platelets release their granule contents. Adenosine diphosphate (ADP) promotes platelet aggregation to form a primary haemostatic plug. Platelet prostaglandin synthesis is activated to form thromboxane A<sub>2</sub> which potentiates the platelet release reaction, promotes platelet aggregation and also has vasoconstrictor activity. Fibrin, produced by blood coagulation, binds to vWF and enmeshes the platelets to form a stable haemostatic plug. Activated platelets promote coagulation, as they have exposed phospholipid binding sites (the prothrombinase complex) which are involved in activation of factor X and of prothrombin to thrombin in the coagulation cascade.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The proteins of the coagulation cascade are proenzymes (serine proteases) and procofactors which are activated sequentially (Fig. 28.2). The cascade has been divided on the basis of laboratory tests into intrinsic, extrinsic and common pathways. This division is useful in understanding results of in vitro coagulation tests. In vivo, however, these pathways are closely interlinked. Coagulation begins when tissue factor activated on the surface of injured cells binds and activates factor VII; the complex activates factor IX which, with cofactor VIII, activates factor X to Xa.</p>
                        <p>Platelets accelerate the coagulation process by providing membrane phospholipid. The complex of Xa and Va, activated from cofactor V by thrombin, acts on prothrombin (factor II) to generate thrombin. Thrombin then converts fibrinogen into fibrin monomers, with release of fibrinopeptides A and B. The monomers combine to form a fibrin polymer clot. Factor XIII crosslinks the polymer to form a more stable clot.</p>
                        <p>Thrombin has a number of key roles in the coagulation process.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>It converts plasma fibrinogen into fibrin.</li>
                            <li>It amplifies coagulation by: (i) activating factor XI which increases IXa production; (ii) cleaving factor VIII from its carrier molecule vWF to activate it and augment Xa production; and (iii) activating factor V to factor Va.</li>
                            <li>It activates factor XIII to factor XIIIa, which stabilizes the fibrin clot.</li>
                            <li>It potentiates platelet aggregation.</li>
                            <li>It binds to thrombomodulin on the endothelial cell surface to form a complex which activates protein C, which is involved in regulating coagulation.</li>

Thrombin is generated from prothrombin by the action of Xa-Va complex and this leads to fibrin formation. Thrombin also: (i) activates FXI leading to increased FIXa production; (ii) cleaves FVIII from its carrier protein vWF activating FVIII; (iii) activates FV to FVa; and (iv) activates FXIII to XIIIa, which stabilizes the fibrin clot.

                        <p>Individual coagulation factors can be assayed by functional tests or immunological methods. Platelet function tests include tests of platelet aggregation with different agonists, platelet adhesion and assessment of platelet granule contents. Tests for abnormalities leading to thrombosis (thrombophilia) are described in Chapter 32.</p>
