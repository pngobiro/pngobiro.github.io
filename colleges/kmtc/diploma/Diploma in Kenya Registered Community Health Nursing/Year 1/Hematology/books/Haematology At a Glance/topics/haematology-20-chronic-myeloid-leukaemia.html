                        <p>This is a clonal myeloproliferative disorder characterized by an increase in neutrophils and their precursors in the peripheral blood with increased cellularity of the marrow as a result of an excess of granulocyte precursors. The leukaemic cells of &gt;95% of patients have a reciprocal translocation between the long arms of chromosomes 9 and 22, t(9;22). The derived chromosome 22 is termed the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome (Fig. 20.1). The disease usually transforms from a relatively stable chronic phase to an acute leukaemia phase (blast transformation).</p>

                        <p>Aetiology is unknown. Exposure to ionizing radiation is a risk factor. The ABL oncogene is translocated from chromosome 9 into the breakpoint cluster region (BCR) on chromosome 22 to form the BCR-ABL fusion gene (see Fig.20.1) This fusion gene encodes a 210-kDa protein with greatly increased tyrosine kinase activity. The disease is of stem cell origin as the Ph chromosome is present in erythroid, granulocytic, megakaryocytic and T-lymphoid precursors. Rare cases show variant translocations, or are Ph-negative but show the BCR-ABL fusion gene. The Ph chromosome abnormality may also occur in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL; see Chapter 22).</p>

                            <figcaption>Fig.20.1 The Philadelphia chromosome is an abnormal chromosome 22 caused by translocation of part of long arm (q) of chromosome 22 to chromosome 9, and reciprocal translocation of part of chromosome 9, including the ABL oncogene, to a specific breakpoint cluster region (BCR) of chromosome 22. A fusion gene results on the derived chromosome 22 which leads to the synthesis of an abnormal protein with tyrosine protein kinase activity that is much greater than that of the normal ABL protein.</figcaption>

                        <p>Patients are typically well during the 'chronic phase'. Main cause of death is transformation into acute leukaemia (Fig. 20.3) (80% AML, 20% ALL, with a proportion showing a mixed blast cell population), which may occur at any stage, even at presentation. Median survival is currently about 4 years. Staging to predict prognosis has been attempted using age, spleen size, blood blast cell and platelet counts. There may be an accelerated phase in which anaemia, thrombocytopenia, splenic enlargement and marrow fibrosis occur. Transformation is usually accompanied by additional morphological and chromosome abnormalities.</p>

                            <li>$\alpha$-interferon (IFN) may also control the white cell count and may delay onset of acute transformation, prolonging overall survival by 1-2 years.

Combination therapies, e.g. IFN + cytosine arabinoside, may be more effective than IFN alone.</li>

                            <li>Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) before the age of 50 from an HLA matching sibling offers a 70% chance of cure in chronic phase but 30% or less once acceleration has occurred. HLA-matched unrelated donor (MUD) SCT is less successful in curing the disease because of higher morbidity and mortality. Transfusion of donor lymphocytes may be valuable in eliminating BCR-ABL-positive cells in case of relapse post-SCT.</li>
                            <li>A specific inhibitor (STI 571) of the tyrosine kinase encoded by BCR-ABL causes the marrow to become Ph negative in a high proportion of cases and may improve the treatment of CML.</li>
