                        <p>Inflammation commonly causes a neutrophil leucocytosis (neutrophilia) (Table 8.1). In addition, neutrophil granules may stain intensely (toxic granulation) and Doehle bodies (cytoplasmic RNA) may be present. A leukaemoid reaction is a profound reactive neutrophilia in which granulocyte precursors (e.g. myelocytes) also appear in the blood. Neutropenia (reduced number of circulating neutrophils; Table 8.2) increases susceptibility to infection, particularly bacterial. The normal neutrophil count is lower in black and Middle Eastern subjects than white people; this has no clinical consequences. Causes of eosinophilia are listed in Table 8.3. Basophilia (increase in blood basophils to &gt;0.1 x 10<sup>9</sup>/L) is uncommon but occurs in myeloproliferative disorders. Monocytosis (increase in circulating monocytes to &gt;1.0 x 10<sup>9</sup>/L) may occur in chronic infections (bacterial and protozoal, particularly in patients who cannot mount a neutrophil response), in malignancy and in myelodysplasia (see Chapter 21). Disorders of neutrophil function may be congenital or acquired and affect neutrophil interaction with immunoglobulin/complement, migration, phagocytosis and microbicidal activity. Chronic granulomatous disease is a rare inherited (X-linked) condition in which the cells are able to phagocytose but not kill. Acquired defects occur more commonly for example in diabetes, myelodysplasia and corticosteroid therapy.</p>

                        <p>Hereditary deficiencies of enzymes required for glycolipid metabolism lead to the accumulation of ceramide components in various cells and tissues. Gaucher's disease is the most common (autosomal recessive) and is caused by mutations in the gene encoding glucocerebrosidase. Type I (most common) occurs especially among Ashkenazic Jews (age of presentation from infancy to middle age) and does not involve the central nervous system (CNS); types II and III are rarer and do involve the CNS. Clinical and haematological features result from accumulation of Gaucher's cells (Fig. 8.1) in the spleen, liver, skeleton, marrow and in types II and III in the CNS. Treatment is principally by enzyme replacement therapy.</p>

Langerhans' cells are macrophages present in epidermis, spleen, thymus, bone, lymph nodes and mucosal surfaces. Langerhans' cell histiocytosis (LCH) is a single organ/system or multisystem disease occurring principally in childhood (&lt;10 years), with an incidence of 2-5 cases/million population. Clinical features include skin rash, bone pain/swelling, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, endocrine changes (e.g. diabetes insipidus as a result of posterior pituitary involvement). Malignant histiocyte disorders include monocytic variants of acute leukaemia (see Chapter 22) and some types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (see Chapter 26).</p>

                        <p>Lymphocytosis occurs in viral infections, some bacterial infections (e.g. pertussis) and in lymphoid neoplasia.</p>
                        <p>Lymphopenia (reduction in circulating lymphocytes to &lt;1.5 x 10<sup>9</sup>/L) occurs in viral infection (e.g. HIV), lymphoma, connective tissue disease, and severe bone marrow failure.</p>
                        <p>Infectious mononucleosis (glandular fever) is caused by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection of B lymphocytes. Atypical circulating lymphocytes are reactive T cells. Cytomegalovirus, other viruses and toxoplasma infections cause a similar blood picture (Fig. 8.2). Clinical features include onset usually in young adults (age 15-40 years), sore throat, lymphadenopathy, fever, morbilliform rash—particularly following treatment with amoxicillin—and jaundice, hepatomegaly and tender splenomegaly in a minority. Complications include autoimmune thrombocytopenia and/or haemolytic anaemia, myocarditis, encephalitis, hepatitis and postviral fatigue syndrome. The Paul-Bunnell test, modified as the monospot slide test, detects heterophile antibodies (antibodies against cells of a different species). These agglutinate sheep red blood cells and, unlike those present in normal people, are not absorbed by guinea-pig kidney cells but are absorbed by ox red blood cells. The test is positive from 1 week after infection and persists for up to 2 months. Viral culture from sputum/saliva and specific IgM and IgG antibody tests against EBV nuclear and capsular antigens are sometimes useful in diagnosis.</p>

                        <p>HIV-1 is a retrovirus transmitted by semen, blood and other body fluids, which infects and kills CD4+ T lymphocytes to cause immune suppression. A non-specific febrile illness with lymphadenopathy often marks initial infection. A proportion of patients progress to AIDS with a CD4 count &lt;0.2 x 10<sup>9</sup>/L. Clinical manifestations include recurring infections, anaemia and lymphadenopathy. Treatment may also induce anaemia; e.g. azidothymidine (AZT) and cotrimoxazole both cause megaloblastic change. Thrombocytopenia, lymphopenia and neutropenia (immune or caused by marrow failure or drug therapy) are also frequent. The bone marrow is usually normo- or hyper-cellular, with dysplastic features and an increase in plasma cells. There is an increased risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma and of Kaposi's sarcoma.</p>
