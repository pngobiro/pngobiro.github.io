Haematology at a Glance

\section*{About the At a Glance series}

The series contains a distillation of wisdom and teaching put together by experts with the help of student and academic reviewers. The reviews are carried out at two different stages, to help guide the authors to what can be edited out and what needs better explanation. The focus is what is required by students to pass their exams, but essential background information is included to facilitate understanding (rather than rote learning).

This book is part of the best-selling At a Glance series, which has become famous for its attractive layout, concise text and clear conceptual diagrams. We welcome feedback, so please write to us with your comments. Our address is: Medical Editorial Department, Blackwell Science Ltd, Osney Mead, Oxford OX2 0EL, UK.

\section*{Preface}

With the ever-increasing complexity of the medical undergraduate curriculum, we feel that there is a need for a concise introduction to clinical and laboratory haematology for medical students. The At a Glance format has allowed us to divide the subject into easily digestible slices or bytes of information.

We have tried to emphasize the importance of basic scientific and clinical mechanisms, and common diseases as opposed to rare syndromes. The clinical features and laboratory findings are summarized and illustrated; treatment is briefly outlined.

This book is intended for medical students, but will be
useful to anyone who needs a concise and up-to-date introduction to haematology, for example nurses, medical laboratory scientists and those in professions supplementary to medicine.

We particularly wish to thank June Elliott who has patiently word-processed the manuscript through many revisions and Jonathan Rowley and his colleagues at Blackwell Science.

\section*{1 Haemopoiesis: physiology and pathology}

\section*{Definition and sites}

Haemopoiesis is the process whereby blood cells are made. The yolk sac, and later the liver and spleen, are important in fetal life but after birth normal haemopoiesis is restricted to the bone marrow. Infants have haemopoietic marrow in all bones but in adults it is in the central skeleton and proximal ends of long bones (normal fat to haemopoietic tissue ratio of about 50:50) (Fig. 1.1). Expansion of haemopoiesis down the long bones may occur, e.g. in leukaemias and chronic haemolytic anaemias. The liver and spleen can resume extramedullary haemopoiesis when there is marrow replacement, e.g. in myelofibrosis, or excessive demand, e.g. in severe haemolytic anaemias.

\section*{Stem cell and progenitor cells}

A common primitive stem cell in the marrow has the capacity to self replicate, proliferate and differentiate to increasingly specialized progenitor cells which, after many cell divisions within the marrow, form mature cells (red cells, granulocytes, monocytes, platelets and lymphocytes) of the peripheral blood (Fig. 1.2). The earliest recognizable red cell precursor is a pronormoblast and the earliest recognizable granulocyte or monocyte precursor is a myeloblast. An early lineage division is between progenitors for lymphoid and myeloid cells. Stem and progenitor cells cannot be recognized morphologically; they resemble lymphocytes. Progenitor cells can be detected by special in vitro assays in which they form colonies (e.g. colony forming units for granulocytes and monocytes, CFU-GM, or for red cells, BFU-E and CFU-E). Stem and progenitor cells also circulate in the peripheral blood. The stromal cells of the marrow (fibroblasts, endothelial cells, macrophages, fat cells) have adhesion molecules which react with corresponding ligands on the stem cells and maintain their viability.

\section*{Growth factors}

Haemopoiesis is regulated by growth factors (GFs) (Table 1.1) which usually act in synergy with each other. These are glycoproteins produced by stromal cells, T lymphocytes, the liver and, for erythropoietin, the kidney. While some GFs act mainly on receptors on the surface of primitive cells, others act on later cells already committed to a particular lineage. They also affect the function of mature cells. Growth factors inhibit apoptosis (programmed cell death) of their target cells. Growth factors in clinical use include erythropoietin (EPO), granulocyte colonystimulating factor (G-CSF), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). Thrombopoietin is under trial.

\section*{Signal transduction}

The binding of a GF with its surface receptor on the haemopoietic cell activates a complex series of biochemical reactions by which a message is transmitted into the nucleus (Fig. 1.3). The pathways involve sequential phosphorylation of substrates by protein kinases. The signal activates transcription factors which in turn activate or inhibit gene transcription. The signal may activate pathways which cause the cell to enter cell cycle (replicate), differentiate, maintain viability (inhibition of apoptosis) or become functionally active (e.g. enhancement of cell killing by neutrophils).

\section*{Assessment of haemopoiesis}

Haemopoiesis can be assessed clinically by performing a full blood count on peripheral blood (see Table 3.1). Bone marrow aspiration also allows assessment of the later stages of maturation of haemopoietic cells (Fig. 1.4a-f; see Chapter 7 for indications). Trephine biopsy provides a core of bone and bone marrow to show architecture.

\section*{2 Normal blood cells I: Red cells and platelets}

\section*{Peripheral blood cells}

Normal peripheral blood contains mainly mature cells which do not undergo further division.

\section*{Red cells (erythrocytes)}

Red cells contain haemoglobin ( Hb ) which allows them to carry oxygen ( $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ ) and carbon dioxide ( $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ ). Haemoglobin is composed of four polypeptide globin chains each with an iron containing haem molecule (Fig. 2.1). Embryonic haemoglobins (Portland, Gower I and II) are present in early fetal life, fetal haemoglobin ( Hb F ) dominates by late fetal life (Table 2.1). A switch occurs at 3-6 months in the neonatal period to normal adult haemoglobin ( Hb A ) (Fig. 2.2). The ability of haemoglobin to bind $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ is measured as the haemoglobin- $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ dissociation curve. Raised concentrations of $2,3-\mathrm{DPG}, \mathrm{H}^{+}$ions or $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ decrease $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ affinity, allowing more $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ delivery to tissues (Fig. 2.3). Hb F has a higher, and sickle $\mathrm{Hb}(\mathrm{Hb} \mathrm{S})$ a lower $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ affinity than Hb A . Erythropoietin controls the production of red cells. It is produced in the peritubular complex of the kidney ( $90 \%$ ), liver and other organs. Erythropoietin stimulates mixed lineage and red cell progenitors as well as pronormoblasts and early erythroblasts to proliferate, differentiate and produce haemoglobin (Table 2.2). Erythropoietin secretion is stimulated by reduced $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ supply to the kidney receptor (see Chapter 27, Table 27.1).

The glycolytic pathway (Fig. 2.4) is the main source of energy (ATP) required to maintain red cell shape and deformability. The hexose monophosphate 'shunt' pathway provides the main source of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH), which maintains reduced glutathione (GSH) and protects haemoglobin and

\caption{Fig. 2.1 Normal adult haemoglobin contains four globin (polypeptide) chains ( $\alpha_{1} \alpha_{2}, \beta_{1} \beta_{2}$ ), each with its own haem molecule. These chains undergo conformational change and move with respect to each other when binding $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{CO}_{2} .2,3$ diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG) binds between the $\beta$ chains to reduce affinity for $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ and allow $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ release to the tissues.}
\end{figure}
the membrane proteins against oxidant damage. Mature red cells have no nucleus, ribosomes or mitochondria. They survive for about 120 days and are removed by macrophages of the reticuloendothelial system (Chapter 4).

The red cell membrane (Fig. 2.5) is a bipolar lipid layer which anchors surface antigens. It has a protein skeleton (spectrin, actin, protein 4.1 and ankyrin) which maintains the red cell's biconcave shape and deformability.

Developing red cells in the marrow (erythroblasts) are nucleated (see Fig. 1.4); the nucleus condenses with maturation, to be extruded prior to red cell release into the circulation. Reticulocytes (Fig. 2.6) are young non-nucleated red cells which retain RNA (stainable by supravital stains). They increase in number following acute haemorrhage, treatment of haematinic deficiency and in haemolytic anaemias. Ten to fifteen percent of developing erythroblasts die within the marrow without producing mature red cells. This 'ineffective erythropoiesis' is increased in, for example, thalassaemia major, myelofibrosis and megaloblastic anaemia.

marrow. Platelets break off from the megakaryocyte cytoplasm and enter the peripheral blood. Thrombopoietin is a hormone produced mainly in the liver which stimulates megakaryocyte and platelet production. Both thrombopoietin and erythropoietin have some action on mixed lineage progenitors so that although their predominant action is on platelets and red cells, respectively, they also have some stimulatory action on both lineages. Thrombopoietin increases platelet production by increasing differentiation of stem cells into megakaryocytes, increasing megakaryocyte numbers and also by increasing the number of divisions undertaken by megakaryocyte nuclei (ploidy). Platelets (Fig. 2.7) are non-nucleated cells required for normal haemostasis (see Chapter 28). They circulate for 6-8 days and are then destroyed in the spleen or the pulmonary vascular bed. Their lifespan is reduced when there is increased platelet consumption (thrombosis, infection and splenic enlargement). Platelets appear in peripheral blood films as granular basophilic forms with a mean diameter of $1-2 \mu \mathrm{~m}$. The normal concentration is $140-400 \times 10^{9} / \mathrm{L}$; a lower number is found in neonates ( $100-300 \times 109 / \mathrm{L}$ ) and among certain racial populations, e.g. in Southern Europe or the Middle East.

thrombasthenia) are important in adhesion and aggregation. The plasma membrane and canalicular system provides a large reactive surface on which plasma coagulation factors are absorbed and activated. Aspirin and sulphinpyrazone inhibit platelet function by inhibiting cyclo-oxygenase. Prostacyclin from endothelial cells and dipyridamole inhibit the action of thromboxane $\mathrm{A}_{2}$.

\section*{3 Normal blood cells II: Granulocytes}

Granulocyte and monocyte production occurs in the bone marrow and is controlled by growth factors (see Table 1.1). External stimuli (e.g. infection, fever, inflammation, allergy, trauma) act on cytokine networks to increase production of these growth factors. The cytokines interleukin-1 and tumour necrosis factor (TNF) form part of this complex network. The earliest recognizable granulocyte precursors in the marrow are promyelocytes. These undergo further division and maturation into myelocytes, metamyelocytes and, finally, granulocytes (neutrophils, eosinophils and basophils). Primary granules, present in promyelocytes, contain lysosomal enzymes (e.g. peroxidase, hydrolases). Secondary granules containing enzymes (peroxidase, lysosyme, alkaline phosphatase and lactoferrin) appear later. Basophil granules also contain histamine and heparin.

\section*{Function of white cells}

The primary function of white cells is to protect the body against infection. They work closely with protein components of the immune response, immunoglobulins and complement. They also produce cytokines which augment function or stimulate proliferation of other cells. Neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils and monocytes are all phagocytes; they ingest and destroy pathogens and cell debris. Phagocytes are attracted to bacteria at the site of inflammation by chemotactic substances released from damaged tissues or by complement components. Opsonization is the coating of cells or foreign particles by immunoglobulin or complement; this aids phagocytosis (engulfment) because phagocytes have Fc and C 3 b (see below) receptors. Killing involves reduction of pH within the phagocytic vacuole, the release of granule contents and the production of antimicrobial oxidants and superoxides (the 'respiratory burst').

\section*{Neutrophils}

Neutrophils (polymorphs) (Fig. 3.1a) are usually the most numerous mature peripheral blood leucocyte. They have a short lifespan of around 10 h in the circulation (circulating pool). About 50\% of neutrophils in peripheral blood are attached to the walls of blood vessels (marginating pool). They enter tissues by migrating in response to chemotactic factors. Their mobility results from the presence of adhesion molecules on their surface which interact with the vascular endothelium. Migration, phagocytosis and killing are energy-dependent functions. Neutrophil function tests separately assess chemotaxis/migration, phagocytosis,

degranulation and the metablolic process involved in killing.

\section*{Eosinophils}

Eosinophils have similar kinetics of production, differentiation and circulation to neutrophils; the growth factor IL- 5 is important in regulating their production. They have a characteristic bi-lobed nucleus (Fig. 3.1b) and red-orange staining granules. They are particularly important in the response to parasitic and allergic diseases. Release of their granule contents onto larger pathogens (e.g. helminths) allows their destruction and subsequent phagocytosis. Histamine is an important component of their granules.

\section*{Basophils}

Basophils are related to small darkly staining cells in the bone marrow and tissues (mast cells) and both are derived from granulocyte precursors in the bone marrow. They are the least numerous of peripheral blood leucocytes and have characteristic large dark purple granules which may obscure the nucleus (Fig. 3.1c). The granule contents include histamine and heparin and are released following binding of IgE to surface receptors. They play an important part in immediate hypersensitivity reactions. Mast cells also have an important role in defence against allergens and parasitic pathogens.

\section*{4 Normal blood cells III: Monocytes and the reticuloendothelial system}

\section*{Monocytes}

Monocytes (Fig. 4.1) circulate for $20-40 \mathrm{~h}$ and then enter tissues as tissue macrophages where they mature and carry

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_09_3fc5c60a4aba104b7634g-017.jpg?height=444&width=846&top_left_y=567&top_left_x=132}

\end{figure}
out their principal functions. Within tissues they survive for many days, possibly months. They have variable morphology in peripheral blood, but are mononuclear, have greyish cytoplasm with vacuoles and small granules. Within tissues, they often have long cytoplasmic projections allowing them to communicate widely with other cells.

\section*{Reticuloendothelial system}

This is used to describe monocyte derived cells (Fig. 4.2) which are distributed throughout the body in multiple organs and tissues. The system includes Kupffer's cells in the liver, alveolar macrophages in the lung, mesangial cells in the kidney, microglial cells in the brain and macrophages within the bone marrow, spleen, lymph nodes, skin and serosal surfaces. The principal functions of the reticuloendothelial system are to:
- phagocytose and destroy pathogens and cellular debris;

- process and present antigens to lymphoid cells (the antigen presenting cells react principally with T cells with whom they 'interdigitate' in lymph nodes, spleen, thymus, bone marrow and tissues);
- produce cytokines (e.g. IL-1) which regulate and participate within cytokine and growth factor networks governing haemopoiesis, inflammation and cellular responses.

The cells of the reticuloendothelial system (RES) are particularly localized in tissues which may come into contact with external allergens or pathogens. The main organs of the RES allow its cells to communicate with lymphoid cells, and include the liver, spleen, lymph nodes, bone marrow, thymus and intestinal tract associated lymphoid

tissue. The anatomy of lymph nodes and spleen are illustrated in Figs 4.3 and 4.4. An additional function of the spleen is to cause blood to be filtered from the arteriolar circulation-the white pulp-through the endothelial meshwork of the red pulp to the sinuses of the venous circulation. This filtration process allows removal of unwanted particulate matter (e.g. opsonized bacteria) as well as removal of effete cells or of unwanted material from within deformable red cells (e.g. nuclear remnants, haemosiderin granules).

\section*{5 Normal blood cells IV: Lymphocytes}

Lymphocytes are an essential component of the immune response and are derived from haemopoietic stem cells. A common lymphoid stem cell undergoes differentiation and proliferation to give rise to B cells, which mediate humoral or antibody-mediated immunity, and T cells (processed in the thymus), mediating cell-mediated immunity (see Fig. 1.1). Mature lymphocytes appear as small mononuclear cells which have scanty blue cytoplasm (Fig. 5.1). The majority of peripheral blood lymphocytes ( $70 \%$ ) are T cells, which typically have more cytoplasm than B cells and may contain granules.

Lymphocyte maturation occurs principally in bone marrow for B cells and in the thymus for T cells but also involves the lymph nodes, liver, spleen and other parts of the reticuloendothelial system. The antigens expressed on the surface of a cell can be recognized in the laboratory by reaction with monoclonal antibody reagents. The cluster of differentiation (CD) nomenclature system has evolved as a means of classifying these antigens. Although most frequently applied to lymphocytes, it is applicable to all haemopoietic cells (see Appendix I). Lymphocytes have the longest lifespan of any leucocyte, and some (e.g. 'memory' $B$ cells) may live for many years.

\section*{Immune response}

Specificity of the immune response derives from amplification of antigen-selected $T$ and $B$ cells. The $T$ cell receptor (TCR) on T cells and surface membrane immunoglobulin (sIg) on B cells are molecules which have a variable and a constant portion. The variability ensures that a specific antigen is recognized by a lymphocyte with a matching variable region. The genetic mechanisms required to generate the required diversity are common to both T and $B$ cells (Fig. 5.2). They involve rearrangement of variable, joining, diversity and constant region genes to generate genes coding for surface receptors (Ig or TCR) capable of reacting specifically with an enormous array of antigens.

The immune response (Fig. 5.3) involves interaction between T cells, B cells and antigen presenting cells (APCs). Mature T cells are of three main types: helper cells expressing the CD4 antigen; suppressor cells expressing CD8; and cytotoxic cells expressing CD8. Developing T cells are 'educated' in the thymus only to react to foreign antigens, and to develop tolerance to self human leucocyte antigens (HLA). If antigen is presented by an APC alongside the HLA (major histocompatability complex, MHC class II) to a $\mathrm{CD} 4+\mathrm{T}$ cell, T cell activation and proliferation result. $\mathrm{CD} 8^{+}$cytotoxic cells require the antigen to be presented to them alongside MHC class I molecules. B cells can also interact directly with antigen. Adhesion molecules mediate these cellular interactions. Reaction between
antigen and appropriate receptor (sIg or TCR) leads to cellular proliferation and differentiation. This process is augmented by cytokines released by APCs (e.g. IL-6, IL-7) and by interacting $T$ cells (e.g. IL-2) which stimulate $T$ and $B$ cell proliferation. $\mathrm{CD} 8^{+}$suppressor T cells have an important role in regulating B cell proliferation. $\mathrm{CD} 8+$ cytotoxic T cells are capable of directly lysing APCs which present appropriate antigen in association with MHC class I molecules.

\section*{Natural killer cells}

Natural killer cells are neither T nor B cells, though are often $\mathrm{CD} 8^{+}$. They characteristically have prominent granules and are often large granular lymphocytes. These cells are not governed by MHC restriction and can kill target cells by direct adhesion. They can also bind to a target cell which has antibody bound to it (antibody-dependent cellmediated cytotoxicity, ADCC).

\section*{Immunoglobulins}

These are gammaglobulins produced by plasma cells. There are five main groups: IgG, IgM, IgA, IgD and IgE. Each is composed of light and heavy chains, and each chain is made up of variable, joining and constant regions (Fig. 5.4).

\section*{Complement}

This is a group of plasma proteins and cell surface receptors which, if activated, interact with cellular and humoral elements in the inflammatory response (Fig. 5.5). The complete molecule is capable of direct lysis of cell membranes and of pathogens sensitized by antibody. The C3b component coats cells making them sensitive to phagocytosis by macrophages. C3a and C5a may also activate chemotaxis by phagocytes and activate mast cells and basophils to release mediators of inflammation.

Fig. 5.2 Immunoglobulin gene rearrangement and transcription. Immunoglobulin heavy chain genes occur as segments for variable (V), diversity (D), joining (J) and constant (C) regions. The class of the immunoglobulin depends on which of the constant region genes ( $\mu, \delta, \gamma, \alpha, \varepsilon$ ) is transcribed. The switch region ( $S$ ) allows switching between classes. Diversity occurs through variability of which V segment joins which D and which J
segment; the enzyme terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) randomly inserts new bases into D region DNA to generate additional diversity. Recombinase enzymes join up rearranged segments of DNA and intervening sequences are deleted. Similar rearrangements occur at the immunoglobulin light chain ( $\kappa$ and $\lambda$ ) and T cell receptor ( $\alpha / \beta, \gamma / \delta$ ) loci. histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecule to a $\mathrm{CD}^{+}$(helper) T cell which has an appropriate configuration of its T cell receptor, the T cell will become activated, proliferate and facilitate proliferation of appropriate $B$ cells. $B$ cells also interact with antigen presented by the APC, but to a different epitope. (b) If processed antigen linked to MHC class I molecules is presented to a cytotoxic ( $\mathrm{CD}^{+}$) T cell, it will trigger proliferation of a clone of cytotoxic T cells which will lyse the APC.

\section*{6 Clinical assessment}

\section*{History}

\section*{Anaemia}
- Symptoms: shortness of breath on exertion, tiredness, headache or angina, more marked if anaemia is severe, of rapid onset and in older subjects.
- Causes: e.g. bleeding, dietary deficiency, malabsorption, systemic illness, haemolysis, bone marrow failure, inherited conditions.

\section*{Leucopenia}
- Neutropenia, particularly if neutrophils are $<0.5 \times 10^{9} / \mathrm{L}$, frequently leads to bacterial or fungal infection in skin, mouth, throat and chest.
- Pus is lacking.
- Lymphopenia predisposes to viral infection (e.g. herpes zoster), tuberculosis.
- Infection is often atypical, caused by organisms nonpathogenic for normal individuals, rapidly progressive and difficult to treat.
- Functional defects of neutrophils and lymphocytes also predispose to infection.

\section*{Thrombocytopenia}
- Spontaneous bruising (ecchymoses) or petechiae, mucosal bleeding, e.g. epistaxis, menorrhagia. Bleeding following trauma is increased with platelets $<50 \times 109 / \mathrm{L}$. Spontaneous bleeding occurs when platelets $<10 \times 10^{9} / \mathrm{L}$.
- Functional platelet defects also predispose to bleeding.

\section*{Coagulation factor defects}
- Easy bleeding after trauma (e.g. circumcision, dental treatment); spontaneous haemorrhage in deep tissues (e.g. muscles, joints); family history.
- Acquired coagulation defects often accompanied by thrombocytopenia; spontaneous skin bleeding and excessive bleeding in response to trauma.

NB: Combination of anaemia, excessive bleeding and/or infection suggest pancytopenia caused by bone marrow failure (see Chapter 18).

\section*{Other symptoms (Fig. 6.1)}
- Weight loss, fever, pruritus and skin rash-lymphoma or myeloproliferative disorder.
- Bone pain, symptoms of hypercalcaemia (thirst, polyuria, constipation)-myeloma.
- Left hypochondrial pain-splenomegaly.
- Painless lymphadenopathy.
- Joint pains-gout caused by hyperuricaemia.

\section*{Family history}

Inherited anaemia (e.g. genetic disorders of haemoglobin), coagulation disorders (e.g. haemophilia) and certain leucocyte disorders.

\section*{Drug history}

Haemolytic anaemia in G6PD deficiency; disordered platelet function caused by aspirin; drug-induced agranulocytosis; macrocytosis of red cells caused by alcohol.

\section*{Operations}

Gastrectomy, intestinal resection.

\section*{Examination}

Includes testing of urine for protein and sugar.
- Pallor of mucous membranes, if $\mathrm{Hb}<9 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dL}$.
- Tachycardia, systolic murmur.
- Jaundice (haemolytic or megaloblastic anaemia); pigment (gallstones).
- Lymphadenopathy (generalized or localized) (Table 6.1).
- Skin changes, e.g. purpura caused by thrombocytopenia, vitiligo associated with pernicious anaemia, melanin pigmentation in iron overload, ankle ulcers in haemolytic anaemia, rashes caused by tumour infiltration.
- Nail changes (e.g. koilonychia in iron deficiency).
- Signs of infection (mouth, throat, skin, perineum, chest) associated with neutropenia.
- Mouth, e.g. angular cheilosis in iron deficiency, glossitis in $B_{12}$ or folate deficiency.
- Hepatomegaly or splenomegaly (Table 6.2).

\section*{Special investigations}

Haematological diseases are often multisystem disorders and a range of special investigations are frequently required to define the extent and stage of the disease.

Radiological investigations particularly helpful in these patients include:
- X-rays to detect evidence of infection, bone erosion, marrow expansion caused by extramedullary haemopoiesis.
- Ultrasound to confirm presence of abdominal masses, gallstones, detect and assess size of spleen/lymph nodes,
define extent of swellings and detect blood or pus in patients with excessive bleeding or atypical infection, to detect deep vein thrombosis.
- Computed tomography (CT) scan to detect infection (e.g. lungs), lymphadenopathy, abdominal organ enlargement, bleeding and thrombosis.
- Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanning is a sensitive way of detecting bone damage, e.g. in sickle cell anaemia, myeloma or deep soft-tissue lesions.
- Endoscopy often required in the gastrointestinal investigation of iron deficiency anaemia.
- Others, e.g. electrocardiogram (ECG), echocardiogram.

Nuclear medicine studies allow study of organ function, and tests useful to haematologists include the following.
- Isotope labelling of cells followed by scanning, e.g. autologous red cells can be labelled with radioactive chronium/technetium, reinjected and their lifespan measured,

\section*{7 Laboratory assessment}

\section*{Routine tests}

\section*{Full blood count (FBC) (see Table 3.1)}

Blood sample in sequestrene (ethylenediaminetetraacetate, EDTA) anticoagulant tested by an automated analyser. Analysers provide the following.
- Haemoglobin concentration, haematocrit, red cell count.
- Red cell indices (mean cell volume, MCV; mean cell haemoglobin, MCH) (Table 7.1).
- White cell count.
- Differential white cell count (three-part: neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes; or five-part to include eosinophils and basophils). White cells are distinguished by use of biochemical staining reactions, light absorbance and scatter, and internal conductivity.
- Platelet count and size.
- Analysers increasingly provide automated reticulocyte counts, enumerate immature platelets ('platelet reticulocytes') and assess intra-erythrocyte haemoglobinization.

\section*{Blood film}

Blood film is used to assess red cell size/shape; white cell appearance and differential; abnormal cells; platelet size and morphology; detection of parasites, e.g. malaria.
- The film may suggest a diagnosis, e.g. type of haemolytic anaemia, presence of malaria, leukaemia, myelodysplasia. Reticulocyte count (normal $0.5-3.5 \%$ ) assesses bone marrow response to anaemia; raised in haemolysis, after haemorrhage, and in response to haematinic therapy.

\section*{Special laboratory tests}

Investigations of haemolytic anaemia, haemoglobin disorders, haematinic deficiency, coagulation disorders and malignant diseases are discussed in the relevant chapters.

\section*{Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)}

This measures the rate of fall of a column of red cells in plasma in 1 h . It is largely determined by plasma concentrations of proteins, especially fibrinogen and globulins. It is raised in anaemia. Normal range rises with age. A raised ESR is a non-specific indicator of an acute phase response and is of value in monitoring disease activity (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis). A raised ESR occurs in inflammatory disorders, infections, malignancy, myeloma, anaemia and pregnancy. The plasma viscosity gives comparable information and is increasingly favoured as it can be easily automated. C-reactive protein (CRP) is raised in an acute phase response and is valuable in monitoring this. Whole blood viscosity is also influenced by the cell counts, and is therefore raised when the red cell count (erythrocrit), white cells count (leucocrit) or platelet count is grossly raised.

\section*{Bone marrow aspiration and trephine biopsy}

Bone marrow aspiration is from the posterior iliac crest or sternum; indications are listed in Table 7.2. Aspirated cells and particles of marrow are spread on slides, stained by Romanowsky's stain and for iron (Perls' stain; see Fig. 1.4). Specialized tests may also be performed (Table 7.3).

}

\section*{Sophisticated tests}

\section*{Flow cytometry}

Flow cytometry (Fig. 7.1) is an automated technique whereby a population of cells is incubated with specific monoclonal antibodies which are conjugated to a fluorochrome. The labelled cells are then passed in a fluid stream across a laser light source which allows quantitative analysis of antigen expression on the cell population. The technique is important in leukaemia diagnosis and assessment of residual malignant disease.

\section*{Chromosomal analysis}

Normal individuals have 46 chromosomes: 44 autosomes ( 22 from each parent) and two sex chromosomes ( $46 \mathrm{XY}=$ male, $46 \mathrm{XX}=$ female). Chromosomal analysis is made initially by special stains of cells in division. Loss or gain of whole chromosomes, chromosome breaks and loss, inversion or translocation of a part of a chromosome can be detected. Fluorescent in situ hybridization is a sensitive technique for detecting chromosome abnormalities (Fig. 7.2) which involves the use of a fluorescent DNA probe which hybridizes selectively to a particular chromosome segment, allowing sensitive detection of deletion, translocation and duplication of that segment.

\end{table}

\section*{DNA abnormalities}

DNA abnormalities as a cause of haematological disease may be inherited or acquired (Table 7.4). Inherited haematological diseases are most commonly autosomal recessive, requiring an individual to inherit two mutant copies (alleles) of a gene (one from each parent) for expression of the disease (homozygotes). Carriers (heterozygotes) have one normal and one mutant allele and may express minor abnormalities. Autosomal dominant diseases are rarer, and require only one mutant allele for full expression of the disease. Sex-linked diseases arise if the mutant gene is on the $X$ chromosome; males, having only one $X$ chromosome, are affected whereas females are usually carriers. Acquired DNA abnormalities are frequently present in clones of malignant cell populations and serve as disease markers and clues to pathogenesis (see Chapter 19).

\section*{Molecular techniques}

These include:
- Southern blotting (Fig. 7.3) which allows assessment of deletion, rearrangement, inversion or duplication of DNA segments. Single base mutations will only be detected,

Fig. 7.3 Southern blot technique. Restriction enzymes are bacterial enzymes which recognize specific 3-6 nucleotide sequences (e.g. CCTCG) and cleave DNA whenever that sequence occurs. The fragments of DNA are separated by gel electrophoresis. DNA is then denatured to make it single-stranded and transferred by capillary action to a nylon filter. The filter is then incubated with a single stranded probe, which will hybridize to those DNA fragments with which there is base-pair homology. The Northern blot technique is a way of analysing RNA species by probe hybridization.

The template DNA is denatured and incubated with oligonucleotides (15-20 bp which hybridize specifically to sequences in template DNA and not anywhere else in the genome). The enzyme TAQ polymerase, in the presence of deoxynucleotides (dNTP), allows formation of a complete DNA chain complementary to the template sequence. This process is repeated 40 or so times. Modifications include amplifying a mRNA sequence into DNA and using nucleotides which only bind to a mutant and not a wild type DNA sequence so that only mutant sequences are amplified.}

however, if they alter the recognition sequence of a restriction enzyme.
- Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (Fig. 7.4) can be used to amplify a DNA segment which can then be sequenced or fractionated by size using gel electrophoresis. PCR can also be used to selectively amplify a particular sequence which may, for example, characterize a clone of malignant cells (minimal residual disease, see Chapter 19).
- Gene expression is studied by analysing RNA extracted from fresh cells e.g. by gel electrophoresis (Northern blot). It can be semi-quantitated by using the enzyme reverse transcriptase to generate a DNA copy and then applying a modified PCR technique.

\section*{Suspected disorders of haemostasis}

Initial screening is with platelet count, prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) and thrombin time (TT). These simple tests of the coagulation pathway are performed by automated machines (coagulometers). If a defect of platelet function is suspected, test bleeding time and platelet function. If disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is considered, measure fibrinogen level and test for fibrin degradation products. If a coagulation factor defect is suspected, assay specific clotting factors. A thrombophilia screen may be needed for patients with, or a family history of, thrombosis (see Chapter 32).

\section*{8 Benign disorders of white cells: granulocytes, monocytes, macrophages and lymphocytes}

\section*{Granulocytes and monocytes}

Inflammation commonly causes a neutrophil leucocytosis (neutrophilia) (Table 8.1). In addition, neutrophil granules may stain intensely (toxic granulation) and Doehle bodies (cytoplasmic RNA) may be present.A leukaemoid reaction is a profound reactive neutrophilia in which granulocyte precursors (e.g. myelocytes) also appear in the blood. Neutropenia (reduced number of circulating neutrophils; Table 8.2) increases susceptibility to infection, particularly bacterial. The normal neutrophil count is lower in black and Middle Eastern subjects than white people; this has no clinical consequences. Causes of eosinophilia are listed in Table 8.3. Basophilia (increase in blood basophils to $>0.1 \times 10^{9} / \mathrm{L}$ ) is uncommon but occurs in myeloproliferative disorders. Monocytosis (increase in circulating monocytes to $>1.0 \times 109 / \mathrm{L}$ ) may occur in chronic infections (bacterial and protozoal, particularly in patients who cannot mount a neutrophil response), in malignancy and in myelodysplasia (see Chapter 21). Disorders of neutrophil function may be congenital or acquired and affect neutrophil interaction with immunoglobulin/complement, migration, phagocytosis and microbicidal activity. Chronic granulomatous disease is a rare inherited (X-linked) condition in which the cells are able to phagocytose but not kill. Acquired defects occur more commonly for example in diabetes, myelodysplasia and corticosteroid therapy.

\section*{Lysosomal storage disease}

Hereditary deficiencies of enzymes required for glycolipid metabolism lead to the accumulation of ceramide components in various cells and tissues. Gaucher's disease is the most common (autosomal recessive) and is caused by mutations in the gene encoding glucocerebrosidase. Type I (most common) occurs especially among Ashkenazic Jews
(age of presentation from infancy to middle age) and does not involve the central nervous system (CNS); types II and III are rarer and do involve the CNS. Clinical and haematological features result from accumulation of Gaucher's cells (Fig. 8.1) in the spleen, liver, skeleton, marrow and in types II and III in the CNS. Treatment is principally by enzyme replacement therapy.

\section*{Histiocyte disorders}

Histiocytes are the terminally differentiated cells of the monocyte macrophage system and are widely distributed throughout all tissues. Langerhans' cells are macrophages present in epidermis, spleen, thymus, bone, lymph nodes and mucosal surfaces. Langerhans' cell histiocytosis (LCH) is a single organ/system or multisystem disease occurring

principally in childhood ( $<10$ years), with an incidence of 2-5 cases/million population. Clinical features include skin rash, bone pain/swelling, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, endocrine changes (e.g. diabetes insipidus as a result of posterior pituitary involvement). Malignant histiocyte disorders include monocytic variants of acute leukaemia (see Chapter 22) and some types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (see Chapter 26).

\section*{Haemophagocytic syndromes}

In these syndromes the bone marrow shows increased numbers of histiocytes which contain ingested blood cells, leading to pancytopenia. The mechanism is poorly understood and prognosis is usually poor. Causes include infection (viral, bacterial, tuberculous), especially in an immunosuppressed host, and tumours (e.g. lymphoma) (see Fig. 36.2).

\section*{Lymphocyte disorders}

Lymphocytosis occurs in viral infections, some bacterial infections (e.g. pertussis) and in lymphoid neoplasia.

Lymphopenia (reduction in circulating lymphocytes to $<1.5 \times 10^{9} / \mathrm{L}$ ) occurs in viral infection (e.g. HIV), lymphoma, connective tissue disease, and severe bone marrow failure.

Infectious mononucleosis (glandular fever) is caused by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection of B lymphocytes. Atypical circulating lymphocytes are reactive $T$ cells. Cytomegalovirus, other viruses and toxoplasma infections cause a similar blood picture (Fig. 8.2). Clinical features include onset usually in young adults (age $15-40$ years), sore throat, lymphadenopathy, fever, morbilliform rashparticularly following treatment with amoxicillin-and jaundice, hepatomegaly and tender splenomegaly in a minority. Complications include autoimmune thrombocytopenia and/or haemolytic anaemia, myocarditis, encephalitis, hepatitis and postviral fatigue syndrome.

detects heterophile antibodies (antibodies against cells of a different species). These agglutinate sheep red blood cells and, unlike those present in normal people, are not absorbed by guinea-pig kidney cells but are absorbed by ox red blood cells. The test is positive from 1 week after infection and persists for up to 2 months. Viral culture from sputum/saliva and specific IgM and IgG antibody tests against EBV nuclear and capsular antigens are sometimes useful in diagnosis.

\section*{Immunodeficiency}

Depressed humoral immunity may be congenital (e.g. Xlinked agammaglobulinaemia) or acquired (e.g. myeloma and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL)) and characteristically leads to recurrent pyogenic bacterial infections. Depressed cell mediated immunity may be congenital (e.g. Di George's syndrome) or acquired (e.g. HIV infection, lymphoma, CLL) and causes susceptibility to viral, protozoal and fungal infections, anergy and a secondary defect in humoral immunity. Mixed B and T cell deficiency is common.

\section*{HIV infection and AIDS}

HIV-1 is a retrovirus transmitted by semen, blood and other body fluids, which infects and kills $\mathrm{CD} 4+\mathrm{T}$ lymphocytes to cause immune suppression. A non-specific febrile illness with lymphadenopathy often marks initial infection. A proportion of patients progress to AIDS with a CD4 count $<0.2 \times 10^{9} / \mathrm{L}$. Clinical manifestations include recurring infections, anaemia and lymphadenopathy. Treatment may also induce anaemia; e.g. azidothymidine (AZT) and cotrimoxazole both cause megaloblastic change. Thrombocytopenia, lymphopenia and neutropenia (immune or caused by marrow failure or drug therapy) are also frequent. The bone marrow is usually normo- or hyper-cellular, with dysplastic features and an increase in plasma cells. There is an increased risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma and of Kaposi's sarcoma.

\section*{9 Iron I: Physiology and deficiency}

\section*{Distribution of body iron}

Iron is contained in haemoglobin, the reticuloendothelial system (RES) (as ferritin and haemosiderin), muscle (myoglobin), plasma (bound to transferrin) and cellular enzymes (e.g. cytochromes, catalase) (Fig. 9.1). Reticuloendothelial cells (macrophages) gain iron from the haemoglobin of effete red cells and release it to plasma transferrin which transports iron to bone marrow and other tissues with transferrin receptors. Transferrin is capable of binding two iron atoms per molecule and is reutilized after giving up iron to cells. The iron-responsive-element-binding protein (IRE-BP) is an RNA-binding protein which binds to specific messenger RNA sequences and is a mechanism whereby the body's iron content regulates uptake and storage of iron by cells of the RES. When iron is in excess, transferrin receptor synthesis, and therefore iron uptake, are reduced and ferritin synthesis is increased. Iron deficiency has the opposite effects.

\section*{Iron intake, absorption and loss}

The average Western diet contains $10-15 \mathrm{mg}$ of iron daily, of which $5-10 \%$ (about 1 mg ) is normally absorbed through
the upper small intestine. Absorption is adjusted to body needs (increased in iron deficiency and pregnancy, reduced in iron overload). Absorption is regulated by two proteins, DMT-1 (also called N-ramp 2) at the villous tip and HFE at the basolateral surfaces of the enterocyte. The DMT-1 level determines the amount of iron absorbed, and the DMT-1 level is in turn controlled by degree of expression of HFE. This is increased in iron deficiency. Iron in animal products is more easily absorbed than vegetable iron; inorganic iron in ferrous form is absorbed more than ferric form. Vitamin C enhances absorption; phytates inhibit it. Dietary intake makes up for daily loss (about 1 mg ) in hair, skin, urine, faeces and menstrual blood loss in women. Infants, children and pregnant women need extra iron to expand their red cell mass and, in pregnancy, for transfer to the fetus.

\section*{Iron deficiency}

Causes (Table 9.1)
- Blood loss ( 500 mL of normal blood contains $200-250 \mathrm{mg}$ iron)-dominant cause in Western countries.
- Malabsorption - rarely a main cause.
- Poor dietary intake-a contributory cause, especially in

\section*{Clinical features}
- General features of anaemia (see Chapter 6).
- Special features (minority of patients): koilonychia (Fig. 9.2) or ridged brittle nails, glossitis, angular cheilosis (sore corners of mouth), pica (abnormal appetite), hair thinning and pharyngeal web formation (Paterson-Kelly syndrome).
- Features resulting from an underlying cause.

\section*{Laboratory findings}
- Hypochromic microcytic anaemia.
- Raised platelet count.
- Blood film appearances (Fig. 9.3) include hypochromic/ microcytic cells, aniso/poikilocytosis, target cells and 'pencil' cells.
- Bone marrow-not needed for diagnosis: erythroblasts show ragged irregular cytoplasm; absence of iron from stores and erythroblasts.
- Serum ferritin reduced, serum iron low with raised transferrin and unsaturated iron binding capacity.
- Serum soluble transferrin receptors increased.

\section*{Other investigations}
- History (especially for blood loss, diet, malabsorption). Tests for cause (especially in males and postmenopausal females) include occult blood tests, upper and lower gastrointestinal endoscopy, tests for hookworm, malabsorption and for urine haemosiderin.

Postgastrectomy, gluten-induced enteropathy

\section*{Poor diet}

Rarely the sole cause in developed countries
- Haemoglobin electrophoresis and/or globin gene DNA analysis to exclude thalassaemia trait or other haemoglobin defects.

\section*{Treatment}
- Oral iron-ferrous sulphate is best ( $200 \mathrm{mg}, 67 \mathrm{mg}$ iron per tablet) before meals three times daily.
- A reticulocyte response begins in 7 days but treatment should be continued for 4-6 months to replenish stores.
- Side effects (e.g. abdominal pain, diarrhoea or constipation) require a lower dose, taking iron with food, or a different preparation (e.g. ferrous gluconate $300 \mathrm{mg}, 37 \mathrm{mg}$ iron per tablet).
- Poor response may be due to continued bleeding, incorrect diagnosis, malabsorption or poor compliance.
- Prophylactic oral iron, often combined with folic acid, is given in pregnancy.
- Intramuscular iron is used in patients with malabsorption or who are unable to take oral iron. Intravenous iron may cause anaphylaxis but is useful to replenish iron stores in rare cases and in renal dialysis patients receiving erythropoietin therapy.

\section*{10 Iron II: Overload and sideroblastic anaemia}

\section*{Iron overload}

Iron overload is the pathological state in which total body stores of iron are increased, often with organ dysfunction as a result of iron deposition.

\section*{Causes}
- Primary (genetic) haemochromatosis (GH) is an autosomal recessive condition associated with excessive iron absorption. Ninety percent of cases are homozygous for a mutation in the HFE gene situated close to the HLA complex on chromosome 6 (see Chapter 9).
- African iron overload; dietary and genetic components.
- Excess dietary iron.
- Ineffective erythropoiesis with increased iron absorption (e.g. thalassaemia intermedia).
- Repeated blood transfusions in patients with severe refractory anaemia, e.g. thalassaemia major, myelodysplasia.

\section*{Clinical features}
- These are mainly caused by organ dysfunction as a result of iron deposition (Fig. 10.1).
- Cardiomyopathy gives rise to dysrhythmias and congestive heart failure: major cause of death.
- Growth/sexual development are reduced in children: delayed puberty, diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism and hypoparathyroidism are frequent.
- The liver may show haemosiderosis and cirrhosis. The liver abnormality in transfusional iron overload is, however, often a result of hepatitis B or C infection.
- Excessive melanin skin pigmentation.
- Excessive infections.
- Arthropathy in GH caused by pyrophosphate deposition.

\section*{Laboratory features}
- Raised serum iron and transferrin saturation.
- Raised serum ferritin.
- Lowered serum-soluble transferrin receptor level.
- Increased iron in liver (transfusional iron overload) and bone marrow.
- Increased urinary iron excretion in response to iron chelator therapy.
- Abnormal liver function tests.
- Endocrine abnormalities, e.g. raised blood glucose.

\section*{Treatment}
- Genetic haemochromatosis: regular venesections to reduce iron level to normal, assessed by serum ferritin, serum iron and total iron binding capacity and by liver biopsy.
- Transfusional iron overload: iron chelation using subcutaneous desferrioxamine (DFX) over $8-12 \mathrm{~h}$ on 5-7 nights each week. Vitamin C enhances iron excretion. An orally active iron chelator (deferiprone) is available for those unable to take DFX.

\section*{Sideroblastic anaemia}

\section*{Definition}

Sideroblastic anaemia is a refractory anaemia in which the marrow shows increased iron present as granules arranged in a ring around the nucleus in developing erythroblasts ('ringed sideroblasts', Fig.10.2). At least $15 \%$ of erythroblasts show this in the primary forms. A defect of haem synthesis is present. Haem synthesis occurs in both the mitochondria and the cellular cytoplasm.

\section*{Endocrine changes}

\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Fig.10.2 Bone marrow iron stain (Perls' stain, Prussian blue) showing a ringed sideroblast.}
\end{figure}

\section*{Classification}
- The most common form is primary acquired type (a form of myelodysplasia; see Chapter 21).
- An X-linked genetic defect in haem synthesis (usually due to mutation of $\delta$-amino laevulinic acid synthase, ALA-S), a key enzyme in haem synthesis underlies some congenital forms, usually in males.
- Ringed sideroblasts may also occur with other haematological disorders and with alcohol, isoniazid therapy and lead poisoning (Fig. 10.3).

\section*{Clinical and laboratory features}

The congenital anaemia is sometimes mild (haemoglobin $8-10 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dL}$ ) but may become more severe with age. Leucopenia and thrombocytopenia may occur in patients with myelodysplasia. Blood film may be dimorphic (Fig.10.3). The MCV is usually raised in acquired and low in the inherited variety.

\section*{Treatment}

Usually symptomatic. Regular blood transfusion and iron chelation is often required. Patients with inherited forms may respond to pyridoxine (vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{6}$ ), a co-factor for ALA-S.

\section*{Lead poisoning}

Clinically this presents with abdominal pain, constipation, anaemia, peripheral neuropathy and a blue (lead) line of the gums. The blood film shows punctate basophilia (blue staining dots as a result of undegraded RNA) (Fig. 10.4) and features of haemolysis. The marrow may show ringed sideroblasts.

\section*{11 Megaloblastic anaemia I: Vitamin $\mathbf{B}_{\mathbf{1 2}}$ deficiency}

Megaloblastic anaemia (MA) is associated with an abnormal appearance of the bone marrow erythroblasts in which nuclear development is delayed and nuclear chromatin has a lacy open appearance. There is a defect in DNA synthesis usually caused by deficiency of vitamin $B_{12}\left(B_{12}\right.$, cobalamin) or folate.

\section*{Biochemical basis}

Folate is an essential coenzyme for the synthesis of thymidine monosphosphate (TMP) and therefore of DNA. $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ is a coenzyme for methionine synthase, a reaction needed in the demethylation of the plasma form of folate, 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (methylTHF) (Fig. 11.1). MethylTHF enters cells and its demethylation provides THF which acts as substrate for synthesis of intracellular folate, polyglutamates, the coenzyme forms of folate needed in DNA synthesis.
$\mathbf{B}_{12}$ physiology (Fig. 11.2)
- Adult daily requirement for $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ is $1 \mu \mathrm{~g}$ (normal mixed
diet contains $10-15 \mu \mathrm{~g}$ ). $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ is present only in foods of animal origin: meat, fish, eggs, milk and butter; it is absent from vegetables, cereals and fruit, unless contaminated by microorganisms. Normal body stores of $\mathrm{B}_{12}$, largely in the liver with an enterohepatic circulation, are sufficient to last for 2-4 years.
- Dietary $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ after release from food and gastric ' R ' binder (see below) combines with intrinsic factor (IF) secreted by gastric parietal cells (GPC). IF-B ${ }_{12}$ complex attaches to ileal receptors and $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ is absorbed.
- Passive absorption (about $0.1 \%$ of oral $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ ) occurs through buccal, gastric and duodenal mucosae.
- Absorbed $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ attaches to transcobalamin (TC) II which carries $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ in plasma to the liver, bone marrow, brain and other tissues. Most $B_{12}$ in plasma is attached to a second $B_{12}$ binding protein, TC I, and is functionally inactive. TC I is synthesized by granulocytes and their precursors. Similar glycoproteins ('R' proteins) occur in saliva, gastric juice and milk.

\section*{Causes of $\mathbf{B}_{12}$ deficiency}

\section*{Inadequate diet}

Vegans may develop $B_{12}$ deficiency, although the intact enterohepatic circulation of a few microgrammes of $B_{12}$ daily delays its onset. Infants born to $\mathrm{B}_{12}$-deficient mothers and breast-fed by them may present with failure to thrive and MA resulting from $B_{12}$ deficiency.

\section*{Malabsorption}

\section*{Gastric causes}
- Pernicious anaemia (PA) is characterized by an autoimmune gastritis, and reduced gastric secretion of IF and acid (Fig.11.3). It is often associated with other organ-specific autoimmune diseases (e.g. myxoedema, thyrotoxicosis, vitiligo, Addison's disease and hypoparathyroidism). Antibodies to IF and gastric parietal cells occur in serum and in gastric secretion ( $50 \%$ and $90 \%$, respectively) of patients. Pernicious anaemia is also associated with early greying of
hair, blue eyes, blood group A, a family history of PA or related autoimmune disease and a $2-3$-fold increased incidence of carcinoma of the stomach. It occurs in all races and has a female/male incidence of $1.6: 1$. Peak age of incidence is 60 years.
- Gastrectomy (total or subtotal) leads to $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ deficiency.
- Congenital IF deficiency or abnormality is rare.

\section*{Intestinal causes}

These include bacterial (rarely fish tapeworm) colonization of small intestine, stagnant loop syndromes, congenital and acquired defects of the ileum (e.g. ileal resection, Crohn's disease). Congenital $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ malabsorption with proteinuria is rare.

\section*{Clinical features}
- Gradual onset of features of anaemia.
- Mild jaundice, caused by ineffective erythropoiesis.
- Glossitis and angular cheilosis and, if severe, sterility (either sex) and reversible melanin skin pigmentation.
- $B_{12}$ deficiency causes a symmetrical neuropathy affecting the pyramidal tracts and posterior columns of the spinal cord (subacute combined degeneration of the cord) and the peripheral nerves. Patients present with tingling in the feet (more than the hands), difficulty in gait, visual or psychiatric disorders.
- $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ or folate deficiency are associated with increased plasma homocysteine which is associated with arterial and venous thrombosis and, if pregnant, to an increased incidence of fetal neural tube defects.
- Patients may be asymptomatic and detected by a routine blood test.

\end{figure}

\section*{Laboratory findings}
- Macrocytic anaemia with oval macrocytes and hypersegmented neutrophils ( $>5$ nuclear lobes) (Fig. 11.4).
- Moderate reduction in leucocyte and platelet counts (severe cases).
- Bone marrow is hypercellular, increased proportion of early cells, megaloblastic erythropoiesis and giant metamyelocytes (Fig. 11.5).
- Biochemical tests show raised serum bilirubin (indirect), lactate dehydrogenase.
- In $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ deficiency, the serum $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ is low, serum folate is normal and red cell folate is normal or low.
- Raised serum methylmalonic acid ( $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ deficiency), raised serum homocysteine (either deficiency).

\section*{Tests for causes of $\mathbf{B}_{12}$ deficiency}

These include history (diet, previous surgery), tests for IF and parietal cell antibodies, upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and radioactive $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ absorption studies.

Radioactive $B_{12}$ absorption studies distinguish gastric

from intestinal causes of $\mathbf{B}_{12}$ malabsorption. The amount of radioactive $B_{12}$ absorbed is measured either by whole body counting or in a $24-\mathrm{h}$ urine sample after a 'flushing' dose of 1 mg unlabelled $B_{12}$, given simultaneously with the oral radioactive dose (Schilling test). The test can be performed with the labelled $B_{12}$ given alone or with IF. A combined urinary excretion test using two isotopic forms of $B_{12}$, one bound to IF, can be used (Dicopac test). $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ absorption is
low and corrected by IF in PA but is low and not corrected by IF in intestinal diseases.

\section*{Treatment}

Treatment for $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ deficiency is 1 mg hydroxocobalamin intramuscularly, repeated every $2-3$ days until six injections have been given; then one injection every 3 months for life unless the cause of deficiency has been corrected.

\section*{12 Megaloblastic anaemia II: Folate deficiency and other macrocytic anaemias}

\section*{Physiology}

Folates consist of a large number of compounds derived from the parent compound pteroylglutamic (folic) acid by reduction, addition of single carbon groups, e.g. methyl or formyl, and, in cells, addition of extra glutamate moieties usually four, five or six (see Fig.11.1).
- Occur in most foods, especially liver and green vegetables. Normal daily diet contains $200-250 \mu \mathrm{~g}$, of which about $50 \%$ is absorbed.
- Daily adult requirements are about $100 \mu \mathrm{~g}$; body stores are sufficient for 4 months.
- Absorbed through the upper small intestine with conversion of all natural forms to 5-methyl tetrahydrofolate (methyl THF).

\section*{Clinical features}

The clinical features of folate deficiency are the same as $B_{12}$ deficiency, but folate deficiency does not cause a similar neuropathy. Folic acid therapy in early pregnancy reduces neural tube defects (anencephaly, spina bifida, encephalocoele) in the fetus, probably by reducing homocysteine accumulation. Conversion of homocysteine to methionine requires the folate coenzyme methyl THF (see Fig. 11.1).

\section*{Causes of folate deficiency (Table 12.1)}
- The most common cause is poor dietary intake, either alone or in association with increased folate utilization (e.g. pregnancy or haemolytic anaemia).
- Malabsorption occurs in gluten-induced enteropathy or tropical sprue.
- Increased utilization. Increased cell turnover and DNA synthesis causes breakdown of folates; the most common causes include pregnancy, haemolytic anaemia, severe chronic inflammatory and malignant diseases, and anticonvulsant drugs.
- Folate is loosely bound to protein in plasma and is easily removed by dialysis.

\section*{Tests for causes of deficiency}

These include history (diet, previous surgery, drug therapy, alcohol, other associated diseases), antigliadin and endomysial antibodies, and tests for malabsorption (e.g. duodenal biopsy). The serum folate is low, red cell folate is low and serum $B_{12}$ is normal or slightly reduced.

\section*{Treatment}

Treatment is 5 mg folic acid daily for 4 months, then decide whether to continue folic acid, e.g. 5 mg folic acid once

weekly indefinitely. Folate therapy corrects the anaemia but not the neuropathy of $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ deficiency. Indeed, administration of folate to a severely $B_{12}$-deficient individual may precipitate or worsen $B_{12}$ neuropathy. Pregnant women are given about $400 \mu \mathrm{~g}$ daily to reduce the incidence of megaloblastic anaemia and of neural tube defects in the fetus.

\section*{Other causes of megaloblastic anaemia}

Defects of $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ or folate metabolism include congenital transcobalamin (TC) II deficiency which leads to $B_{12}$ malabsorption and to failure of $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ to enter cells resulting in megaloblastic anaemia (MA) in early infancy. $\mathrm{N}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ anaesthesia reversibly inactivates body $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ and prolonged or repeated exposure may cause megaloblastic anaemia or $B_{12}$ neuropathy. Antifolate drugs include the inhibitors of dihydrofolate reductase (methotrexate, pyrimethamine and trimethoprim) which have progressively less activity against the human compared to the bacterial enzyme. Folinic acid (5-formyl-THF) is used to overcome
methotrexate toxicity. Megaloblastic anaemia also occurs with cytotoxic drug therapy (e.g. 6-mercaptopurine, cytosine arabinoside or hydroxyurea (hydroxycarbamide)) or, rarely, inborn errors, e.g. orotic aciduria.

\section*{Causes of macrocytosis}

Alcohol is the most frequent cause (Table 12.2). MCV is not usually as high as in severe MA in these conditions. White cell and platelet counts are normal unless the underlying marrow disease affects these, the red cells are circular rather than oval, hypersegmented neutrophils are absent and the marrow is normoblastic.

\section*{13 Haemolytic anaemias I: General}

Haemolytic anaemias are caused by a shortened red cell lifespan; the normal mean red cell life (MRCL) is 120 days. Red cell production can be increased 6-8 times by normal bone marrow and haemolytic anaemia (HA) occurs if MRCL falls to 15 days or less, particularly in the presence of ineffective erythropoiesis, haematinic deficiency or marrow disease. Haemolysis may be caused by a fault in the red cell, usually inherited, or an abnormality in its environment, usually acquired (Table 13.1).

\section*{Physiology of red cell destruction (Fig. 13.1)}

Red cell destruction is normally extravascular in the macrophages of the reticuloendothelial system, in bone marrow, liver and spleen. Globin is degraded to amino
acids, haem to protoporphyrin, carbon monoxide and iron. Protoporphyrin is metabolized to bilirubin, conjugated to a glucuronide in the liver, excreted in faeces (as stercobilinogen) and, after reabsorption, in urine as urobilinogen. Iron is recycled to plasma and combined to transferrin. Some iron remains in the macrophages as ferritin and haemosiderin. Haptoglobins are plasma proteins which bind haemoglobin to form a complex which is removed by the liver; their level is reduced in haemolysis as well as in liver disease. Pathological red cell destruction may occur intravascularly (Table 13.2). Some haemoglobin is excreted in the urine unchanged; it is also partly reabsorbed by the renal tubules and broken down to haemosiderin.

\end{figure}

\section*{Clinical features}
- Anaemia (unless fully compensated haemolysis).
- Jaundice (usually mild) caused by unconjugated bilirubin in plasma; bilirubin is absent from the urine.
- An increased incidence of pigment gallstones.
- Splenomegaly - in many types.
- Ankle ulcers, especially sickle cell anaemia, thalassaemia intermedia and hereditary spherocytosis.
- Expansion of marrow e.g. frontal bossing.
- Aplastic crises caused by parvovirus infection and megaloblastic anaemia caused by folate deficiency.

\section*{Laboratory features}
- Haemoglobin level may be normal or reduced.
- Raised reticulocyte count.
- Blood film may show polychromasia (blue staining in young red cells), altered red cell shape, e.g. spherocytes, elliptocytes, sickle cells or fragmented cells.
- Bone marrow shows increased erythropoiesis.
- Serum indirect (unconjugated) bilirubin is raised.
- Serum haptoglobins absent.

- Faecal stercobilinogen and urine urobilinogen are increased.
- Radioactive chromium ( ${ }^{51} \mathrm{Cr}$ ) labelling of red cells measures lifespan and assesses the sites of red cell destruction by surface counting. Useful in predicting value of splenectomy.
- Intravascular haemolysis leads to raised plasma and urine haemoglobin, positive serum (Schumm's) test for methaemalbumin, urine haemosiderin.

\section*{14 Haemolytic anaemias II: Inherited membrane and enzyme defects}

\section*{Membrane abnormalities}

\section*{Hereditary spherocytosis (HS)}

This is the most common inherited haemolytic anaemia (HA) in white people. It is autosomal dominant with variable severity and may present as severe neonatal HA, as symptomatic HA later in life, or as an incidental finding. Defect is in a red cell membrane protein e.g. spectrin; 25\% of cases are new mutations. Affected red cells lose membrane during passage through the reticuloendothelial system, especially the spleen. The cells become progressively more spherical (decreased surface area/volume ratio) and microcytic. They are destroyed prematurely, mainly in the spleen.

\section*{Clinical features}

Clinical features are those generally associated with HA. The spleen is usually enlarged.

\section*{Laboratory features}
- Blood film: microspherocytes and polychromasia (Fig. 14.1).
- Haemoglobin level variable.
- Tests for HA are positive (see Chapter 13).
- Special tests: osmotic fragility increased (Fig. 14.2), autohaemolysis increased and corrected by addition of glucose.
- Direct antiglobulin test is negative (excluding warm autoimmune HA which can cause a similar blood picture).

\section*{Treatment}
- Splenectomy corrects the decrease in lifespan although spherocytosis persists; may not be needed in mild cases; defer if possible in children until over the age of 6 years.
- Give folic acid prophylactically for severe cases.
- Pigment gallstones may cause cholecystitis.
- If cholecystectomy required, perform splenectomy also to reduce risk of recurrent gallstones.

\caption{Fig. 14.1 Hereditary spherocytosis: peripheral blood film.}
\end{figure}

\section*{Hereditary elliptocytosis (HE) (Fig. 14.3)}

This is similar but usually milder than HS. It is usually due to a spectrin defect. The peripheral blood is characteristic. Splenectomy is rarely needed. A homozygous form causes a severe HA (hereditary pyropoikilocytosis).

\section*{South-East Asian ovalocytosis}

This is an inherited red cell membrane protein defect (band 3 ), in which carriers have a degree of protection against malaria.

\caption{Fig. 14.3 Hereditary elliptocytosis: peripheral blood film.}
\end{figure}

\section*{Enzyme abnormalities}

Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency G6PD is the first enzyme in the hexose monophosphate pathway (see Fig.2.4) which generates reducing power as reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH). Deficiency results in red cells being susceptible to oxidant stress. The gene is on the X chromosome so inheritance is sex-linked. Many mutant enzymes occur. Affected males develop HA when the red cells are exposed to oxidant stress, especially by drugs, infections, ingestion of fava beans and during the neonatal period (Table 14.1). Deficiency is common in black, mediterranean, middleeastern and oriental populations. There is epidemiological evidence that individuals with G6PD deficiency have a small degree of protection against malaria.

\section*{Clinical and laboratory features}
- Blood count and film normal between crises.
- During crises features of acute intravascular haemolysis.
- Blood film in a crisis (see Fig.14.4) shows red cells with absent haemoglobin ('bite' and 'blister' cells) and polychromasia. Heinz bodies (denatured haemoglobin) may be seen in a reticulocyte preparation with supravital staining.
- Haemolysis is usually self-limited because of the increased G6PD activity in reticulocytes.
- Chronic non-spherocytic HA (CNSHA) occurs rarely with certain mutant enzymes.
- Neonatal jaundice is frequent.
- Screening tests for red cell G6PD deficiency measure the generation of NADPH. The enzyme may also be characterized by electrophoresis, assay of activity and DNA analysis. Diagnosis should, when possible, be undertaken in the steady state as reticulocytes generally have higher enzyme activity and the raised reticulocyte count following haemolysis may lead to a false normal result.

Table 14.1 Agents which may cause haemolytic anaemia in G6PD deficiency.

\footnotetext{
Infections and other acute illnesses, e.g. diabetic ketoacidosis
Drugs
Antimalarials, e.g. primaquine
Sulphonamides and sulphones, e.g. cotrimoxazole, sulphanilamide, dapsone, salazopyrine
Other antibacterial agents, e.g. nitrofurans, chloramphenicol
Analgesics, e.g. aspirin (moderate doses are safe)
Antihelminths, e.g. $\beta$-naphthol, stibophen, niridazole
Miscellaneous, e.g. vitamin K analogues, naphthalene (mothballs), probenecid
Fava beans (possibly other vegetables)
}

\section*{Management}
- Stop offending drugs or fava bean ingestion.
- Treat infection if present.
- Transfuse packed red cells if necessary.
- Splenectomy may ameliorate HA in rare CNSHA.

\section*{Pyruvate kinase deficiency}

Pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency is the most frequent enzyme deficiency in the Embden-Meyerhof (glycolytic) pathway to cause CNSHA (see Fig. 14.5). Inheritance is autosomal recessive. The $\mathrm{O}_{2}$-dissociation curve is shifted to the right so symptoms are mild in comparison to the degree of anaemia. Splenectomy partly improves the anaemia.

Other enzyme deficiencies are rare causes of CNSHA and are frequently associated with musculoskeletal disease.

\section*{15 Haemolytic anaemias III: Acquired}

\section*{Autoimmune haemolytic anaemia}

This is caused by autoantibodies against the red cell membrane. It is divided into warm and cold antibody types and each may be idiopathic or secondary to other diseases (see Table 13.1).

\section*{Warm autoimmune haemolytic anaemia}

Antibody, typically IgG, has maximum activity at $37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.

\section*{Clinical and laboratory features}
- Presents at any age, in either sex, with features of extravascular haemolytic anaemia of varying severity.
- The spleen is often enlarged.
- Blood film shows microspherocytes (Fig.15.1), polychromasia, anisocytosis, $\pm$ circulating nucleated red blood cells.
- Direct antiglobulin test (DAT) is positive (Fig.15.2).
- Antibody may be non-specific or directed against antigens in the Rh system.
- IgG or IgG + complement (C3d) is detected on the red cell.
- Free antibody may be present in the serum.
- May be associated with immune thrombocytopenia (Evans' syndrome).
- Antibody-coated red cells are destroyed in the reticuloendothelial system, especially the spleen.

\section*{Treatment}
- Corticosteroids, e.g. prednisolone $1 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ orally with subsequent gradual reduction.
- Blood transfusion if necessary.
- Consider splenectomy if steroid therapy fails.
- Other immunosuppressive drugs, e.g. azathioprine, cyclosporin, cyclophosphamide.

\section*{Cold autoimmune haemolytic anaemia}

Antibody, typically IgM, has maximum activity at $4^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.

\section*{Clinical and laboratory features (Fig. 15.3)}
- Raynaud's phenomenon affecting the fingers, toes, nose and ears.
- Positive DAT with C3d on red cells.
- Cold agglutinins, usually IgM and directed against I or i antigen (especially in infectious mononucleosis) on red

If agglutination occurs, then the red blood cells must have been coated; if no agglutination occurs, the red blood cells were not coated. In the indirect antiglobulin test, red cells are first incubated with serum at $37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ for 30 min ; a DAT is then performed, which will be positive if there are antibodies in the serum reacting against the red blood cells.}
\end{figure}
cells are present in serum, often to titres of 1:4000 or more. In primary form (cold haemagglutinin disease) the antibody is monoclonal and the patient may ultimately develop non-Hodgkin lymphoma.
- Paroxysmal cold haemoglobinuria is a rare syndrome, precipitated by infections. Intravascular haemolysis is caused by the Donath-Landsteiner antibody which binds red cells in the cold but causes lysis at $37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.

\section*{Treatment}
- Keep the patient warm.
- Consider immunosuppression with chlorambucil or cyclophosphamide.
- Consider plasma exchange to lower antibody titre.

\section*{Alloimmune haemolytic anaemia}

This is caused when antibody produced by one individual reacts against red cells of another. The three important situations are:
1 mismatched blood transfusions (see Chapter 37);
2 haemolytic disease of the newborn (see Chapter 37); and
3 following marrow or solid organ transplantation.

\section*{Drug-induced immune haemolytic anaemia}

Mechanisms include the following.
- Antibody directed against a drug (e.g. penicillin)-red cell membrane complex, the drug acting as a hapten.
- Antibody against a drug (e.g. quinidine)-plasma protein complex with subsequent deposition of the immune complex on red cells.
- Stimulation of autoantibody (warm type) production against the red cell, e.g. methyldopa, fludarabine.

Red cell agglutinates disappear if a blood film is prepared at $37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.}
\end{figure}

\section*{Red cell fragmentation syndromes}

These occur when red cells are exposed to an abnormal surface (e.g. non-endothelialized artificial heart valve or arterial graft), or flow through small vessels containing fibrin strands (e.g. in disseminated intravascular coagulation) or damaged small vessels. This is termed microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia (MAHA) and occurs in thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, haemolytic uraemic syndrome, widespread adenocarcinoma, malignant hypertension, pre-eclampsia and meningococcal septicaemia. Haemolysis is both extra- and intravascular; blood film shows deeply staining fragmented red cells (see Fig. 29.5).

\section*{Infections}

These may cause haemolysis by:
- direct damage to red cells (e.g. malaria);
- toxin production (e.g. clostridium perfringens);
- oxidant stress in G6PD-deficient individuals;
- MAHA (e.g. meningococcal septicaemia);
- autoantibody formation (e.g. infectious mononucleosis);
- extravascular destruction (e.g. malaria).

\section*{Chemical and physical agents}

Some drugs, e.g. dapsone, or chemicals, e.g. chlorate, cause haemolysis by oxidation even with normal G6PD levels. Severe burns and snake bites may also cause haemolysis.

\section*{Paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria}

This is a clonal disorder in which haemolysis is caused by a rare acquired mutation of the PIG-A gene in haemopoietic stem cells. This results in a defect of the phosphatidyl inositol anchor which tethers a large number of proteins to the cell membrane. The cells become abnormally sensitive to complement-mediated haemolysis (lack of MIRL, CD56 antigen). It is often associated with a hypoplastic marrow with neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. The clinical course is frequently complicated by recurrent venous thromboses, especially of large veins, e.g. hepatic or portal; also by iron deficiency and infections. Diagnosis is made by a positive acid lysis (Ham's) test and the presence of red cells lacking the CD56 antigen.

\section*{Treatment}
- Iron is given for iron deficiency resulting from chronic intravascular haemolysis.
- Transfusion of leucodepleted red cells may be necessary.
- Warfarin may be needed life-long to prevent thrombosis.
- Allogeneic stem cell transplant for very serious cases in young adults.

\section*{16 Haemolytic anaemias IV: Genetic defects of haemoglobin}

Genetic disorders of haemoglobin comprise:
1 disorders of globin chain synthesis (the thalassaemias);
2 structural defects of haemoglobin which give rise to haemolysis (e.g. sickle cell anaemia, haemoglobin C);
3 unstable haemoglobins (rare); and
4 structural disorders giving rise to polycythaemia or methaemoglobinaemia (rare).

The first and second have a wide global prevalence, particularly where malaria is, or was, common, as the carrier states give some protection against falciparum malaria. Frequent compound heterozygotes of a thalassaemic allele and a haemoglobin structural variant allele include sickle/ $\beta$-thalassaemia and $\mathrm{Hb} \mathrm{E} / \beta$-thalassaemia.

\section*{Thalassaemia}

These autosomal recessive syndromes divide into $\alpha$ - and $\beta$ thalassaemia depending on whether there is reduced synthesis of $\alpha$ - or $\beta$-globin (Table 16.1).

\section*{$\alpha$-thalassaemia}

Normally there are four $\alpha$-globin genes, two on each chromosome 16 (see Fig.2.2). Severity of $\alpha$-thalassaemia depends on the number of $\alpha$-genes deleted or, less frequently, dysfunctional.

\section*{Hydrops fetalis}

In hydrops fetalis all four $\alpha$ genes are inactive. The fetus is unable to make either fetal ( $\alpha_{2} \gamma_{2}$ ) or adult $\mathrm{Hb} \mathrm{A} \mathrm{( } \alpha_{2} \beta_{2}$ ) haemoglobin. Death occurs in utero or neonatally.

\section*{Haemoglobin H disease}

This is caused by deletion or functional inactivity of three of the four $\alpha$ genes. Markedly microcytic hypochromic anaemia (Hb 6-11.0g/dL); splenomegaly usual. Bone deformities and features of iron overload do not occur. Haemoglobin electrophoresis shows 4-10\% haemoglobin $\mathrm{H}(\beta 4)$ and supravital staining shows 'golf ball' cells.

\section*{$\alpha$-thalassaemia trait}

This is a one or two $\alpha$ gene deletion with microscopic hypochromic red cells with raised red cell count ( $>5.5 \times 10^{9} / \mathrm{L}$ ). Mild anaemia occurs in some cases with two $\alpha$ genes deleted.

\section*{$\beta$-thalassaemia}

\section*{Thalassaemia major}

Complete ( $\beta$ o) or almost complete ( $\beta^{+}$) failure of $\beta$-globin chain synthesis resulting from one of over 160 different point mutations or deletions in the $\beta$-globin gene or its controlling sequences on chromosome 11. There is severe imbalance of $\alpha: \beta+\gamma$ chains with deposition of $\alpha$ chains in erythroblasts, ineffective erythropoiesis, severe anaemia and extramedullary haemopoiesis.

\section*{Clinical features}
- Anaemia presents at the age of 3-6 months when the switch from $\alpha$ - to $\beta$-chain synthesis normally occurs. Milder cases present later (up to age 4 years).
- Failure to thrive, intercurrent infection, pallor, mild jaundice.
- Enlargement of the liver and spleen, expansion of the bones - especially of the skull - with bossing and a 'hair on

end' appearance on X-ray (Fig. 16.1); thalassaemic facies, caused by expansion of skull and facial bones.
- Features of iron overload as a result of blood transfusions include melanin pigmentation, growth/endocrine defects, cardiac failure, liver abnormality (see Chapter 10).

\section*{Laboratory findings}
- Severe anaemia (Hb 2-6g/dL) with reduced MCV and MCH .
- Blood film (Fig.16.2) shows hypochromic microcytic cells, target cells, erythroblasts and, often, myelocytes.
- Bone marrow is hypercellular with erythroid hyperplasia.
- Globin chain synthesis studies show absent, or severely deficient, $\beta$-chain synthesis. Fetal haemoglobin variably increased.
- DNA analysis reveals the specific mutations.

\section*{Management}
- Regular transfusions of packed red cells to maintain haemoglobin above $9-10 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dL}$, leucodepleted to reduce risk of HLA sensitization and of transmission of disease, e.g. cytomegalovirus.
- Iron chelation therapy with subcutaneous desferrioxamine (DFX) over $8-12 \mathrm{~h}$ on $5-7$ nights weekly. Additional DFX may be given intravenously at the time of blood transfusion via a separate bag. Oral vitamin C increases iron excretion with DFX. An orally active chelator, deferiprone is also available for those unable to take DFX (see also Chapter 10).
- Hepatitis B is prevented by early immunization. Patients who already have chronic active hepatitis caused by hepatitis C may need $\alpha$-interferon + ribavirin therapy.
- Splenectomy is necessary if blood requirements are excessively high. Defer if possible until the age of 5 years, precede by immunization (see Chapter 39) and follow by oral penicillin therapy for life. If the platelet count remains raised, low-dose aspirin reduces the risk of thromboembolism.
- Bone marrow transplantation from a HLA-matching sibling may give long-term disease-free survival of up to $90 \%$ in good-risk patients, but nearer $50 \%$ in poor risk (previously poorly chelated with enlarged liver and liver fibrosis).
- Treat complications of iron overload: heart, endocrine organs, liver damage.
- Osteoporosis may occur as a result of marrow expansion, endocrine deficiencies.

\section*{Thalassaemia intermedia}

A variable syndrome milder than thalassaemia major, with

\end{figure}
later onset, and characterized by moderately severe ( Hb $6-10 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dL}$ ), hypochromic microcytic anaemia requiring either few or no transfusions. There is milder imbalance of $\alpha: \beta+\gamma$ globin chain synthesis than in thalassaemia major due to milder $\beta$-chain defects, increased $\gamma$ chains or reduced $\alpha$-chain synthesis. Hepatosplenomegaly, extramedullary haemopoiesis, anaemia and bone deformities may occur. Iron overload occurs as a result of irregular blood transfusions and increased gastrointestinal iron absorption.

\section*{$\beta$-thalassaemia trait}

A mild hypochromic microcytic anaemia with a raised red cell count ( $>5.5 \times 10^{12} / \mathrm{L}$ ) and raised haemoglobin $\mathrm{A}_{2}\left(\alpha_{2} \delta_{2}\right)$ level ( $>3.5 \%$ ). Iron stores are normal, though iron deficiency may occur as in unaffected subjects. Accurate diagnosis allows genetic counselling and avoidance of inappropriate iron therapy.

\section*{Prenatal diagnosis of haemoglobin defects}

Prenatal diagnosis is available using either DNA (chorionic villous or amniotic fluid) or fetal blood. Carriers must first be identified (screening by blood count in ethnic minority groups, at preconception counselling or in the antenatal clinic). If a mother is a carrier, her partner must be tested. If both are carriers, there is a one in four chance that the fetus is homozygous, or doubly heterozygous, and a one in two chance that the fetus is a carrier. Fetal DNA is then usually amplified by use of the polymerase chain reaction test and the DNA mutations are detected. If the fetus is severely affected the couple should be counselled and termination of pregnancy, if appropriate, offered.

\section*{17 Haemolytic anaemias V: Inherited defects of haemoglobin - sickle cell disease}

\section*{Sickle cell disease}

Sickle cell disease (homozygous sickle cell anaemia) is a chronic haemolytic anaemia caused by a point mutation in the $\beta$-globin gene causing substitution of valine for glutamic acid in the sixth position of the $\beta$-globin chain. This causes insolubility of Hb S in its deoxygenated state. The insoluble chains crystallize in the red cells causing sickling (Fig.17.1) and vascular occlusion. The disease is most common in Africans ( $1: 5$ West Africans are carriers - they have some protection against falciparum malaria). The mutant gene also occurs in other parts of the world where malaria is or was prevalent, e.g. the Middle East, Far East and the Indian subcontinent.

\section*{Clinical features}

These resemble those of other chronic haemolytic anaemias, punctuated with different types of crisis.
1 Vaso-occlusive with blockage of small vessels is caused by increased sickling; common precipitants are infection, dehydration, acidosis and deoxygenation. Abdominal pain is caused by infarction affecting abdominal organs; bone pain may occur in the back, pelvis, ribs and long bones. Infarction may affect the central nervous system-causing a stroke or fits-lungs, spleen or kidneys. In children the 'hand-foot syndrome' is caused by infarction of the metaphyses of the small bones.
2 Visceral sequestration crisis is caused by sickling with pooling of red cells in the liver, spleen or lungs. Sequestration in the lungs is partly responsible for the acute chest syndrome, though infarction and infection contribute.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_09_3fc5c60a4aba104b7634g-049.jpg?height=531&width=843&top_left_y=1718&top_left_x=163}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Fig.17.1 Sickle cell anaemia (Hb SS): peripheral blood film showing sickle cells, anisocytois and changes of hyposplenism (target cells, Howell-Jolly bodies).}
\end{figure}

3 Aplastic crisis occurs following infection by B19 parvovirus. This causes temporary arrest of erythropoiesis which in healthy individuals is of no consequence but in patients with reduced red cell survival, such as Hb SS , can rapidly cause severe anaemia requiring blood transfusion.
- Increased susceptibility to infection. Splenic function is reduced because infarction leads to autosplenectomy in severe cases in infancy. Pneumococcal infections may lead to pneumonia and meningitis. Infarction of intestinal mucosa predisposes to Salmonella infection and osteomyelitis may result.
- Other clinical features include pigment gallstones with cholecystitis, chronic leg ulcers, avascular necrosis of the femoral and humeral heads (Fig. 17.2) or other bones, cardiomyopathy, proliferative retinopathy and renal papillary necrosis (leading to polyuria, failure to concentrate urine and tendency to dehydration).

\section*{Laboratory features}
- Haemoglobin level is $7-9 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dL}$ but symptoms of anaemia are usually mild (the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ dissociation curve of Hb S is shifted to the right).
- Blood film shows sickle cells, target cells and often features of splenic atrophy (see Fig.17.1).
- Screening tests for sickling demonstrate increased turbidity of the blood after deoxygenation (e.g. with dithionate or $\mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{HPO}_{4}$ ). Haemoglobin electrophoresis (Fig. 17.5) shows haemoglobin with an abnormal migration. In Hb SS there is absence of $\mathrm{Hb} \mathrm{A} . \mathrm{Hb} \mathrm{F}$ level is usually mildly raised ( $5-10 \%$ ).

\section*{Treatment}
- General-avoid known precipitants of sickle cell crisis,

\begin{figure}

\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Fig.17.2 Sickle cell anaemia: bony changes. X-ray showing avascular necrosis of the head of the humerus.}
\end{figure}
especially dehydration and infections. Give folic acid, pneumococcal, HIB and meningococcal vaccination and oral penicillin indefinitely to compensate for splenic atrophy.
- Vaso-occlusive crisis is treated with hydration, usually intravenous normal saline, analgesia (e.g. diamorphine subcutaneous infusion); $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ if there is hypoxia; antibiotics if there is infection.
- Red cell transfusion for severe anaemia (sequestration or aplastic crisis) or as a 3-6-month programme of therapy for patients with frequently recurring crises or for 2-3 years following central nervous system crisis.
- Severe sickling or sequestration crisis (e.g. 'chest syndrome' and stroke) is treated acutely with exchange transfusion to reduce Hb S levels to $<30 \%$. Pregnant patients and those undergoing general anaesthesia may need transfusion to reduce Hb S levels to $<30 \%$.
- Oral hydroxyurea ( $20-40 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} /$ day ) reduces both the frequency and duration of sickle cell crisis. Although its

precise mode of action is not known, it increases Hb F production, decreases intracellular $\mathrm{Hb} S$ concentration by increasing MCV, and inhibits prothrombotic interactions between sickle cells and the endothelium.
- Bone marrow transplantation in selected cases.
- Joint replacement surgery may be required for avascular necrosis (hips and shoulder).
- Iron chelation therapy for patients with iron overload caused by multiple transfusions.

\section*{Sickle cell trait}

Sickle cell trait is a benign condition without anaemia and is usually asymptomatic. Occasionally haematuria or overt crisis occurs. Genetic counselling should be offered to carriers.

\section*{Other sickling disorders}

Haemoglobin S may occur in combination with other genetic defects of haemoglobin (compound heterozygotes). $\mathrm{Hb} \mathrm{S} / \beta$-thalassaemia (Fig. 17.3) clinically resembles Hb SS but the spleen usually remains enlarged and MCV is reduced. Hb SC (Fig. 17.4) disease varies in severity from mild to indistinguishable from sickle cell anaemia; thrombotic complications are particularly common.

\section*{Other structural haemoglobin abnormalities}

Many other mutations of the $\alpha$ - or $\beta$-chain genes have been identified. Most that have a significant population frequency are not associated with clinical symptoms.

\section*{18 Bone marrow failure}

Bone marrow failure is the failure of the bone marrow to produce sufficient red cells, white cells and platelets. Causes are listed in Table 18.1. The bone marrow may be hypoplastic or aplastic, with a reduction in haemopoietic cells and an increase in fat spaces. Alternatively, the haemopoietic cells may be replaced by abnormal cells or malignant cells either arising in the marrow (primary) or infiltrating it (secondary).

\section*{Clinical features}
- Symptoms and signs of anaemia, infections and easy bruising or bleeding.
- Symptoms and signs as a result of the underlying cause, e.g. side effects of chemotherapy.

\section*{Laboratory findings}
- Anaemia, leucopenia and thrombocytopenia of varying severity.
- Blood film may show circulating red cell and white precursors (leucoerythroblastic) caused by bone marrow infiltration (see Chapter 34) or may show evidence of primary haematological malignancy, e.g. circulating leukaemic blast cells.
- Bone marrow aspirate and trephine biopsy are required to define cause (Fig. 18.1).

\section*{Differential diagnosis}
- Pancytopenia (reduction in all three haemopoietic cell lines) can also result from accelerated destruction of cells (e.g. as a result of splenomegaly or autoimmune destruction) or pooling of cells (e.g. within an enlarged spleen).

\section*{Treatment}
- Remove any known cause, e.g. drugs.

}
- Support care with appropriate blood components (see Chapter 37) and antimicrobials (see Chapter 39).
- Specific therapy is considered separately with the specific diseases.

\section*{Aplastic anaemia}

This is a chronic pancytopenia associated with a hypoplastic bone marrow. There are reduced marrow stem cells, increased fat spaces (fat/haemopoiesis ratio >75:25\%) and no evidence of malignancy. The marrow microenvironment is intact.

\section*{Aetiology and pathogenesis}

The disease may be congenital or acquired (Table 18.2).
- Congenital aplastic anaemia may be inherited as an autosomal recessive (Fanconi type); rarely associated with dyskeratosis congenita.
- Acquired aplastic anaemia has an identifiable cause (viral infection, radiation or drug exposure) in about $50 \%$ of cases. In the remainder the cause is unknown, but may involve an immune reaction against marrow stem cells.

\section*{Clinical features}
- May occur at any age, in either sex, incidence of 2-5 cases/million population.
- Onset rapid (over a few days) or slow (over weeks or months).
- Symptoms and signs are caused by bone marrow failure (see above).
- Liver, spleen and lymph nodes are not enlarged.

\caption{Fig. 18.2 Aplastic anaemia: Fanconi's anaemia, with multiple skeletal deformities of upper limbs.}
\end{figure}
- Fanconi's anaemia (Fig.18.2) usually presents in childhood. Associated findings may include skeletal and renal tract defects, microcephaly and altered skin pigmentation. In dyskeratosis congenita there are skin, hair and nail changes.

\section*{Laboratory findings}
- Anaemia is normocytic or mildly macrocytic with a low reticulocyte count.
- Leucopenia is usual with neutrophils below $1.5 \times 10^{9} / \mathrm{L}$ ( $<0.2 \times 10^{9} / \mathrm{L}$ in severe cases).
- Thrombocytopenia ( $<10 \times 10^{9} / \mathrm{L}$ in severe cases).
- Bone marrow is hypoplastic with $>75 \%$ fat spaces. Remaining haemopoietic cells are of normal appearance. Megakaryocytes are particularly reduced.
- In Fanconi's anaemia lymphocyte chromosomes show random breaks.

\section*{Specific therapy}
- Immunosuppression, e.g. antilymphocyte globulin (ALG), horse or rabbit, given intravenously over several days, corticosteroids and cyclosporin (alone or with ALG) improve marrow function in 50-70\% of severe cases.
- Androgens (e.g. oxymetholone) may benefit Fanconi's anaemia and acquired aplastic anaemia.
- Bone marrow transplantation offers a cure in severe cases, providing there is an HLA matching sibling to act as
donor. Results are best (60-70\% cure) in younger patients (<20 years).
- Haemopoietic growth factors, granulocyte colonystimulating factor or granulocyte-macrophage colonystimulating factor may raise the neutrophil count temporarily but have no long-term benefit on the underlying bone marrow defect.

\section*{Red cell aplasia}

Red cell aplasia is anaemia caused by selective reduction of red cell production by the bone marrow. There is absence or severe reduction of developing erythroblasts in the marrow and of reticulocytes in the peripheral blood, with no abnormality in other cell lines.

\section*{Clinical and laboratory features}

A rare congenital form (Diamond-Blackfan anaemia) is frequently associated with other somatic malformations. Acquired red cell aplasia may occur as a result of drugs (e.g. azathioprine, isoniazid), in association with autoimmune diseases (e.g. systemic lupus erythematosus), haematological malignancy (e.g. chronic lymphocytic leukaemia) or with a thymoma (see Chapter 34).

Transient red cell aplasia occurs following infection with B19 parvovirus and can lead to a profound but temporary reduction of red cell production with severe anaemia in patients with a haemolytic disorder (e.g. 'aplastic crisis' in hereditary spherocytosis or sickle cell anaemia).

\section*{Treatment}

Treatment of the underlying disorder (e.g. surgical removal of a thymoma) is required. Red cell transfusion and iron chelation therapy may be required. Immunosuppressive therapy (e.g. prednisolone, cyclosporin, ALG) is useful in selected patients with either congenital or acquired red cell aplasia.

\section*{Congenital dyserythopoietic anaemias}

Congenital dyserythropoietic anaemias are a rare group of recessively inherited conditions in which chronic anaemia results from abnormal maturation of erythroid cells in the marrow. Red cell precursors usually show marked morphological abnormalities, e.g. bi- and trinucleated normoblasts.

\section*{19 Haematological malignancy: basic mechanisms}

\section*{Neoplasia}

Haematological malignancies (Table 19.1) are thought to arise from a single cell in the bone marrow, thymus or peripheral lymphoid system. This cell undergoes genetic change (mutation) leading to malignant transformation. Successive mitotic divisions give rise to a clone of cells derived from the parent cell. Further mutations may give rise to subclones (clonal evolution). Transformed cells either proliferate excessively or are resistant to apoptosis. They are often 'frozen' at a particular stage of differentiation.

\section*{Causes of neoplasia}

Neoplasia is caused by a complex interaction between genetic and environmental mechanisms (Fig. 19.1).

1 Genetic predisposition. Certain inherited conditions (e.g. Down's syndrome, trisomy 21) and conditions associated with defective DNA repair (e.g. Fanconi's anaemia) or immune suppression (e.g. ataxia telangiectasia).
2 Viral infection. Human T-cell leukaemia virus (HTLV-1) incorporates into T-lymphoid-cell genome and underlies adult T-cell leukaemia lymphoma (see Chapter 26). Other viruses predispose to malignancy by immune suppression (e.g. HIV). Epidemiological evidence implicates Epstein-Barr virus in Burkitt's lymphoma.
3 Ionizing radiation causes DNA mutation and increases the risk of haematological neoplasia.
4 Toxins/chemicals, e.g. benzene and organochemicals may predispose to leukaemia and myelodysplasia (MDS).
5 Drugs. Alkylating agents (e.g. melphalan, mustine)

and other forms of chemotherapy predispose to MDS or acute myeloid leukaemia.

\section*{Mechanism of malignant transformation}

Altered expression of three types of gene underlies multistep pathogenesis of haematological malignancy.

\section*{1 Oncogenes}

These are genes whose protein products cause neoplastic transformation. Oncogenes are derived from normal cellular genes (proto-oncogenes) which code for proteins usually involved in one or other stage in cell signal transduction, gene transcription, cell cycle, cell survival/ apoptosis or differentiation. Inappropriate activation and expression of an oncogene may cause transformation. Activation of oncogenes may occur by amplification, point mutation or translocation (most frequent in haematological malignancies) from one chromosomal location to another. Translocation may lead to a quantitative change in expression (e.g. MYC translocation to immunoglobulin heavy chain locus in lymphoid neoplasia, $t(8 ; 14)$ ) or qualitative change by joining all or part of the oncogene to another gene to form a fusion gene (e.g. ABL translocation to the breakpoint cluster region [BCR] to form BCR-ABL in CML, t[9;22]).

\section*{2 Anti-oncogenes}

Anti-oncogenes, or tumour suppressor genes (e.g.p53), are genes encoding proteins which have a critical role in suppressing cell growth. Chromosome deletion may obliterate tumour suppressor genes on one allele; deletion or mutation of the remaining allele may allow uncontrolled cell growth.

\section*{3 Inhibition of apoptosis}

Malignant cells often show resistance to apoptosis. The BCL-2 gene product inhibits apoptosis and its expression is increased in some chromosome translocations (e.g. in NHL).

\section*{Evidence of clonality}

A population of cells is considered clonal (derived from a single cell by mitotic division) if they have some or all the following.
- The same acquired chromosome abnormality, e.g. Ph chromosome (see Fig. 20.1) or point mutation within an individual gene.
- Clonal rearrangement of an immunoglobulin or T cell receptor gene in lymphoid neoplasia.
- Restriction in a B-lymphoid neoplasm to expression of only $\lambda$ or $\kappa$ light chains, but not both as in polyclonal B cells.
- Restriction fragment length polymorphism in which the size of a restriction fragment of DNA on the X chromo-
some is analysed. In females, two fragments derived from the two X chromosomes will be found in polyclonal populations, both fragments being transcriptionally active and hypomethylated. In tumours only one size of fragment is hypomethylated as only one X chromosome is active.

\section*{Minimal residual disease (Fig. 19.2)}

At the time of diagnosis of a haematological neoplasm, the patient will have approximately $10^{13}-10^{14}$ malignant cells. Even if treatment results in 1000 -fold reduction of tumour cells, there remain $10^{10}$ cells, which may be below the conventional level of detection. Using modern immunological or molecular techniques, residual malignant cells may be detected in blood or marrow of patients who clinically and by conventional light microscopy are in complete remission.

\section*{Techniques}

These techniques (see Chapter 7) include:
- immunological, particularly if residual malignant cells carry a distinctively abnormal phenotype;
- chromosomal analysis and FISH (p.27); and
- molecular using the polymerase chain reaction, which are the most sensitive (will detect one malignant cell in up to $10^{6}$ normal cells).

\section*{20 Chronic myeloid leukaemia}

This is a clonal myeloproliferative disorder characterized by an increase in neutrophils and their precursors in the peripheral blood with increased cellularity of the marrow as a result of an excess of granulocyte precursors. The leukaemic cells of $>95 \%$ of patients have a reciprocal translocation between the long arms of chromosomes 9 and $22, \mathrm{t}(9 ; 22)$. The derived chromosome 22 is termed the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome (Fig. 20.1). The disease usually transforms from a relatively stable chronic phase to an acute leukaemia phase (blast transformation).

\section*{Aetiology and pathophysiology}

Aetiology is unknown. Exposure to ionizing radiation is a

\caption{Fig.20.1 The Philadelphia chromosome is an abnormal chromosome 22 caused by translocation of part of long arm (q) of chromosome 22 to chromosome 9 , and reciprocal translocation of part of chromosome 9 , including the ABL oncogene, to a specific breakpoint cluster region (BCR) of chromosome 22. A fusion gene results on the derived chromosome 22 which leads to the synthesis of an abnormal protein with tyrosine protein kinase activity that is much greater than that of the normal ABL protein.}
\end{figure}
risk factor. The ABL oncogene is translocated from chromosome 9 into the breakpoint cluster region (BCR) on chromosome 22 to form the BCR-ABL fusion gene (see Fig.20.1) This fusion gene encodes a $210-\mathrm{kDa}$ protein with greatly increased tyrosine kinase activity. The disease is of stem cell origin as the Ph chromosome is present in erythroid, granulocytic, megakaryocytic and T-lymphoid precursors. Rare cases show variant translocations, or are Ph-negative but show the BCR-ABL fusion gene. The Ph chromosome abnormality may also occur in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL; see Chapter 22).

\section*{Clinical features}
- Occurs at all ages (peak age 25-45 years, male/female ratio equal, incidence of 5-10 cases/million population).
- Patients usually present in the chronic phase.
- Presenting symptoms include weight loss, night sweats, itching, left hypochondrial pain, gout.
- Priapism, visual disturbance and headaches caused by hyperviscosity (WBC>250×109/L) are less frequent.
- Splenomegaly, often massive, occurs in over $90 \%$ of cases.
- Some cases are discovered on routine blood test.

\section*{Laboratory findings}
- Raised white cell count (often $50 \times 10^{9} / \mathrm{L}$ or more), mainly neutrophils and myelocytes (Fig. 20.2).
- Basophils may be prominent.
- Platelet count may be raised, normal or low and anaemia may be present.
- Low leucocyte alkaline phosphatase score, raised serum $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ and $\mathrm{B}_{12}$-binding protein (transcobalamin I).
- Raised serum uric acid.

\end{figure}
- Bone marrow is hypercellular with a raised myeloid/ erythroid ratio (see Chapter 1).

\section*{Course and progress}

Patients are typically well during the 'chronic phase'. Main cause of death is transformation into acute leukaemia (Fig. 20.3) ( $80 \%$ AML, $20 \%$ ALL, with a proportion showing a mixed blast cell population), which may occur at any stage, even at presentation. Median survival is currently about 4 years. Staging to predict prognosis has been attempted using age, spleen size, blood blast cell and platelet counts. There may be an accelerated phase in which anaemia, thrombocytopenia, splenic enlargement and marrow fibro-
sis occur. Transformation is usually accompanied by additional morphological and chromosome abnormalities.

\section*{Treatment}

\section*{Chronic phase}
- Hydroxyurea will control the raised white cell count.
- $\alpha$-interferon (IFN) may also control the white cell count and may delay onset of acute transformation, prolonging overall survival by $1-2$ years. The best responders to IFN become Ph-negative, but usually remain BCR-ABLpositive, and have the best prognosis, but must continue IFN. Combination therapies, e.g. IFN + cytosine arabinoside, may be more effective than IFN alone.
- Allopurinol to prevent hyperuricaemia.
- Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) before the age of 50 from an HLA matching sibling offers a $70 \%$ chance of cure in chronic phase but $30 \%$ or less once acceleration has occurred. HLA-matched unrelated donor (MUD) SCT is less successful in curing the disease because of higher morbidity and mortality. Transfusion of donor lymphocytes may be valuable in eliminating BCR-ABLpositive cells in case of relapse post-SCT.
- A specific inhibitor (STI 571) of the tyrosine kinase encoded by BCR-ABL causes the marrow to become Ph negative in a high proportion of cases and may improve the treatment of CML.

\section*{Acute phase}

Therapy as for acute leukaemia, AML or ALL may be given, but the prognosis is poor. The value of STI 571 is under trial.

\section*{21 Myelodysplasia}

This is a clonal disorder of the haemopoietic stem cell characterized by peripheral blood cytopenias affecting more than one lineage in association with a cellular marrow, indicating ineffective haempoiesis.

\section*{Aetiology and pathogenesis}

Myelodysplasia (MDS) may be primary (de novo) or a consequence of previous chemotherapy/radiotherapy (secondary). Various chromosome and oncogene abnormalities occur, e.g. complete or partial deletions of chromosomes 5 or 7, point mutations in RAS oncogenes. The disease is divided into five subgroups (Table 21.1). It may transform to acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) ( $>30 \%$ blasts in the marrow).

\section*{Clinical features}
- Most frequent in the elderly but young adults or even children may be affected.
- Bone marrow failure (see Chapter 18) with anaemia and/or leucopenia and/or thrombocytopenia.
- In chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML), the spleen may be enlarged.
- The 5q-syndrome is a subgroup, occurring particularly in elderly females with a high platelet count, macrocytosis and good prognosis.

\section*{Laboratory findings}
- Anaemia is usually macrocytic.
- Neutropenia is frequent and neutrophils may be hypogranular with pseudo-Pelger forms. Monocytes are increased in CMML to $>1.0 \times 10^{9} / \mathrm{L}$.
- Bone marrow is usually hypercellular but may be hypocellular and/or fibrotic.
- Characteristic morphological changes are seen in all three lineages (Figs21.1-21.4).

\section*{Differential diagnosis}

This is very broad, particularly when only one lineage is involved in an elderly person. Thus, other causes of anaemia, e.g. haematinic deficiency, renal disease, hypothyroidism, anaemia of chronic disease must be excluded; some or all may coexist with MDS. Thrombocytopenia or leucopenia may be caused by drugs, immune destruction or hypersplenism. The hallmark of MDS is involvement of more than one-typically all three-lineage(s). Nevertheless, distinction between MDS, myelofibrosis and aplasia may be difficult in patients with pancytopenia. The finding of a cytogenetic abnormality greatly strengthens what may otherwise be a subjective morphological diagnosis.

\section*{Course and prognosis}

This depends on the type of MDS (see Table 21.1). The degree of cytopenia influences the incidence of complications and treatment, while the percentage of blast cells is predictive of the risk of developing acute leukaemia. Death may be caused by infection, haemorrhage, iron overload from multiple transfusions or from transformation into AML.

\section*{Treatment}
- Support care with red cell or platelet transfusions and antimicrobials may be required.
- Iron chelation therapy may be needed for multiply transfused iron loaded patients with an otherwise good prognosis.
- Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) or

- Younger patients with refractory anaemia with excess blasts (RAEB) and RAEB in transformation (RAEB-t) may be treated as AML. Fludarabine, ara-C, G-CSF $\pm$ idarubicin (FLAG $\pm$ Ida) is a useful form of combination chemotherapy. Complete remissions are less frequent than in de novo AML. Allogeneic SCT (sibling or MUD) may cure younger patients.

\section*{22 Acute leukaemia}

Acute leukaemia is a malignant disorder in which haemopoietic blast cells constitute $>30 \%$ of bone marrow cells. The primitive cells usually also accumulate in the blood, infiltrate other tissues and cause bone marrow failure.

\section*{Classification}

There are two main groups: acute lymphoblastic (ALL); and acute myeloid (myeloblastic) leukaemia (AML). Rare cases are undifferentiated or mixed. Subclassification of ALL or AML depends on morphological, immunological, cytochemical and cytogenetic criteria (Tables 22.1-22.3).

\section*{Aetiology and pathogenesis}

The malignant cells typically show a chromosome translocation or other DNA mutation affecting oncogenes and anti-oncogenes (see Chapter 19). AML may follow previous myeloproliferative or myelodysplastic diseases. In childhood B lineage (common) ALL there is evidence that the first event, a chromosomal translocation, may occur in utero and subsequent events (? infection) precipitate the onset of ALL.

\section*{Incidence}

Approximately 1000 new cases (20-25/million population) each of AML and ALL per year in the UK. ALL is the most common malignancy in childhood (peak age 4 years) but also occurs in adults. AML occurs at all ages but is rarer than ALL in childhood, being most common in the elderly.

\section*{Clinical features}
- Short (<3-month) history of symptoms due to bone marrow failure (e.g. anaemia, abnormal bruising/bleeding or infection). Disseminated intravascular coagulation
(DIC) with bleeding is particularly common in AML M3.
- Increased cellular catabolism may cause sweating, fever and general malaise.
- Lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly are frequent, especially in ALL.
- Tissue infiltration, e.g. of meninges, testes (more common in ALL), skin, bones, gums with hypertrophy (AML M5 or M4) may cause clinical symptoms or signs.

\section*{Laboratory features}
- Anaemia, thrombocytopenia and often neutropenia.
- Leucocytosis caused by blast cells in the blood usually occurs. Leucopenia is less frequent.
- The bone marrow shows infiltration by blast cells ( $>30 \%$ and often $80-90 \%$ of marrow cells).
- Coagulation may be abnormal and DIC can occur, especially with AML M3.
- Serum uric acid, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) may be raised.
- Morphological analysis (Figs22.1-22.12, Table 22.1) usually reveals cytoplasmic granules or Auer rods (condensations of granules) in AML. Cytochemical stains are helpful-AML blasts have granules positive by Sudan black, myeloperoxidase and chloroacetate esterase, while monoblasts are positive for non-specific and butyrate esterase. B-lineage lymphoblasts show blocks of positive material with periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) stain, and in T-lineage ALL with acid phosphatase.
- Immunophenotype analysis involves use of antibodies to identify cell antigens (many termed clusters of differentiation or CD, see Appendix I) which correlate with lineage and maturity (Table 22.2). Other antigens, e.g. TdT, and cytoplasmic immunoglobulin may be also be detected.
- Cytogenetic analysis gives diagnostic and prognostic information (Tables 22.3 and 22.4).

\section*{Treatment}

The first phase of therapy (remission-induction) is with high-dose intensive combination chemotherapy to reduce or eradicate leukaemic cells from the bone marrow and reestablish normal haemopoiesis. Further therapy is postinduction chemotherapy: this may be intensive ('intensification' or 'consolidation' chemotherapy) or less intensive

(maintenance chemotherapy). Each course of intensive treatment typically requires 4-6 weeks in hospital.

\section*{Acute myeloid leukaemia}

Remission induction regimes usually comprise an anthracy-
cline (e.g. daunorubicin), cytosine arabinoside and etoposide or thioguanine. All trans retinoic acid (ATRA) is given concurrently in AML M3 to induce differentiation. More than $80 \%$ of patients under the age of 60 years achieve remission, defined as a normal full blood count and film with $<5 \%$ blasts in bone marrow, with one course and $>85 \%$ with two courses. Older patients and those with preceding MDS or AML secondary to another disease (e.g. myeloproliferative disorder, MPD) have lower remission rates. Three or four further courses are given as postinduction therapy, and other agents used include mitoxantrone, M-AMSA, idarubicin and high dose ara-c.

\section*{Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia}

Remission induction regimes comprise vincristine, prednisolone and l-asparaginase often with daunorubicin, cyclophosphamide. Post-remission therapy is with two or three 'intensification' blocks with additional drugs. Patients then receive maintenance chemotherapy for a further 2 to 3 years with daily mercaptopurine, weekly methotrexate and monthly vincristine and prednisolone.

Central nervous system involvement is common in ALL in children and adults, and normal practice is to give multiple intrathecal injections and courses of high-dose systemic chemotherapy with methotrexate or cranial radiotherapy to prevent or treat this complication.

\section*{Stem cell transplantation (see Chapter 38)}

Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) is usually recommended for patients (<50 years) in first remission of AML and for adults with ALL ( $>20$ years, <50 years) who have a histocompatible sibling. Good prognosis AML (Table 22.3) and ALL (Table 22.4) cases are not usually given SCT in first remission. Autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplant (PBSCT) in some studies has improved cure rate compared to chemotherapy alone in AML and adult ALL in first or subsequent remission.

Complications of chemotherapy and supportive care are considered in Chapter 39; blood component therapy is considered in Chapter 37.

\section*{Prognosis}

\section*{Childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia}

Overall 70\% of children with ALL are cured, the best responses being in girls, aged 2-12 years with low presenting white cell count ( $<10 \times 10^{9} / \mathrm{L}$ ) and favourable cytogenetics (Table 22.4).

\section*{Acute myeloid leukaemia and adult acute lymphoblastic leukaemia}

Approximately $30-40 \%$ of patients are cured but this varies widely according to age and prognostic features.

\section*{23 Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia}

Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is a B-cell clonal lymphoproliferative disease in which lymphocytes accumulate in the blood, bone marrow and often in the lymph nodes and spleen (absolute lymphocyte count $>5.0 \times 10^{9} / \mathrm{L}$ ). A disease of older patients (peak age 72), it is the commonest leukaemia in Western countries (over 70 new cases/million population/year in the UK, male/female ratio $2: 1$ ) but is rare in Asia.

\section*{Aetiology and pathophysiology}

The cause is unknown. Commonest chromosome changes are trisomy 12, a 13q deletion and deletions of 11q including the ataxia telangiectasia gene. Oncogene mutations or dele-
tions occur which may prevent cells from undergoing programmed cell death (apoptosis).

\section*{Clinical features}

Stages depend on clinical and laboratory findings (Fig. 23.1).
- Many cases (Stage A) are symptomless and diagnosed on routine blood test.
- Presenting features include lymphadenopathy (typically symmetrical, painless and discrete), night sweats, loss of weight, symptoms of bone marrow failure.
- Spleen is often moderately enlarged.
- Hypogammaglobulinaemia and reduced cell-mediated immunity predispose to bacterial and viral infection.

\caption{Fig. 23.3 (a) Prolymphocytic leukaemia: blood film. (b) Hairy cell leukaemia: blood film.}
\end{figure}

\section*{Laboratory findings}
- Increased peripheral blood lymphocytes (Fig. 23.2 usually $10-30 \times 10^{9} / \mathrm{L}$ at presentation) which are B cells (CD19, CD22 and also CD5 positive).
- They have weak expression of surface IgM which is monoclonal (expressing only $\kappa$ or only $\lambda$ light chains).
- Serum immunoglobulins are depressed.
- Anaemia and thrombocytopenia may occur due to marrow infiltration or as a result of auto-antibodies.

\section*{Course and prognosis}

Patients may present at an early stage and subsequently remain stationary, progress or may present with late-stage disease. Some patients need no treatment for 10 years or more whilst in others the disease follows an aggressive course. Immunoblastic transformation (Richter's syndrome) may be a terminal event.

\section*{Treatment}
- Observation only for asymptomatic Stage A patients.
- Oral chlorambucil to lower the lymphocyte count and reduce lymph node and spleen size.
- Corticosteroids for bone marrow failure due to infiltration and for autoimmune haemolytic anaemia or thrombocytopenia.
- The purine analogue fludarabine is valuable, either alone or in combination.
- Combination chemotherapy e.g. CHOP (see Chapter 26).
- Support care (Chapter 39).
- Splenectomy or splenic irradiation is useful if the spleen is large and causes symptoms as a result of hypersplenism.

\section*{Variants of chronic Iymphocytic Ieukaemia}

Prolymphocytic leukaemia (PLL, Fig. 23.3a) resembles CLL but usually occurs in older ( $>70$ years) patients, the white cell count is high and responds poorly to treatment.

Hairy cell leukaemia (HCL, Fig. 23.3b) is rare (male/female ratio of 4:1, peak age of 55 years), presents with splenomegaly and pancytopenia. 'Hairy cells' are present in bone marrow and blood. Infections are frequent. They are B cells which stain for tartrate resistant acid phosphatase. Effective treatments include 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine (2-CDA) deoxycoformycin, interferon- $\alpha$ and splenectomy.

T-cell variants of CLL, PLL and HCL are much rarer than B-cell type and are more aggressive.

\section*{24 Myeloma}

Multiple myeloma (MM) is a malignant disorder of plasma cells characterized by:
1 a monoclonal paraprotein in serum and/or urine;
2 bone changes leading to pain and pathological features; and
3 excess plasma cells in the bone marrow.

\section*{Incidence}

Approximately 50 cases/million population; $15 \%$ of lymphoid malignancies; $2 \%$ of all malignancies; twice as common in black than white people; slightly more common in males than females; median age at diagnosis 71 years.

\section*{Aetiology and pathogenesis}

The aetiology is unknown. The cell of origin is probably a postgerminal centre B-lymphoid cell. The cells all secrete the same immunoglobulin (Ig) or Ig component, e.g. part of a heavy chain attached to a light chain or light chain ( $\kappa$ or $\lambda$ ) alone. Rarely ( $<1 \%$ ) the cells are non-secretory. Inter-leukin-6 (IL-6) from myeloma cells themselves or accessory cells promotes plasma cell growth. Tumour necrosis factor (TNF) and IL-1 mediate bone resorption. Oncogene mutations (e.g. ras, p53, myc) and translocations to 14q occur.

\section*{Clinical features}
- Skeletal involvement-bone pain, especially lower backache, or pathological fracture.
- Marrow infiltration-features of bone marrow failure.
- Infection-lack of normal immunoglobulins (immune paresis) and neutropenia.
- Renal failure occurs in up to one-third of patients and is caused by hypercalcaemia, infection, deposition of paraprotein or light chains, uric acid or amyloid.
- Amyloidosis may cause macroglossia, hepatosplenomegaly, cardiac or renal failure, carpal tunnel syndrome and autonomic neuropathy.

\section*{Laboratory features}
- Anaemia is frequent, often with neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) often $>100 \mathrm{~mm} / \mathrm{h}$.
- Blood film shows rouleaux with a bluish background staining, caused by the protein increase. Leuco-erythroblastic picture may be present.
- Bone marrow shows $>10 \%$ plasma cells, often with multinucleate and other abnormal forms (Fig.24.1).
- A paraprotein in serum and/or Bence Jones protein (light chains) in urine with suppression of normal serum immunoglobulins is usual (Fig. 24.2).
- The paraprotein is IgG in $70 \%$; IgA in $20 \%$; IgM is uncommon; IgD and IgE are rare.
- Serum $\beta_{2}$ microglobulin ( $\beta_{2} \mathrm{M}$ ) often raised and higher levels correlate with worse prognosis.
- Serum alkaline phosphatase usually normal.
- X-rays, CT scan or MRI show lytic lesions typically in skull and axial skeleton and/or osteoporosis, often with pathological fractures (Fig.24.3). Occasional patients show localized plasma cell deposits, typically in the axial skeleton (multiple or solitary plasmacytoma).
- Prognostic data include haemoglobin level, serum levels of $\beta_{2} \mathrm{M}$, serum creatinine and extent of skeletal disease.

\section*{Treatment}
- Symptomless patients who are stable with normal blood counts and renal function, no skeletal disease and low levels of paraprotein warrant observation rather than therapy.
- Chemotherapy: induction is usually with melphalan and prednisolone or combination chemotherapy, e.g. Adriamycin, BCNU, cyclophosphamide and melphalan (ABCM) given intermittently every 4-6 weeks.
- Most patients will reach a stable (plateau) phase (clinically well with near normal blood count, <5\% plasma cells in bone marrow, stable paraprotein level) after 4-6 cycles of treatment. This lasts $1-3$ years. $\alpha$-Interferon may prolong duration of plateau phase.
- Intensive therapy, e.g. slow infusions of vincristine, Adriamycin and dexamethasone (VAD), more often ( $>50 \%$ ) leads to complete disappearance of paraprotein and normalization of blood and marrow morphology (complete remission).
- Younger patients (<60 years) may benefit from induction with courses of VAD followed by high-dose chemotherapy, e.g. with high-dose melphalan, followed by autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplant (PBSCT).

biotics and blood components. Bisphosphonates (e.g. sodium clodronate) are useful in reducing skeletal complications and may improve survival. Surgery may be required for complications (e.g. pathological fracture, spinal cord compression). Plasma exchange is helpful in reducing the paraprotein level quickly.

\section*{Related disorders}

Benign monoclonal gammopathy (also termed monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance, MGUS) is an indolent disorder, more common than myeloma and characterized by a low ( $<20 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{L}$ ) and stationary serum level of paraprotein, no reduction in normal immunoglobulins, absence of skeletal abnormalities and of Bence Jones protein and less than $10 \%$ plasma cells in the marrow. It may progress slowly to myeloma in approximately $10-30 \%$ of patients.

Primary amyloidosis also shows less than $10 \%$ marrow plasma cells and no skeletal lesions but Bence Jones protein and low-level serum paraprotein may occur. Treatment as for myeloma may be beneficial.

Solitary plasmacytoma may occur in bone or in soft tissues, a low level of serum paraprotein may occur and some cases later develop myeloma.

Waldenström's macroglobulinaemia is a chronic lymphoproliferative disorder with a median age at diagnosis of 72 years, and is associated with an IgM paraprotein. Hyperviscosity is more common and may cause visual disturbance, central nervous system changes (confusion, impaired conscious level) and headache. Cells resembling plasma cells and lymphocytes are present in the marrow and often in the spleen and lymph nodes.

Plasma cell leukaemia is an aggressive disorder in which large numbers of plasma cells circulate. The prognosis is poor.

\section*{25 Lymphoma I: Hodgkin Iymphoma (Hodgkin's disease)}

Lymphoma is a neoplastic proliferation of lymphoid cells originating in lymph nodes or other lymphoid tissue. It is a heterogeneous group of disorders, divided into Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). Approximately 200 new cases are diagnosed each year per million population, with a ratio of NHL/HL of approximately $6: 1$; the incidence is rising.

\section*{Aetiology and epidemiology}

Hodgkin lymphoma is more prevalent in males than females (M/F ratio 1.5-2.0:1) and has a peak incidence in age range of 15-40 years. The cause is not known, but Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection may be a cofactor.

\section*{Histological classification}

This is well defined and of prognostic significance (see p. 72). Reed-Sternberg (RS) cells are characteristic of HL (Fig. 25.1) but their exact cell of origin is unknown, and RS cells are usually outnumbered by a non-malignant reactive infiltrate of eosinophils, plasma cells, lymphocytes and histiocytes. HL is of B-cell origin.

\section*{Clinical features}
- Enlarged, painless lymphadenopathy (typically cervical) is the characteristic presentation. The nodes often fluctuate in size, and alcohol ingestion may precipitate pain.
- Hepatic and splenic enlargement may occur.
- Systemic symptoms (fever, weight loss, pruritus and drenching night sweats) occur in $25 \%$.
- Extranodal disease is uncommon but lung, CNS, skin and bone involvement may occur.
- Infection caused by defective cell-mediated/humoral immunity (Fig. 25.3).

\section*{Laboratory features}
- Anaemia (normochromic, normocytic).
- Leucocytosis (occasionally eosinophilia).
- Leuco-erythroblastic blood film.
- Raised erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), raised lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)-useful as prognostic marker and for monitoring response-and abnormal liver function tests.

\section*{Staging}

Staging influences both treatment and prognosis. Clinical staging with careful physical examination is followed by cervical thoracic, abdominal and pelvic CT or MRI scanning (Fig. 25.3). Bone marrow aspirate and trephine are performed to detect marrow involvement. The most commonly used staging system is the Cotswold Classification (Fig. 25.4).

\section*{Treatment}

This depends principally on stage.
- Radiotherapy alone may be used for patients with clinical or pathological stage IA or IIA disease with favourable histology.
- Advanced (stages IB, IIB, III and IV) HD should be treated with combination chemotherapy (CCT) using one of the standard regimes (e.g. six cycles of Adriamycin, bleomycin, vinblastine and dacarbazine, ABVD).
- For bulky mediastinal disease, especially common in young females with nodular sclerosing HL, chemotherapy followed by deep X-ray therapy (DXT) (combined modality therapy) may be given and local DXT may be needed for other sites of bulky or resistant disease.

For complications of treatment see Chapter 39.

\section*{Relapsed disease}

Patients who relapse following DXT alone generally have a

very good response to CCT ( $>80 \%$ complete remission (CR) rate). Patients initially treated with chemotherapy who relapse after a remission lasting more than 1 year are likely to achieve CR again, and up to $50 \%$ may be cured with CCT. However, patients relapsing within 1 year of initial therapy, or failing to achieve complete remission, have a poorer prognosis and should be considered for highdose therapy with stem cell rescue (see Chapter 38).

\section*{Prognosis}

Stage is of paramount importance for HL. While $>90 \%$ of stage I and II may be cured, the rate falls progressively to $50 \%$ of stage IV patients. Older patients generally do less well, as do those with lymphocyte-depleted histology.

\section*{26 Lymphoma II: Non-Hodgkin Iymphoma}

The non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHLs) are a diverse group of disorders, which encompass a range of clinical presentations, histological appearances and prognostic categories.

\section*{Aetiology and epidemiology}

Non-Hodgkin lymphoma occurs at all ages, with indolent tumours being most common in the elderly. There is clonal expansion from a normal cell which is 'frozen' at a particular level of differentiation. Most NHLs are B-cell disorders. Environmental factors include abnormal response to viral infection, e.g. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) and human T-cell leukaemia virus (HTLV-1) in adult T-cell leukaemia lymphoma (ATLL), or to bacterial infection (e.g. chronic Helicobactor pylori infection in gastric lymphoma), or to radiation or certain drugs (e.g. phenytoin). Autoimmune disease (e.g. Sjögren's syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis) and immune suppression (e.g. AIDS, post-transplant) also predispose to NHL. Chromosome translocations in NHL involving oncogenes and immunoglobulin genes include $\mathrm{t}(14 ; 18)$ (follicular lymphoma, BCL 2 oncogene) and $t(8 ; 14)$ (BL, MYC oncogene).

\section*{Histological classification}

At least six different classifications for NHL have existed but NHL is now classified as disease entities based on clinical, biological and histological criteria in the REAL system (see p. 72). Membrane marker and molecular studies of NHL show most ( $>80 \%$ ) to be derived from B cells (either follicle centre or from other zones in the lymph node), and the remainder are $T$ cell or unclassified. Indolent NHL may evolve into aggressive disease (Figs 26.1-26.4).

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_09_3fc5c60a4aba104b7634g-069.jpg?height=561&width=843&top_left_y=1744&top_left_x=163}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Fig. 26.1 Low-grade (indolent) NHL: lymph node biopsy showing follicular (nodular) structure.}
\end{figure}

\section*{Clinical features}

\section*{General}
- Similar to Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), including painless lymphadenopathy, hepatic and splenic enlargement, systemic symptoms and infection.
- Extranodal disease is more common in NHL than in HL. Thus, gastrointestinal, central nervous system, skin, endocrine organ (including testes), pulmonary and ocular lymphomas will all have the characteristic presenting features of tumours affecting these organs.

\section*{Clinical features of sub types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma}

Non-Hodgkin lymphoma is clinically heterogeneous, but various clinical patterns emerge.
- Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL)-like: indolent NHL (small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL), follicular lymphoma) is more common in older patients ( $>60$ years), is widely disseminated at presentation and may only warrant observation, not treatment. Variants include some T-cell NHL (T-NHL) (e.g. mycosis fungoides) which affect the skin and splenic marginal zone lymphoma predominantly causing splenomegaly.
- Myeloma-like: bony disease is uncommon but a paraprotein, lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly may occur with lymphoplasmacytoid lymphomas and Waldenström's macroglobulinaemia (see p. 67).
- Gastrointestinal lymphomas include mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma, and T-cell NHL complicating coeliac disease.
- Epidemiology-defined aggressive NHL includes BL (African children, higher incidence in males than females,

jaw tumours, EBV related); ATLL (Caribbean and Japan, hypercalcaemia, skin and lymphoid area involvement; HTLV-1 related) and AIDS-related NHL (usually aggressive and frequent central nervous system disease).

\section*{Laboratory features}

In addition to the changes seen in HL, NHL may cause:
- pancytopenia as a result of bone marrow involvement leading to bone marrow failure;
- peripheral blood lymphocytosis caused by the presence of lymphoma cells in the blood; and
- paraprotein and hypogammaglobulinaemia.

\section*{Staging}

This is of less importance than in HL. More than $50 \%$ of patients with indolent NHL have stage IV disease, whereas aggressive NHL is often of early stage.

\section*{Treatment}

This depends principally on histology. Paradoxically, aggressive tumours respond more dramatically to treatment and are more likely to be cured than indolent tumours; however, they are also more aggressive if untreated, frequently relapse and are associated with higher short- to medium-term mortality.

\section*{Aggressive}

Localized (stage I or II) aggressive NHL, deep X-ray therapy (DXT) with adjuvant combination chemotherapy (CCT) (e.g. three cycles of CHOP, a 21 -day cycle of cyclophosphamide, hydroxy daunorubicin (Adriamycin), vincristine and prednisolone). Advanced stage aggressive NHL is treated with CCT (up to complete remission plus at least two cycles) followed by DXT to sites of bulky disease. Patients with lymphoblastic lymphoma are best treated

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_09_3fc5c60a4aba104b7634g-070.jpg?height=563&width=848&top_left_y=184&top_left_x=1017}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Fig.26.4 High-grade NHL: immunostaining showing positive staining for Ki 67 , indicating high proliferation rate.}
\end{figure}
with the very aggressive CCT regimes used for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia; such patients are candidates for allogeneic stem cell transplantation (see Chapter 38).

\section*{Indolent}

Asymptomatic patients may be followed closely without therapy for months or even years. When treatment is required, options include DXT, single agent chemotherapy (e.g. oral chlorambucil) and CCT with or without DXT. The relapse rate is high. Trials of aggressive chemotherapy followed by stem cell transplantation are in progress for younger patients.

\section*{Relapsed disease}

Over 50\% of NHL patients will relapse after initial therapy. Indolent NHL will typically respond to single agent, CCT or radiotherapy. Relapsed aggressive NHL carries a poor prognosis but may respond to second-line CCT regimes followed by autologous or allogeneic stem cell transplantation.

\section*{New therapies}

The use of monoclonal antibodies, interleukin-2, interferon, new chemotherapeutic agents (e.g. fludarabine, 2-chlorodeoxy-adenosine (2-CDA) in indolent lymphomas) and the use of antisense oligonucleotides to the oncogene BCL-2 are under current investigation.

\section*{Prognosis}

Prognosis in NHL is largely dependent on histology. The presence of bulky disease, multiple sites of extranodal involvement, age, performance status and laboratory parameters, such as LDH level and $\beta 2$ microglobulin level, all influence prognosis. Long-term side effects of therapy are considered in Chapter 39.

\section*{27 Myeloproliferative disorders}

Myeloproliferative disorders (MPD) are chronic diseases caused by clonal proliferation of bone marrow stem cells leading to excess production of one or more haemopoietic lineage (Fig.27.1). The clinical syndromes include polycythaemia rubra vera (red cells), essential thrombocythaemia (platelets), chronic myeloid leukaemia (white cells) and myelofibrosis in which there is a reactive fibrosis of the marrow and extramedullary haemopoiesis in the liver and spleen. Intermediate forms may occur and the diseases may all transform into acute myeloid leukaemia. Their combined overall incidence is 100-150 cases/year/ million population in Europe.

\section*{Polycythaemia}

Polycythaemia (erythrocytosis) is defined as an increase in haemoglobin concentration above normal (Table 27.1). True polycythaemia exists when the total red cell mass (RCM), measured by dilution of isotopically labelled red cells, is increased above normal. Spurious (pseudo or stress) polycythaemia exists when an elevated haemoglobin concentration is caused by a reduction in plasma volume, measured by dilution of isotopically labelled albumin.

- Polycythaemia rubra vera occurs equally in males and females, typically over 55 years of age.
- Raised RCM causes a ruddy complexion (Fig.27.2) and conjunctival suffusion; hyperviscosity may lead to headaches and visual disturbance.
- Thrombosis (e.g. deep vein thrombosis (DVT), BuddChiari syndrome, stroke) are also caused by hyperviscosity and increased platelets.
- Haemorrhage, especially gastrointestinal, may occur.
- Excess histamine secretion from basophils leads to increased gastric acid and peptic ulcer is frequent.
- Pruritus, typically after a hot bath, and gout, caused by increased uric acid production, also occur frequently.
- Enlarged spleen is found in $75 \%$ of patients and distinguishes PRV from other causes of polycythaemia (Fig. 27.3).

\section*{Laboratory features}
- Raised haematocrit, haemoglobin concentration, red cell count and RCM.
- Seventy-five per cent of all patients have raised white cells (neutrophil leucocytosis) and/or platelets.
- Neutrophil alkaline phosphatase (NAP) score, serum $\mathrm{B}_{12}$, serum $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ binding capacity and serum uric acid are all usually raised.

\caption{Fig. 27.2 Polycythaemia rubra vera patient with plethora.}
\end{figure}
- Bone marrow is hypercellular with prominent megakaryocytes, iron stores are depleted because of excessive iron utilization, and the trephine biopsy may show mildly increased reticulin.
- Abdominal ultrasound excludes renal disease and assesses spleen size.

\section*{Differential diagnosis}

Secondary or reactive polycythaemia may occur in conditions where arterial oxygen saturation is reduced, leading to a physiological rise in EPO, or when EPO levels are inappropriately raised (e.g. caused by secretion of EPO by a renal neoplasm).

Spurious (pseudo) polycythaemia arises when plasma volume is reduced by dehydration, vomiting or diuretic therapy. A common form occurs particularly in young male adults, especially smokers, and is associated with stress, increased vasomotor tone and hypertension (Gaisböck's syndrome). The white cell and platelet counts are normal, as is the bone marrow. If the packed cell volume ( PCV ) is over 0.50 , it is treated by venesections; patients should reduce weight, stop smoking, moderate alcohol intake and avoid diuretics.

The following additional tests are occasionally required.
- Chest X-ray; arterial blood gas analysis to exclude lung disease.
- Haemoglobin oxygen dissociation curve to identify a variant haemoglobin with increased oxygen affinity.
- Serum EPO assay.

\section*{Treatment}
- Thrombosis is the main cause of morbidity and mortality and its incidence can be reduced by maintaining the PCV below 0.45 and platelets below $600 \times 10^{9} / \mathrm{L}$. Aspirin ( 75 mg daily) is often used to inhibit platelet function.
- Regular venesection is used initially to lower the PCV.
- Chemotherapy (e.g. oral hydroxyurea) is also usually required.
- ${ }^{32} \mathrm{P}$ is a $\beta$-emitter which is taken up and concentrated by bone and may be used to give prolonged myelosuppression (about 2 years) in older patients.

\section*{Prognosis}

Median survival is about 16 years. Up to $30 \%$ of patients develop myelofibrosis (see below). Acute myeloid leukaemia occurs in up to $5 \%$ of patients, probably increased in patients treated with a ${ }^{32} \mathrm{P}$ and some types of chemotherapy.

\section*{Essential thrombocythaemia}

Essential thrombocythaenia (ET) is defined as persistent elevation of the peripheral blood platelet count as a result of increased marrow production in the absence of a systemic cause for thrombocytosis (Table 27.2).

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_09_3fc5c60a4aba104b7634g-074.jpg?height=1224&width=1009&top_left_y=273&top_left_x=841}

CML, chronic myeloid leukaemia; PRV, polycythaemia rubra vera.

\section*{Aetiology and pathophysiology}

Similar to PRV, distinction between the two conditions is not exact. ET occurs more frequently in younger adults than PRV.

\section*{Clinical features}
- Thrombosis, both arterial (peripheral vessels with gangrene of toes, cerebral, coronary and mesenteric arteries) and venous (e.g. Budd-Chiari syndrome, DVT). Headaches, visual disturbance and peripheral vascular disease occur.
- At least $20 \%$ of patients are asymptomatic and detected as an incidental finding.
- Excessive haemorrhage may occur spontaneously or after trauma or surgery.
- Pruritus and sweating are uncommon.
- Splenomegaly in about $30 \%$ of patients; in others the spleen is atrophied because of infarction.

\section*{Laboratory features}
- Platelet count is persistently raised and often $>1000 \times 109 / \mathrm{L}$, raised red cell and/or white cell count is present in about 30\% (Fig.27.4).
- Blood film shows platelet anisocytosis with circulating megakaryocyte fragments. Autoinfarction of the spleen causes changes in red cells (target cells, Howell-Jolly bodies).
- The NAP score may be raised or normal.
- Serum uric acid is often raised, serum LDH may be raised.
- Bone marrow is hypercellular with increased numbers of megakaryocytes, often in aggregates.
- Defective platelet function, especially defective aggregation in response to adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and adrenaline, may help to distinguish primary from reactive thrombocythaemia.

\section*{Treatment}
- Chemotherapy, e.g. hydroxyurea, is used to maintain the platelet count below $600 \times 10^{9} / \mathrm{L}$.
- $\alpha$-Interferon and oral anagrelide are also effective.
- Aspirin ( 75 mg daily), except in those with haemorrhage.

\section*{Prognosis}

Median survival is more than 20 years; thrombosis and haemorrhage are the main causes of morbidity and mortality. Transformation to AML may occur.

\section*{Myelofibrosis}

Myelofibrosis (myelosclerosis, agnogenic myeloid metaplasia) is characterized by splenomegaly, extramedullary haemopoiesis, a leuco-erythroblastic blood picture and replacement of bone marrow by collagen fibrosis.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_09_3fc5c60a4aba104b7634g-075.jpg?height=571&width=853&top_left_y=1688&top_left_x=117}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Fig.27.4 Essential thrombocythaemia: peripheral blood film showing increased numbers of platelets, giant platelets and changes of hyposplenism because of splenic autoinfarction.}
\end{figure}

\section*{Aetiology and pathophysiology}

Primary defect is within the haemopoietic stem cell; fibrosis results from a reactive non-neoplastic proliferation of marrow stromal cells. One-third of patients have a preceding history of PRV or essential thrombocythaemia.

\section*{Clinical features}
- Sexes affected equally; age of onset rarely below 50 years.
- Massive splenomegaly may lead to left hypochondrial pain and anaemia, leucopenia and thrombocytopenia (hypersplenism) (Fig. 27.5).
- Fever, weight loss, pruritus, hepatomegaly and night sweats are frequent; gout, bone and joint pain are less common.
- Abdominal swelling, ascites and bleeding from oesophageal varices occur, caused by portal hypertension, in late stages.

\section*{Laboratory features}
- Normochromic normocytic anaemia.
- Leucocytosis and thrombocytosis with circulating megakaryocyte fragments occur early; leucopenia and thrombocytopenia later.
- Blood film: red cell poikilocytosis with teardrop forms and circulating red cell and white cell precursors (leucoerythroblastic picture) (Fig. 27.6).
- Serum LDH is raised. Liver function tests are often abnormal because of extramedullary haemopoiesis.
- NAP score, serum $B_{12}$ and $B_{12}$ binding capacity are usually raised.
- Bone marrow aspiration is usually unsuccessful ('dry tap'); the trephine biopsy shows increased cellularity, increased megakaryocytes and fibrosis (Figs 27.7 and 27.8).

\section*{Treatment}
- Chemotherapy (e.g. hydroxyurea) for patients with hypermetabolism and myeloproliferation.
- Supportive therapy with red cell transfusions, folic acid and occasionally platelet transfusions. Iron chelation may be needed.
- Allopurinol to prevent hyperuricaemia and gout.
- Splenectomy or splenic irradiation to reduce symptoms from splenomegaly, anaemia or thrombocytopenia (selected patients only).
- Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation has cured a few younger patients (<50 years).

\section*{Prognosis}

Median survival is about 5 years; acute leukaemia occurs in about 20\%.

\section*{28 Normal haemostasis}

Haemostasis (Fig.28.1) is the process whereby haemorrhage following vascular injury is arrested. It depends on closely linked interaction between:
- the vessel wall;
- platelets; and
- coagulation factors.

The fibrinolytic system and inhibitors of coagulation ensure coagulation is limited to the site of injury.

\section*{The vessel wall}

The intact vessel wall has an important role in preventing haemostasis. Endothelial cells produce:
- prostacyclin, which causes vasodilatation and inhibits platelet aggregation;
- antithrombin (AT) and protein C (PC) activator (thrombomodulin), both of which inhibit coagulation; and
- tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) which activates fibrinolysis.

Injury to the vessel wall: (i) activates membrane bound tissue factor which initiates coagulation (Fig.28.2); and (ii) exposes subendothelial connective tissue allowing binding of platelets to von Willebrand factor (vWF), a large, multimeric protein made by endothelial cells, which mediates platelet adhesion to endothelium and carries clotting factor VIII in plasma.

\section*{Platelets (see Chapter 2)}

Platelets have a large surface area onto which coagulation factors are absorbed. Glycoproteins GPIb and IIb/IIIa allow attachment of platelets to vWF (Fig. 28.3) and hence to endothelium. Collagen exposure and thrombin promote platelet aggregation and the platelet release reaction whereby platelets release their granule contents. Adenosine diphosphate (ADP) promotes platelet aggregation to form a primary haemostatic plug. Platelet prostaglandin synthesis is activated to form thromboxane $A_{2}$ which poten-

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_09_3fc5c60a4aba104b7634g-077.jpg?height=1282&width=1178&top_left_y=1120&top_left_x=145}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Fig.28.1 Haemostasis.}
\end{figure}
tiates the platelet release reaction, promotes platelet aggregation and also has vasoconstrictor activity. Fibrin, produced by blood coagulation, binds to vWF and enmeshes the platelets to form a stable haemostatic plug. Activated platelets promote coagulation, as they have exposed phospholipid binding sites (the prothrombinase complex) which are involved in activation of factor X and of prothrombin to thrombin in the coagulation cascade.

\section*{Coagulation factors}

The proteins of the coagulation cascade are proenzymes (serine proteases) and procofactors which are activated sequentially (Fig. 28.2). The cascade has been divided on
the basis of laboratory tests into intrinsic, extrinsic and common pathways. This division is useful in understanding results of in vitro coagulation tests. In vivo, however, these pathways are closely interlinked. Coagulation begins when tissue factor activated on the surface of injured cells binds and activates factor VII; the complex activates factor IX which, with cofactor VIII, activates factor X to Xa.

Platelets accelerate the coagulation process by providing membrane phospholipid. The complex of Xa and Va , activated from cofactor V by thrombin, acts on prothrombin (factor II) to generate thrombin. Thrombin then converts fibrinogen into fibrin monomers, with release of fibrinopeptides A and B. The monomers combine to form a fibrin

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_09_3fc5c60a4aba104b7634g-078.jpg?height=1298&width=1272&top_left_y=800&top_left_x=355}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Fig.28.2 The coagulation pathway. Injury initiates release of tissue factor (TF). Tissue factor binds and activates factor VII. The TF VIIa complex activates factors $X$ and IX; the activity of the TF VIIa complex is inhibited by TF pathway inhibitor (TFPI). The VIIIa-IXa complex amplifies Xa production from X. Thrombin is generated from prothrombin by the action of $\mathrm{Xa}-\mathrm{Va}$ complex and this leads to fibrin formation. Thrombin also: (i) activates FXI}

Thrombin has a number of key roles in the coagulation process.
1 It converts plasma fibrinogen into fibrin.
2 It amplifies coagulation by: (i) activating factor XI which

\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Fig.28.3 Platelet adhesion. Subendothelial microfibrils bind von Willebrand factor (vWF) which in turn binds platelets at the glycoprotein 1b (GP1b) receptor. This binding exposes the platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa (GPIIb/IIIa) receptor which binds further with vWF. The GPIIb/IIIa receptor also binds fibrinogen to allow platelet-platelet aggregation. The platelet glycoprotein 1a (GP1a) receptor binds directly to collagen.}

increases IXa production; (ii) cleaving factor VIII from its carrier molecule vWF to activate it and augment Xa production; and (iii) activating factor V to factor Va .
3 It activates factor XIII to factor XIIIa, which stabilizes the fibrin clot.
4 It potentiates platelet aggregation.
5 It binds to thrombomodulin on the endothelial cell surface to form a complex which activates protein C, which is involved in regulating coagulation.

\section*{Coagulation regulatory factors}

These inhibit the coagulation cascade and ensure the action of thrombin is limited to the site of injury.
1 Antithrombin inactivates serine proteases, principally factor Xa and thrombin. Heparin activates antithrombin. $2 \alpha_{2}$ Macroglobulins, $\alpha_{2}$ antiplasmin, $\alpha_{2}$ antitrypsin and heparin cofactor II also inhibit circulating serine proteases. 3 Proteins C and S are vitamin K-dependent proteins made in the liver. Protein C is activated via a thrombin-thrombomodulin complex (Fig.32.2) and, like protein S, inhibits coagulation by inactivating factors Va and VIIIa; it also enhances fibrinolysis by inactivating the tissue plasmogen activator (TPA) inhibitor (see Fig.28.4).
4 Tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) inhibits the main in vivo coagulation pathway by inhibiting factor VIIa and Xa.

\section*{The fibrinolytic pathway (Fig. 28.4)}

Fibrinolysis is the process whereby fibrin is degraded by plasmin. A circulating pro-enzyme, plasminogen, may be activated to plasmin:
1 following injury, by TPA and urokinase-like plasminogen activator (UPA) released from damaged or activated cells; or
2 by exogenous agents, e.g. streptokinase, or by therapeutic TPA or UPA.

\section*{Laboratory tests of coagulation}

These are listed in Table 28.1.

\section*{Specialized tests}

Individual coagulation factors can be assayed by functional tests or immunological methods. Platelet function tests include tests of platelet aggregation with different agonists, platelet adhesion and assessment of platelet granule contents. Tests for abnormalities leading to thrombosis (thrombophilia) are described in Chapter 32.

\section*{29 Disorders of haemostasis: vessel wall and platelets}

Defective haemostasis with abnormal bleeding may be caused by:
- abnormalities of the vessel wall;
- thrombocytopenia;
- disordered platelet function; and
- defective blood coagulation (see Chapters 30 and 31).

\section*{Vessel wall abnormalities}

These are associated with easy bruising, purpura and ecchymosis and spontaneous bleeding from mucosal surfaces. The bleeding time, prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) and platelet count are all normal.

\section*{Inherited}
- Hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia. This is autosomal dominant with multiple dilated microvascular swellings, typically in oropharynx (Fig. 29.1) and gastrointestinal tract, which bleed spontaneously or following minor trauma. Local treatment (e.g. nasal packing) may control bleeding; tranexamic acid helps to reduce bleeding. Chronic iron deficiency is frequent.
- Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, Marfan's syndrome and other rare connective tissue disorders.

\section*{Acquired}

Causes include vitamin C deficiency (scurvy), steroid

therapy, normal ageing (senile purpura) and immune complex deposition (e.g. purpura fulminans in septicaemia). Henoch-Schönlein purpura is an allergic vasculitis which follows an acute infection, usually in childhood, and may be associated with arthropathy, haematuria and gastrointestinal symptoms.

\section*{Platelets}

Excessive bleeding caused by thrombocytopenia or disordered platelet function is mucosal (e.g. epistaxis, gastrointestinal bleeding or menorrhagia) or affects the skin (purpura, petechiae and ecchymoses). Symptoms usually occur when the platelet count is $<10 \times 10^{9} / \mathrm{L}$ but this may be higher when there is impaired platelet function.

\section*{Thrombocytopenia (platelets $<140 \times 109 / \mathrm{L}$ ) (Fig. 29.2) Congenital}

This is rare: causes include congenital aplastic anaemia, thrombocytopenia with absent radii (TAR) syndrome or Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (thrombocytopenia with eczema and hypogammaglobulinaemia). Congenital infection (e.g. rubella, cytomegalovirus) frequently leads to thrombocytopenia.

\section*{Acquired}

This is a result of deficient platelet production or accelerated platelet destruction.

\section*{Immune thrombocytopenia}

The platelets are coated with autoantibody (immunoglobulin) and are removed by the macrophages of the reticuloendothelial system. Their lifespan is therefore reduced from 10-14 days to a few hours.

\section*{Autoimmune thrombocytopenia}

\section*{Acute}
- Usually presents in childhood (2-7 years).
- Often follows a viral infection.
- Purpuric rash or epistaxis frequent (Figs 29.3 and 29.4).
- Typically resolves spontaneously. A minority develop mucosal bleeding and should be treated with prednisolone or intravenous immunoglobulin. Up to $20 \%$ develop chronic immune thrombocytopenia.

\section*{Chronic}

Immune thrombocytopenia in adults is less likely to resolve without therapy and usually chronic. It is more common in females (M/F ratio 1:4). Autoantibody is present on the platelet surface and may also be present as free antibody in serum.

\section*{Laboratory findings}
- Normal haemoglobin and white cell count; platelets low, often $<20 \times 10^{9} / \mathrm{L}$.
- Bone marrow is normal or increased numbers of megakaryocytes.
- PT and APTT are normal, fibrinogen is normal.

\section*{Treatment}

Treatment, if necessary, is with the following.
- Prednisolone ( $1 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} /$ day, reducing over $4-6$ weeks).
- Intravenous immunoglobulin is valuable for obtaining a temporary rise in platelet count.
- Splenectomy is required for non-responders with continuing symptoms and/or very low platelet counts.
- Additional immunosuppressive therapy (e.g. azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, cyclosporin A, rhesus anti-D, vincristine) or even combination chemotherapy have been used.
Immune thrombocytopenia also occurs in association with some malignancies (e.g. chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, myelodysplasia), infections (e.g. Epstein-Barr virus, HIV, malaria) and connective tissue disease (e.g. systemic lupus erythematosus). Patients should be tested for ANF and anticardiolipin antibodies.

\section*{Alloimmune thrombocytopenia}

Transplacental passage of maternal antibody in immune thrombocytopenia can lead to neonatal thrombocytopenia, which typically resolves spontaneously over a few weeks. Mothers who have been sensitized (e.g. by blood transfusion or previous pregnancy) to platelet antigens may develop antibodies which cross the placenta and coat fetal and neonatal platelets, which are then removed in the reticuloendothelial system. Individuals with such platelet alloantibodies can also become thrombocytopenic after blood transfusion (post-transfusion purpura). The antibody usually is directed against the HPA1-a antigen on platelets.

\section*{Other causes of thrombocytopenia}

\section*{Drugs}

Drugs cause thrombocytopenia by inhibiting marrow production or by an immune mechanism. The most common immune mechanism (e.g. quinine, heparin) is when the drug forms an antigen with a plasma protein, an antibody is formed to it, and circulating antigen-antibody complexes are absorbed on the platelet surface. Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia is associated with thrombosis.

\section*{Disseminated intravascular coagulation}

This is discussed in Chapter 31.

\section*{Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and haemolytic uraemic syndrome}

Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) and
haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS) are characterized by thrombosis in small vessels, red cell fragmentation, haemolytic anaemia (Fig.29.5) and thrombocytopenia. Renal failure often occurs in HUS and fever, neurological changes and liver dysfunction in TTP. The PT and APTT are normal. TTP is caused by a deficiency-either congenital or acquired from an antibody-of a plasma protease which normally cleaves von Willebrand factor (vWF). Abnormally high molecular weight vWF complexes are present in plasma. Haemolytic uraemic syndrome occurs in childhood and follows infection with verotoxin-producing strains of E. coli; it is also associated with Shigella, Salmonella and streptococcal infection, pregnancy, autoimmune diseases and drugs (e.g. cyclosporin A). The protease levels are normal. TTP is more frequently fatal, occurs in adults

Paraproteinaemia, e.g. myeloma or Waldenström's macroglobulinaemia
and may be associated with autoimmune conditions (e.g. SLE), pregnancy and infection.

Treatment of TTP is with plasma exchange using fresh frozen plasma (FFP) as the replacement fluid. Fresh frozen plasma depleted of cryoprecipitate may be more effective, while FFP which has been solvent treated is less likely to transmit viral infection. Antiplatelet drugs (aspirin or dipyridamole), corticosteroids, splenectomy and vincristine have all been used. Response to treatment may be monitored by haemoglobin level, reticulocytes, lactate dehydrogenase, platelet count, plasma bilirubin and presence of
vWF multimers in plasma. In HUS, treatment for fits, hypertension and renal failure may be needed.

Disorders of platelet function (Table 29.1)
These are characterized by a prolonged bleeding time with normal platelet count and disordered platelet aggregation. Inherited disorders are rare and present with bruising/excessive bleeding after surgery or injury in childhood. The most common acquired cause is aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.

\section*{30 Disorders of coagulation I: Inherited}

Excessive bleeding may occur as a result of an inherited defect of one or other protein involved in coagulation. Inherited deficiency of each of the coagulation factors has been described. The defects are point mutations, deletions or intragenic inversions.

\section*{Factor VIII deficiency (haemophilia A)}

Factor VIII deficiency (haemophilia A) is the most common inherited disorder (approximately 50 cases/million population). The factor VIII gene is on the X chromosome so inheritance is sex-linked (Fig. 30.1). A wide range of genetic changes is described including deletions, insertions and point mutations and a common intragene inversion.

\section*{Clinical features}
- Range from severe spontaneous bleeding, especially into

joints (haemarthroses) and muscles, to mild symptoms (Fig. 30.2).
- Onset in early childhood (e.g. postcircumcision).
- Increased risk of postoperative or post-traumatic haemorrhage.
- Chronic debilitating joint disease caused by repeated bleeds.

\section*{Laboratory features (Table 30.1)}
- Prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), normal prothrombin time (PT), normal bleeding time, plasma factor VIII reduced ( $<1 \%$ of normal in severe cases, but up to $10 \%$ in mild cases).
- Carriers have factor VIII approximately $50 \%$ of normal. DNA analysis is helpful in carrier detection and counselling.
- Von Willebrand factor level is normal.

\section*{Treatment (see also Chapter 37)}
- Infusions of factor VIII concentrate to elevate the patient's level to $20-50 \%$ of normal for severe bleeding.
- Level is raised to and maintained at 80-100\% for elective surgery.
- Desmopressin, an analogue of vasopressin, leads to a modest rise in endogenous factor VIII which is useful in mild cases.
- Avoid aspirin, other antiplatelet drugs and intramuscular injections.
- Patients should be registered with a recognized haemophilia centre and should carry a card with details of their condition.
- Patients may need to have continuing or prophylactic treatment at home.

\end{table}

\section*{Complications of treatment}
- HIV and hepatitis C from impure preparations (prior to the early 1980s), subsequent AIDS, hepatitis and cirrhosis.
- Neutralizing antibodies to factor VIII in $15 \%$ of severe patients may require immunosuppressive therapy, treatment with porcine factor VIII, or plasma exchange.

\section*{Factor IX deficiency (haemophilia B, Christmas disease)}

Factor IX deficiency (haemophilia B, Christmas disease) has similar clinical features to haemophilia A. Also sexlinked, it is four times less common and usually milder than haemophilia A. Diagnosis and treatment are similar to haemophilia A, except that factor IX concentrate is used for treatment and desmopressin is not effective.

\section*{Von Willebrand's disease}

Von Willebrand's disease is usually autosomal dominant, and results from mutations in the von Willebrand factor (vWF) gene. Von Willebrand factor is a large multimeric protein produced by endothelial cells, which carries factor VIII in plasma and mediates platelet adhesion to endothelium (see Chapter 28). The disease is more frequent than haemophilia A; males and females are affected equally.

\section*{Clinical features}
- Bleeding, typically from mucous membranes (mouth, nose bleeds, menorrhagia).
- Excess blood loss following trauma or surgery.
- Haemarthroses and muscle bleeding are rare.

\section*{Diagnosis}
- APTT is prolonged, PT normal.
- Factor VIII and vWF levels are reduced.
- Bleeding time is prolonged.
- Defective platelet function, reduced aggregation with ristocetin.
- Mild thrombocytopenia may occur.

\section*{Treatment}
- Intermediate purity factor VIII concentrate (contains both vWF and factor VIII) for bleeding.
- Desmopressin is helpful for mild bleeding.
- Fibrinolytic inhibitors (e.g. tranexamic acid) are helpful.
- Carrier detection and antenatal diagnosis based on fetal DNA analysis is now available.

\section*{Other conditions}

Factor XI deficiency has an incidence of approximately 10 cases/million population (higher among Ashkenazi Jews) and is autosomal recessive. There is poor correlation between factor XI levels and symptoms. It is generally mild, but severe spontaneous and postsurgical bleeding may occur. Congenital deficiencies of factor II, V, VII, X and XIII are rare and usually cause mild bleeding disorders. Factor XII deficiency prolongs the APTT but does not cause clinical symptoms. Fibrinogen deficiency occurs as a moderately severe autosomal recessive disorder. Dysfibrinogenaemia (presence of a functionally abnormal molecule) is both a rare autosomal dominant disorder and a more common acquired disorder (liver disease, malignancy and systemic lupus erythematosus).

\section*{31 Disorders of coagulation II: Acquired}

\section*{Liver disease}

Liver disease leads to defects of coagulation, platelets and fibrinolysis.
- Reduced synthesis of vitamin K dependent factors (II, VII, IX, X, proteins C and S) caused by impaired vitamin K absorption (biliary obstruction).
- Impaired synthesis of other coagulation proteins (factor I and V).
- Thrombocytopenia (hypersplenism) and abnormal platelet function (cirrhosis).
- Fibrinolysis impaired.
- Reduced levels of proteins C and S , antithrombin and $\alpha_{2}$ antiplasmin lead to susceptibility to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).
- Dysfibrinogenaemia may lead to haemorrhage or thrombosis.

\section*{Disseminated intravascular coagulation (Fig. 31.1)}

Release of procoagulant material into the circulation or endothelial cell damage causes generalized activation of the coagulation and fibrinolytic pathways leading to widespread fibrin deposition in the circulation.

\section*{Clinical features}
- Both bleeding and thrombosis may occur.
- Tissue damage caused by thrombosis leads to necrosis and further activation of coagulation and fibrinolysis.
- Purpura, ecchymoses, gastrointestinal bleeding, bleeding from intravenous sites and following venepuncture may occur as a result of low levels of coagulation factors and platelets resulting from increased consumption.
- Renal function may be impaired due to microvascular thrombosis.

APTT, activated partial thromboplastin time; DIC, disseminated intravascular coagulation; FDP, fibrin degradation products; N, normal; PT, prothrombin time; RBC, red blood cell; TT, thrombin time.
- Other manifestations include acute respiratory distress syndrome (both a cause and complication of DIC), adrenal necrosis, shock and thromboembolism.

\section*{Laboratory features (Table 31.1)}
- Thrombocytopenia.
- Nearly all tests of coagulation and fibrinolysis are abnormal with low levels of fibrinogen.
- Fibrin degradation products (e.g. X-DP or FDP) are present in plasma ( $\mathrm{X}=$ clotting factor).
- Blood film: microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia (see Chapter 15) may occur.

\section*{Treatment}
- Treat the cause, e.g. antibiotics, removal of the procoagulant stimulus (e.g. a dead fetus).
- Supportive therapy with fresh frozen plasma, platelet concentrates and cryoprecipitate if bleeding is dominant.
- Anticoagulant therapy (e.g. heparin) if thrombosis is dominant.
- Protein C and antithrombin in selected patients.

\section*{Other acquired disorders of coagulation}

\section*{Drugs}
- Anticoagulants and drugs affecting anticoagulation (see Chapter 33) are the most common drugs to disturb coagulation.
- Chemotherapy (e.g. l-asparaginase may lead to thrombosis).

\section*{Acquired coagulation inhibitors}

These antibodies to coagulation factors are idiopathic, commoner in the elderly, or occur in malignancy (e.g. lymphoma), connective tissue disease (e.g. SLE) and with paraproteins (e.g. myeloma). They lead to excessive bleeding, both spontaneously and following injury.

\section*{Vitamin K deficiency}

Vitamin K is required to activate factors II, VII, IX and X and protein C and S by $\gamma$ carboxylation (see Chapter 33). It is fat-soluble and derived from vegetables in food and intestinal flora. Deficiency occurs in patients on poor diets, those taking broad-spectrum antibiotics which reduce the gut flora, in biliary tract disease and with intestinal malabsorption.

\section*{Haemorrhagic disease of the newborn}

Newborn infants are at an increased risk of bleeding because of hepatic immaturity and low levels of vitamin K . It is customary to give an injection of vitamin $\mathrm{K}(1 \mathrm{mg})$ to all newborn infants in the UK. Fears that this may lead to an increased risk of cancer have not been substantiated.

\section*{32 Thrombosis and thrombophilia}

\section*{Thrombosis}

Thrombosis is the pathological process whereby platelets and fibrin interact with the vessel wall to form a haemostatic plug to cause vascular obstruction. It may be arterial, causing ischaemia, or venous leading to stasis (Fig.32.1). The thrombus may be subsequently lysed by fibrinolysis, organize, recanalize or embolize. Thrombosis underlies ischaemic heart, cerebrovascular and peripheral vascular disease; venous occlusion and pulmonary embolism; and it plays an important part in pre-eclampsia.

\section*{Arterial thrombosis (Table 32.1)}

This occurs in relation to damaged endothelium, e.g. atherosclerotic plaques. Exposed collagen and released tissue factor cause platelet aggregation and fibrin formation.

\section*{Venous thrombosis (Table 32.2)}

Factors affecting blood flow (e.g. stasis, obesity), alterations in blood constituents and damage to vascular endothelium (e.g. caused by sepsis, surgery or indwelling catheters) are important risk factors.

\section*{Thrombophilia}

Thrombophilia is a congenital or acquired predisposition to thrombosis. It should be suspected and screened for in patients who are young, have a positive family history, have a thrombosis in an unusual site and in females with recurrent fetal loss.

\begin{figure}

\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Fig. 32.1 Thrombosis: venogram showing filling defects due to a deep vein thrombus in a patient with polycythaemia.}
\end{figure}

\section*{Inherited thrombophilia}

This has been increasingly recognized recently (Tables 32.1 and 32.2 ; Fig. 32.2). Presentation may be during early childhood or in adulthood, e.g. at commencement of oral contraceptives or during pregnancy/puerperium. Inheritance of a variant form of factor V (factor V Leiden) is the most common (up to $5 \%$ of the population). Activated factor V Leiden is relatively resistant to inactivation by protein C . The risk of thrombosis is increased 5- to 10 -fold in heterozygotes, and 50- to 100 -fold in homozygotes. Rarer causes include protein C , protein S or antithrombin deficiency or functional abnormality, defective fibrinolysis (e.g. TPAI deficiency, see Chapter 28), mutant prothrombin and homocystinuria. The combination of two abnormalities often underlies severe cases.

\section*{Acquired thrombophilia}

Acquired hypercoagulable states are listed in Tables 32.2 and 32.3. Pathogenesis, e.g. in pregnancy, oral contraceptive pill therapy and malignancy, is multifactorial and relates to elevated levels of procoagulant factors, depressed levels of inhibitor proteins and physical factors (e.g. stasis, surgery).

\section*{Lupus anticoagulant syndrome}

Despite its name, this syndrome usually presents with arterial or venous thrombosis or recurrent miscarriages. It may be associated with systemic lupus erythematosus or other connective tissue disorders, with malignancy or infections or be idiopathic. Patients may show a spectrum of antibodies which interfere with phospholipid-dependent coagulation tests in vitro and/or react with cardiolipin. The APTT is prolonged and not corrected by a $50: 50 \mathrm{mix}$ of normal plasma in patient plasma. Anticoagulant therapy is needed for patients with thrombosis.

\section*{Antiplatelet therapy}

The use of heparin and warfarin is discussed in Chapter 33. Antiplatelet drugs (see Chapter 2, Fig. 2.8) and fibrinolytic drugs are discussed here.
- Aspirin ( 75 mg daily and 300 mg post myocardial infarc-
tion) is most widely used. It inhibits platelet function by inhibiting cyclo-oxygenase thus reducing thromboxane $\mathrm{A}_{2}$ production.
- Others: ticlopidine and monoclonal antibodies directed to platelet glycoproteins (e.g. GP IIb/IIIa) are used, for example, post angiography.

\section*{Indications}

Prevention of thrombosis in patients with:
- previous myocardial infarction, transient ischaemic attacks and stroke or high risk of first myocardial infarct in males;
- thrombocytosis, e.g. myeloproliferative disorders, post splenectomy;
- prosthetic valves and post coronary artery surgery or angioplasty;
- pre-eclampsia; and
- severe peripheral vascular disease.

\section*{Fibrinolytic therapy}

This is used to enhance conversion of plasminogen to plasmin (see Chapter 28, Fig.28.4), which degrades fibrin. They must be used within 5-7 days for venous thrombi and $5-7 \mathrm{~h}$ for arterial thrombi.
- Streptokinase directly activates plasminogen. Most individuals have antistreptococcal antibodies; a loading dose is therefore required and treatment becomes ineffective after 4-10 days.
- Urokinase has a similar action but may be used if there are high levels of antistreptococcal antibodies. Single chain urokinase-type plasminogen activator (SCU-PA) has also been developed.
- Acylated plasminogen streptokinase activator complex (APSAC) activates streptokinase bound to plasminogen.
- Recombinant tissue plasminogen activation (TPA) causes activation of fibrin-bound plasminogen only, and is associated with less systemic activation of fibrinolysis.

\section*{Indications}
- Acute myocardial infarction: streptokinase is usually given with 300 mg aspirin and heparin intravenously.
- Treatment of arterial and venous thrombosis, e.g. pulmonary embolism, peripheral arterial or venous thrombosis.

\section*{Contraindications}
- Patients with active gastrointestinal bleeding, aortic dissection. head injury or recent (<2 months) neurosurgery, and bleeding diathesis.

\section*{Side effects}
- Bleeding, especially in patients taking anticoagulants or antiplatelet drugs.
- Anaphylactic reactions may occur with streptokinase.

\section*{Anticoagulation}

\section*{Heparin}

Heparin is a mucopolysaccharide which is not absorbed orally and is therefore given subcutaneously or intravenously. It activates antithrombin (AT) which irreversibly inactivates prothrombin $\mathrm{Xa}, \mathrm{IXa}$ and XIa. It also impairs platelet function. Unfractionated heparin (UFH) is a heterogeneous mixture of polysaccharide chains. Low-molecular-weight (LMW) heparin preparations (MW $<5000$ ) have a greater ability to inactivate Xa and less effect on thrombin (Fig. 33.1) and platelet function, and therefore have a lesser tendency to cause bleeding. They have a longer plasma half-life so that once daily subcutaneous administration is effective in prophylaxis. They also interact less than UFH with endothelium, plasma proteins, macrophages and platelets making their action more predictable.

\section*{Indications}
- Acute venous thrombosis, e.g. deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). Continuous intravenous infusion of UFH for 5-7 days until warfarinized.

Subcutaneous LMW heparin is equally effective. Warfarin is usually started 1-2 days after heparin.
- Unstable angina, post myocardial infarction.
- Disseminated intravascular coagulation if this is dominated by thrombosis.
- Acute peripheral arterial occlusion.
- Prophylaxis of DVT in surgical patients, e.g. 5000 units UFH b.d. (LMW heparin 2000-5000 units once daily).
- Thrombosis prophylaxis in patients undergoing cardiac surgery or renal dialysis.
- Pregnancy. As warfarin is teratogenic, heparin is used in the first trimester of pregnancy when anticoagulation is needed.
- Maintaining patency of indwelling lines and catheters.

\section*{Monitoring}

For continuous intravenous infusion, the APPT should be maintained at $1.5-2 \times$ normal. LMW heparin therapy is not normally monitored; if necessary, e.g. in renal failure or in those of very low ( $<50 \mathrm{~kg}$ ) or high ( $>80 \mathrm{~kg}$ ) body weight, by factor Xa assay.

\begin{figure}

}

\section*{Side effects}
- Haemorrhage, particularly if combined with antiplatelet therapy, overdosage or, rarely, platelet function defect. Heparin has a short half-life ( 1 h ); levels fall rapidly when infusion stopped. Protamine sulphate will reverse heparin immediately, but must be used with caution as it can cause haemorrhage at high dosage.
- Long-term therapy ( $>2$ months) can lead to osteoporosis.
- Thrombocytopenia, which is antibody-mediated, may lead to platelet clumping with arterial thrombosis.
- LMW heparin is less likely to cause all these side effects.

\section*{Warfarin}

Vitamin K promotes the $\gamma$ carboxylation of glutamic acid residues of factor II, VII, IX and X; warfarin prevents this to cause a $50 \%$ drop of factor VII levels within 24 h and of factor II in 4 days. Full anticoagulation occurs $48-72 \mathrm{~h}$ after starting warfarin therapy. Non-carboxylated factors II, VII, IX and X (proteins formed in vitamin K absence, PIVKAs) appear in plasma (see Fig. 33.2). Protein C and S levels also fall and this initially (first $2-3$ days) leads to an increased risk of thrombosis and may lead to skin necrosis.

\section*{Control of therapy}

The PT is measured and expressed as an international normalized ratio (INR) against the mean normal PT using a calibrated thromboplastin. Treatment is monitored by maintaining the INR at 2.0-3.5, precise level depending on indication.

\section*{Indications}
- Treatment of DVT, pulmonary embolism, systemic embolism (3-6 months therapy).
- Prophylaxis against thrombosis in patients with atrial fibrillation, prosthetic valves, arterial grafts, repeated pulmonary embolism and in patients with inherited or acquired predisposition.
- Low doses (to maintain INR 1.5) of value in prevention of myocardial infarct in high-risk groups.
- Warfarin crosses the placenta and is teratogenic in early pregnancy; heparin is given in pregnancy.

\section*{Side effects}
- Haemorrhage-especially in patients taking other anticoagulants, antiplatelet drugs or thrombolytic therapy, and in those with liver disease.

\section*{Drug interactions}

Warfarin is highly bound to albumin and is metabolized by the liver. The minor unbound fraction is active. Action is increased by drugs which:

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_09_3fc5c60a4aba104b7634g-092.jpg?height=743&width=843&top_left_y=176&top_left_x=1012}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Fig.33.2 Action of warfarin.}
\end{figure}
- reduce its binding to albumin, e.g. aspirin, sulphonamides;
- inhibit hepatic metabolism, e.g. allopurinol, tricyclic antidepressants, sulphonamides;
- decrease absorption of vitamin K, e.g. antibiotics, laxatives;
- decrease synthesis of vitamin K factors, e.g. high-dose salicylates.

Action is decreased by drugs which:
- accelerate its metabolism, e.g. barbiturates, rifampicin; and
- enhance synthesis of coagulation factors, e.g. oral contraceptives, hormone replacement therapy.

\section*{Reversal of action}

Patients with haemorrhage and a raised INR should receive fresh frozen plasma or concentrates of factors II, VII, IX and X. If severe, also vitamin K ( 10 mg i.v.) but this results in resistance to warfarin for 2-3 weeks. Raised INR without haemorrhage is managed by withholding therapy for 1-2 days and repeating the INR.

\section*{Other anticoagulant drugs}

The identification of thrombin receptors is likely to lead to development of receptor antagonist drugs. Hirudin (formerly purified from leech extracts, now available as a recombinant product) is a specific direct inhibitor of thrombin licensed for use in adults who cannot receive heparin (e.g. because of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia).

\section*{34 Haematological aspects of systemic disease I: Inflammation—malignancy}

A wide range of abnormalities affecting red cells, white cells, platelets and coagulation factors occur in association with systemic illness.

\section*{Anaemia of chronic disease}
- Anaemia of chronic disease (ACD) is a common normochromic or mildly hypochromic anaemia, occurring in patients with a systemic disease (Table 34.1). Moderate anaemia occurs (haemoglobin level $>9.0 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dL}$, severity of anaemia correlating with severity of underlying disease).
- Reduced serum iron and total iron binding capacity.
- Normal or raised serum ferritin with adequate iron stores in the bone marrow but stainable iron absent from erythroblasts.

\section*{Pathogenesis}

Increased levels of cytokines, especially IL-1, IL-6, tumour necrosis factor and interferon- $\gamma$, which interact with accessory marrow stromal cells, macrophages and erythroid progenitors to reduce erythropoiesis, iron utilization and response to erythropoietin (EPO).

\section*{Treatment}
- Therapy of the chronic disease gradually reduces levels of mediator cytokines.
- Recombinant EPO may improve anaemia in patients with, for example, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), cancer and myeloma.

Table 34.1 Conditions associated with anaemia of chronic disorders.

\section*{Chronic infections}

Especially osteomyelitis, bacterial endocarditis, tuberculosis, chronic abscesses, bronchiectasis, chronic urinary tract infections, HIV, AIDS, malaria

\section*{Other chronic inflammatory disorders}

Rheumatoid arthritis, polymyalgia rheumatica, systemic lupus erythematosus, scleroderma, inflammatory bowel disease, thrombophlebitis

\section*{Malignant diseases}

Carcinoma, especially metastatic or associated with infection, lymphoma

\section*{Others}

Congestive heart failure, ischaemic heart disease

\section*{Malignancy}

\section*{Anaemia}
- Anaemia of chronic disease affects almost all cancer patients at some stage.
- Blood loss in gastrointestinal and gynaecological malignancies.
- Autoimmune haemolytic anaemia (AIHA), especially in lymphoma.
- Microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia (see Chapter 15) may occur with disseminated mucin-secreting adenocarcinoma.
- Leuco-erythroblastic anaemia indicates marrow infiltration by tumour (Fig. 34.1).
- Red cell aplasia is associated with thymoma, lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia.

\section*{Other causes}

Chemotherapy or radiotherapy-induced inhibition of bone marrow. Folate deficiency as a result of poor diet and widespread disease.

\section*{Polycythaemia}

Tumour cells may produce EPO or EPO-like peptides in renal cell carcinoma, hepatoma and uterine myoma (see Chapter 27).

\section*{White cell changes}

Cancer patients frequently have opportunistic infections or bleed, which raises white cells (usually neutrophils), or receive chemotherapy or radiotherapy, which lowers them.

Thrombocytopenia may be due to decreased production (e.g. extensive marrow infiltration, chemotherapy or radiotherapy), accelerated peripheral destruction (e.g. disseminated intravascular coagulation, DIC) and/or hypersplenism (Figs34.2-34.4). Immune thrombocytopenia may occur especially with lymphoma.

Thrombocytosis is a frequent reactive phenomenon in malignancy.

\section*{Coagulation changes}

Activation of both coagulation and fibrinolysis may predispose to either haemorrhage or thrombosis. Chronic DIC (e.g. with pancreatic carcinoma) causes thrombosis, includ-

\end{figure}
ing migratory thrombophlebitis (Trousseau's syndrome). Circulating anticoagulants (e.g. acquired von Willebrand factor inhibitors) and specific coagulation factor inhibitors may occur.

\section*{Connective tissue disorders \\ Anaemia}
- Anaemia of chronic disease is common. Iron deficiency may coexist in patients with gastrointestinal haemorrhage caused by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents.
- Autoimmune haemolytic anaemia occurs in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), RA and mixed connective tissue disorders (CTD).
- Red cell aplasia occurs in SLE.

\section*{White cells}

Inflammation leads to neutrophilia. Neutropenia with splenomegaly occurs in patients with RA (Felty's syndrome). Antibody and immune-complex mediated neutrophil destruction and decreased neutrophil production in the marrow may also occur in SLE. Eosinophilia may occur in SLE, RA and polyarteritis nodosa.

\section*{Platelets}

Thrombocytopenia may be immune (SLE, rather than scleroderma and RA). Thrombocytosis is a non-specific reactive phenomenon to inflammation in CTD.

\section*{Coagulation changes}

These may be caused by associated renal disease, drug therapy, DIC and specific coagulation factor inhibitors. The lupus anticoagulant occurs in approximately $10 \%$ of patients with SLE (see Chapter 32).

\section*{35 Haematological aspects of systemic disease II: Renal, liver, endocrine-pregnancy}

\section*{Renal disease}

\section*{Anaemia}

Acute or chronic renal failure causes a normochromic normocytic anaemia, with reduced erythropoietin (EPO) levels-the main cause of anaemia-and ecchinocytes (burr cells) in the blood film (Fig.35.1). Iron deficiency (blood loss) and haemolysis in haemolytic uraemic syndrome and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura are other causes. Erythropoietin corrects anaemia up to a haemoglobin level of $12 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dL}$. A poor response to EPO occurs with iron or folate deficiency, haemolysis, infection, occult malignancy, aluminium toxicity, hyperparathyroidism and inadequate dialysis. Hypertension and thrombosis of an arteriovenous fistula may occur with EPO therapy.

\section*{Polycythaemia}

Polycythaemia may occur with renal tumours or cysts.

\section*{Haemostatic abnormalities}

Coagulation factors II, XI or XIII may be reduced and platelet function is impaired (predispose to bleeding), whereas low levels of protein C, AT or plasminogen may lead to thrombosis.

\section*{Endocrine disease}

\section*{Anaemia}

Both hyper- and hypothyroidism cause mild anaemia (mean corpuscular volume, MCV, raised in hypothyroidism, low in thyrotoxicosis). Deficiencies of iron, as a

\end{figure}
result of menorrhagia or achlorhydria, or $\mathrm{B}_{12}$, (increased incidence of PA in hypothyroidism, hypoadrenalism and hypoparathyroidism), may complicate the anaemia. Antithyroid drugs (carbimazole and propylthiouracil) can cause aplastic anaemia or agranulocytosis.

\section*{Liver disease}

\section*{Anaemia}

This may be caused by anaemia of chronic disease, haemodilution (increased plasma volume), pooling of red cells (splenomegaly) and haemorrhage (e.g. caused by oesophageal varices). The MCV is raised, particularly in alcoholics, and target cells, ecchinocytes and acanthocytes occur in the blood film (Fig. 35.2). Haemolysis and hypertriglyceridaemia with alcoholic liver disease (Zieve's syndrome) is rare. Direct toxicity of copper for red cells causes haemolysis in Wilson's disease. Viral hepatitis, including hepatitis $\mathrm{A}, \mathrm{B}$ and C and hepatitis viruses yet to be characterized, may lead to aplastic anaemia. Platelets may be low (hypersplenism or DIC). Coagulation abnormalities are discussed in Chapter 31.

\section*{Platelets and haemostasis}

See Table 31.1 and Chapter 31.

\section*{Haematological aspects of pregnancy}

\section*{Anaemia}

Plasma volume increases by up to $50 \%$ during first and second trimesters, whereas red cell mass (RCM) increases by only $20-30 \%$. Haemodilution results (haemoglobin falls to a mean $10.5 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dL}$ between 16 and 40 weeks). A

physiological rise in MCV of 5-10fl occurs. Increase in RCM, iron transfer to the fetus and blood loss during labour together require about 1000 mg of iron, so that iron deficiency is frequent. Folate requirements rise because of increased catabolism. Early supplementation (e.g. $400 \mu \mathrm{~g}$ daily) reduces risk of megaloblastic anaemia and of fetal neural tube defects (see Chapter 12). The serum $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ level falls below normal in $20-30 \%$ of pregnant women, to
rise again spontaneously post delivery. Autoimmune haemolytic anaemia in pregnancy is typically severe and refractory to therapy. Haemolytic anaemia with elevated liver enzymes and low platelets (HELLP syndrome) and epigastric pain may occur in the last trimester. Disseminated intravascular coagulation may accompany HELLP syndrome and induction of labour or caesarean section is often necessary.

\section*{White cells}

Mild neutrophil leucocytosis with a left shift.

\section*{Platelets}

Gestational thrombocytopenia complicates $8-10 \%$ of pregnancies, is mild (platelets $80-150 \times 10^{9} / \mathrm{L}$ ) and is not associated with neonatal thrombocytopenia or significant bleeding. Maternal immune thrombocytopenic purpura may antedate pregnancy or present during it, and is associated with increased levels of platelet-associated IgG or serum platelet autoantibodies. Management includes no therapy (absence of bleeding, platelets $>50 \times 10^{9} / \mathrm{L}$ ), corticosteroids or intravenous immunoglobulin, which also crosses placenta to elevate fetal count. Thrombocytopenia occurs in pre-eclampsia (mechanism unknown); low-dose aspirin therapy may reduce platelet consumption.

\section*{Coagulation changes}

Coagulation changes (Table 35.1) combine to give an increased risk of thrombosis and DIC. This occurs in up to $40 \%$ of cases of abruptio placenta, leading to haemorrhage and shock. Retention of a dead fetus usually leads to chronic low-grade DIC with onset over 1-2 weeks. Venous stasis resulting from the gravid uterus combines with these changes to make pregnancy a hypercoagulable state; operative delivery imposes an additional risk.

36 \\ Haematological aspects of systemic disease III: Infection, amyloid
}

\section*{Infections}

\section*{Viruses}

\section*{Anaemia}

Autoimmune haemolytic anaemia may occur, especially in infectious mononucleosis, usually of cold type. B19 parvovirus causes erythema variegata or fifth disease in children and leads to transient red cell aplasia in patients with haemolytic anaemias (aplastic crisis). Anaemia occurs with pancytopenia in virus-associated bone marrow aplasia (hepatitis viruses, HIV and cytomegalovirus in organ transplant recipients). Microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia (MAHA) with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) may occur.

\section*{White cells}

Typically neutropenia with lymphopenia or lymphocytosis (see Chapter 8) occurs.

\section*{Platelets}

Thrombocytopenia may be immune (e.g. infectious mononucleosis, HIV) caused by bone marrow aplasia, or by increased consumption-disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), haemophagocytosis (Fig. 36.1), haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS) and TTP. Reactive thrombocytosis can also occur.

\section*{Bacterial, fungal and protozoal infection \\ Anaemia}

Anaemia of chronic disease is frequent. Haemolytic anaemia may be immune (e.g. cold antibodies with anti-I specificity in mycoplasma infection) or non-immune (e.g. direct red cell invasion, Bartonella bacilliformis; or toxinmediated, Clostridium perfringens and Staphylococcus aureus). Disseminated intravascular coagulation and MAHA may occur. Haemolytic uraemic syndrome may follow infection by verotoxin-producing strains of

Escherichia coli, Salmonella, Shigella and Campylobacter. Blood loss can occur with Helicobacter pylori and ankylostoma infections.

\section*{White cells}

Neutrophilia is most common (see Chapter 8).

\section*{Platelets}

Thrombocytosis is frequently reactive. Thrombocytopenia may also occur, caused by immune destruction, circulating immune complexes, decreased platelet production and DIC in severe bacterial, fungal and rickettsial infection.

\section*{Haemostasis}

Disseminated intravascular coagulation may dominate the clinical picture in certain infections, e.g. bacterial meningitis.

\section*{Malaria (Fig. 36.2)}

Anaemia is caused by haemolysis (cellular disruption and haemoglobin digestion), splenic sequestration, haemodilution (raised plasma volume) and ineffective erythropoiesis. Malarial antigens attached to red cells may cause immune haemolysis. Acute intravascular haemolysis with haemoglobinuria and renal failure (blackwater fever) occurs rarely in Plasmodium falciparum infection. Anaemia of chronic disease (ACD) may also occur. Eosinophilia is variable. Thrombocytopenia (in up to $70 \%$ of $P$. falciparum infections) may be caused by immune destruction, splenic sequestration and DIC.

\section*{Leishmaniasis}

\section*{Amyloid}

Amyloidosis is the tissue deposition of a fibrillary homogeneous eosinophilic protein material which is birefringent and stains with Congo red. It is classified into:
- amyloid derived from clonal lymphocyte or plasma cell proliferation (AL) (e.g. myeloma, primary amyloidosis) when immunoglobulin light chains or components of them are deposited (see Chapter 24); and
- reactive amyloidosis (AA) which occurs when serum amyloid A protein, an apolipoprotein, is deposited in chronic inflammatory disease (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis,

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_09_3fc5c60a4aba104b7634g-098.jpg?height=567&width=845&top_left_y=168&top_left_x=1015}

\end{figure}
inflammatory bowel disease) or chronic infection (tuberculosis, leprosy, osteomyelitis and bronchiectasis). Familial Mediterranean fever is a chronic inflammatory disease often affecting the kidneys and joints in which amyloidosis is a frequent complication.

Localized amyloid occurs in, for example, endocrine organs or skin in old age (Fig.36.4), with deposition of protein A , hormones and other constituents.

Amyloid P protein is a serum protein related to C -reactive protein which is deposited in both AL or AA types of amyloid. Amyloid deposition leads to organ enlargement and dysfunction. Tissues involved include kidneys, heart, skin, tongue, endocrine organs, liver, spleen, gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts and the autonomic nervous system. Diagnosis is made by biopsy of tongue, gums or rectum with special staining.

\section*{37 Blood transfusion}

Whole blood or plasma is collected from volunteer donors. Over $90 \%$ of the donated blood is separated to allow use of individual cell components and plasma from which specific blood products can be manufactured (Fig. 37.1).

In the UK blood donors are healthy volunteers, aged 18-70 years, who are not on medication, have had no serious previous illnesses and are at low risk for transmitting infectious agents. Drug abusers, haemophiliacs, those who have recently travelled outside Europe or lived in Africa-where malaria or AIDS may be endemic-and their sexual partners are excluded. Donors are screened for anaemia and venesected 2-3 times each year.

Donated blood is routinely tested:
- for hepatitis B and C, HIV I and II, HTLV-I and II, Treponema pallidum;
- serologically to determine the blood group (A, B or O) and Rh C, D and E type; and
- selective testing for antibodies to cytomegalovirus (CMV) is used to identify donations which are CMVnegative and thus suitable for certain patients.

\section*{Blood grouping and compatibility testing \\ Red cells}

Red cells have surface antigens which are glycoproteins or

\begin{figure}

\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Table 37.1 Red cell antigens and antibodies. Incidence in UK individuals given in brackets.}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline Cell antigens & Naturally occurring antibodies (usually IgM) & Antibodies only occurring after sensitization ('atypical' or immune (usually IgG)) \\
\hline A (40\%) & Anti-B & \\

\end{table}
glycolipids (Table 37.1). Individuals lacking a red cell antigen may make antibodies if exposed to it by transfusion or by transfer of fetal red cells across the placenta in pregnancy. Antibodies to ABO antigens occur naturally, are IgM and complete (detectable by incubation of red cells with antibody in saline at room temperature). Antibodies to other red cell antigens appear only after sensitization. They are usually IgG and incomplete, detected by special techniques, e.g. enzyme-treated red cells, addition of albumin to the reaction mixture or the indirect antiglobulin (Coombs') reaction (see Fig. 15.2). Antibodies may cause:
- intravascular (e.g. ABO incompatibility) or extravascular (e.g. Rh incompatibility) haemolysis of donor red cells in the recipient; and
- haemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn because of transplacental passage.

\section*{Blood grouping}

An individual's red cell group is determined by suspending washed red cells with diluted anti-A, anti-B, anti A+B and anti Rh (D). This is usually carried out in microtitre plates (Fig. 37.2) or gels but automated machines are increasingly used. Agglutination indicates a positive test. Serum is simultaneously incubated with group $\mathrm{A}, \mathrm{B}$ and O cells to confirm the presence of the expected naturally occurring ABO antibodies. The recipient's serum is also incubated against a pool of group O cells which together express the most common antigens against which 'atypical' antibodies occur. If such an antibody is found, it must be characterized and donor blood negative for that antigen is selected for transfusion.

\section*{Compatibility testing}

Compatibility testing (cross-matching) entails suspension of red cells from a donor pack with recipient serum, incubation (at room temperature and $37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ ) to allow reactions to occur, and examination for agglutination, including indirect antiglobulin test (see Fig.15.2) to ensure that no reaction has occurred.

\begin{figure}

Rows 7 and 8 are patients' red cells with two different anti-D reagents to determine the $\mathrm{Rh}(\mathrm{D})$ group.}
\end{figure}

\section*{Red cell transfusion (Fig. 37.4a) Indications}
- Haemorrhage, severe anaemia refractory to other therapy or needing rapid correction.
- If repeated transfusions likely, phenotyped ABO and Rh (D) compatible red cells which correspond as closely as possible to the minor red cell antigens of the recipient are used to minimize sensitization.

\section*{Types of red cells}
- Whole blood-for treatment of acute haemorrhage with hypovolaemia. Fresh whole blood (<5 days post collection) is preferable for neonates.
- Red cells in optimal additive solution (OAS) ('packed'), e.g. containing sodium chloride, adenine, glucose and mannitol (SAG-M) which gives red cells a shelf life of

30-35 days. These are generally used for patients with anaemia requiring red cell transfusion.
- Leucocyte-depleted red cells have been passed through a leucocyte filter either at the bedside or in the laboratory. They are given to reduce reactions to leucocytes in patients sensitized to HLA antigens (e.g. multiply transfused patients), to reduce incidence of sensitization to HLA antigens and in patients requiring CMV-negative components (e.g. CMV-negative transplant recipients, neonates/premature babies, pregnant females) when CMV status of donor is unknown. Leucodepletion reduces the theoretical risk of transmission of new variant Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease (nvCJD, see below) and all red cells in the UK are now leucodepleted.

\section*{Autologous donation}

Autologous donation of red cells is suitable for some patients awaiting elective surgery. Patients donate their own red cells preoperatively on several occasions and receive iron. Donated units are screened for infectious agents in the usual way and stored at $4^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. Directed donations, e.g. within families, are not considered ethical within the UK.

\section*{Platelet transfusion (Fig. 37.4b)}

A single donor unit is prepared from a unit of whole blood by centrifugation within hours of collection. It contains approximately $5 \times 10^{10}$ platelets in $50-60 \mathrm{~mL}$ fresh plasma; shelf life of 4-6 days. Standard adult dose is five pooled units and group ABO and Rh compatible, but not crossmatched, units are given. Patients with HLA antibodies may require platelets from HLA compatible donors who have donated platelets by platelet-pheresis.

\section*{Indications}

Indications for platelet transfusion are the following.
- Thrombocytopenia $<50 \times 109 / \mathrm{L}$-in presence of significant bleeding or prior to an invasive procedure.
- Thrombocytopenia $<10 \times 10^{9} / \mathrm{L}-$ prophylactic transfusions are required in patients post chemotherapy or stem cell transplant (SCT) or with failure of marrow production.
- Platelet function defects (in presence of bleeding or prior to surgery), DIC (see Chapter 31) and dilutional thrombocytopenia following massive transfusion.

\section*{White cell transfusion}

White cell (buffy coat) transfusions are now rarely used in neutropenic patients as there are few data demonstrating clinical efficacy.

\section*{Fresh frozen plasma (Fig. 37.4c)}

Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) is a source of all coagulation and other plasma proteins. Compatibility testing is not
required, but blood group compatible units are used. Fresh frozen plasma from group AB donors may be used if the recipient blood group is unknown. As FFP is not heat sterilized and may transmit infection, solvent-treated FFP may be safer in this regard.

\section*{Indications}
- Coagulation factor replacement. Perform coagulation tests and platelet count prior to use. Patients with DIC or massive transfusion at risk of bleeding and with coagulation abnormalities may benefit. Single factor deficiencies are best treated with a specific factor concentrate.
- Liver disease-in the presence of bleeding or prior to invasive procedures, e.g. liver biopsy; combined with vitamin K .
- Haemolytic uraemic syndrome or thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura often with plasma exchange. Cryoprecipitate-poor FFP is preferred.
- Reversal of oral anticoagulation or thrombolytic therapy.

\section*{Cryoprecipitate}

Cyroprecipitate is prepared from the precipitate formed from FFP during controlled thawing, resuspended in 20 mL plasma. It is rich in fibrinogen, fibronectin and factor VIII. Group compatible units are used. It may be useful in patients with DIC, liver disease, following massive transfusion and, rarely, in von Willebrand's disease.

\section*{Other blood products}

These are derived from pooled human plasma which has undergone a manufacturing process designed to concentrate and sterilize the component. They carry a theoretical risk of transmitting diseases caused by prions (e.g. nvCJD). There have been no documented cases of this, but current UK practice is to use products made by recombinant DNA or plasma from non-UK donors wherever possible.

\section*{Coagulation factor concentrates}

Coagulation factor concentrates are available as freezedried powder of high purity. Factor VIII concentrate is used for treatment of haemophilia $A$ and von Willebrand's disease; recombinant factor VIII is now available. Factor IX concentrate, also available as recombinant, is used in patients with haemophilia B. Factor IX complex (prothrombin complex) also contains factors II, VII and X and is of value in patients with specific disorders involving factors II and X, oral anticoagulant overdose, in severe liver failure and to overcome inhibitors to factor VIII in patients with haemophilia A who have developed inhibitors. Its use carries a risk of provoking thrombosis and DIC.

Other concentrates include protein C , antithrombin, factors VII, XI and XIII and are used in the corresponding congenital deficiencies.

\section*{Albumin solution}

Albumin solution is available as $5 \%, 20 \%$ and $20 \%$ saltpoor formulations. It contains no coagulation factors. It is used in the treatment of hypovolaemia, particularly when caused by burns, and shock associated with multiple organ failure. Synthetic plasma volume expanders (e.g. dextrans, gelatin and hydroxyethyl starch) are of equal value in initial management. These 'colloids' remain longer within the intravascular space than 'crystalloid' solutions (e.g. 0.9\% NaCl ), exert a colloid osmotic effect and may elevate blood pressure. Resistant oedema in patients with renal and hepatic disease requires $20 \%$ albumin.

\section*{Immunoglobulins}

Immunoglobulins (Igs) are prepared from pooled donor plasma by fractionation and sterile filtration. Specific Igs include hepatitis B and herpes zoster which provide passive immune protection. Standard human Ig for intramuscular injection is used for prophylaxis against hepatitis A, rubella and measles, whereas hyperimmune globulin is prepared from donors with high titres of the relevant antibodies for prophylaxis of tetanus, hepatitis A, diphtheria, rabies, mumps, measles, rubella, CMV and Pseudomonas infections. Intravenous Ig may be used to protect against infections in patients with congenital or acquired immune deficiency and is of value in some autoimmune disorders, e.g. immune thrombocytopenic purpura.

\section*{Complications of transfusion (see Table 37.2)}
- Administrative and clerical errors must be avoided by rigorous adherence to procedures for checking and documentation when ordering, prescribing, issuing and administering blood components. These are by far the most common cause of serious and 'near miss' incidents.
- Congestive heart failure caused by circulatory overload.
- Immunological reactions may occur with transfusion of cellular and plasma derived blood components. ABO incompatible red cell transfusions may lead to lifethreatening intravascular haemolysis of transfused cells with fever, rigors, haemoglobinuria, hypotension and renal failure. Atypical antibodies arising from previous transfusions or pregnancy may cause intravascular or, more commonly, delayed extravascular haemolysis with anaemia, jaundice, splenomegaly and fever.

Hypersensitivity reactions to plasma components may cause urticaria, wheezing, facial oedema and pyrexia but can cause anaphylactic shock, especially in IgA-deficient subjects.

\section*{Treatment}

The transfusion must be stopped immediately. For severe reactions, the clerical details must be checked and samples from the donor unit and recipient are analysed for compatibility and haemolysis. Recipient serum is analysed for pres-
ence of atypical red cell, leucocyte, HLA and plasma protein antibodies. Support care to maintain blood pressure and renal function, to promote diuresis and treat shock (intravenous steroids, antihistamines, adrenaline in severe cases) may be necessary.
- Transmission of infection. Bacterial infections can occur through failure of sterile technique at time of collection or because of bacteraemia in the donor. Protozoal infections (e.g. malaria) can be transmitted and at-risk donors are not

eligible to donate. Viral infection can be transmitted in spite of mandatory screening, as seroconversion may not have occurred in an infected donor, the virus may not have been identified, or the most sensitive serological tests may not be routinely performed (e.g. testing for antihepatitis B core antibodies). The risk of transmission is much lower for those blood products which have undergone a manufacturing and sterilization process. There is a theoretical risk of transmitting prion diseases, e.g. nvCJD, by plasma products (see above).
- Other complications. Iron overload occurs in multiply transfused patients (see Chapter 10). Graft vs. host disease may be caused by transfusion of viable T lymphocytes into severely immunosuppressed hosts so cellular components should be irradiated prior to transfusion to fetuses, premature neonates, SCT recipients and other severely immunocompromised patients.

\section*{Haemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn}

Haemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn (HDFN) is the haemolysis of fetal or neonatal red cells caused by transplacental passage of maternal red cell antibodies (Fig. 37.3).

\section*{HDFN caused by ABO antibodies}

Although ABO incompatibility between mother and fetus is common, this type of HDFN is rarely severe. Most ABO antibodies are IgM and therefore cannot cross the placenta. Fetal A and B antigens are not fully developed at birth and the maternal antibodies can be partially neutralized by $A$

and B antigens present on other cells, in the plasma and in tissue fluids.

\section*{HDFN caused by other antibodies}

The most important cause is anti-D, produced in Rh (D)negative women as a result of sensitization during a previous pregnancy or blood transfusion and causing haemolysis in Rh (D)-positive infants. Other important causes are other antibodies within the Rh system (e.g. anti-c), antiKell, anti-Duffy and anti-JKa antibodies.

Haemolysis of fetal cells can lead to hydrops fetalis, though nowadays it more commonly leads to neonatal haemolytic anaemia. All women must have their blood group determined at booking and atypical red cell antibodies in plasma should be detected. If present, their titre is monitored throughout pregnancy. Ultrasound for fetal growth, fetal blood sampling and measurements of bilirubin levels in amniotic fluid are used to monitor fetal well-being.

\section*{Treatment}

Transfusion of CMV-negative irradiated red cells compatible with maternal serum may be given to fetuses. Maternal antibody levels can be lowered by plasma exchange. Phototherapy and exchange transfusion of the neonate allows removal of unconjugated bilirubin which may otherwise deposit in the basal ganglia to cause neurological sequelae (kernicterus).

\section*{Prevention}

Prevention is by administration of anti-D to unsensitized $\mathrm{Rh}(\mathrm{D})$-negative women within 72 h of a potentially sensitizing event (e.g. birth of an Rh (D)-positive fetus, abortion or antepartum haemorrhage). The anti-D will coat fetal cells which are then removed from the maternal circulation before sensitization occurs. The dosage of anti-D is adjusted according to the number of fetal cells detected in the maternal circulation (Kleihauer test). All Rh (D)-negative women are now given anti-D at 28 and 34 weeks routinely.

\section*{Stem cell transplantation}

Stem cell transplantation (SCT) (Fig.38.1) is the use of haemopoietic stem cells (HSC) from a donor harvested from peripheral blood (peripheral blood stem cells, PBSC) or bone marrow, to repopulate recipient bone marrow.
- Allogeneic SCT involves transplantation of HSC from one individual to another. This is usually between two HLA matching individuals, most frequently siblings but, in their absence, volunteer and HLA matched unrelated donors (MUD) are increasingly being used. HLA matching includes class I (A,B tested serologically) and class II (DR tested serologically or by molecular typing). If the donor is an identical twin, the transplant is termed 'syngeneic'. 'Mini' transplants in which the recipient receives immunosuppressive but not myeloablative therapy are currently being explored.
- Autologous SCT utilizes the patient's own stem cells. These are harvested from the patient then used to repopulate the marrow after further high-dose chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy.
- Cord blood transplantation utilizes fetal stem cells harvested at the time of birth from the umbilical cord.

Allogeneic SCT is rarely performed in individuals $>55$ years of age, as it carries risk of treatment-related morbidity and even mortality (up to $5-10 \%$ ) which increases with age. Autologous SCT may be performed more safely in older patients, up to 70 years.

\section*{Indications (Table 38.1)}

Stem cell transplantation is used to 'rescue' the patient from bone marrow failure or following intensive chemotherapy ( $\pm$ radiotherapy). For allogeneic SCT the recipient requires 'conditioning' therapy (chemotherapy $\pm$ radiotherapy) pretransplant to cause immunosuppression, thereby reducing risk of marrow rejection, and to eradicate malignant disease in bone marrow and elsewhere. The transplanted immune system in an allogeneic SCT may itself have antitumour, e.g. graft vs. leukaemia (GVL) effect.

\section*{Procedure}

Treatment with a haemopoietic growth factor (e.g. G-CSF), combined in the case of autologous SCT with chemotherapy, e.g. high-dose cyclophosphamide, is used to mobilize HSC from bone marrow into peripheral blood, where they are collected by leucopheresis. Alternatively, HSC may be harvested from marrow by multiple bone marrow aspirations, performed under general anaesthesia. Approximately $2 \times 108 / \mathrm{kg}$ nucleated cells or $2 \times 10^{6} / \mathrm{kg}$ CD 34 cells are needed (CD34 is a surface marker of early haemopoietic stem and progenitor cells). The recipient of an allogeneic or

MUD transplant then receives immunosuppressive drugs to reduce the risk of graft vs. host disease (GVHD) (see below).

\section*{Complications}

Complications of SCT include the following.
- Side effects of conditioning chemotherapy/radiotherapy, e.g. bone marrow failure, nausea, alopecia, skin burns, pulmonary toxicity, hepatic veno-occlusive disease, toxicity to endocrine organs and growth retardation.
- Rejection of transplanted HSC.
- Relapse of original disease. This is sometimes treated by infusion of lymphocytes from the allogeneic donor, which will have a GVL effect.
- Infection following SCT occurs because patients are severely immunosuppressed. Infection may be bacterial, viral, protozoal or fungal. Prophylactic antibiotics, antifungal and antiviral therapy is given. CMV-negative recipients should receive blood components which are leucodepleted or from CMV-negative donors. CMV infection may cause pneumonitis, diarrhoea, liver dysfunction, skin rash and graft failure, and is a major cause of transplant-related mortality. Ganciclovir and foscarnet are useful in treatment of CMV infection. Prophylaxis against Pneumocystis carinii infection is with oral co-trimoxazole and/or nebulized pentamidine.

- Metabolic problems, often caused by multiple intravenous drugs (antibiotics, antivirals, antifungals), renal failure, blood component therapy, intravenous feeding, etc.
- Graft vs. host disease (GVHD) (allogeneic SCT). Transplanted lymphocytes may recognize the recipient as 'foreign' and mount an immunological onslaught, to cause skin rash, liver disease and diarrhoea. The incidence of GVHD is higher in older patients. Acute GVHD (<100
days after SCT) typically begins $7-10$ days after transplantation and is graded according to severity. Chronic GVHD ( $>100$ days) presents with a scleroderma-like syndrome, liver, lung, gastrointestinal or joint abnormalities. The incidence and severity of GVHD may be decreased by depleting $T$ cells from donor marrow and immune suppression of the recipient.

\section*{39 General aspects of treatment}

\section*{Chemotherapy}

Chemotherapy is the use of pharmacological agents (Table 39.1) to treat malignant or other proliferative diseases. It may be given orally, by bolus, prolonged subcutaneous or intravenous injection/infusion or intrathecally. It may be a single agent or combination chemotherapy utilizing drugs with different, preferably synergistic, modes of action, with limited or no overlapping toxicity, and aimed at delaying emergence of drug resistance. Chemotherapy drugs are often given as a cycle of a few days' treatment every 3-6 weeks to allow normal cells, especially of the bone marrow and gastrointestinal tract, to recover from toxicity. Extravasation into tissues can cause severe local reactions. Intravenous chemotherapy is usually given through a central line or through a tunnelled intravenous catheter (e.g. Hickman's) or indwelling chamber (e.g. Porta-Cath).

\section*{Side effects of chemotherapy}

Most chemotherapeutic agents are toxic to normal dividing cells (gastrointestinal tract, haemopoietic cells, hair, skin) as well as to malignant cells. Common side effects include the following.
- Bone marrow failure (anaemia, thrombocytopenia, leucopenia) with increased susceptibility to bleeding and infection, which may require therapy with antimicrobials, blood components and recombinant growth factors (G-CSF, GM-CSF, thrombopoietin, erythropoietin).

- Nausea and vomiting, requiring antiemetic therapymetoclopramide, dexamethazone and 5-HT antagonists (e.g. ondansetron, granisetron).
- Mucositis (sore mouth and throat), abdominal pain and diarrhoea.
- Infertility-sperm storage considered before chemotherapy.
- Tumour lysis syndrome-prevented by good hydration, alkalinization of urine, allopurinol.
- Hyperuricaemia-prevented by allopurinol.
- Specific side effects of chemotherapy include: neuropathy (vincristine), cardiomyopathy (anthracyclines), thrombosis (l-asparaginase), secondary leukaemia (alkylating agents, etoposide), pulmonary fibrosis (busulphan) and haemorrhagic cystitis (cyclophosphamide).

\section*{Mechanism of action}

Chemotherapy drugs generally affect DNA synthesis or repair and promote cellular apoptosis. Cycle-specific agents prevent DNA synthesis and act on the $S$ phase of the cell cycle (Table 39.1). Non-cycle-specific agents act at all phases of the cell cycle and include alkylating agents, which bind to DNA, and anthracyclines, which cause DNA strand breaks. Inhibition of the DNA repair enzyme, topoisomerase II, is an important component of the action of anthracyclines and etoposide.

\section*{Biological therapies}

Growth factors in clinical use (see Chapter 1) include GCSF and GM-CSF (Fig.39.1), and erythropoietin. The interferons are naturally occurring agents which have both antineoplastic and anti-infective properties. Interferon- $\alpha$ is used in treatment of chronic myeloid leukaemia, multiple myeloma, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Monoclonal antibodies alone or bound to toxins or radioactive isotopes may be used to kill specific cells or target drug therapy.

\section*{Infection}

The main risk factors are:
- neutropenia (particularly if $<0.5 \times 10^{9} / \mathrm{L}$ ) for bacterial and fungal infections;
- defective cell-mediated or humoral immunity for viral, bacterial and atypical infections (e.g. tuberculosis);
- others, such as indwelling catheters (intravenous, urethral), corticosteroid therapy and mucositis also increase risk. Impaired splenic function or splenectomy reduce ability to make antibody, particularly to capsulated organisms, reduces clearance of intracellular organisms (e.g. parasitized red cells) and impairs defence against organisms and toxins in the portal circulation. Organisms which

\section*{Organisms}

Organisms include the following:

\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Fig. 39.3 Septicaemia in acute leukaemia leading to infected skin lesions.}

- bacterial-Gram-positive (coagulase-negative and -positive staphylococci, streptococci, enterococci); Gramnegative (klebsiella, pseudomonas, Escherichia coli, proteus); others, e.g. tuberculosis, atypical mycobacteria (Figs 39.2 and 39.3);
- fungal-Candida, aspergillus;
- viruses-cytomegalovirus, herpesviruses, adenoviruses; and
- protozoans-toxoplasma, pneumocystis, Leishmania, histoplasma.

\section*{Prevention}
- Good hygiene on the part of the patient and staff, regular hand cleaning and avoidance of contact with infected individuals.
- Barrier nursing in isolation is preferred. Staff wear gowns and gloves when in contact with severely neutropenic patients.
- Filtered air at positive pressure reduces risk from fungal spores.
- Food should ideally be cooked. Foods frequently contaminated with bacteria (soft cheeses, uncooked eggs and meat, salads, live yoghurt) are avoided and only peeled fruits are allowed.
- Oral non-absorbable antibiotics (e.g. neomycin, colistin) will reduce colonization of the gastrointestinal tract, oral systemic antibiotics (ciprofloxacin, co-trimoxazole) reduce the incidence of bacteraemia and oral antifungals (fluconazole/amphotericin/itraconozole) and/or oral antiviral (acyclovir) prophylaxis are routinely given in some units.

\section*{Diagnosis}
- Fever is the cardinal sign of infection: tachycardia, tachypnoea, fall in blood pressure, cough, dysuria, altered mental state may also occur.
- Physical signs include reddened throat, inflamed intravenous catheter site, skin rash, chest signs, mouth signs and perineal inflammation. Pus is absent in neutropenic patients.
- Special tests to identify the responsible organism include microbial culture (sputum, urine, throat and perineal swab, blood cultures from peripheral blood and indwelling catheter, lumbar puncture-if neurological symptomsskin swabs, faecal culture). Bronchoalveolar lavage may be necessary. Serological tests for specific organisms, e.g. aspergillus, may be of value. Imaging tests may include chest X-ray, CT scan, especially of chest if fungal infection is suspected, and sinus X-rays.

\section*{Treatment}
- Supportive care for renal failure/hypotension/respiratory failure.
- Empirical antibacterial therapy should be commenced in patients who are neutropenic ( $<0.5 \times 10^{9} / \mathrm{L}$ ) or otherwise severely immunocompromised and develop fever (temperature of $38^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ or greater lasting for more than 2 hours). Cultures should be taken and intravenous antibiotics should be commenced, with either a single, potent broadspectrum agent (e.g. a fourth generation cephalosporin) or
a combination of agents with activity against gram negative and gram positive (including coagulase negative staphylococci) organisms.

\section*{Radiotherapy}

Ionizing radiation, usually derived from an external source, is used to treat disease by causing DNA damage in malignant cells. It is commonly used in the treatment of haematological malignancies (e.g. lymphoid leukaemias, lymphoma, myeloma) and as part of conditioning therapy for bone marrow transplant for malignant disease. Side effects include nausea, vomiting, alopecia, bone marrow failure, damage to normal tissues (e.g. skin burns), growth retardation and induction of second malignancies.

\section*{Other therapies}

Blood and blood component therapy are discussed in Chapter 37. Splenectomy is beneficial in a number of haematological conditions, particularly when the spleen is the site of excessive destruction of peripheral blood cells (e.g. selected patients with haemolytic anaemia and thrombocytopenia (particularly auto-immune), myelofibrosis). The spleen has an important role in removing opsonized bacteria (see Chapter 3) and splenectomy (or hyposplenism due to disease, e.g. sickle cell disease) can lead to an increased susceptibility to infection. The operation should be avoided in children under 5 years and should be preceded by vaccination against pneumococcus, haemophilus influenza type B and meningococcus. Patients who are hyposplenic or post-splenectomy should take prophylactic antibiotics indefinitely (e.g. oral Penicillin V or erythromycin at low dose) and should at all times carry a card informing them and their carers of their condition.

\section*{Counselling}

Counselling is valuable for various groups of haematological patients.
- Patients and families with malignant disease need emotional support during treatment and/or bereavement. Practical help with housing, transport, welfare benefits, etc. There should be good liaison with GPs, terminal care support teams in the community and hospices.
- Genetic counselling is needed in families with haemophilia, thalassaemia, sickle cell disease and related conditions.

\section*{Case history 1}

A 66-year-old caucasian man gives a history of increasing tiredness and lethargy over the preceding 2-4 months. He has recently lost his wife and has been drinking more alcohol than usual. His appetite is poor and he has lost 1 stone in weight over the past 3 months. He eats a mixed diet. His bowels are regular and he does not report any blood loss. He is not on any medication. He has not had any illnesses in the past.

On examination he is pale but not jaundiced. His blood pressure is 135/80. Abdominal examination, including rectal, is normal and there are no other abnormalities.

\section*{His FBC shows:}
$\mathrm{Hb}=7.6 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dL}$
$\mathrm{MCV}=68 \mathrm{fL}$
$\mathrm{MCH}=26$
WBC $=8.6 \times 10^{9} / \mathrm{L}$
Platelets $=490 \times 10^{9} / \mathrm{L}$
ESR $=83 \mathrm{~mm} / \mathrm{h}$

\section*{Questions}

What is the differential diagnosis?
How would you manage him?

\section*{Answers}

A history of anorexia and weight loss suggest occult malignancy. A microcytic anaemia suggests iron deficiency, and the elevated platelet count suggests bleeding as the cause. The raised ESR supports a diagnosis of underlying malignancy.

An accurate dietary and alcohol history should be taken, although alcohol usually causes a macrocytic anaemia. A poor diet may also cause folic acid or $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ deficiency, which would also cause a macrocytic anaemia.

\section*{Management: diagnosis and treatment}

Further diagnostic tests should include serum ferritin, serum $\mathbf{B}_{12}$ and serum folate. Urea and electrolytes and liver function tests should also be done. A search for a cause of bleeding is mandatory, even though physical examination does not offer clues to the source of blood loss. Once iron deficiency is confirmed, endoscopic and/or radiological investigation of the GI tract is indicated.

The serum ferritin was reduced at $5 \mu \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{L}$ confirming iron deficiency. Upper GI endoscopy revealed a malignant gastric ulcer which was successfully resected.

\section*{Case history 2}

A 71-year-old man has back pain. This has been present for over three months and is worse in the lower back. He has also developed upper abdominal pain and constipation over the last month. He has had no serious illnesses in the past. His appetite is poor and he has lost 1 stone in weight over the previous month. His medication includes pain killers (paracetamol and Ibuprofen).

On examination he is pale. His blood pressure is slightly elevated (160/100). Urine examinatin shows $2+$ proteinuria.

Investigations show:
$\mathrm{Hb}=8.6 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dL}$
WBC $=9.5 \times 10^{9} / \mathrm{L}$
Platelets $=65 \times 10^{9} / \mathrm{L}$
$\mathrm{ESR}=110 \mathrm{~mm} / \mathrm{h}$

Blood film report: Rouleaux
Leucoerythroblastic changes present

\section*{Questions}

What is the differential diagnosis?
What further tests are indicated?

\section*{Answers}

A history of recent onset of back pain, with poor appetite and weight loss, suggests malignant infiltration of the skeleton. Abdominal pain and constipation are suggestive of hypercalcaemia.

Proteinuria on urine testing suggests renal disease. There is no history of prostatic obstruction. The very high ESR suggests myeloma or carcinoma with bony metastases. Further tests should include urea and electrolytes, creatinine clearance, calcium level and serum alkaline phosphatase. X-rays of his back are required. Serum and urinary protein electrophoresis are needed to exclude myeloma.

A prostate specific antigen test to exclude prostatic carcinoma is required. This patient's calcium level was raised at $3.6 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$ and he was in renal failure (serum creatinine $860 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$ ).

The serum alkaline phosphatase was normal, which is in keeping with myeloma rather than secondary deposits. Skeletal survey,
bone marrow, serum and urine paraprotein level, serum $\beta_{2}$ microglobulin are indicated (see Chapter 24).

\section*{Case history 3}

A 64-year-old caucasian lady complains of gradually increasing tiredness. She feels the cold more than she used to. She also has a sore tongue. Over the past two months she has complained of numbness of her feet. Her sister suffers from hypothyroidism. She eats a normal diet.

On examination she is pale and very slightly jaundiced. Her tongue is reddened and enlarged; she has grey hair. The thyroid gland is clinically normal. She has reduced touch and joint position sense in the toes and the ankle jerks are absent. Neurological examination is otherwise normal.

Investigations show:
$\mathrm{Hb}=6.4 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dL}$
$\mathrm{MCV}=131 \mathrm{fL}$

WBC $=3.1 \times 10^{9} / \mathrm{L}$
Platelets $=63 \times 10^{9} / \mathrm{L}$

\section*{Questions}

What is the diagnosis?
Which further investigations are required?
How would you treat her?

\section*{Answer}

This lady presents a classic clinical picture of pernicious anaemia (p.37).

The further investigations required are listed on p. 38.
Treatment is with hydroxocobalamin ( 1 mg intramuscular) immediately followed by further $B_{12}$ injections. It is important not to give folic acid before giving $B_{12}$, as it may precipitate neuropathy.
