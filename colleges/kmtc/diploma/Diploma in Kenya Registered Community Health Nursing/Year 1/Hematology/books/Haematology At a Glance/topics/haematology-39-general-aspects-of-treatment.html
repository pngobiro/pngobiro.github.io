                        <p>Chemotherapy is the use of pharmacological agents (Table 39.1) to treat malignant or other proliferative diseases. It may be given orally, by bolus, prolonged subcutaneous or intravenous injection/infusion or intrathecally. It may be a single agent or combination chemotherapy utilizing drugs with different, preferably synergistic, modes of action, with limited or no overlapping toxicity, and aimed at delaying emergence of drug resistance. Chemotherapy drugs are often given as a cycle of a few days' treatment every 3-6 weeks to allow normal cells, especially of the bone marrow and gastrointestinal tract, to recover from toxicity. Extravasation into tissues can cause severe local reactions. Intravenous chemotherapy is usually given through a central line or through a tunnelled intravenous catheter (e.g. Hickman's) or indwelling chamber (e.g. Porta-Cath).</p>

                        <p>Most chemotherapeutic agents are toxic to normal dividing cells (gastrointestinal tract, haemopoietic cells, hair, skin) as well as to malignant cells. Common side effects include the following.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Bone marrow failure (anaemia, thrombocytopenia, leucopenia) with increased susceptibility to bleeding and infection, which may require therapy with antimicrobials, blood components and recombinant growth factors (G-CSF, GM-CSF, thrombopoietin, erythropoietin).</li>
                            <li>Nausea and vomiting, requiring antiemetic therapy—metoclopramide, dexamethazone and 5-HT antagonists (e.g. ondansetron, granisetron).</li>
                            <li>Mucositis (sore mouth and throat), abdominal pain and diarrhoea.</li>
                            <li>Infertility—sperm storage considered before chemotherapy.</li>
                            <li>Tumour lysis syndrome—prevented by good hydration, alkalinization of urine, allopurinol.</li>
                            <li>Hyperuricaemia—prevented by allopurinol.</li>
                            <li>Specific side effects of chemotherapy include: neuropathy (vincristine), cardiomyopathy (anthracyclines), thrombosis (l-asparaginase), secondary leukaemia (alkylating agents, etoposide), pulmonary fibrosis (busulphan) and haemorrhagic cystitis (cyclophosphamide).</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Mechanism of action</h3>
                        <p>Chemotherapy drugs generally affect DNA synthesis or repair and promote cellular apoptosis. Cycle-specific agents prevent DNA synthesis and act on the S phase of the cell cycle (Table 39.1). Non-cycle-specific agents act at all phases of the cell cycle and include alkylating agents, which bind to DNA, and anthracyclines, which cause DNA strand breaks. Inhibition of the DNA repair enzyme, topoisomerase II, is an important component of the action of anthracyclines and etoposide.</p>

                        <p>Growth factors in clinical use (see Chapter 1) include G-CSF and GM-CSF (Fig.39.1), and erythropoietin.

Interferon-$\alpha$ is used in treatment of chronic myeloid leukaemia, multiple myeloma, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Monoclonal antibodies alone or bound to toxins or radioactive isotopes may be used to kill specific cells or target drug therapy.</p>

                            <li>others, such as indwelling catheters (intravenous, urethral), corticosteroid therapy and mucositis also increase risk.

                            <li>Barrier nursing in isolation is preferred. Staff wear gowns and gloves when in contact with severely neutropenic patients.</li>
                            <li>Filtered air at positive pressure reduces risk from fungal spores.</li>
                            <li>Food should ideally be cooked. Foods frequently contaminated with bacteria (soft cheeses, uncooked eggs and meat, salads, live yoghurt) are avoided and only peeled fruits are allowed.</li>
                            <li>Oral non-absorbable antibiotics (e.g. neomycin, colistin) will reduce colonization of the gastrointestinal tract, oral systemic antibiotics (ciprofloxacin, co-trimoxazole) reduce the incidence of bacteraemia and oral antifungals (fluconazole/amphotericin/itraconozole) and/or oral antiviral (acyclovir) prophylaxis are routinely given in some units.</li>

                            <li>Physical signs include reddened throat, inflamed intravenous catheter site, skin rash, chest signs, mouth signs and perineal inflammation. Pus is absent in neutropenic patients.</li>
                            <li>Special tests to identify the responsible organism include microbial culture (sputum, urine, throat and perineal swab, blood cultures from peripheral blood and indwelling catheter, lumbar puncture—if neurological symptoms—skin swabs, faecal culture). Bronchoalveolar lavage may be necessary. Serological tests for specific organisms, e.g. aspergillus, may be of value. Imaging tests may include chest X-ray, CT scan, especially of chest if fungal infection is suspected, and sinus X-rays.</li>

                            <li>Empirical antibacterial therapy should be commenced in patients who are neutropenic (&lt;0.5 x 10<sup>9</sup>/L) or otherwise severely immunocompromised and develop fever (temperature of 38°C or greater lasting for more than 2 hours). Cultures should be taken and intravenous antibiotics should be commenced, with either a single, potent broad-spectrum agent (e.g. a fourth generation cephalosporin) or a combination of agents with activity against gram negative and gram positive (including coagulase negative staphylococci) organisms.</li>

                        <p>Ionizing radiation, usually derived from an external source, is used to treat disease by causing DNA damage in malignant cells. It is commonly used in the treatment of haematological malignancies (e.g. lymphoid leukaemias, lymphoma, myeloma) and as part of conditioning therapy for bone marrow transplant for malignant disease. Side effects include nausea, vomiting, alopecia, bone marrow failure, damage to normal tissues (e.g. skin burns), growth retardation and induction of second malignancies.</p>

                        <p>Blood and blood component therapy are discussed in Chapter 37. Splenectomy is beneficial in a number of haematological conditions, particularly when the spleen is the site of excessive destruction of peripheral blood cells (e.g. selected patients with haemolytic anaemia and thrombocytopenia (particularly auto-immune), myelofibrosis). The spleen has an important role in removing opsonized bacteria (see Chapter 3) and splenectomy (or hyposplenism due to disease, e.g. sickle cell disease) can lead to an increased susceptibility to infection. The operation should be avoided in children under 5 years and should be preceded by vaccination against pneumococcus, haemophilus influenza type B and meningococcus. Patients who are hyposplenic or post-splenectomy should take prophylactic antibiotics indefinitely (e.g. oral Penicillin V or erythromycin at low dose) and should at all times carry a card informing them and their carers of their condition.</p>
