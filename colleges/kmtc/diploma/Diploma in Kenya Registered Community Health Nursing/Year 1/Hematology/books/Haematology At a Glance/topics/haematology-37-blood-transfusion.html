                        <p>Red cells have surface antigens which are glycoproteins or glycolipids (Table 37.1). Individuals lacking a red cell antigen may make antibodies if exposed to it by transfusion or by transfer of fetal red cells across the placenta in pregnancy. Antibodies to ABO antigens occur naturally, are IgM and complete (detectable by incubation of red cells with antibody in saline at room temperature). Antibodies to other red cell antigens appear only after sensitization. They are usually IgG and incomplete, detected by special techniques, e.g. enzyme-treated red cells, addition of albumin to the reaction mixture or the indirect antiglobulin (Coombs') reaction (see Fig. 15.2). Antibodies may cause:</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Blood grouping</h3>
                        <p>An individual's red cell group is determined by suspending washed red cells with diluted anti-A, anti-B, anti A+B and anti Rh (D). This is usually carried out in microtitre plates (Fig. 37.2) or gels but automated machines are increasingly used. Agglutination indicates a positive test. Serum is simultaneously incubated with group A, B and O cells to confirm the presence of the expected naturally occurring ABO antibodies. The recipient's serum is also incubated against a pool of group O cells which together express the most common antigens against which 'atypical' antibodies occur. If such an antibody is found, it must be characterized and donor blood negative for that antigen is selected for transfusion.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Indications</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Haemorrhage, severe anaemia refractory to other therapy or needing rapid correction.</li>
                            <li>If repeated transfusions likely, phenotyped ABO and Rh (D) compatible red cells which correspond as closely as possible to the minor red cell antigens of the recipient are used to minimize sensitization.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Types of red cells</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Whole blood</strong>—for treatment of acute haemorrhage with hypovolaemia. Fresh whole blood (&lt;5 days post collection) is preferable for neonates.</li>
                            <li><strong>Red cells in optimal additive solution (OAS)</strong> ('packed'), e.g. containing sodium chloride, adenine, glucose and mannitol (SAG-M) which gives red cells a shelf life of 30-35 days. These are generally used for patients with anaemia requiring red cell transfusion.</li>
                            <li><strong>Leucocyte-depleted red cells</strong> have been passed through a leucocyte filter either at the bedside or in the laboratory. They are given to reduce reactions to leucocytes in patients sensitized to HLA antigens (e.g. multiply transfused patients), to reduce incidence of sensitization to HLA antigens and in patients requiring CMV-negative components (e.g. CMV-negative transplant recipients, neonates/premature babies, pregnant females) when CMV status of donor is unknown. Leucodepletion reduces the theoretical risk of transmission of new variant Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease (nvCJD, see below) and all red cells in the UK are now leucodepleted.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Autologous donation</h4>
                        <p>Autologous donation of red cells is suitable for some patients awaiting elective surgery. Patients donate their own red cells preoperatively on several occasions and receive iron. Donated units are screened for infectious agents in the usual way and stored at $4^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$. Directed donations, e.g. within families, are not considered ethical within the UK.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Platelet transfusion (Fig. 37.4b)</h3>
                        <p>A single donor unit is prepared from a unit of whole blood by centrifugation within hours of collection. It contains approximately 5 x 10<sup>10</sup> platelets in 50-60 mL fresh plasma; shelf life of 4-6 days. Standard adult dose is five pooled units and group ABO and Rh compatible, but not crossmatched, units are given. Patients with HLA antibodies may require platelets from HLA compatible donors who have donated platelets by platelet-pheresis.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Indications</h4>
                        <p>Indications for platelet transfusion are the following.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Thrombocytopenia &lt;50 x 10<sup>9</sup>/L—in presence of significant bleeding or prior to an invasive procedure.</li>
                            <li>Thrombocytopenia &lt;10 x 10<sup>9</sup>/L—prophylactic transfusions are required in patients post chemotherapy or stem cell transplant (SCT) or with failure of marrow production.</li>
                            <li>Platelet function defects (in presence of bleeding or prior to surgery), DIC (see Chapter 31) and dilutional thrombocytopenia following massive transfusion.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">White cell transfusion</h3>
                        <p>White cell (buffy coat) transfusions are now rarely used in neutropenic patients as there are few data demonstrating clinical efficacy.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Fresh frozen plasma (Fig. 37.4c)</h3>
                        <p>Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) is a source of all coagulation and other plasma proteins. Compatibility testing is not required, but blood group compatible units are used. Fresh frozen plasma from group AB donors may be used if the recipient blood group is unknown. As FFP is not heat sterilized and may transmit infection, solvent-treated FFP may be safer in this regard.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Indications</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Coagulation factor replacement. Perform coagulation tests and platelet count prior to use. Patients with DIC or massive transfusion at risk of bleeding and with coagulation abnormalities may benefit. Single factor deficiencies are best treated with a specific factor concentrate.</li>
                            <li>Liver disease—in the presence of bleeding or prior to invasive procedures, e.g. liver biopsy; combined with vitamin K.</li>
                            <li>Haemolytic uraemic syndrome or thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura often with plasma exchange. Cryoprecipitate-poor FFP is preferred.</li>
                            <li>Reversal of oral anticoagulation or thrombolytic therapy.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Cryoprecipitate</h3>
                        <p>Cryoprecipitate is prepared from the precipitate formed from FFP during controlled thawing, resuspended in 20 mL plasma. It is rich in fibrinogen, fibronectin and factor VIII. Group compatible units are used. It may be useful in patients with DIC, liver disease, following massive transfusion and, rarely, in von Willebrand's disease.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Other blood products</h3>
                        <p>These are derived from pooled human plasma which has undergone a manufacturing process designed to concentrate and sterilize the component. They carry a theoretical risk of transmitting diseases caused by prions (e.g. nvCJD). There have been no documented cases of this, but current UK practice is to use products made by recombinant DNA or plasma from non-UK donors wherever possible.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Coagulation factor concentrates</h4>
                        <p>Coagulation factor concentrates are available as freeze-dried powder of high purity. Factor VIII concentrate is used for treatment of haemophilia A and von Willebrand's disease; recombinant factor VIII is now available. Factor IX concentrate, also available as recombinant, is used in patients with haemophilia B. Factor IX complex (prothrombin complex) also contains factors II, VII and X and is of value in patients with specific disorders involving factors II and X, oral anticoagulant overdose, in severe liver failure and to overcome inhibitors to factor VIII in patients with haemophilia A who have developed inhibitors. Its use carries a risk of provoking thrombosis and DIC.</p>
                        <p>Other concentrates include protein C, antithrombin, factors VII, XI and XIII and are used in the corresponding congenital deficiencies.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Albumin solution</h4>
                        <p>Albumin solution is available as 5%, 20% and 20% salt-poor formulations. It contains no coagulation factors. It is used in the treatment of hypovolaemia, particularly when caused by burns, and shock associated with multiple organ failure. Synthetic plasma volume expanders (e.g. dextrans, gelatin and hydroxyethyl starch) are of equal value in initial management. These 'colloids' remain longer within the intravascular space than 'crystalloid' solutions (e.g. 0.9% NaCl), exert a colloid osmotic effect and may elevate blood pressure. Resistant oedema in patients with renal and hepatic disease requires 20% albumin.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Immunoglobulins</h4>
                        <p>Immunoglobulins (Igs) are prepared from pooled donor plasma by fractionation and sterile filtration. Specific Igs include hepatitis B and herpes zoster which provide passive immune protection. Standard human Ig for intramuscular injection is used for prophylaxis against hepatitis A, rubella and measles, whereas hyperimmune globulin is prepared from donors with high titres of the relevant antibodies for prophylaxis of tetanus, hepatitis A, diphtheria, rabies, mumps, measles, rubella, CMV and Pseudomonas infections. Intravenous Ig may be used to protect against infections in patients with congenital or acquired immune deficiency and is of value in some autoimmune disorders, e.g. immune thrombocytopenic purpura.</p>

                        <p>The transfusion must be stopped immediately. For severe reactions, the clerical details must be checked and samples from the donor unit and recipient are analysed for compatibility and haemolysis. Recipient serum is analysed for presence of atypical red cell, leucocyte, HLA and plasma protein antibodies. Support care to maintain blood pressure and renal function, to promote diuresis and treat shock (intravenous steroids, antihistamines, adrenaline in severe cases) may be necessary.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Transmission of infection.</strong> Bacterial infections can occur through failure of sterile technique at time of collection or because of bacteraemia in the donor. Protozoal infections (e.g. malaria) can be transmitted and at-risk donors are not eligible to donate. Viral infection can be transmitted in spite of mandatory screening, as seroconversion may not have occurred in an infected donor, the virus may not have been identified, or the most sensitive serological tests may not be routinely performed (e.g. testing for anti-hepatitis B core antibodies). The risk of transmission is much lower for those blood products which have undergone a manufacturing and sterilization process. There is a theoretical risk of transmitting prion diseases, e.g. nvCJD, by plasma products (see above).</li>
                            <li><strong>Other complications.</strong> Iron overload occurs in multiply transfused patients (see Chapter 10). Graft vs. host disease may be caused by transfusion of viable T lymphocytes into severely immunosuppressed hosts so cellular components should be irradiated prior to transfusion to fetuses, premature neonates, SCT recipients and other severely immunocompromised patients.</li>

                        <p>Haemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn (HDFN) is the haemolysis of fetal or neonatal red cells caused by transplacental passage of maternal red cell antibodies (Fig. 37.3).</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">HDFN caused by ABO antibodies</h3>
                        <p>Although ABO incompatibility between mother and fetus is common, this type of HDFN is rarely severe. Most ABO antibodies are IgM and therefore cannot cross the placenta. Fetal A and B antigens are not fully developed at birth and the maternal antibodies can be partially neutralized by A and B antigens present on other cells, in the plasma and in tissue fluids.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">HDFN caused by other antibodies</h3>
                        <p>The most important cause is anti-D, produced in Rh (D)-negative women as a result of sensitization during a previous pregnancy or blood transfusion and causing haemolysis in Rh (D)-positive infants. Other important causes are other antibodies within the Rh system (e.g. anti-c), anti-Kell, anti-Duffy and anti-JKa antibodies.</p>
                        <p>Haemolysis of fetal cells can lead to hydrops fetalis, though nowadays it more commonly leads to neonatal haemolytic anaemia. All women must have their blood group determined at booking and atypical red cell antibodies in plasma should be detected. If present, their titre is monitored throughout pregnancy. Ultrasound for fetal growth, fetal blood sampling and measurements of bilirubin levels in amniotic fluid are used to monitor fetal well-being.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Treatment</h3>
                        <p>Transfusion of CMV-negative irradiated red cells compatible with maternal serum may be given to fetuses. Maternal antibody levels can be lowered by plasma exchange. Phototherapy and exchange transfusion of the neonate allows removal of unconjugated bilirubin which may otherwise deposit in the basal ganglia to cause neurological sequelae (kernicterus).</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Prevention</h3>
                        <p>Prevention is by administration of anti-D to unsensitized Rh(D)-negative women within 72 h of a potentially sensitizing event (e.g. birth of an Rh (D)-positive fetus, abortion or antepartum haemorrhage). The anti-D will coat fetal cells which are then removed from the maternal circulation before sensitization occurs. The dosage of anti-D is adjusted according to the number of fetal cells detected in the maternal circulation (Kleihauer test). All Rh (D)-negative women are now given anti-D at 28 and 34 weeks routinely.</p>
