                        <p>Myeloproliferative disorders (MPD) are chronic diseases caused by clonal proliferation of bone marrow stem cells leading to excess production of one or more haemopoietic lineage (Fig.27.1). The clinical syndromes include polycythaemia rubra vera (red cells), essential thrombocythaemia (platelets), chronic myeloid leukaemia (white cells) and myelofibrosis in which there is a reactive fibrosis of the marrow and extramedullary haemopoiesis in the liver and spleen. Intermediate forms may occur and the diseases may all transform into acute myeloid leukaemia. Their combined overall incidence is 100-150 cases/year/million population in Europe.</p>

True polycythaemia exists when the total red cell mass (RCM), measured by dilution of isotopically labelled red cells, is increased above normal. Spurious (pseudo or stress) polycythaemia exists when an elevated haemoglobin concentration is caused by a reduction in plasma volume, measured by dilution of isotopically labelled albumin.</p>

                        <p>Polycythaemia rubra vera (PRV) is a primary neoplastic disorder in which bone marrow erythropoiesis is increased, usually accompanied by increased thrombopoiesis and granulopoiesis. Serum erythropoietin (EPO) levels are low.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Clinical features</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Polycythaemia rubra vera occurs equally in males and females, typically over 55 years of age.</li>
                            <li>Raised RCM causes a ruddy complexion (Fig.27.2) and conjunctival suffusion; hyperviscosity may lead to headaches and visual disturbance.</li>
                            <li>Thrombosis (e.g. deep vein thrombosis (DVT), Budd-Chiari syndrome, stroke) are also caused by hyperviscosity and increased platelets.</li>
                            <li>Haemorrhage, especially gastrointestinal, may occur.</li>
                            <li>Excess histamine secretion from basophils leads to increased gastric acid and peptic ulcer is frequent.</li>
                            <li>Pruritus, typically after a hot bath, and gout, caused by increased uric acid production, also occur frequently.</li>
                            <li>Enlarged spleen is found in 75% of patients and distinguishes PRV from other causes of polycythaemia (Fig. 27.3).</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Laboratory features</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Raised haematocrit, haemoglobin concentration, red cell count and RCM.</li>
                            <li>Seventy-five per cent of all patients have raised white cells (neutrophil leucocytosis) and/or platelets.</li>
                            <li>Neutrophil alkaline phosphatase (NAP) score, serum B<sub>12</sub>, serum B<sub>12</sub> binding capacity and serum uric acid are all usually raised.</li>
                            <li>Bone marrow is hypercellular with prominent megakaryocytes, iron stores are depleted because of excessive iron utilization, and the trephine biopsy may show mildly increased reticulin.</li>
                            <li>Abdominal ultrasound excludes renal disease and assesses spleen size.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Differential diagnosis</h3>
                        <p>Secondary or reactive polycythaemia may occur in conditions where arterial oxygen saturation is reduced, leading to a physiological rise in EPO, or when EPO levels are inappropriately raised (e.g. caused by secretion of EPO by a renal neoplasm).</p>
                        <p>Spurious (pseudo) polycythaemia arises when plasma volume is reduced by dehydration, vomiting or diuretic therapy. A common form occurs particularly in young male adults, especially smokers, and is associated with stress, increased vasomotor tone and hypertension (Gaisböck's syndrome). The white cell and platelet counts are normal, as is the bone marrow. If the packed cell volume (PCV) is over 0.50, it is treated by venesections; patients should reduce weight, stop smoking, moderate alcohol intake and avoid diuretics.</p>
                        <p>The following additional tests are occasionally required.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Chest X-ray; arterial blood gas analysis to exclude lung disease.</li>
                            <li>Haemoglobin oxygen dissociation curve to identify a variant haemoglobin with increased oxygen affinity.</li>
                            <li>Serum EPO assay.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Treatment</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Thrombosis is the main cause of morbidity and mortality and its incidence can be reduced by maintaining the PCV below 0.45 and platelets below 600 x 10<sup>9</sup>/L. Aspirin (75 mg daily) is often used to inhibit platelet function.</li>
                            <li>Regular venesection is used initially to lower the PCV.</li>
                            <li>Chemotherapy (e.g. oral hydroxyurea) is also usually required.</li>
                            <li>$^{32}\mathrm{P}$ is a $\beta$-emitter which is taken up and concentrated by bone and may be used to give prolonged myelosuppression (about 2 years) in older patients.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Prognosis</h3>
                        <p>Median survival is about 16 years. Up to 30% of patients develop myelofibrosis (see below). Acute myeloid leukaemia occurs in up to 5% of patients, probably increased in patients treated with a $^{32}\mathrm{P}$ and some types of chemotherapy.</p>

                        <p>Myelofibrosis (myelosclerosis, agnogenic myeloid metaplasia) is characterized by splenomegaly, extramedullary haemopoiesis, a leuco-erythroblastic blood picture and replacement of bone marrow by collagen fibrosis.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Aetiology and pathophysiology</h3>
                        <p>Primary defect is within the haemopoietic stem cell; fibrosis results from a reactive non-neoplastic proliferation of marrow stromal cells. One-third of patients have a preceding history of PRV or essential thrombocythaemia.</p>

                            <li>Massive splenomegaly may lead to left hypochondrial pain and anaemia, leucopenia and thrombocytopenia (hypersplenism) (Fig. 27.5).</li>
                            <li>Fever, weight loss, pruritus, hepatomegaly and night sweats are frequent; gout, bone and joint pain are less common.</li>
                            <li>Abdominal swelling, ascites and bleeding from oesophageal varices occur, caused by portal hypertension, in late stages.</li>

                            <li>Serum LDH is raised. Liver function tests are often abnormal because of extramedullary haemopoiesis.</li>
                            <li>NAP score, serum B<sub>12</sub> and B<sub>12</sub> binding capacity are usually raised.</li>
                            <li>Bone marrow aspiration is usually unsuccessful ('dry tap'); the trephine biopsy shows increased cellularity, increased megakaryocytes and fibrosis (Figs 27.7 and 27.8).</li>
