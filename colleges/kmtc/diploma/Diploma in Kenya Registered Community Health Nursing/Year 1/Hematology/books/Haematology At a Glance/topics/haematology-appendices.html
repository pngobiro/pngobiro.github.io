                        <p>A 66-year-old caucasian man gives a history of increasing tiredness and lethargy over the preceding 2-4 months. He has recently lost his wife and has been drinking more alcohol than usual. His appetite is poor and he has lost 1 stone in weight over the past 3 months. He eats a mixed diet. His bowels are regular and he does not report any blood loss. He is not on any medication. He has not had any illnesses in the past.</p>
                        <p>On examination he is pale but not jaundiced. His blood pressure is 135/80. Abdominal examination, including rectal, is normal and there are no other abnormalities.</p>
                        <p>His FBC shows:</p>
                        <pre><code>Hb = 7.6 g/dL
MCV = 68 fL
MCH = 26
WBC = 8.6 x 10<sup>9</sup>/L
Platelets = 490 x 10<sup>9</sup>/L
ESR = 83 mm/h</code></pre>
                        <h4>Questions</h4>
                        <p>What is the differential diagnosis?<br>How would you manage him?</p>
                        <h4>Answers</h4>
                        <p>A history of anorexia and weight loss suggest occult malignancy. A microcytic anaemia suggests iron deficiency, and the elevated platelet count suggests bleeding as the cause. The raised ESR supports a diagnosis of underlying malignancy.</p>
                        <p>An accurate dietary and alcohol history should be taken, although alcohol usually causes a macrocytic anaemia. A poor diet may also cause folic acid or B<sub>12</sub> deficiency, which would also cause a macrocytic anaemia.</p>
                        <p><strong>Management: diagnosis and treatment</strong></p>
                        <p>Further diagnostic tests should include serum ferritin, serum B<sub>12</sub> and serum folate. Urea and electrolytes and liver function tests should also be done. A search for a cause of bleeding is mandatory, even though physical examination does not offer clues to the source of blood loss. Once iron deficiency is confirmed, endoscopic and/or radiological investigation of the GI tract is indicated.</p>
                        <p>The serum ferritin was reduced at 5 µg/L confirming iron deficiency. Upper GI endoscopy revealed a malignant gastric ulcer which was successfully resected.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Case history 2</h3>
                        <p>A 71-year-old man has back pain. This has been present for over three months and is worse in the lower back. He has also developed upper abdominal pain and constipation over the last month. He has had no serious illnesses in the past. His appetite is poor and he has lost 1 stone in weight over the previous month. His medication includes pain killers (paracetamol and Ibuprofen).</p>
                        <p>On examination he is pale. His blood pressure is slightly elevated (160/100). Urine examinatin shows 2+ proteinuria.</p>
                        <p>Investigations show:</p>
                        <pre><code>Hb = 8.6 g/dL
WBC = 9.5 x 10<sup>9</sup>/L
Platelets = 65 x 10<sup>9</sup>/L
ESR = 110 mm/h</code></pre>

                        <h4>Questions</h4>
                        <p>What is the differential diagnosis?<br>What further tests are indicated?</p>
                        <h4>Answers</h4>
                        <p>A history of recent onset of back pain, with poor appetite and weight loss, suggests malignant infiltration of the skeleton. Abdominal pain and constipation are suggestive of hypercalcaemia.</p>
                        <p>Proteinuria on urine testing suggests renal disease. There is no history of prostatic obstruction. The very high ESR suggests myeloma or carcinoma with bony metastases. Further tests should include urea and electrolytes, creatinine clearance, calcium level and serum alkaline phosphatase. X-rays of his back are required. Serum and urinary protein electrophoresis are needed to exclude myeloma.</p>
                        <p>A prostate specific antigen test to exclude prostatic carcinoma is required. This patient's calcium level was raised at 3.6 mmol/L and he was in renal failure (serum creatinine 860 mmol/L).</p>
                        <p>The serum alkaline phosphatase was normal, which is in keeping with myeloma rather than secondary deposits. Skeletal survey, bone marrow, serum and urine paraprotein level, serum $\beta_{2}$ microglobulin are indicated (see Chapter 24).</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Case history 3</h3>
                        <p>A 64-year-old caucasian lady complains of gradually increasing tiredness. She feels the cold more than she used to. She also has a sore tongue. Over the past two months she has complained of numbness of her feet. Her sister suffers from hypothyroidism. She eats a normal diet.</p>
                        <p>On examination she is pale and very slightly jaundiced. Her tongue is reddened and enlarged; she has grey hair. The thyroid gland is clinically normal. She has reduced touch and joint position sense in the toes and the ankle jerks are absent. Neurological examination is otherwise normal.</p>
                        <p>Investigations show:</p>
                        <pre><code>Hb = 6.4 g/dL
MCV = 131 fL
WBC = 3.1 x 10<sup>9</sup>/L
Platelets = 63 x 10<sup>9</sup>/L</code></pre>
                        <h4>Questions</h4>
                        <p>What is the diagnosis?<br>Which further investigations are required?<br>How would you treat her?</p>
                        <h4>Answer</h4>
                        <p>This lady presents a classic clinical picture of pernicious anaemia (p.37).</p>
                        <p>The further investigations required are listed on p. 38.</p>
                        <p>Treatment is with hydroxocobalamin (1 mg intramuscular) immediately followed by further B<sub>12</sub> injections. It is important not to give folic acid before giving B<sub>12</sub>, as it may precipitate neuropathy.</p>
