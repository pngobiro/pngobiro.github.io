                        <p>Granulocyte and monocyte production occurs in the bone marrow and is controlled by growth factors (see Table 1.1). External stimuli (e.g. infection, fever, inflammation, allergy, trauma) act on cytokine networks to increase production of these growth factors. The cytokines interleukin-1 and tumour necrosis factor (TNF) form part of this complex network. The earliest recognizable granulocyte precursors in the marrow are promyelocytes. These undergo further division and maturation into myelocytes, metamyelocytes and, finally, granulocytes (neutrophils, eosinophils and basophils). Primary granules, present in promyelocytes, contain lysosomal enzymes (e.g. peroxidase, hydrolases). Secondary granules containing enzymes (peroxidase, lysosyme, alkaline phosphatase and lactoferrin) appear later. Basophil granules also contain histamine and heparin.</p>

                        <p>The primary function of white cells is to protect the body against infection. They work closely with protein components of the immune response, immunoglobulins and complement. They also produce cytokines which augment function or stimulate proliferation of other cells. Neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils and monocytes are all phagocytes; they ingest and destroy pathogens and cell debris. Phagocytes are attracted to bacteria at the site of inflammation by chemotactic substances released from damaged tissues or by complement components. Opsonization is the coating of cells or foreign particles by immunoglobulin or complement; this aids phagocytosis (engulfment) because phagocytes have Fc and C3b (see below) receptors. Killing involves reduction of pH within the phagocytic vacuole, the release of granule contents and the production of antimicrobial oxidants and superoxides (the 'respiratory burst').</p>

                        <p>Neutrophils (polymorphs) (Fig. 3.1a) are usually the most numerous mature peripheral blood leucocyte. They have a short lifespan of around 10 h in the circulation (circulating pool). About 50% of neutrophils in peripheral blood are attached to the walls of blood vessels (marginating pool). They enter tissues by migrating in response to chemotactic factors. Their mobility results from the presence of adhesion molecules on their surface which interact with the vascular endothelium. Migration, phagocytosis and killing are energy-dependent functions. Neutrophil function tests separately assess chemotaxis/migration, phagocytosis, degranulation and the metablolic process involved in killing.</p>

                        <p>Eosinophils have similar kinetics of production, differentiation and circulation to neutrophils; the growth factor IL-5 is important in regulating their production. They have a characteristic bi-lobed nucleus (Fig. 3.1b) and red-orange staining granules. They are particularly important in the response to parasitic and allergic diseases. Release of their granule contents onto larger pathogens (e.g. helminths) allows their destruction and subsequent phagocytosis. Histamine is an important component of their granules.</p>

                        <p>Basophils are related to small darkly staining cells in the bone marrow and tissues (mast cells) and both are derived from granulocyte precursors in the bone marrow. They are the least numerous of peripheral blood leucocytes and have characteristic large dark purple granules which may obscure the nucleus (Fig. 3.1c). The granule contents include histamine and heparin and are released following binding of IgE to surface receptors. They play an important part in immediate hypersensitivity reactions. Mast cells also have an important role in defence against allergens and parasitic pathogens.</p>
