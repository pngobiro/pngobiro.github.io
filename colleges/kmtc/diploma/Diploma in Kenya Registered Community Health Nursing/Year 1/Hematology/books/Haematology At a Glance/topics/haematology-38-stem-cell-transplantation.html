                        <p>Stem cell transplantation (SCT) (Fig.38.1) is the use of haemopoietic stem cells (HSC) from a donor harvested from peripheral blood (peripheral blood stem cells, PBSC) or bone marrow, to repopulate recipient bone marrow.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Allogeneic SCT</strong> involves transplantation of HSC from one individual to another. This is usually between two HLA matching individuals, most frequently siblings but, in their absence, volunteer and HLA matched unrelated donors (MUD) are increasingly being used. HLA matching includes class I (A,B tested serologically) and class II (DR tested serologically or by molecular typing). If the donor is an identical twin, the transplant is termed 'syngeneic'. 'Mini' transplants in which the recipient receives immunosuppressive but not myeloablative therapy are currently being explored.</li>
                            <li><strong>Autologous SCT</strong> utilizes the patient's own stem cells. These are harvested from the patient then used to repopulate the marrow after further high-dose chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy.</li>
                            <li><strong>Cord blood transplantation</strong> utilizes fetal stem cells harvested at the time of birth from the umbilical cord.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Allogeneic SCT is rarely performed in individuals >55 years of age, as it carries risk of treatment-related morbidity and even mortality (up to 5-10%) which increases with age. Autologous SCT may be performed more safely in older patients, up to 70 years.</p>

                        <p>Stem cell transplantation is used to 'rescue' the patient from bone marrow failure or following intensive chemotherapy (± radiotherapy). For allogeneic SCT the recipient requires 'conditioning' therapy (chemotherapy ± radiotherapy) pretransplant to cause immunosuppression, thereby reducing risk of marrow rejection, and to eradicate malignant disease in bone marrow and elsewhere. The transplanted immune system in an allogeneic SCT may itself have antitumour, e.g. graft vs. leukaemia (GVL) effect.</p>

                        <p>Treatment with a haemopoietic growth factor (e.g. G-CSF), combined in the case of autologous SCT with chemotherapy, e.g. high-dose cyclophosphamide, is used to mobilize HSC from bone marrow into peripheral blood, where they are collected by leucopheresis. Alternatively, HSC may be harvested from marrow by multiple bone marrow aspirations, performed under general anaesthesia. Approximately 2 x 10<sup>8</sup>/kg nucleated cells or 2 x 10<sup>6</sup>/kg CD34 cells are needed (CD34 is a surface marker of early haemopoietic stem and progenitor cells). The recipient of an allogeneic or MUD transplant then receives immunosuppressive drugs to reduce the risk of graft vs. host disease (GVHD) (see below).</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Side effects of conditioning chemotherapy/radiotherapy, e.g. bone marrow failure, nausea, alopecia, skin burns, pulmonary toxicity, hepatic veno-occlusive disease, toxicity to endocrine organs and growth retardation.</li>
                            <li>Rejection of transplanted HSC.</li>
                            <li>Relapse of original disease. This is sometimes treated by infusion of lymphocytes from the allogeneic donor, which will have a GVL effect.</li>
                            <li>Infection following SCT occurs because patients are severely immunosuppressed. Infection may be bacterial, viral, protozoal or fungal. Prophylactic antibiotics, antifungal and antiviral therapy is given. CMV-negative recipients should receive blood components which are leucodepleted or from CMV-negative donors. CMV infection may cause pneumonitis, diarrhoea, liver dysfunction, skin rash and graft failure, and is a major cause of transplant-related mortality. Ganciclovir and foscarnet are useful in treatment of CMV infection. Prophylaxis against Pneumocystis carinii infection is with oral co-trimoxazole and/or nebulized pentamidine.</li>
                            <li>Metabolic problems, often caused by multiple intravenous drugs (antibiotics, antivirals, antifungals), renal failure, blood component therapy, intravenous feeding, etc.</li>
                            <li><strong>Graft vs. host disease (GVHD) (allogeneic SCT).</strong> Transplanted lymphocytes may recognize the recipient as 'foreign' and mount an immunological onslaught, to cause skin rash, liver disease and diarrhoea. The incidence of GVHD is higher in older patients. Acute GVHD (&lt;100 days after SCT) typically begins 7-10 days after transplantation and is graded according to severity. Chronic GVHD (&gt;100 days) presents with a scleroderma-like syndrome, liver, lung, gastrointestinal or joint abnormalities. The incidence and severity of GVHD may be decreased by depleting T cells from donor marrow and immune suppression of the recipient.</li>
