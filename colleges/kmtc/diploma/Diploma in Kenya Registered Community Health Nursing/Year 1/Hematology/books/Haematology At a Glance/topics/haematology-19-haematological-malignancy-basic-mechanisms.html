                        <p>Haematological malignancies (Table 19.1) are thought to arise from a single cell in the bone marrow, thymus or peripheral lymphoid system. This cell undergoes genetic change (mutation) leading to malignant transformation. Successive mitotic divisions give rise to a clone of cells derived from the parent cell. Further mutations may give rise to subclones (clonal evolution). Transformed cells either proliferate excessively or are resistant to apoptosis. They are often 'frozen' at a particular stage of differentiation.</p>

                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Genetic predisposition.</strong> Certain inherited conditions (e.g. Down's syndrome, trisomy 21) and conditions associated with defective DNA repair (e.g. Fanconi's anaemia) or immune suppression (e.g. ataxia telangiectasia).</li>
                            <li><strong>Viral infection.</strong> Human T-cell leukaemia virus (HTLV-1) incorporates into T-lymphoid-cell genome and underlies adult T-cell leukaemia lymphoma (see Chapter 26). Other viruses predispose to malignancy by immune suppression (e.g. HIV). Epidemiological evidence implicates Epstein-Barr virus in Burkitt's lymphoma.</li>
                            <li><strong>Ionizing radiation</strong> causes DNA mutation and increases the risk of haematological neoplasia.</li>
                            <li><strong>Toxins/chemicals</strong>, e.g. benzene and organochemicals may predispose to leukaemia and myelodysplasia (MDS).</li>
                            <li><strong>Drugs.</strong> Alkylating agents (e.g. melphalan, mustine) and other forms of chemotherapy predispose to MDS or acute myeloid leukaemia.</li>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">1 Oncogenes</h3>
                        <p>These are genes whose protein products cause neoplastic transformation. Oncogenes are derived from normal cellular genes (proto-oncogenes) which code for proteins usually involved in one or other stage in cell signal transduction, gene transcription, cell cycle, cell survival/apoptosis or differentiation. Inappropriate activation and expression of an oncogene may cause transformation. Activation of oncogenes may occur by amplification, point mutation or translocation (most frequent in haematological malignancies) from one chromosomal location to another. Translocation may lead to a quantitative change in expression (e.g. MYC translocation to immunoglobulin heavy chain locus in lymphoid neoplasia, t(8;14)) or qualitative change by joining all or part of the oncogene to another gene to form a fusion gene (e.g. ABL translocation to the breakpoint cluster region [BCR] to form BCR-ABL in CML, t[9;22]).</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">2 Anti-oncogenes</h3>
                        <p>Anti-oncogenes, or tumour suppressor genes (e.g.p53), are genes encoding proteins which have a critical role in suppressing cell growth. Chromosome deletion may obliterate tumour suppressor genes on one allele; deletion or mutation of the remaining allele may allow uncontrolled cell growth.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">3 Inhibition of apoptosis</h3>
                        <p>Malignant cells often show resistance to apoptosis. The BCL-2 gene product inhibits apoptosis and its expression is increased in some chromosome translocations (e.g. in NHL).</p>
