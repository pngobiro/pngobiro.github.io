                        <p>Folate is an essential coenzyme for the synthesis of thymidine monosphosphate (TMP) and therefore of DNA. $B_{12}$ is a coenzyme for methionine synthase, a reaction needed in the demethylation of the plasma form of folate, 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (methylTHF) (Fig. 11.1). MethylTHF enters cells and its demethylation provides THF which acts as substrate for synthesis of intracellular folate, polyglutamates, the coenzyme forms of folate needed in DNA synthesis.</p>

The reaction methionine synthase involves conversion of haemocysteine to methionine which is converted to $S$-adenosylmethionine involved in numerous methylation reactions. 5.10-Methylene tetrahydrofolate plays a key part in DNA synthesis by acting as coenzyme for synthesis of thymidine monophosphate from deoxyuridine monophosphate.</figcaption>

                            <li>Adult daily requirement for $B_{12}$ is $1 \mu \mathrm{g}$ (normal mixed diet contains $10-15 \mu \mathrm{g}$). $B_{12}$ is present only in foods of animal origin: meat, fish, eggs, milk and butter; it is absent from vegetables, cereals and fruit, unless contaminated by microorganisms. Normal body stores of $B_{12}$, largely in the liver with an enterohepatic circulation, are sufficient to last for 2-4 years.</li>
                            <li>Dietary $B_{12}$ after release from food and gastric 'R' binder (see below) combines with intrinsic factor (IF) secreted by gastric parietal cells (GPC). IF-B$_{12}$ complex attaches to ileal receptors and $B_{12}$ is absorbed.</li>
                            <li>Passive absorption (about $0.1\%$ of oral $B_{12}$) occurs through buccal, gastric and duodenal mucosae.</li>
                            <li>Absorbed $B_{12}$ attaches to transcobalamin (TC) II which carries $B_{12}$ in plasma to the liver, bone marrow, brain and other tissues. Most $B_{12}$ in plasma is attached to a second $B_{12}$ binding protein, TC I, and is functionally inactive. TC I is synthesized by granulocytes and their precursors. Similar glycoproteins ('R' proteins) occur in saliva, gastric juice and milk.</li>

                        <p>Vegans may develop $B_{12}$ deficiency, although the intact enterohepatic circulation of a few microgrammes of $B_{12}$ daily delays its onset.

                        <ul>
                            <li>Pernicious anaemia (PA) is characterized by an autoimmune gastritis, and reduced gastric secretion of IF and acid (Fig.11.3). It is often associated with other organ-specific autoimmune diseases (e.g. myxoedema, thyrotoxicosis, vitiligo, Addison's disease and hypoparathyroidism). Antibodies to IF and gastric parietal cells occur in serum and in gastric secretion ($50\%$ and $90\%$, respectively) of patients. Pernicious anaemia is also associated with early greying of hair, blue eyes, blood group A, a family history of PA or related autoimmune disease and a $2-3$-fold increased incidence of carcinoma of the stomach. It occurs in all races and has a female/male incidence of $1.6:1$. Peak age of incidence is 60 years.</li>
                            <li>Gastrectomy (total or subtotal) leads to $B_{12}$ deficiency.</li>
                            <li>Congenital IF deficiency or abnormality is rare.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Intestinal causes</h4>
                        <p>These include bacterial (rarely fish tapeworm) colonization of small intestine, stagnant loop syndromes, congenital and acquired defects of the ileum (e.g. ileal resection, Crohn's disease). Congenital $B_{12}$ malabsorption with proteinuria is rare.</p>

                        <p>Radioactive $B_{12}$ absorption studies distinguish gastric from intestinal causes of $B_{12}$ malabsorption. The amount of radioactive $B_{12}$ absorbed is measured either by whole body counting or in a $24-\mathrm{h}$ urine sample after a 'flushing' dose of 1 mg unlabelled $B_{12}$, given simultaneously with the oral radioactive dose (Schilling test). The test can be performed with the labelled $B_{12}$ given alone or with IF. A combined urinary excretion test using two isotopic forms of $B_{12}$, one bound to IF, can be used (Dicopac test). $B_{12}$ absorption is low and corrected by IF in PA but is low and not corrected by IF in intestinal diseases.</p>
