                        <p>Lymphocytes are an essential component of the immune response and are derived from haemopoietic stem cells. A common lymphoid stem cell undergoes differentiation and proliferation to give rise to B cells, which mediate humoral or antibody-mediated immunity, and T cells (processed in the thymus), mediating cell-mediated immunity (see Fig. 1.1). Mature lymphocytes appear as small mononuclear cells which have scanty blue cytoplasm (Fig. 5.1). The majority of peripheral blood lymphocytes ($70\%$) are T cells, which typically have more cytoplasm than B cells and may contain granules.</p>
                        <p>Lymphocyte maturation occurs principally in bone marrow for B cells and in the thymus for T cells but also involves the lymph nodes, liver, spleen and other parts of the reticuloendothelial system. The antigens expressed on the surface of a cell can be recognized in the laboratory by reaction with monoclonal antibody reagents. The cluster of differentiation (CD) nomenclature system has evolved as a means of classifying these antigens. Although most frequently applied to lymphocytes, it is applicable to all haemopoietic cells (see Appendix I). Lymphocytes have the longest lifespan of any leucocyte, and some (e.g. 'memory' B cells) may live for many years.</p>

                        <p>Specificity of the immune response derives from amplification of antigen-selected T and B cells. The T cell receptor (TCR) on T cells and surface membrane immunoglobulin (sIg) on B cells are molecules which have a variable and a constant portion. The variability ensures that a specific antigen is recognized by a lymphocyte with a matching variable region. The genetic mechanisms required to generate the required diversity are common to both T and B cells (Fig. 5.2). They involve rearrangement of variable, joining, diversity and constant region genes to generate genes coding for surface receptors (Ig or TCR) capable of reacting specifically with an enormous array of antigens.</p>
                        <p>The immune response (Fig. 5.3) involves interaction between T cells, B cells and antigen presenting cells (APCs). Mature T cells are of three main types: helper cells expressing the CD4 antigen; suppressor cells expressing CD8; and cytotoxic cells expressing CD8. Developing T cells are 'educated' in the thymus only to react to foreign antigens, and to develop tolerance to self human leucocyte antigens (HLA). If antigen is presented by an APC alongside the HLA (major histocompatability complex, MHC class II) to a CD4+ T cell, T cell activation and proliferation result. CD8+ cytotoxic cells require the antigen to be presented to them alongside MHC class I molecules. B cells can also interact directly with antigen. Adhesion molecules mediate these cellular interactions. Reaction between antigen and appropriate receptor (sIg or TCR) leads to cellular proliferation and differentiation. This process is augmented by cytokines released by APCs (e.g. IL-6, IL-7) and by interacting T cells (e.g. IL-2) which stimulate T and B cell proliferation. CD8+ suppressor T cells have an important role in regulating B cell proliferation. CD8+ cytotoxic T cells are capable of directly lysing APCs which present appropriate antigen in association with MHC class I molecules.</p>

                            <figcaption>Fig. 5.2 Immunoglobulin gene rearrangement and transcription. Immunoglobulin heavy chain genes occur as segments for variable (V), diversity (D), joining (J) and constant (C) regions. The class of the immunoglobulin depends on which of the constant region genes ($\mu, \delta, \gamma, \alpha, \varepsilon$) is transcribed. The switch region (S) allows switching between classes. Diversity occurs through variability of which V segment joins which D and which J segment; the enzyme terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) randomly inserts new bases into D region DNA to generate additional diversity. Recombinase enzymes join up rearranged segments of DNA and intervening sequences are deleted. Similar rearrangements occur at the immunoglobulin light chain ($\kappa$ and $\lambda$) and T cell receptor ($\alpha/\beta, \gamma/\delta$) loci. histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecule to a CD4+ (helper) T cell which has an appropriate configuration of its T cell receptor, the T cell will become activated, proliferate and facilitate proliferation of appropriate B cells. B cells also interact with antigen presented by the APC, but to a different epitope. (b) If processed antigen linked to MHC class I molecules is presented to a cytotoxic (CD8+) T cell, it will trigger proliferation of a clone of cytotoxic T cells which will lyse the APC.</figcaption>
