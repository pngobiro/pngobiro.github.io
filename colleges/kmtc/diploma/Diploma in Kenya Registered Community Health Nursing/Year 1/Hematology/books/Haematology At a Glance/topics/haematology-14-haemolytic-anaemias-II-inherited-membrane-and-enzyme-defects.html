                        <p>This is the most common inherited haemolytic anaemia (HA) in white people. It is autosomal dominant with variable severity and may present as severe neonatal HA, as symptomatic HA later in life, or as an incidental finding. Defect is in a red cell membrane protein e.g. spectrin; 25% of cases are new mutations. Affected red cells lose membrane during passage through the reticuloendothelial system, especially the spleen. The cells become progressively more spherical (decreased surface area/volume ratio) and microcytic. They are destroyed prematurely, mainly in the spleen.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Clinical features</h4>
                        <p>Clinical features are those generally associated with HA. The spleen is usually enlarged.</p>

                        <p>G6PD is the first enzyme in the hexose monophosphate pathway (see Fig.2.4) which generates reducing power as reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH). Deficiency results in red cells being susceptible to oxidant stress. The gene is on the X chromosome so inheritance is sex-linked. Many mutant enzymes occur. Affected males develop HA when the red cells are exposed to oxidant stress, especially by drugs, infections, ingestion of fava beans and during the neonatal period (Table 14.1). Deficiency is common in black, mediterranean, middle-eastern and oriental populations. There is epidemiological evidence that individuals with G6PD deficiency have a small degree of protection against malaria.</p>

Inheritance is autosomal recessive. The $\mathrm{O}_{2}$-dissociation curve is shifted to the right so symptoms are mild in comparison to the degree of anaemia. Splenectomy partly improves the anaemia.</p>
