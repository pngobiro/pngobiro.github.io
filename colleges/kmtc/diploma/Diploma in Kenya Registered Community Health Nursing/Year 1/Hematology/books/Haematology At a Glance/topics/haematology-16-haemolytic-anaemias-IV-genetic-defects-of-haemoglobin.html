                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">$\alpha$-thalassaemia</h3>
                        <p>Normally there are four $\alpha$-globin genes, two on each chromosome 16 (see Fig.2.2). Severity of $\alpha$-thalassaemia depends on the number of $\alpha$-genes deleted or, less frequently, dysfunctional.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Hydrops fetalis</h4>
                        <p>In hydrops fetalis all four $\alpha$ genes are inactive. The fetus is unable to make either fetal ($\alpha_{2}\gamma_{2}$) or adult Hb A ($\alpha_{2}\beta_{2}$) haemoglobin. Death occurs in utero or neonatally.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Haemoglobin H disease</h4>
                        <p>This is caused by deletion or functional inactivity of three of the four $\alpha$ genes. Markedly microcytic hypochromic anaemia (Hb 6-11.0g/dL); splenomegaly usual. Bone deformities and features of iron overload do not occur. Haemoglobin electrophoresis shows 4-10% haemoglobin H ($\beta$4) and supravital staining shows 'golf ball' cells.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">$\alpha$-thalassaemia trait</h4>
                        <p>This is a one or two $\alpha$ gene deletion with microscopic hypochromic red cells with raised red cell count (&gt;5.5 x 10<sup>9</sup>/L). Mild anaemia occurs in some cases with two $\alpha$ genes deleted.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">$\beta$-thalassaemia</h3>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Thalassaemia major</h4>
                        <p>Complete ($\beta$o) or almost complete ($\beta^{+}$) failure of $\beta$-globin chain synthesis resulting from one of over 160 different point mutations or deletions in the $\beta$-globin gene or its controlling sequences on chromosome 11. There is severe imbalance of $\alpha:\beta+\gamma$ chains with deposition of $\alpha$ chains in erythroblasts, ineffective erythropoiesis, severe anaemia and extramedullary haemopoiesis.</p>

                        <p><strong>Clinical features</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Anaemia presents at the age of 3-6 months when the switch from $\alpha$- to $\beta$-chain synthesis normally occurs. Milder cases present later (up to age 4 years).</li>
                            <li>Failure to thrive, intercurrent infection, pallor, mild jaundice.</li>
                            <li>Enlargement of the liver and spleen, expansion of the bones - especially of the skull - with bossing and a 'hair on end' appearance on X-ray (Fig. 16.1); thalassaemic facies, caused by expansion of skull and facial bones.</li>
                            <li>Features of iron overload as a result of blood transfusions include melanin pigmentation, growth/endocrine defects, cardiac failure, liver abnormality (see Chapter 10).</li>

                            <li>Globin chain synthesis studies show absent, or severely deficient, $\beta$-chain synthesis. Fetal haemoglobin variably increased.</li>

                        <p><strong>Management</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Regular transfusions of packed red cells to maintain haemoglobin above $9-10 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dL}$, leucodepleted to reduce risk of HLA sensitization and of transmission of disease, e.g. cytomegalovirus.</li>
                            <li>Iron chelation therapy with subcutaneous desferrioxamine (DFX) over $8-12 \mathrm{~h}$ on 5-7 nights weekly. Additional DFX may be given intravenously at the time of blood transfusion via a separate bag. Oral vitamin C increases iron excretion with DFX. An orally active chelator, deferiprone is also available for those unable to take DFX (see also Chapter 10).</li>
                            <li>Hepatitis B is prevented by early immunization. Patients who already have chronic active hepatitis caused by hepatitis C may need $\alpha$-interferon + ribavirin therapy.</li>
                            <li>Splenectomy is necessary if blood requirements are excessively high. Defer if possible until the age of 5 years, precede by immunization (see Chapter 39) and follow by oral penicillin therapy for life. If the platelet count remains raised, low-dose aspirin reduces the risk of thromboembolism.</li>
                            <li>Bone marrow transplantation from a HLA-matching sibling may give long-term disease-free survival of up to $90\%$ in good-risk patients, but nearer $50\%$ in poor risk (previously poorly chelated with enlarged liver and liver fibrosis).</li>
                            <li>Treat complications of iron overload: heart, endocrine organs, liver damage.</li>
                            <li>Osteoporosis may occur as a result of marrow expansion, endocrine deficiencies.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Thalassaemia intermedia</h3>
                        <p>A variable syndrome milder than thalassaemia major, with later onset, and characterized by moderately severe (Hb $6-10 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dL}$), hypochromic microcytic anaemia requiring either few or no transfusions. There is milder imbalance of $\alpha:\beta+\gamma$ globin chain synthesis than in thalassaemia major due to milder $\beta$-chain defects, increased $\gamma$ chains or reduced $\alpha$-chain synthesis. Hepatosplenomegaly, extramedullary haemopoiesis, anaemia and bone deformities may occur. Iron overload occurs as a result of irregular blood transfusions and increased gastrointestinal iron absorption.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">$\beta$-thalassaemia trait</h3>
                        <p>A mild hypochromic microcytic anaemia with a raised red cell count (&gt;5.5 x 10<sup>12</sup>/L) and raised haemoglobin A<sub>2</sub> ($\alpha_{2}\delta_{2}$) level (&gt;3.5%). Iron stores are normal, though iron deficiency may occur as in unaffected subjects. Accurate diagnosis allows genetic counselling and avoidance of inappropriate iron therapy.</p>

                        <p>Prenatal diagnosis is available using either DNA (chorionic villous or amniotic fluid) or fetal blood. Carriers must first be identified (screening by blood count in ethnic minority groups, at preconception counselling or in the antenatal clinic). If a mother is a carrier, her partner must be tested. If both are carriers, there is a one in four chance that the fetus is homozygous, or doubly heterozygous, and a one in two chance that the fetus is a carrier. Fetal DNA is then usually amplified by use of the polymerase chain reaction test and the DNA mutations are detected. If the fetus is severely affected the couple should be counselled and termination of pregnancy, if appropriate, offered.</p>
