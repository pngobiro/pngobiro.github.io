                        <p>Haemopoiesis is the process whereby blood cells are made. The yolk sac, and later the liver and spleen, are important in fetal life but after birth normal haemopoiesis is restricted to the bone marrow. Infants have haemopoietic marrow in all bones but in adults it is in the central skeleton and proximal ends of long bones (normal fat to haemopoietic tissue ratio of about 50:50) (Fig. 1.1). Expansion of haemopoiesis down the long bones may occur, e.g. in leukaemias and chronic haemolytic anaemias. The liver and spleen can resume extramedullary haemopoiesis when there is marrow replacement, e.g. in myelofibrosis, or excessive demand, e.g. in severe haemolytic anaemias.</p>

                        <p>A common primitive stem cell in the marrow has the capacity to self replicate, proliferate and differentiate to increasingly specialized progenitor cells which, after many cell divisions within the marrow, form mature cells (red cells, granulocytes, monocytes, platelets and lymphocytes) of the peripheral blood (Fig. 1.2). The earliest recognizable red cell precursor is a pronormoblast and the earliest recognizable granulocyte or monocyte precursor is a myeloblast. An early lineage division is between progenitors for lymphoid and myeloid cells. Stem and progenitor cells cannot be recognized morphologically; they resemble lymphocytes. Progenitor cells can be detected by special in vitro assays in which they form colonies (e.g. colony forming units for granulocytes and monocytes, CFU-GM, or for red cells, BFU-E and CFU-E). Stem and progenitor cells also circulate in the peripheral blood. The stromal cells of the marrow (fibroblasts, endothelial cells, macrophages, fat cells) have adhesion molecules which react with corresponding ligands on the stem cells and maintain their viability.</p>

                        <p>Haemopoiesis is regulated by growth factors (GFs) (Table 1.1) which usually act in synergy with each other. These are glycoproteins produced by stromal cells, T lymphocytes, the liver and, for erythropoietin, the kidney. While some GFs act mainly on receptors on the surface of primitive cells, others act on later cells already committed to a particular lineage. They also affect the function of mature cells. Growth factors inhibit apoptosis (programmed cell death) of their target cells. Growth factors in clinical use include erythropoietin (EPO), granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). Thrombopoietin is under trial.</p>

                        <p>The binding of a GF with its surface receptor on the haemopoietic cell activates a complex series of biochemical reactions by which a message is transmitted into the nucleus (Fig. 1.3). The pathways involve sequential phosphorylation of substrates by protein kinases. The signal activates transcription factors which in turn activate or inhibit gene transcription. The signal may activate pathways which cause the cell to enter cell cycle (replicate), differentiate, maintain viability (inhibition of apoptosis) or become functionally active (e.g. enhancement of cell killing by neutrophils).</p>

Bone marrow aspiration also allows assessment of the later stages of maturation of haemopoietic cells (Fig. 1.4a-f; see Chapter 7 for indications). Trephine biopsy provides a core of bone and bone marrow to show architecture.</p>
