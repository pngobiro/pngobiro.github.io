                        <p>Heparin is a mucopolysaccharide which is not absorbed orally and is therefore given subcutaneously or intravenously. It activates antithrombin (AT) which irreversibly inactivates prothrombin Xa, IXa and XIa. It also impairs platelet function. Unfractionated heparin (UFH) is a heterogeneous mixture of polysaccharide chains. Low-molecular-weight (LMW) heparin preparations (MW &lt;5000) have a greater ability to inactivate Xa and less effect on thrombin (Fig. 33.1) and platelet function, and therefore have a lesser tendency to cause bleeding. They have a longer plasma half-life so that once daily subcutaneous administration is effective in prophylaxis. They also interact less than UFH with endothelium, plasma proteins, macrophages and platelets making their action more predictable.</p>

                            <figcaption>Fig.33.1 Heparin binds to antithrombin via a pentasaccharide sequence, and induces a conformational change which allows antithrombin to bind Xa and thrombin. The shorter chain length of low molecular weight (LMW) heparin allows binding to only Xa, while unfractionated heparin will bind both Xa and thrombin. Thus, LMW heparin allows a selective inhibition of factor Xa. Modified from Weitz J.I. (1997) Low molecular-weight heparin. New England Journal of Medicine, 337: 688-98.</figcaption>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Indications</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Acute venous thrombosis, e.g. deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). Continuous intravenous infusion of UFH for 5-7 days until warfarinized. Subcutaneous LMW heparin is equally effective. Warfarin is usually started 1-2 days after heparin.</li>
                            <li>Unstable angina, post myocardial infarction.</li>
                            <li>Disseminated intravascular coagulation if this is dominated by thrombosis.</li>
                            <li>Acute peripheral arterial occlusion.</li>
                            <li>Prophylaxis of DVT in surgical patients, e.g. 5000 units UFH b.d. (LMW heparin 2000-5000 units once daily).</li>
                            <li>Thrombosis prophylaxis in patients undergoing cardiac surgery or renal dialysis.</li>
                            <li>Pregnancy. As warfarin is teratogenic, heparin is used in the first trimester of pregnancy when anticoagulation is needed.</li>
                            <li>Maintaining patency of indwelling lines and catheters.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Monitoring</h3>
                        <p>For continuous intravenous infusion, the APPT should be maintained at 1.5-2 x normal. LMW heparin therapy is not normally monitored; if necessary, e.g. in renal failure or in those of very low (&lt;50 kg) or high (&gt;80 kg) body weight, by factor Xa assay.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Side effects</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Haemorrhage, particularly if combined with antiplatelet therapy, overdosage or, rarely, platelet function defect. Heparin has a short half-life (1 h); levels fall rapidly when infusion stopped. Protamine sulphate will reverse heparin immediately, but must be used with caution as it can cause haemorrhage at high dosage.</li>
                            <li>Long-term therapy (&gt;2 months) can lead to osteoporosis.</li>
                            <li>Thrombocytopenia, which is antibody-mediated, may lead to platelet clumping with arterial thrombosis.</li>
                            <li>LMW heparin is less likely to cause all these side effects.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>Vitamin K promotes the $\gamma$ carboxylation of glutamic acid residues of factor II, VII, IX and X; warfarin prevents this to cause a 50% drop of factor VII levels within 24 h and of factor II in 4 days. Full anticoagulation occurs 48-72 h after starting warfarin therapy. Non-carboxylated factors II, VII, IX and X (proteins formed in vitamin K absence, PIVKAs) appear in plasma (see Fig. 33.2). Protein C and S levels also fall and this initially (first 2-3 days) leads to an increased risk of thrombosis and may lead to skin necrosis.</p>

                        <p>The PT is measured and expressed as an international normalized ratio (INR) against the mean normal PT using a calibrated thromboplastin. Treatment is monitored by maintaining the INR at 2.0-3.5, precise level depending on indication.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Indications</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Treatment of DVT, pulmonary embolism, systemic embolism (3-6 months therapy).</li>
                            <li>Prophylaxis against thrombosis in patients with atrial fibrillation, prosthetic valves, arterial grafts, repeated pulmonary embolism and in patients with inherited or acquired predisposition.</li>
                            <li>Low doses (to maintain INR 1.5) of value in prevention of myocardial infarct in high-risk groups.</li>
                            <li>Warfarin crosses the placenta and is teratogenic in early pregnancy; heparin is given in pregnancy.</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Haemorrhage—especially in patients taking other anticoagulants, antiplatelet drugs or thrombolytic therapy, and in those with liver disease.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Drug interactions</h3>
                        <p>Warfarin is highly bound to albumin and is metabolized by the liver. The minor unbound fraction is active. Action is increased by drugs which:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>reduce its binding to albumin, e.g. aspirin, sulphonamides;</li>
                            <li>inhibit hepatic metabolism, e.g. allopurinol, tricyclic antidepressants, sulphonamides;</li>
                            <li>decrease absorption of vitamin K, e.g. antibiotics, laxatives;</li>
                            <li>decrease synthesis of vitamin K factors, e.g. high-dose salicylates.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Action is decreased by drugs which:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>accelerate its metabolism, e.g. barbiturates, rifampicin; and</li>
                            <li>enhance synthesis of coagulation factors, e.g. oral contraceptives, hormone replacement therapy.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Reversal of action</h3>
                        <p>Patients with haemorrhage and a raised INR should receive fresh frozen plasma or concentrates of factors II, VII, IX and X. If severe, also vitamin K (10 mg i.v.) but this results in resistance to warfarin for 2-3 weeks. Raised INR without haemorrhage is managed by withholding therapy for 1-2 days and repeating the INR.</p>
