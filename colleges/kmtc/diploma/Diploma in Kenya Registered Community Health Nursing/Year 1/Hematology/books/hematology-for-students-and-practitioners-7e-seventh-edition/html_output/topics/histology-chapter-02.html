                        <p>In a normal healthy person there is a constant breakdown and fresh formation of various blood elements. However, minor daily physiological fluctuations do occur.</p>
                        <p>The erythrocytes transport the respiratory gases, oxygen and carbon dioxide, granulocytes and monocytes (leukocytes) are cells that can get out of the blood vessels and migrate among the cells of many tissues. These cells are important in inflammation and phagocytosis. Platelets are tiny, anucleate cells that contain molecules required for hemostasis, they also provide hemostasis through their ability to adhere, aggregate and provide a surface for coagulation reactions. Lymphocytes mediate highly specific immunity against microorganisms and other foreign particles/molecules. B lymphocytes confer immunity through production of specific soluble antibodies, whereas T lymphocytes direct a large variety of immunity functions, including killing of cells that bear foreign molecules on their surface membranes. Inspite of such vast structural and functional differences, these cells are thought to be originating from a single type of cell. The process is termed as hematopoiesis. These processes of hematopoiesis include self renewal of stem cells, commitment of most progeny of stem cells to differentiate ultimately into a particular cell type, proliferation of the progenitor cells, and their differentiation along a pathway leading to a particular kind of mature blood cell. Absolutely essential for the process to continue, is the maintenance of a local environment conducive to survival of at least same portion of the cell lineage, production of necessary protein survival factors or growth factors.</p>

                        <p>During embryogenesis blood production sites change several times. Nucleated RBCs first appear in "blood islands" in the yolk sac (yolk sac hematopoiesis is dominant till 8 weeks of gestation). The yolk sac-derived RBCs do not lose their nuclei during maturation and they contain hemoglobin molecules of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ chains. As soon as liver is organized, it becomes the major hematopoietic organ of the fetus during mid-gestation; the spleen also to a minor extent participates in the process. The RBCs produced by these organs are anucleate and the hemoglobin consists of $\alpha$ and fetal type $\beta$ chains. Eventually, the bone marrow takes over the process (and, it stays the exclusive post-natal site of hematopoiesis). During late fetal development RBCs begin to be produced that contain the adult type $\beta$ chains.</p>

                        <p>With increasing age, peripheral skeleton produces less blood cells and the function is taken over by axial skeleton mainly. After the age of 4 years fat cells begin to appear in the long bones. Around age of 18 years, hematopoietic marrow is found in the sternum, ribs, pelvis, vertebrae and skull.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Abnormal Sites</h3>
                        <p><strong>Extramedullary hematopoiesis (myeloid metaplasia):</strong> In certain disorders the fetal hemopoietic organs revert to their old function supported by the reticulum cell which retains its potential hemopoietic activity. This occurs when bone marrow cannot fulfil the requirements or demand imposed upon it any further.</p>
                        <p>The spleen and liver are the most commonly encountered sites, but hematopoiesis in lymph nodes, and less commonly, adrenal glands, cartilage, broad ligament, thrombi, adipose tissue, intrathoracic areas, kidneys and endosteum also has been recorded. The presence of megakaryocytes in these areas differentiates the process from leukemic infiltrates.</p>

                        <h3>IN AN ADULT</h3>
                        <p>Hematopoiesis occurs in the extravascular part of the red marrow. A single layer of epithelial cells separates the extravascular marrow compartment from the intravascular compartment (venous sinuses). When blood cells produced in the marrow are almost mature and ready to circulate in the peripheral blood, the cells leave the marrow parenchyma by passing through the fenestrations in endothelial cells and emerge into the venous sinuses.</p>
                        <p>The various cell lineages in bone marrow originate from the pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells. The pluripotential stem cell provides a cellular reserve for the stem cells committed to the lymphoid stem cell line for lymphopoiesis and to the nonlymphoid stem cell line for producing the other hematopoietic cells. The nonlymphoid (or myeloid) committed stem cell produces the erythrocytic, granulocytic (neutrophilic, eosinophilic, basophilic), monocytic macrophage, and megakaryocytic-platelet lines. The lymphoid committed stem cell produces lymphocytic and plasmocytic cells. The pluripotential stem cells are not as such identifiable in bone marrow smears, but when isolated in cell culture systems they have been observed to be small round cells with fine chromatin, nucleoli, and blue nongranular cytoplasm (akin to an early lymphoid cell).</p>
                        <p>Most of the knowledge gained as regards hematopoiesis has been derived from nonhuman mammalian experimental models, e.g. mice. The hematopoietic stem cell has been defined as a colony forming unit (CFU). In a classic experiment, Till and McCullock irradiated mice and then injected suspensions of marrow cells intravenously. About 10 days later, nodules of injected marrow could be observed on the surface of the spleen and in microscopic study of the splenic tissue. These nodules were named "spleen colonies," and the progenitor cells that formed these colonies were called colony-forming unit-spleen (CFU-S).</p>
                        <p>Under the influence of the splenic microenvironment, an injected stem cell from a suspension of marrow cells proliferates and differentiates into a larger colony. Enumeration of the colonies allows for an indirect method of quantitation of the number of injected CFU-S. Each colony is derived from a single stem cell. Proof of the clonality of the nodules is substantiated by using cells with chromosome markers induced by radiation when 95% or more of the metaphases in the colonies are observed. In addition, if a colony is removed cautiously from the spleen two weeks after injection and a suspension of cells is made and injected into irradiated mice, numerous colonies are observed. Such evidence demonstrates the self-renewing capacity of CFU-S in the colonies.</p>
                        <p>Spleen colonies observed at first were primarily composed of erythroid cells with a few megakaryocytes and granulocytes, but later the colonies were noted to be mixtures of these cell times. Thus, the committed myeloid (pertaining to marrow) stem cell (CFU-S) is considered to be multipotent and to give rise to granulocytes, erythrocytes, monocytes, and megakaryocytes. Hence, the term CFU GEMM (granulocytic, erythrocytic, myelocytic, monocytic) has been suggested and may be substituted for "CFU-S" (Fig. 2.2).</p>
                        <p>In vitro culture methods now provide another assay system for hematopoietic stem cells. Progenitor stem cells (CFU-S) have been identified by their activity to form large in vitro colonies on semisolid culture media which contains growth factor or colony stimulating factor (CSF) for sustained growth. CSF consists of cell extracts from monocytes, macrophages, endothelial cells, fat cells, and other cellular elements. In the presence of CSF, colonies of granulocytes and monocytes are formed in 7-10 days. These colonies of granulocytes and monocytes have been named CFU-C (C for culture) or CFU<sub>GM</sub> (GM for granulocytes and monocytes), indicating that they are committed to the production of granulocytic and monocytic cells. Other more mature and specialized precursors include CFU<sub>Eo</sub> (eosinophils), CFU<sub>Ba</sub> (basophils). CFU<sub>E</sub> (erythroid), and CFU<sub>Meg</sub> (megakaryocytes). BFU<sub>E</sub> (burst-forming unit, erythroid) refers to an earlier erythroid progenitor than the CFU<sub>E</sub>.</p>

For instance, the colony-stimulating factors, interleukins and erythropoietin. These may act locally or via the systemic circulation.</p>

                        <p>Mature RBCs are derived from committed erythroid progenitor cells through a series of mitotic divisions and maturation phases. Erythropoietin, a humoral agent produced mainly by the kidney, stimulates erythropoiesis by acting on stem cells to induce proliferation and differentiation of erythrocytes. Tissue hypoxia is the main stimulus for the production of erythropoietin by the kidneys.</p>
                        <p>The in vitro systems devised for assay of CFU-S defined two classes of erythroid stem cells. The committed myeloid stem cell CFU<sub>GEMM</sub> differentiates into a primitive erythroid cell called burst-forming unit erythroid (BFU<sub>E</sub>) which requires large amounts of erythropoietin and long culture times to form large erythroid colonies (or "bursts"). The BFU<sub>E</sub> differentiates into an erythroid stem cell called colony-forming unit-erythroid (CFU<sub>E</sub>) which gives rise to tiny erythroid colonies and needs low levels of erythropoietin and short culture times.</p>

                        <h3>Erythron Concept</h3>
                        <p>Blood cells markedly differ from rest of the body cells both in structure and function. With respect to erythrocytes, it is useful to conceive of the precursors and mature cells as components of a single, though discontinuous organ known as the erythron. This concept emphasizes the functional unity of the red blood corpuscles and their precursors. The insterstitial tissue of the erythron comprise the plasma and the fat and reticulum of the bone marrow.</p>
                        <p>Erythropoiesis occurs in the marrow over a period of four to five days through successive morphologic alterations in the nucleated cells from pronormoblast to the anucleate mature RBC.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Erythroblast is a nucleated red cell.</li>
                            <li>Normoblast implies normal (reaction) erythropoiesis.</li>
                            <li>Megaloblast implies megaloblastic (reaction) erythropoiesis.</li>
                            <li>Normoblastic maturation involves:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Reduction in cell size</li>
                                    <li>Ripening of cytoplasm, i.e. hemoglobinization.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>Maturation time from pronormoblast to RBC is 7 days.</li>
                            <li>Mitotic division occurs till the intermediate normoblast stage. 14-16 erythrocytes are produced from one pronormoblast. 10-15% of nucleated red cells die in marrow maturation.</li>
                            <li>The basophilic (bluish) cytoplasm in erythrocytic precursors is due to presence of ribosomes joined together (2-8) by a strand of messenger RNA called ribosomal RNA.</li>
                            <li>Ultrastructural (electron microscopy) differentiation from other early precursors is made by the presence of ferritin in the normoblasts.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The amount of "reticulum" decreases as the cells mature. Reticulocytes are more adhesive than adult RBCs and move about in currents at much slower rate than do mature cells. They appear to have a coating of globulin, at least part of which is transferrin. Their specific gravity is lower than that of adult RBCs, and they tend to collect in the upper portions of suspensions of corpuscles. They vary in resistance to hypotonic solutions. They have metabolic pathways that are lacking in mature red cells, including an intact tricarboxylic acid cycle.</p>

                        <h3>Erythron: Proliferation and Maturation</h3>
                        <p>Within the erythron, cellular maturation and proliferation proceed simultaneously. All identifiable erythroid progenitors and morphologically identifiable erythroid precursors are functionally destined to mature; thus they are incapable of self-maintenance. Maintenance of erythron is the function of the stem cell compartment. It takes about 12-15 days for a cell at BFU<sub>E</sub> stage to mature into normoblasts, 6-8 days for BFU<sub>E</sub> to differentiate into CFU<sub>E</sub>, 5-7 days to reach the early normoblast stage. Probably three to five cell divisions occur along the maturation of erythroid precursors. Thus, 8-32 mature RBCs are derived from each pronormoblast cell division stops at intermediate normoblast stage, late normoblasts cannot synthesize DNA and, therefore, cannot divide. BFU<sub>E</sub> is totally interleukin 3 (IL-3) dependent and bears a small numbers of EPO (erythropoietin) receptors. Within 72 hours in culture, these cells become fully dependent on EPO (mature BFU<sub>E</sub>) and in their presence proliferate and differentiate into CFU<sub>E</sub>. At this stage EPO induces an increase in the synthesis of RNA, closely followed by the induction of $\beta$-globin gene transcription. Other biochemical events include increased uptake of calcium and glucose, synthesis of transferrin receptors, increased iron uptake hemoglobin synthesis, and appearance of erythrocyte membrane proteins. Hemoglobin synthesis continues as the cell matures further into the early normoblast stage, and at the intermediate normoblast stage enough hemoglobin has accumulated in the cytoplasm to give the cell the mild acidophilic reaction as detected by routine Romanowsky stains. Hemoglobin synthesis continues throughout the late normoblast stage and persists at a very low rate in the reticulocyte after denucleation. Mature red cells, lacking ribosomes; cannot synthesise hemoglobin.</p>
                        <p>One can observe morphologic evidence of nuclear degeneration as early as normoblast stage, by late normoblast stage nucleus becomes completely inactive, unable to synthesize either DNA or RNA. It is thought that intracellular hemoglobin brings about this cessation of nuclear activity, it gains access to the nucleus through pores in the nuclear membrane. After reaching a critical concentration, the nuclear hemoglobin may react with nucleohistones, thereby bringing about nuclear inactivation and condensation.</p>
                        <p>After the nucleus degenerates, it is extruded from the cell. The process takes about 5-60 minutes. The extruded nucleus carries with it a rim of cytoplasm, including ribosomes, hemoglobin and occasional mitochondria.</p>
                        <p>Enucleation is a process akin to cytokinesis and does not seem to depend upon either the presence of extracellular matrix proteins or accessory cells. It is also thought that the late normoblast cytoplasm and the organelles manage to squeeze through the endothelial cytoplasmic pores but the nucleus being more rigid gets caught and thus gets enucleated while rest of the cell now a reticulocyte passes through. Soon after denucleation, the nucleus is engulfed by a macrophage. This cell may remain in marrow for several days as a reticulocyte. After release the reticulocyte must be sequestered in the spleen for 1-2 days. Here additional maturation may occur, and the composition of the membrane lipids may be altered. As the reticulocyte matures to an adult erythrocyte, it loses its ability to synthesis hemoglobin. Both particulate and soluble RNA fractions are catabolised by a ribonuclease. Thus, a mature RBC is formed.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Erythroid Precursors</h3>
                        <p>The least mature, recognisable erythrocyte precursor cell is known as pronormoblast or proerythroblast. The various stages of maturation in order of increasing maturity, are known as pronormoblast, early normoblast or basophilic normoblast, intermediate normoblast or orthochromatic normoblast. Ordinary Romanowsky dyes can differentiate each cell stage with light microscopy.</p>
                        <p>Cytoplasmic maturation can be assessed by the change in staining characteristics, as the deep blue color from the high RNA content of immature cells gives way to the red color characteristic of hemoglobin. Nuclear maturation is evaluated by disappearance of nucleoli and the condensation of chromatin as nuclear activity ceases.</p>
                        <p>The cytoplasm shows ribosomes which remain free in the cytoplasm as polyribosomes; these consist of eight individual ribosomes joined together by a strand of messenger RNA. Ribosomal RNA accounts for the deep blue staining that is characteristic to younger cells (pronormoblast to intermediate normoblast). Mitochondria are most numerous in earlier stages of maturation. Ferritin containing vesicles are found in the cytoplasm, these are thought to arise by pinocytosis, whereby macromolecular substances are brought into the cytoplasm. Other cytoplasmic structures include Golgi apparatus and randomly oriented occasional microtubules (Fig. 2.6).</p>

                        </ul>

                        <h3>Late Normoblast (Orthochromatic Normoblast or Erythroblast)</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>8-12 $\mu$m in diameter, cytoplasm is more or less fully hemoglobinized (color same as mature cells)</li>
                            <li>Nucleus undergoes pyknotic degeneration, chromatin becomes greatly condensed and the nucleus shrinks.</li>
                            <li>Nucleus may become a homogeneous mass and may assume bizarre forms. Finally the nucleus is extruded.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Reticulocyte</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>When the nucleus is extruded from a late normoblast it is called a reticulocyte.</li>
                            <li>Reticulocytes are little larger (20%) than mature RBCs. They contain certain cytoplasmic organelles, such as ribosomes, mitochondria, and the Golgi complex, and have special staining characteristics. Methanol, etc. cause a uniform precipitation of the ribosomal RNA. Such cells may appear uniformly blue or gray, or various shades of basophilia may be intermingled with pink-staining portions (polychromatophilia or polychromasia).</li>
                            <li>Supravital stains (new methylene blue or brilliant cresyl blue) cause the ribosomal RNA to precipitate or aggregate into a network of strands or clumps that, unfortunately, have been called "reticulum". This led to them being labelled as reticulocytes. Both terms are misnomers because true endoplasmic reticulum does not exist in reticulocytes. This so-called "reticulum" decreases as the cells mature. Concentration of stain and its pH can have variable effects on the appearance of recticulocytes.</li>
                            <li>At its latest stage it becomes the typical bilaterally indented disc shape of the mature RBC.</li>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>In broad outlines, this control system operates in the following manner. Alterations in the concentrations of hemoglobin in the blood lead to changes in tissue oxygen tension within the kidney. In response to hypoxia, it secretes a hormone called erythropoietin. This hormone induces primitive marrow cells to differentiate into pronormoblasts, thereby bringing about expansion of the erythroid marrow and an increase in red cell production. This, in turn, leads to an increase in size of the erythron and an increase in tissue oxygen levels (Fig. 2.7).</p>

                        <h3>Erythropoietin</h3>
                        <p>(Erythropoiesis stimulating factor, ESF) Molecular weight = 34000. It is a glycoprotein containing sialic acid, hexosamine, and hexoses. In man, kidney is the major source of erythropoietin production, but liver and some other organs also contribute.</p>
                        <p>Specialized cells producing EPO (erythropoietin) have been identified in renal and hepatic parenchyma. These rare EPO producing cells are found in the interstitium of the renal parenchyma, outside the tubular basement membrane, mostly in the inner cortex and outer medulla. They contain EPO mRNA. In liver mRNA is detected in hepatocytes. The number of interstitial renal EPO-producing cells increases in response to anemia, indicating that increased demands for EPO are met by an increase in the number of EPOproducing cells rather than by an increased synthesis of EPO by a preset number of cells. Thus, it appears that EPO is synthesized de novo in response to hypoxia and there is no detectable storage of the hormone. Increased levels of circulating EPO do not seem to exert a negative effect on EPO production.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Action of EPO</h4>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Increasing the number of stem cells committed to erythropoiesis.
                                <ul>
                                    <li>RBC precursors have EPO receptors. They are detected on BFU<sub>E</sub> and their density increases as the BFU<sub>E</sub> matures to CFU<sub>E</sub>. Erythroid cells at a stage between CFU<sub>E</sub> and pronormoblast seem to have the highest density of EPO receptors, which decrease in number as the pronormoblast matures and eventually disappear at the late normoblast stage.</li>
                                    <li>Following binding of EPO to its receptor, the hormone is rapidly endocytosed and degraded. The proportion of erythroid cells in the marrow increases and, in the chronic state, there is anatomical expansion of erythroid tissue down the long bones and sometimes in extramedullary sites. In infants, the marrow cavity may expand into cortical bone and bone deformities may result, e.g. frontal bossing and protrusion of maxilla.</li>

                        <p>As the demand for new cells is great, the marrow requires large amounts of hemoglobin. The following groups of substances are needed:</p>

                        <p>Neutrophilic, eosinophilic, and basophilic granulocytes are thought to follow similar patterns of proliferation, differentiation, maturation, and storage in the bone marrow and delivery to the blood. The details of these processes are best documented for neutrophils. In the first three morphologic stages, the myeloblast, promyelocyte, and myelocyte cells are capable of replication. Later stages cannot divide but continue to differentiate classifying a cell (precursor) in one category or another is difficult because it is actually a transition between the two.</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>An immature cell, typically found in bone marrow not in the blood. Its stem cell is CFU<sub>GEMM</sub>. CFU<sub>GM</sub> can divide to form promyelocytes which can give rise to myelocytes.</li>
                            <li>Has a large nucleus, round or slightly oval and has the least amount of cytoplasm.</li>
                            <li>The nuclear membrane is smooth and even in outline and is exceedingly thin with no condensation of chromatin near its inner surface (as seen in lymphoblasts). The chromatin shows an even, diffuse distribution with no aggregation into larger masses, although some condensation may be seen about the nucleoli. The chromatin may appear in the form of fine strands, thus giving the nucleus a fine sieve-like appearance; alternatively, it may have the form of fine dust-like granules, producing a uniform stippled effect.</li>
                            <li>Generally the myeloblast nucleus contains two to five pale, sky-blue nucleoli.</li>
                            <li>The cytoplasm is basophilic (blue), and usually, although not invariably, no perinuclear halo/hoff is seen. Sometimes the cytoplasm is reticular, spongy, or foamy. By definition no granules are present in the cytoplasm.</li>
                            <li>Leukemic myeloblasts that contain no perceptible granules often are identified by special stains that demonstrate the presence of myeloperoxidase or esterase, thus providing early evidence of differentiation.</li>
                            <li>Electron microscopy (EM) reveals similar findings. The nuclear membrane is thin and indistinct with minimal or no chromatin condensation. The numerous particles or ribonucleoprotein in the cytoplasm produce deep blue basophilia in stained preparations. Mitochondria are abundant but small and the endoplasmic reticulum is flat and appears infrequently. The Golgi apparatus is indistinct, and no cytoplasmic granules are present. EM studies of myeloblast show peroxidase activity in the rough endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi.</li>
                            <li>If granules are seen, the cells should be classified as promyelocytes.</li>
                            <li>In wet films myeloblasts appear immobile, also fail to move in supravital preparations but in hanging-drop preparations, myeloblasts show a characteristic snail-like movement.</li>
                            <li>Their size varies considerably 10-20 $\mu$m in diameter because they are in the process of growth and division.</li>
                            <li>In patients with acute leukemia, the nucleus may show several wide and deep indentations, suggesting lobulation (Reider cells). Such myeloblasts suggest more rapid maturation on the part of the nucleus than of the cytoplasm (asynchronism of DiGuglielmo). Also in association with leukemia, Auer bodies/rods are evident in the cytoplasm of cells that otherwise look like myeloblasts. Asynchrony of nuclear and cytoplasmic differentiation (Reider cells) can be seen in monocytes, lymphocytes, myeloblasts, leukoblasts, and reticuloendothelial monocytoid cells.</li>

                        <h4>Differentiation from Other Blasts</h4>
                        <p>With the usual Romanowsky stains and light microscopy, distinguishing among leukoblasts (myeloblasts, lymphoblasts, monoblasts) and even pronormoblasts is extremely difficult if cells are showing beginning maturational changes (granulation or hemoglobinization) are excluded from the blast category.</p>
                        <p>In lymphoblasts, the nuclear membrane is more dense than that of the myeloblast and the chromatin is more coarse and may show some aggregation. Lymphoblasts generally have one or two nucleoli and their membrane is usually distinct. The mitochondria are short and plumper than those of myeloblasts and often assume a position close to the nucleus. The monoblast is described as showing characteristics similar to those of a mature monocyte, such as a fine chromatin, pale nucleus, and ground-glass cytoplasm with a fine, irregular border. In most of the cases, the identification of blasts is greatly aided by the company they keep (the more easily recognisable cells around them in sections or smears). With the myeloblast, the demonstration of associated promyelocytes, which show azure granulation on Romanowsky stains is presumptive evidence for the cell's identification. Special stains to detect enzymes such as peroxidase or esterase, in the blast cytoplasm before lysosomal granules appear may at times be useful in identification, especially in the classification of leukemia (Table 2.1).</p>
                        
                        <h3>Promyelocytes (Neutrophilic) (Fig. 2.10B)</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>EM studies demonstrate that the azurophilic or primary granules first appear at the promyelocyte stage and can be identified on fine structural study as characteristic of the neutrophil, eosinophil, or basophil series. They do not transform into specific granules, but persist throughout the remainder of the maturation sequence and are seen in all subsequent stages, including polymorphonuclear forms.</li>
                            <li>Neutrophilic promyelocyte is little larger on average than the myeloblast.</li>
                            <li>It has a round or oval nucleus in which the nuclear chromatin is diffusely distributed, as in the myeloblast; in later stages, slight condensation is found around the nuclear membrane.</li>

                            <li>Compared to the myeloblast, on EM, the endoplasmic reticulum is more prominent and takes on a dilated, vesicular appearance. The azurophilic primary granules appear and accumulate in increasing numbers during this stage, but the specific or secondary granules are not yet seen. Light microscopy may not reveal the few granules present in early promyelocytes.</li>
                            <li>Locomotion of promyelocyte is seen slightly only at the last stage, even then, the streaming of granules so characteristic of neutrophils is lacking. The cytoplasm is supposed to be in gel form and therefore cannot change shape, consequently is unable to leave the bone marrow. In hanging drop preparations, however, promyelocytes are actively mobile.</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Myelocyte is the stage when specific (secondary) granules appear in the cytoplasm and cell can be assigned to a lineage (neutrophilic) when stained and observed to have a pinkish ground-glass background color with the light microscope (LM).</li>
                            <li>The nucleus of the neutrophilic myelocyte is usually eccentric and round or oval. One side may appear flattened.</li>
                            <li>The nuclear chromatin is somewhat coarse, and the nucleoli are small and often not visible, although they are seen clearly on EM.</li>
                            <li>Primary granules persist in myelocyte although their formation is limited to the promyelocyte, and each succeeding cell division leads to reduction in their number in the daughter population.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>The secondary granules are smaller than the primary granules. The amount of granular endoplasmic reticulum is lower in the myelocyte than in earlier forms, so the cytoplasmic basophilia decreases and disappears. The mitochondria remain small and are few.</p>

                        <h4>Neutrophil Granule Formation</h4>
                        <p>The primary granules are packed and released from the inner concave surface of the Golgi apparatus, in contrast to the specific or secondary granules of the myelocyte and later granulocyte stages that appear to be formed and released from the outer, convex surface. The ratio of secondary to primary granules in a mature neutrophil is 2-3:1.</p>
                        <p>The mature primary granules usually contain central crystalloid and apparently bind neutral red dye and are seen easily as neutral red bodies in supravital preparation. These membrane bound lysosomes contain enzymes and other substances.</p>
                        <p>Acid phosphatase activity is variable. Peroxidase has been associated with primary granules and is considered the marker enzyme for primary granules. Sulfated mucosubstance presumably accounts for the azurophilic staining of the primary granules. A significant amount of neutrophilic lysozyme is found within the primary granule.</p>
                        <p>Alkaline phosphatase is present in secondary granules in the secondary vesicle. Lysozyme is present in human neutrophil secondary granules also; about two-thirds of this antibacterial basic protein is in the secondary granule. The standard marker enzymes for specific granules are lactoferrin and B<sub>12</sub>-binding protein.</p>
                        <p>A third type of granule, the tertiary granule, also known as the gelatinase granule, is synthesized mainly during the band and segmented neutrophil stages.</p>

                            <li>It is characterized by a clearly indented or a horseshoe-shaped nucleus without nucleoli.</li>
                            <li>The nuclear chromatin is moderately dense, with considerable clumping evident along the nuclear membrane.</li>
                            <li>The cytoplasm is filled with primary, secondary and tertiary granules, but the secondary granules predominate.</li>
                            <li>The endoplasmic reticulum is sparse, as are polysomes, thus signifying the virtual completion of protein synthesis.</li>

                            <li>In differentiating metamyelocytes from myelocytes, nuclear shape is less important, the observer should pay particular attention to evidence in nucleus and cytoplasm that protein synthesis has decreased or stopped. This determination is made on the basis of the fact that the nuclear chromatin is coarse and clumped and that the cytoplasm is faint pink and is essentially the color of the mature cell in stained preparations. These features are also helpful in differentiating metamyelocytes from monocytes because in monocytes, nuclear chromatin remains fine and evidence of protein synthesis persists. Directional amoeboid movement can be shown even in coverglass slide preparations, at the metamyelocyte stage.</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>This is characterized by further condensation of nuclear chromatin and transformation of nuclear shapes into sausage or band forms that have more or less uniform diameters throughout their length. Subsequently one or more constrictions begin to develop and progress until the nucleus is divided into two or more lobes, connected by filamentous strands of heterochromatin, the polymorphonuclear stage.</li>
                            <li>A clear and easily recognisable separation between nuclear lobes is needed to count nuclear lobes for diagnostic purposes, as in the early detection of folic acid deficiency or in assessing marrow release of young forms into the blood. For such purposes, the clear separation of nuclear lobes is taken as the criterion for inclusion in the polymorphonuclear category. Cells without this complete formation of distinct lobes (usually connected by a filamentous strand) are classified as band forms.</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>The nucleus in Romanowsky stained preparations is a deep, purplish color and contains course, condensed chromatin.</li>
                            <li>The lobes are joined by thin filaments of chromatin, although filaments may not be visible if lobes are partially superimposed.</li>
                            <li>The cytoplasm is faint pink and contains fine, specific granules that sometimes give a ground-glass appearance.</li>
                            <li>The azurophilic or primary granules have usually lost their dark-staining characteristics by this stage, but can be seen with EM. With EM, the granules exhibit considerable variation in density, presumably a reflection of variation in enzyme content. Large masses of glycogen become evident for the first time in mature neutrophils; this finding may contribute to their capacity for anaerobic metabolism.</li>
                            <li>Why nuclear lobulation? Perhaps because of loss of nucleolar emptying and has no function or perhaps it enhances cell deformability and movement through vessel walls and into sites of inflammation.</li>
                            <li>Nuclear lobulation continues as the cell ages.</li>
                            <li>In wet films marked ameboid activity of polymorphonuclear neutrophils at physiologic temperatures is characteristic. In supravitally stained films, the (specific) granules appear yellowish, pink and are refractile; in addition occasional larger, nonrefractile, deep red vacuoles may be seen.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Senile polymorphonuclear leukocytes are no longer motile and fail to take up the neutral red stain. They are seen in small numbers in the blood, where their survival time is short.</p>

                        <h3>EOSINOPHILS (Fig. 2.10G)</h3>
                        <p>Eosinophils exhibit the same type of maturation process as neutrophils, with the exception that only one type of granule is recognized. These homogeneous granules appear to be formed throughout all the subsequent stages of maturation. Their contents are first seen as flocculent material in Golgi saccules, then in small vacuoles that condense to form the large homogeneous, dense granules. Later, crystalloids develop and the granules acquire an angular shape; the angular configuration predominates in the mature eosinophils, and the lobes are larger than those seen in neutrophils. It is unusual to find more than two lobes in mature eosinophils. Presence of more than two lobes suggests cell activation, as occurs in parasitic diseases. Eosinophilic granules are considerably larger than neutrophilic granules, appear somewhat refractile under light microscope, and stain a brilliant yellowish red with Romanowsky stains.</p>
                        <p>Human eosinophilic granules contain eosinophil peroxidase, a heme protein that is distinct from neutrophil myeloperoxidase; they contain several cationic proteins, including eosinophilic cationic protein (ECP), and eosinophil major basic protein (MBP). MBP constitutes a major proportion of total granule protein and damages several parasites such as schistosomes, Trichinella spiralis larvae, and trypanosomes as well as many type of mammalian cells, including respiratory epithelium. The granules also contain eosinophil derived neurotoxin (EDN). Of the mature granulocytes, eosinophils display the most intense staining with peroxidase.</p>

                        <p>Basophils play an important role in allergic reactions. They express a unique surface antigen profile and contain a variety of vasoactive and immunomodulatory chemicals that are released on activation.</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Basophils are distinguished by their large, coarse, purplish black granules that usually fill the cytoplasm and often obscure the nucleus.</li>
                            <li>The granules are water-soluble and thus may be dissolved in the process of staining and washing; the cells may appear vacuolated with only a few or no basophilic granules remaining.</li>
                            <li>The primary basophil granules are peroxidase positive and contain large amounts of heparin and histamine (sulfated acid mucosubstance), features that are probably responsible for the affinity of granules for basic dyes. These granules also contain the slow-reactive substance of anaphylaxis, kallikrein, an eosinophil chemotactic factor and a platelet activating factor. Charcot-Leyden crystals are also seen with both phase and EM, major basic protein (MBP) is found both in eosinophils and basophils. A second smaller, peroxidase negative-granule has also been identified.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Mast cells:</strong> Similar to basophils but somewhat larger cells found in the tissues are mast cells. They do not circulate in blood however, and probably mature locally in the tissues from mitotically active precursors. Although these cells resemble basophils in their metachromasia, acid nature, and content of heparin and histamine, they contain hydrolytic enzymes, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and serotonin, which basophils do not.</p>

                        <p>On stimulation by appropriate antigen, lymphocytes transform into immunologically competent cells. They are usually large. The increase in size is due to an increase in DNA in nucleus and of RNA in the cytoplasm, nuclei may be indented with an intermediate chromatin pattern. Some lymphocytes may show blast-like nuclei with nucleoli. Varying degrees of basophilia may be seen. There may be distinctive reddish granules. The cytoplasm may be bubbly and may show vacuoles. The most strking such lymphocytes are seen in infectious mononucleosis but reactive (or stress) lymphocytes may be seen in virus-related diseases and conditions such as post-transfusion reactions, organ transplants, and serum sickness (Fig. 2.11E).</p>

                        <h3>Plasmocytes</h3>
                        <p>Plasmocytes and lymphocytes are closely related. Progenitor of both, live in lymphoid organs. Both the types of cells have morphologic features and immunologic functions that are distinct from those of nonlymphoid cells. They are essential in body defence against bacteria, viruses, and other microorganisms.</p>
                        <p>Plasma cells are not seen in peripheral blood but constitute about 1% of nucleated bone marrow cells. In viral infections they may be found in peripheral blood too. Size ranges from 15 to 25 $\mu$m. May be round or oval with slightly irregular margins. The cytoplasm is nongranular and usually stains a deep or vibrant blue which has been described as "cornflower" or "larkspur" blue. They show a perinuclear halo/hoff where the Golgi apparatus is housed, fibrillar structures and vacuoles may also be seen in the cytoplasm. The nucleus is relatively small, round or oval and eccentrically placed. Nuclear chromatin is clumped in a way that it gives a "clockface" pattern. After stimulation by antigen some B cell lineage lymphocytes may be transformed into plasmacytoid cells and secrete and manufacture immunoglobulins. The immunoglobulins produced by plasma cells produce unusual morphologic variants. The proteinaceous material is in the form of round globules that my be red ("Russell bodies"), pink, blue or colorless. The globules may fill the cytoplasm giving it the appearance of bunch of grapes.</p>
                        <p>In some cells the red color has a diffuse distribution producing so-called flame cells. This red color is due to abundant IgA within the plasma cells.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Plasmablasts and Proplasmocytes (Fig. 2.11F to H)</h3>
                        <p>The plasmablasts are similar to other blasts of other series. The nuclei are large in relation to cytoplasm, appear round with linear chromatin strands and have a nucleolus. The cytoplasm is dark blue and nongranular. The blasts are identified by the presence of proplasmocytes and plasma cells around them.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h3>MACROPHAGES</h3>
                        <p>As monocytes grow, they become too large to pass readily through capillaries. Monocytes then migrate into tissues and mature into activated macrophages in many organs (e.g. alveolar macrophages, splenic macrophages, Kupffer's cells). Macrophages do not normally re-enter the bloodstream.</p>
                        <p>The monocyte-macrophage system plays a key role in host defense. Phagocytes entrap and kill pathogenic microorganisms, ingest and degrade noxious external agents, engulf and process antigens, and pass on processed antigenic substances to cells of the lymphocytic plasma cell system responsible for synthesis of antibodies and for cell-mediated immunity. Phagocytic cells remove from circulating blood hemoglobin-containing red cells, injured and dead cells, hemosiderin granules, white and red cell fragments, insoluble particles, activated clotting factors, and antigen-antibody complexes. Motile macrophages, escaping between epithelial cells of respiratory tracts and gastrointestinal and genitourinary organs, perform a scavenger function by clearing the body of unneeded debris. When activated, some macrophages are able to kill some types of tumor cells in culture. Macrophages also serve as secretory cells by releasing IL-1, a soluble factor that induces T cell proliferation, and by elaborating prostaglandins, which are mediators of inflammation.</p>
                        <p>There is no large reserve pool of monocytes in marrow. They constitute about 2% of nucleated marrow cells. Monocytes leave the marrow when mature and enter the bloodstream where they circulate for about 14 hours before entering tissues.</p>

                        <h3>Control of Leukopoiesis</h3>
                        <p>Not very well understood perhaps by a feedback mechanism.</p>

                        <h3>LYMPHOKINES AND MONOKINES</h3>
                        <p>These are glycoproteins, which are released by lymphocytes and monocytes (macrophages), have wide ranging effects on hemopoiesis, the immune response, response to infection and to invasion by tumors. They have a complex network of interactions and are briefly desribed below (Table 2.2).</p>

                        <h4>Interleukin-1 (IL-1)</h4>
                        <p>IL-1 is produced by activated macrophages, and also by endothelial cells, astrocytes, fibroblasts and T cells, in two forms, alpha and beta, in the ratio of 1:10. Both $\alpha$ and $\beta$ IL-1 are biologically active, with widespread activities in the recruitment of cells involved in the inflammatory response, in wound healing, in the immune response and in stages of hemopoiesis. IL-1 acts as an endogenous pyrogen; activates lymphocytes, neutrophils, other macrophages and natural killer cells; induces proliferation of osteoclasts, fibroblasts, epithelial, endothelial and synovial cells and enhances MHC class II antigen expression. Prostaglandin and collagenase synthesis is increased. An important role in hemopoiesis is stimulation of marrow stromal cells to secrete CSFs. CSFs ultimately induce hemopoiesis.</p>

                        <h4>Interleukin-2 (IL-2)</h4>
                        <p>This promotes the proliferation of T lymphocytes and, to a lesser extent, B cells and monocytes, it promotes cytotoxic function by stimulating the proliferation and activity of natural killer (NK) cells. The IL-2 receptor consists of two proteins.</p>

                        <h4>Interleukin-4 (IL-4)</h4>
                        <p>IL-4 has wide variety of effects in hemopoiesis and in the development of both B and T cells. It is needed for developing B cells to switch expression of immunoglobulin class.</p>

                        <h4>Interleukin-6</h4>
                        <p>This has a wide variety of effects on hemopoiesis, the immune system and as an acute phase protein. It is also necessary for platelet production.</p>

                        <h4>Interleukins 7 and 9-13</h4>
                        <p>These are more recently discovered cytokines, have roles in hemopoiesis and immune system development and function.</p>

                        <h4>Interferons</h4>
                        <p>These are produced in response to viral infections. They inhibit viral replication in other cells by inducing new cellular RNA and protein synthesis. Interleukins activate lymphocytes to produce interferon.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Lymphocytes</h3>
                        <p>Lymphocytes assist the phagocytes in the defence of the body against infection and other foreign invasion and add specificity to the attack. They are produced in the bone marrow from pluripotent stem cells and fall into two main groups with different functions, T cells and B cells indistinguishable by routine Romanowsky stains. T cells are processed initially in the thymus; B cells are so-called because in birds they differentiate in an organ known as bursa of Fabricius.</p>

                        <h4>T Cells</h4>
                        <p>Mature T cells, which constitute 65-70% of the circulating lymphocyte population, carry a marker (antigen CD2) which binds sheep erythrocytes. Other surface markers may be defined by indirect immunofluorescence or by immunoperoxidase-linked specific antibodies, some of which define subpopulations of T cells, T cells are subdivided into two major subsets which are detected by monoclonal antibodies to CD8 and CD4 surface membrane antigens. CD8+ cells, the major subpopulation of T cells in the marrow, include suppressor/cytotoxic cells, while CD4+ (helper) cells predominate in the peripheral blood.</p>
                        <p>T cells also contain a number of lysosomal acid hydrolases, such as $\beta$-glucosidase, and acid phosphatase, which may be detected cytologically as discrete masses in the Golgi zone in the cytoplasm.</p>

                        <h4>B Cells</h4>
                        <p>They comprise 5-15% of the circulating lymphocyte population. Mature B cells are defined by the presence of endogenously produced immunoglobulin molecules inserted into the surface membrane where they act as receptors for specific antigens. The immunoglobulins (Ig) may be one of the five classes; IgM, IgD, IgG (divided into four subtypes), IgE or IgA (divided into two subtypes). Each immunoglobulin molecule consists of light chains (k or $\lambda$) and heavy chains ($\mu, \delta, \gamma, \varepsilon, \alpha$, respectively) which determine the class of immunoglobulin. Both heavy and light chains contain constant and variable regions.</p>

                        <h4>Natural Killer (NK) Cells</h4>
                        <p>There is a minor population of lymphocyte cells which do not carry markers of either T or B cells and which are known as 'non- T , non- B' cells or third population cells. The majority of 'null cells' appear as large granular lymphocytes in the peripheral blood. This population of cells contains the majority of natural killer (NK) cells, which can kill target cells. They can kill tumor cells and virus infected cells. They are also involved in graft rejection. Small number of circulating 'null' cells are immature T or B cells and myeloid or erythroid progenitor cells. NK cells probably include cells of mainly T cells (CD8+) and myeloid lineage cells. Their proliferation is stimulated by interleukin-2 and interferon.</p>

                        <h3>Lymphocyte Proliferation and Differentiation (Fig. 2.13)</h3>
                        <p>T and B cells proliferate and develop in reactive lymphoid tissue, for instance, lymph nodes, and lymphoid tissues of alimentary and respiratory tract and spleen. Both T and B cells acquire receptors for antigens, which commit them to a single antigenic specificity and are activated when they bind their specific antigen in the presence of accessory cells.</p>
                        <p>The stimulated T and B cells proliferate and differentiate under the stimulus of factors released from antigen-presenting cells (IL-1, IL-6 and IL-7) and activated T-helper cells (IL-2, IL-4 and IL-9). The T-helper lymphocytes also secrete cytokines, especially IL-2 and IL-4 which cause B cells to multiply, to produce antibodies and to stop replication. Clones of both effector and memory B cells are produced. When the memory cells are stimulated at a later date by their specific antigen, they are able to proliferate again in an accelerated fashion (secondary response).</p>

                        </figure>
                        <p>Activated T cells become responsible for cell-mediated immunity and secrete a number of lymphokines including interleukins 2,3 and 5, interferons $\alpha$ and $\gamma$, migration inhibition factor, lymphotoxins and tumour necrosis factor. Other lymphokines activate killer T cells, enabling them to attack an invading organism or cell, induce macrophages to stay at the site of infection and help to digest the cells they have phagocytosed. They may also have a direct action on organisms by inhibiting proliferation or activating apoptosis (programmed cell destruction).</p>
                        <p>T helper cells are important in initiation of a B cell response to antigens: T suppressor cells reduce the B lymphocytic response, and T cytotoxic cells are capable of directly damaging cells recognized as foreign or virus infected.</p>
                        <p>Activated B cells are responsible for humoral immunity. Many B cell blasts mature into plasma cells which produce and secrete antibodies of one specificity and immunoglobulin class.</p>

                        <h3>Lymphocyte Circulation</h3>
                        <p>Lymphocytes from the primary lymphoid organs of the marrow and thymus migrate via the blood through postcapillary venules into the substance of lymph nodes, into unencapsulated lymphoid collections of the body and into the spleen. T cells home to the paracortical areas of these nodes and to the periarteriolar sheaths of the spleen. B cells accumulate selectively in germinal follicles of lymphoid tissue, in the subcapsular periphery of the cortex and in the medullary cords of the lymph nodes. Lymphocytes return to the peripheral blood by the efferent lymphatic system and the thoracic duct. The median duration of complete circulation is about 10 hours. The majority of circulating cells are T cells. B cells are mainly sessile and spend long periods in lymphoid tissue and spleen. Many lymphocytes have long lifespan and may survive as memory cells for several years.</p>
