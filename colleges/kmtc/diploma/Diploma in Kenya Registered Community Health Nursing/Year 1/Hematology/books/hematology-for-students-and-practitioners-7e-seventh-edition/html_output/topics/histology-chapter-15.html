                        <p>Myeloproliferative disorders are a group of conditions characterized by endogenous proliferation of one or more hemopoietic components in the bone marrow and in many cases by myeloid metaplasia (extramedullary hemopoiesis) in liver and spleen. These disorders are closely related, transitional forms occur and, in many patients, an evolution from one entity into another occurs during the course of illness) (Fig. 15.1). Polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia and myelosclerosis are collectively known as nonleukemic myeloproliferative disorders and are discussed here: The myeloid leukemias are discussed elsewhere.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Erythraemia, Vaquez-Osler disease, and polycythemia rubra vera are synonyms for polycythemia vera, which is a chronic, progressive, and ultimately fatal disease, in which the fundamental abnormality is an excess production of the formed elements of the blood by a hyperplastic bone marrow. The marrow hyperplasia is not secondary to any recognized bone marrow stimulus, and studies using isoenzymes for glucose-6phosphate dehydrogenase indicate that the affected cells are members of a clone that has arisen from a single progenitor. Progenitors of red cells in polycythemia vera are unusually responsive to erythopoietin and there is an apparent appropriate reduction in the plasma concentration of erythropoietin in response to the elevated PCV. Polycythemia vera may be regarded as a relatively benign type of neoplasm of hemopoietic tissue, in which the dominant clinical manifestations are due to the abnormal increase in red cell precursor activity. The occasional occurrence of cytogenetic abnormalities in bone marrow cells, particularly trisomy 9, emphasizes its neoplastic nature. Similar features exist in myelofibrosis and essential thrombocythemia, emphasizing the relationship between these disorders. Polycythemia vera is classified as one of the myeloproliferative disorders and commonly evolves into myelofibrosis.</p>
                        <h3>PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</h3>
                        <p>The basic abnormality is hyperplasia of the precursors of the red cells, granulocytes, and platelets in the bone marrow, with resultant excess production of these cells. The overproduction of red cells results in an increase in the total red cell volume, sometimes to twice its normal value, or even more. This results in an increase in the number of red cells per litre of blood, and thus evaluated PCV, and in an absolute increase in the total blood volume of the body. The increased blood volume is due predominantly to the increase in total red cell volume, the plasma volume generally being within the normal range, although it is sometimes increased. The increased blood volume is accommodated mainly by capillary dilatation; at postmortem all the organs of the body are engorged with blood.</p>
                        <p>Excessive production of red cells is responsible for most of the symptoms of polycythemia vera, and, together with the excess number of platelets, for the vascular insufficiency which causes much of the morbidity and mortality. The increased blood volume causes a diversity of symptoms, the most prominent being cerebral. The increase in PCV, and the associated increase in viscosity of the blood, tends to slow the rate of blood flow, and predisposes to the thrombosis that so commonly occurs. Increased platelet adhesiveness may also contribute.</p>
                        <p>A hemorrhagic tendency also occurs. The cause is incompletely understood, but it is probable that several factors contribute, namely vascular engorgement and defects of platelet function similar to those of essential thrombocythemia.</p>
                        <h3>CLINICAL PRESENTATION</h3>
                        <p>Polycythemia vera is basically a disease of middle and old age, the majority of cases occurring between 40 and 80 years, with onset most frequently at about 60 years. It occurs occasionally in younger adults, and rare cases in the second decade have been described. Males are affected a little more commonly than females.</p>
                        <p>The clinical picture (Table 15.1) is influenced by the severity and rate of progress of the disorder, and by the number and type of complications. Symptoms are caused mainly by the increased blood volume and by the thrombotic and hemorrhagic complications. The increased blood volume causes engorgement and slowing of the circulation in many organs; therefore, symptoms may be referred to a number of systems.</p>

                        <p>The onset is usually insidious, often with vague symptoms referred to one or more of the systems mentioned below. The most common presentation is with cerebral symptoms. Occasionally, an acute thrombotic or hemorrhagic complication causing a medical or surgical emergency is the presenting manifestation. When asymptomatic, the disorder is sometimes accidentally discovered on routine physical examination.</p>
                        <h4>Central Nervous System</h4>
                        <p>Cerebral symptoms occur in most patients, and are the most common presenting manifestation. Headache, fullness in the head, and dizziness are the usual complaints, but visual symptoms, tinnitus, syncope, loss of memory, inability to concentrate, and irritability also occur. Headache may be mild or severe, frequent or occasional, and varies in location from frontal to occipital. It may be worse on awakening in the morning or on lying down. Depression and other psychiatric disturbances occur occasionally.</p>
                        <p>Cerebrovascular accidents vary from mild attacks causing transient weakness of a limb, loss of consciousness or dysphasia, to the classical picture of a major cerebral thrombosis or hemorrhage. They are a common cause of death.</p>
                        <p>Weakness, lassitude, fatigue, and weight loss are common symptoms.</p>
                        <h4>Cardiovascular System</h4>
                        <p>Cardiac symptoms are frequent, dyspnea being the most common. Because of the age group in which polycythemia occurs, degenerative arterial disease and essential hypertension are frequent associations, and probably contribute largely to the cardiovascular manifestations. Hypertension is present in about 50% of cases, but because it is corrected in only a few cases after adequate therapy, it is probably due to essential hypertension, the increased blood volume making relatively little contribution. In the normotensive patient, the heart is usually of normal size. Angina of effort, coronary insufficiency, and cardiac failure are important and common complications.</p>
                        <h4>Peripheral Vascular Disorders</h4>
                        <p>Peripheral vascular disorders of varying types are frequent. The result from slowing of the circulation, thrombosis, and associated atherosclerosis. Erythromelalgia, arterial thrombosis, thromboangitis obliterans, superficial and deep venous thrombosis, and Raynaud's phenomenon may occur. Pain in the extremies, including intermittent claudication, may be prominent symptom. Arterial occlusion may result in gangrene.</p>
                        <h4>Gastrointestinal Symptoms</h4>
                        <p>Especially dyspepsia and flatulence, occur frequently. Symptoms are due mainly to the vascular engorgement of the alimentary tract, but about 10% of cases have a radiologically or endoscopically demonstrable peptic ulcer, usually duodenal. Abdominal pain may result from peptic ulceration, splenic enlargement, or infarction, or occasionally from mesenteric thrombosis. Hemorrhage from the congested mucosa of the stomach and bowel, or from a peptic ulcer, is not uncommon. Occasionally, the patient actually presents with anemia resulting from occult gastrointestinal bleeding. Mild weight loss is common.</p>
                        <h4>Visual Disturbances</h4>
                        <p>Visual disturbances are common; they result from engorgement of retinal veins and sometimes from thrombosis or hemorrhage. Scotomata, spots before the eyes, and transient dimness of vision are most common, but temporary blindness or diplopia may occur.</p>
                        <h4>Thrombosis and Hemorrhage</h4>
                        <p>Particularly thrombosis, are important causes of both morbidity and mortality. Thrombotic manifestations include cerebral and coronary thrombosis, mesenteric thrombosis, thrombosis of peripheral arteries, and pulmonary thrombosis. Postoperative thrombosis is common. More than 75% of patients with uncontrolled polycythemia develop bleeding or thrombotic complications following major surgery, and elective procedures should never be undertaken prior to control of the polycythemia. Thrombosis and hemorrhage occur more frequently in patients over the age of 70 years.</p>
                        <h4>Gout</h4>
                        <p>It occurs in about 10% of cases, and elevated plasma urate in more than 50% the gout may be temporarily exacerbated by treatment. The first attack of gout may precede the diagnosis of polycythemia vera by some years. Uric acid nephropathy with diffuse deposition of uric acid crystals through the kidney may occur, and in some cases there is calculcus formation. Bone pain also occurs occasionally.</p>
                        <h4>Generalized Pruritus</h4>
                        <p>Often worse on the palms and soles, and aggravated by hot baths, occurs in about half the cases; it is an important symptom in diagnosis, especially in differential diagnosis from secondary polycythemia in which it rarely, if ever, occurs. The pruritus is considered to be due to liberation of histamine from the basophil granulocytes. Paresthesiae with numbness and tingling may also occur.</p>
                        <h3>GENERAL PHYSICAL EXAMINATION AND X-RAY</h3>
                        <p>On examination, the outstanding features are the red color of the skin and mucous membranes, congestion of the conjunctival vessels, and engorgement of the retinal veins. Splenomegaly is present at the time of diagnosis in some 70% of cases.</p>
                        <h4>Skin and Mucous Membranes</h4>
                        <p>The red color of the skin and mucous membranes is a striking feature in most, but not all, patients. The skin in florid cases is typically a brick-red color, often with a dusky cyanotic hue which is more marked in cold weather. The high color results from the marked engorgement and distension of the superficial capillaries. Easily recognized telangietasia on the cheeks is common. The nail beds and palms of the hands are useful sites for assessment of the degree of plethora. The skin is warm, and the superficial veins are often distended. The mucous membranes of the mouth and tongue are often a deep red color.</p>
                        <h4>Conjunctival Vessels</h4>
                        <p>The conjunctival vessels are usually injected. Excess lacrimation may occur, but pain or soreness of the eyes is rare. It is not uncommon for the patient to present complaining of bloodshot eyes, or to give a history of having been treated for conjunctivitis. Ophthalmoscopic examination reveals a deeply colored retina with engorged, tortuous veins. Retinal thrombosis and hemorrhage are sometimes seen.</p>
                        <h4>Splenomegaly</h4>
                        <p>Splenomegaly is present in 70% of cases initially, and may subsequently develop in others. It is usually only of mild to moderate degree, although it is occasionally marked. The spleen is smooth and firm, and relatively rapid enlargement suggests the development of myelofibrosis or leukemia. Infarction of the spleen may cause perisplenitis with pain and sometimes a friction rub. Hepatomegaly, either slight or moderate, is often present.</p>
                        <h4>Chest X-ray</h4>
                        <p>The chest X-ray may show prominent pulmonary vessels. The large number of visible end on vessels may produce mottling, particularly in the lower and mid-zones of the lungs, well out to the periphery. Previous pulmonary infarction may have resolved completely, or may have left areas of plate atelectasis or linear scars.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h3>Peripheral Blood Picture</h3>
                        <p>Blood obtained by venepuncture is dark, thick, viscous, and clots readily. The increased viscosity may make the spreading of satisfactory films difficult.</p>
                        <h4>Red Cell Count</h4>
                        <p>The red cell count is raised, usual values being 8-10 x 10¹²/L, and with counts up to 12 x 10¹²/L occurring occasionally. The hemoglobin level is usually in the range of 18-24 g/dL, although it may be higher. The MCH is often slightly reduced, and thus the relative increase in hemoglobin level may be little less than the degree of increase in red cell count. The PCV is raised, usually 0.60-0.70, and sometimes higher. The MCV is usually in the lower normal range, but may be reduced, especially when there has been gastrointestinal bleeding.</p>
                        <p>In the film of an uncomplicated cases, the red cells usually appear normal. There is sometimes slight anisocytosis and microcytosis. A few round polychromatic macrocytes and an occasional nucleated red cell may be seen. Reticulocytes are 1.5% or above in half the cases. In patients who have had repeated venesections or spontaneous bleeding, features of iron deficiency may be prominent.</p>
                        <h4>Leukocytosis</h4>
                        <p>Leukocytosis is present in nearly half the cases at presentation, the white count usually being from 12 to 20 x 10⁹/L, though occasionally counts up to 50 x 10⁹/L occur. There is usually a shift to the left with metamyelocytes and stab forms, and often occasional myelocytes.</p>
                        <h4>Neutrophil Alkaline Phosphatase</h4>
                        <p>The neutrophil alkaline phosphatase is increased in more than 70% of cases, but correlates poorly with the white cell count.</p>
                        <h4>Platelet Count</h4>
                        <p>The platelet count is above 400 x 10⁹/L in nearly two-thirds of cases, most frequently ranging from 400-800 x 10⁹/L, but occasionally reaching several 1000 x 10⁹/L. Macrothrombocytes may be seen. The blood clotting times is not prolonged, but the clot is bulky and may be fragile. The bleeding time is usually normal, but is occasionally prolonged.</p>
                        <h4>Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate</h4>
                        <p>The erythrocyte sedimentation rate is very often low, usually being not more than 1 mm/hour.</p>
                        <h4>Biochemical Parameters</h4>
                        <p>The serum bilirubin value is commonly at the upper limit of normal, but is sometimes slightly raised. Plasma iron and ferritin levels may be decreased, and are especially so after venesection. The serum level of vitamin B₁₂, unsaturated B₁₂-binding capacity, and lysozyme are commonly elevated. reduction in serum folate levels may occur occasionally, a reflection of mild deficiency secondary to erythroid hyperplasia. Blood histamine values are often raised, and the activity of the enzyme histidine decarboxylase, which is responsible for histamine synthesis, is increased in leukocyte-rich blood fractions.</p>
                        <p>The plasma protein levels, including the fibrinogen concentration, are usually normal. The serum uric acid is raised in over half the cases. The serum lactic dehydrogenase activity is usually normal, as is the serum haptoglobin level.</p>
                        <p>When the disorder evolves into myelofibrosis, the peripheral blood picture of that condition develops. The hemoglobin level progressively falls, moderate to marked anisocytosis and poikilocytosis appear, and the number of myelocytes and normoblasts increases, together with the degree of polychromasia. There may be an elevated total white cell count, with a shift to the left, but at times the white counts fall and leucopenia develops. The platelet count sometimes remains high, but often falls to normal, or less than normal, as the disease evolves.</p>
                        <h3>Bone Marrow Examination (Fig. 15.2)</h3>
                        <p>Hyperplastic bone marrow is evident on trephine biopsy. There is replacement of fat cells in the usual sites of hemopoiesis, giving the marrow a darker red appearance than normal, and an extension of the red marrow down the shafts of the long bones which normally contain yellow marrow. Trephine specimens commonly show some increase in reticulin.</p>
                        <p>Aspirated marrow usually contains numerous fragments, which low-power examination shows to be densely cellular and to contain either no fat or much less fat than normal. The cell trails are usually hypercellular. Erythropoiesis is normoblastic, and numerous clumps of developing normoblasts are prominent. Granulopoiesis is active, and since it shares in the hyperplasia, the myeloid:, erythroid ratio is usually within normal limits, although it is sometimes reduced. Megakaryocytes are increased in number, and because of their size, are a prominent features of the marrow. They often occur in clumps of 2-5 or even more, and are most obvious in the region of marrow fragments and at the margins of the film. Many megakaryocytes have platelets masses attached. Sometimes, aspiration of particles is difficult or impossible, and this is not uncommonly related to more extensive development of reticulin, or extreme hypercellularity of the marrow.</p>
