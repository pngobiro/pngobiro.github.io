                        <h3>NATURALLY OCCURRING ANTIBODIES</h3>
                        <p>Under normal circumstances, the newborn has no ABO antibodies. However, after 10-20 weeks later, moderate amount of antibodies are present which appear without any specific antigenic stimulus. So, these are called naturally occurring antibodies. Anti-A and anti-B are important examples of this class. They are IgM immunoglobulins; they react optimally at room temperature, they are also called cold antibodies. They are complete antibodies in serological behaviors, because these antibodies readily agglutinate the red cells carrying the corresponding antigen in saline.</p>
                        <p>Immune antibodies are produced in response to immunization either by transfusion or pregnancy. They are usually IgG antibodies; they react best at body temperature 37°C, and are called warm antibodies. Rh antibody (anti-D) is important immune antibody. They are often called incomplete antibodies, as they do not cause agglutination of red cells with corresponding antigen in saline. These antibodies cause only sensitization or coating of the red cells.</p>
                        <p>In 1900, Karl Landsteiner discovered the blood groups ABO and classified blood into A, B and O groups. A fourth blood group 'AB' was discovered by Landsteiner's associates, von Decastello and Struli in 1902.</p>
                        <p>The four blood groups are determined by the presence or absence of blood group antigens (agglutinogens) on red blood cells and accordingly an individual's group is A, B, AB or O (O denotes absence of A or B antigens). In addition, it has been shown that corresponding to antigen A and B, there are naturally occurring antibodies anti-A and anti-B (agglutinins) in the plasma/serum of individuals whose red cells lack the corresponding antigen. Group A individuals have anti-B, group B individuals have anti-A, group O individuals have both anti-A and anti-B and group AB individuals have no agglutinins in plasma/serum (Table 25.1).</p>

                        <h3>GENETICS OF ABO SYSTEM</h3>
                        <p>ABO system follows Mendelian law of inheritance. The locus for ABO grouping is a chromosome 9 which is occupied by one of three major allelic genes namely A, B and O. Each individual has a pair of chromosomes (one from each parent). The A and B genes are dominant, while O gene is recessive, thus, not detected directly and accordingly absence of A and B antigens on red cells indicates 'O' blood group (Fig. 25.1).</p>

                        </figure>
                        <h3>BIOCHEMISTRY</h3>
                        <p>The expression of A and B genes appears to be dependent on another gene called H gene. H gene is inherited, independent of A, B and O genes. H gene is expressed both as homozygous (HH) and heterozygous (Hh). When no H gene is inherited, a (hh) phenotype results which is extremely rare. This is commonly called Bombay group. Bombay group individuals are homozygous for hh gene.</p>
                        <p>As shown in Fig. 25.2 there is a basic precursor substance which is converted to H substance by an enzyme L. Fucosyl transferase (a product of H gene).</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_09_20_6dc34e0338b37aad296bg-736-2.jpg" alt="A diagram illustrating the biochemical pathway for the production of A, B, and H blood group antigens from a precursor substance." class="content-image">

                        </figure>
                        <p>H substance is next acted upon by A and/or B gene specified transferase enzyme and is converted to A and/ or B antigens. The 'O' gene is an amorph (no gene product) and thus, group 'O' cells enter only H substance.</p>
                        <p>The persons with genetic configuration of 'hh' cannot act on the precursor substance and the precursor substance remains unaltered. Since no H substance is produced, the ABO genes remain inactive and there is no conversion to A, B or H antigen (These are the persons called Bombay group).</p>

                        <h3>SUBGROUPS OF A AND AB</h3>
                        <p>Anti-A serum very seldom differentiates between A₁ and A₂. For this reason we use human anti-A₁ and lectin anti-A which agglutinate A₁ and A₁B cells but not A₂ and A₂B cells. About 20% of persons with A antigen in A or AB group are A₂ or A₂B.</p>
                        <p>It is not necessary to classify group A patient or donors as A₁ or A₂ except when the individual serum contains anti-A₁. Anti-A₁ occurs in the serum of 1-8% of A₂ group persons and 22-35% of A₂B group persons.</p>
                        <p>Anti-A₁ causes discrepancies between ABO cell and serum groupings and may cause crossmatch incompatibilities, but it is considered clinically significant if it reacts at 37°C.</p>
                        <p>Subgroups weaker than A₂ occur infrequently. They are characterized by declining number of 'A' antigens on red cells and reciprocal increase in H reactivity. Weaker variants of A are A₃, Ax, Am and A intermediate.</p>
                        <h3>Subgroups of B</h3>
                        <p>Subgroups of B are clinically not significant, but they can be Bx and Bm type.</p>
                        <h3>Antibodies of ABO System</h3>
                        <p>The antibodies in ABO are usually naturally occurring and are mostly IgM. However, IgG classes are also present. IgG anti-A and IgG anti-B are found more commonly in group O individuals.</p>
                        <p>Anti-A and anti-B are usually not produced in infants up to age of 3-6 months. However, they reach a maximum titer by 5-10 years and then gradually become weaker as the individual ages. The antibodies found in the serum of infants at birth are almost of maternal origin. The serum grouping of a newborn is, therefore, not recommended.</p>
                        <h3>Anti-H</h3>
                        <p>Anti-H very rarely occurs as cold reactive agglutinin in individuals with very low levels of H antigens on their cells and have little clinical significance. However, anti- H found in Bombay blood group (Oh) is an all antibody and is clinically significant. It occurs as a hemolysin and agglutinates cells at 37°C.</p>
