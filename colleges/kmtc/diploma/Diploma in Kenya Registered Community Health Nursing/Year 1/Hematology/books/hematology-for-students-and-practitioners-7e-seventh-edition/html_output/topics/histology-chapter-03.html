                    <h2 id="section-heading-2" class="section-heading">Structure</h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>It is one of the most highly specialized cells, consisting of a plasma membrane surrounding a solution of proteins and electrolytes. More than 95% of cytoplasmic protein is the oxygen-transport protein, hemoglobin.</p>
                        <p>It lacks cytoplasmic organelles like nucleus, mitochondria, or ribosomes. It can neither synthesize new protein nor carry out oxidative reactions associated with mitochondria or undergo mitosis.</p>
                        <p>Nevertheless, the red cell subserves a number of complex and crucial functions in the human body.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Shape</h3>
                        <p>The mature human red blood cell is shaped like a flattened, bilaterally indented sphere, often referred to as a "biconcave disk". On fixed, stained blood smears, it appears circular, with an area of central pallor corresponding to the indented regions, on fixed smears.</p>
                        <p>The RBC has a diameter of about 7-8 $\mu$m. The disk shape is well suited to RBC function. The surface to volume ratio approaches the maximum value in such a shape:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Facilitates gas transfer</li>
                            <li>Biconcave disk is more deformable and can undergo the changes in shape necessary for optimal movement within the microvasculature.</li>
                            <li>The plane of the biconcave disk has been found to be oriented in the direction of blood flow. The leading edge becomes pointed and the following edge blunted. In this way, the RBC can negotiate a vessel of about 4 mm diameter.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4>How does the RBC produce and maintain the resting biconcave shape?</h4>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Elastic forces within the membrane</li>
                            <li>Surface tension</li>
                            <li>Electrical forces on membrane surface</li>
                            <li>Osmotic and hydrostatic pressures.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>The indented region can easily change its location. The RBC is remarkable for its ability to maintain membrane integrity while exhibiting extreme deformability under normal physiologic circumstances. The elasticity of membrane and low viscosity of RBC cytoplasm, permit its movement through very narrow channels within the human body.</p>
                        <p>Osmotic swelling occurs when the RBC is suspended in hypotonic solutions. First, it becomes cup-shaped and eventually becomes spherical. The cell volume increases but surface area more or less remains the same.</p>
                        <p>Discocyte to echinocyte (spiculated RBC) transformation takes place when:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Intracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is depleted</li>
                            <li>Intracellular calcium is increased</li>
                            <li>Cell is exposed to stored plasma, high pH, anionic detergents, lysolecithin or fatty acids</li>
                            <li>The cell is placed between a glass (not plastic) slide and coverslip.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Discocyte-stomatocyte transformation occurs when red cells are exposed to low pH, cationic detergents, or phenothiazines.</p>
                        <p>These cells on fixed smears show a mouth-like "stoma" instead of central pallor, therefore, these cells are called stomatocytes.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Dimensions</h3>
                        <p>Diameter: 7.2 $\mu$m (6.9-7.4)<br>
                        Greatest thickness: 2.4 $\mu$m (2.0-2.5)<br>

                        <h4>Outer Layer</h4>
                        <p>Hydrophilic layer made of glycoprotein molecules which carry the mucopolysaccharide blood group antigens and absorbed protein.</p>
                        <h4>Middle Layer</h4>
                        <p>It is a hydrophobic phospholipid bilayer stabilized by cholesterol.</p>
                        <h4>Inner Layer</h4>
                        <p>It is a hydrophilic layer containing protein molecules extending toward the cell interior.</p>
                        <p>The red cell surface bears a negative charge.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>RBC membrane represents a semipermeable lipid bilayer supported by a protein mesh-like cytoskeleton structure. The fluid lipid matrix contains equal amounts of cholesterol and phospholipids with a mosaic of protein interspersed throughout at various intervals.</li>

The "peripheral" proteins are limited to the cytoplasmic surface of the membrane, which is beneath the lipid bilayer and forms the RBC cytoskeleton.</li>
                            <li>The protein and lipid layers are organized asymmetrically.</li>
                            <li>Chemically, the membrane approximately constitutes 40% lipids, 50% proteins, and 10% carbohydrates.</li>

                        <h4>Red Cell Membrane Lipids</h4>
                        <h5>Phospholipids</h5>
                        <p>The RBC membrane lipid consists of a bilayer of phospholipids interspersed with molecules of unesterified cholesterol and glycolipids. Two groups of phospholipids are known to possess a distinct asymmetry within the bilayer matrix of the RBC: Choline phospholipids and amino phospholipids.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Choline phospholipids, consisting of phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin, are primarily located on the outer half of the lipid bilayer readily accessible to the external environment. There is an energy dependent fatty acid exchange between plasma fatty acids and the RBC membrane. Therefore changes in body lipid transport and metabolism may cause abnormalities in the plasma phospholipid concentration, thereby, resulting in a decreased RBC survival in circulation.</li>
                            <li>Amino phospholipids, in contrast, consisting of phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylserine, are located almost exclusively on the inside half or cytoplasmic side of the RBC membrane along with phasphatidylinositol. This specific orientation of these phospholipids maintains a precise lipid pattern that is critical to normal RBC survival in circulation. Alteration of this arrangement leading to the abnormal appearance of these amino phospholipids on the outer surface of the lipid bilayer promotes activation of the clotting cascade and may result in extravascular hemolysis. Stabilization of this phospholipid asymmetry in the RBC membrane is maintained through the interaction of specific peripheral proteins.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h5>Glycolipids and Cholesterol</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The majority of the glycolipids are located in the outer half of the lipid bilayer and interact with glycoproteins to form many of the RBC antigens.</li>
                            <li>Cholesterol is approximately equally distributed, being located on both sides of the lipid bilayer inserted between the choline and amino phospholipids. Cholesterol comprises 25% of the RBC membrane lipids and is present in a 1:1 molar ratio with phospholipids. RBC cholesterol is in continual exchange with plasma cholesterol and is therefore affected by changes in body lipid transport.</li>
                            <li>Increased cholesterol accumulation in the RBC produces target cells, and may cause RBC membrane damage. Acanthocytes or spiny RBCs are also associated with excess cholesterol accumulation on RBC membrane (as may occur in lipid disorders, such as abetalipoproteinemia). Excess cholesterol makes the cell less deformable and reduces their life span. LCAT deficiency (lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase) leads to excessive free cholesterol in both plasma and RBC membrane, resulting in, among other problems, a chronic hemolytic anemia.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>RBC Membrane Proteins (Fig. 3.2)</h4>
                        <p>It is estimated that 10 major and 200 minor proteins are asymmetrically organized within the RBC membrane. After solubilization of the RBC membrane with the detergent sodium dodecyl sulfite (SDS), membrane proteins can be separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and stained. The separated RBC membrane proteins are numbered 1-8 when stained with Coomassie blue and 1-4 when stained with periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) stain, which is the basis of their nomenclature. The proteins range in molecular weight from 16,000 to 240,000 daltons. Two of the most important constituents include glycophorin an "integral membrane protein and spectrin, a "peripheral" membrane protein.</p>
                        <h5>Integral Membrane Proteins</h5>
                        <p>Glycophorin, the major integral membrane protein, is the principal RBC glycoprotein, representing 10% of the total membrane protein. The molecule contains approximately 60% carbohydrate and accounts for most of the membrane sialic acid, which gives the RBC and its negative charge. Glycophorin spans the entire thickness of the lipid bilayer and appears on the external surface of the RBC membrane, accounting for the location of RBC antigens.</p>

                        <p>The majority of these proteins, as mentioned previously, carry RBC antigens and are receptors (such as glycophorins) or are transport proteins (such as band 3, the anion exchange channel glycoprotein). It is thought that band 3 and glycophorins play a major role in anchoring the RBC membrane cytoskeleton to the lipid bilayer. As a result, lateral motility of these integral proteins within the lipid bilayer is relatively restricted.</p>
                        <h5>Peripheral Proteins</h5>
                        <p>Spectrin, the principal "Peripheral" protein, is a large molecule that represents approximately 75% of the peripheral protein and 25% of the total membrane protein. Spectrin is intimately related to RBC membrane integrity as it binds with other peripheral proteins such as actin (band 5), ankyrin (band 2.1), and band 4.1 to form a "skeleton" of microfilaments on the inner surface of RBC membrane. These microfilaments strengthen the membrane, protecting the cell from being broken by circulatory shear forces, and also control the biconcave shape and deformability of the cell.</p>
                        <p>The normal chemical composition as well as structural arrangement and molecular interactions of the RBC membrane are crucial to the normal red cell survival in circulation of 120 days. In addition, they play a critical role in two important RBC characteristics: Deformability and permeability.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Deformability</h3>
                        <p>Loss of ATP (energy) levels leads to a decrease in the phosphorylation spectrin and in turn, a loss of membrane deformability. An accumulation or increase in deposition of membrane calcium also increases the membrane rigidity and loss of pliability. These cells are at a marked disadvantage when they pass through the small (3-5 $\mu$m diameter) orifices of the spleen, one of whose functions is extravascular sequestration and removal of aged, damaged, or less deformable RBCs or fragments of their membrane. The loss of RBC membrane is exemplified by the formation of spherocytes, cells with a reduced surface-to-volume ratio, and "bite cells" in which the removal of a portion of membrane has left a permanent indentation in the remaining cell membrane. The survival of these forms is also shortened.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Permeability</h3>
                        <p>The RBC membrane is freely permeable to water and anions, chloride (Cl⁻) and bicarbonate (HCO₃⁻) traverse the membrane in less than a second. It is thought that the massive exchange of HCO₃⁻ and Cl⁻ ions occurs through a large numbers of exchange channels formed by the integral protein, band 3, a glycoprotein described earlier. In contrast the RBC membrane is relatively impermeable to cations with a half-time exchange of sodium (Na⁺) and potassium (K⁺) of over 30 hours. It is primarily through the control of the sodium and potassium intracellular levels that the RBC maintains its volume and water homeostasis. The erythrocyte intracellular:extracellular ratios of sodium and potassium are 1:12 and 25:1, respectively. The passive influx of sodium and potassium is controlled by as many as 300 cationic pumps, which actively transport sodium out of the cell and potassium into the cell. These pumps are energy dependent requiring ATP, and membrane enzyme sodium-potassium ATPase. The full activation of the sodium-potassium ATPase pumps requires the presence of RBC membrane aminophospholipid, phosphatidylserine. Similarly, calcium (Ca⁺⁺) is also actively pumped from the interior of the RBC through the energy-dependent calcium ATPase cationic pump. Calmodulin, a cytoplasmic calcium-binding protein, is speculated to control these calcium-ATPase pumps, preventing excessive intracellular calcium buildup, which is harmful to the RBC, resulting in shape changes and loss of deformability. The permeability properties of the RBC membrane, as well as active cation transport, are crucial to preventing colloid osmotic hemolysis and controlling the volume of the red cell. In addition, ATP-depleted cells allow the accumulation of excess intracellular calcium and sodium, followed by potassium and water loss, resulting in dehydrated, rigid cell later sequestered by spleen. The energy required by all those pumps is provided by ATP.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Hemoglobin is a conjugated protein with a molecular weight of approximately 68,000, comprises 95% of the RBC's dry weight, or 33% of the RBC's weight by volume. Approximately 65% of the hemoglobin occurs during the nucleated stages of RBC maturation, and 35% occurs during the reticulocyte stage. Normal hemoglobin consists of globin (a tetramer of two pairs of polypeptide chains) and four heme groups, each of which contains a protoporphyrin ring plus iron (Fe⁺⁺).</p>
                        
                        <h3>Hemoglobin Synthesis</h3>
                        <p>Normal hemoglobin production is dependent on three processes:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Adequate iron delivery and supply</li>
                            <li>Adequate synthesis of protoporphyrins (the precursor of heme)</li>
                            <li>Adequate globin synthesis.</li>
                        </ol>
                        
                        <h4>Iron Delivery and Supply</h4>
                        <p>Iron is delivered to the membrane of the RBC precursor (say a reticulocyte) by the protein carrier transferrin. The majority of the iron that crosses the membrane and enters the cytoplasm of the cell is committed to hemoglobin synthesis and thereby proceeds to mitochondria for insertion into the protoporphyrin ring to form heme. Excess iron in the cytoplasm aggregates as ferritin, the amount of which is dependent on the ratio between the level of plasma iron and the amount of iron required by the erythrocyte for hemoglobin synthesis. Two-thirds of the total body iron supply is bound to heme in the hemoglobin (Fig. 3.3).</p>

                        </figure>

                        <h4>Synthesis of Protoporphyrins</h4>
                        <p>Protoporphyrin synthesis begins in the mitochondria with the formation of delta aminolevulinic acid ($\delta$-ALA) from glycine and succinyl-CoA, which is the major rate limiting step in heme biosynthesis, the mitochondrial enzyme $\delta$-ALA synthetase, which mediates this reaction is influenced by erythropoietin and requires the presence of the cofactor pyridoxal phosphate (vitamin B₆).</p>
                        <p>In the cytoplasm, condensation of two molecules of $\delta$-ALA, catalyzed by $\delta$-ALA dehydrase, produces the pyrrole porphobilinogen (PBG). Because four molecules are involved in the reaction, the formation of four types of isomers is theoretically possible. However, only two types of isomers have occurred physiologically UPG—I and III-and virtually all the UPG is the type III isomer. Coproporphyrinogen (CPG) is next formed via decarboxylation reactions from UPG III. The final steps of heme synthesis are carried out in the mitochondria and involve the formation of protoporphyrinogen (PP) from CPG III. Because PP chemically has three types of side chains, 15 possible isomers of PP can form, compared with four possible UPG and CPG isomers. However, normal mitochondrial physiology leads to the formation of only one of these isomers, PP IX, from CPG III. After further conversion of protoporphyrin IX, the incorporation of iron results in heme (ferroprotoporphyrin IX) formation.</p>
                        <p>Porphyrinogens, not porphyrins, are the intermediates of heme synthesis. Porphyrinogens are unstable tetrapyrroles that are readily and irreversibly oxidized to form porphyrins. In contrast, porphyrins are highly stable resonating molecules that are normally found in small quantities in the urine as a result of normal RBC catabolism.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Globin Synthesis</h4>
                        <p>Globin chain synthesis occurs on RBC-specific cytoplasmic ribosomes, which are initiated from the inheritance of various structural genes. Each gene results in the formation of a specific polypeptide chain. Each somatic cell, including the RBC, contains four alpha ($\alpha$) genes, two beta ($\beta$) genes, two delta ($\delta$) genes, and four gamma ($\gamma$) genes. The alpha genes are located on chromosome 16, and the beta, delta and gamma genes are located on chromosome 11. The resulting products are called alpha, beta, delta and gamma chains. In the fetus, it should be remembered that during the first few weeks of life, a different polypeptide chain, epsilon ($\varepsilon$), is synthesized forming tetramer molecules that are designated "embryonic" hemoglobin ($\varepsilon_4$ or $\alpha_2\varepsilon_2$).</p>
                        <p>All adult normal hemoglobins are formed as tetramers consisting of two alpha chains. plus two (non-alpha) globin chains. Normal adult RBCs contain the following types of hemoglobins:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Ninety two to ninety five percent of the hemoglobin is HbA, consisting of $\alpha_2\beta_2$ chains.</li>
                            <li>Three to five percent of the hemoglobin is HbA1c (glycosylated), which consists of $\alpha_2$($\beta$-NH-glucose)₂ chains</li>
                            <li>Two to three percent of the hemoglobin is HbA₂, consisting of $\alpha_2\delta_2$ chains.</li>
                            <li>One to two percent of the hemoglobin is (fetal) HbF, consisting of $\alpha_2\gamma_2$ chains.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Each synthesized globin chain links with heme (ferroprotoporphyrin IX) to form hemoglobin, which primarily consists of two alpha chains, two beta chains, and four heme groups. Normal alpha chains consist of 141 amino acids, while normal beta chains consist of 146 amino acid residues. The precise order of amino acids is critical to the hemoglobin molecule's structure and function. The substitution of even one amino acid, such as valine, for the normal glutamic acid at the sixth position on the $\beta$ chain, can result in such functional abnormalities as a hemoglobin that tends to polymerize when deoxygenated (sickle hemoglobin, HbS). An adequate amount of $\beta$-chain synthesis is also important since decreased production of one of the polypeptide chains leads to a group of disorders known as thalassemias, the more common forms refer to decrease in $\beta$-chain production and $\alpha$-thalassemia refers to a decrease in $\alpha$-chain production.</p>
                        <p>The rate of globin chain synthesis is directly related to the rate of porphyrin synthesis, and vice versa; protoporphyrin synthesis is reduced when globin synthesis is impaired. There is, however, no such relationship with iron uptake when either globin or protoporphyrin synthesis is impaired; iron accumulates in the RBC cytoplasm as ferritin aggregates. (The iron-ladden nucleated RBC is termed a "sideroblast" and anucleated form a "siderocyte".) (Iron can be stained with Prussian blue stain).</p>

                    <h2 id="section-heading-5" class="section-heading">Hemoglobin Function</h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The primary function of hemoglobin is gas transport (oxygen and carbon dioxide): Delivery and release of oxygen to tissues and facilitation of carbon dioxide excretion. Owing to hemoglobin's multichain structure, the molecule is capable of a considerable amount of allosteric movement as it loads and unloads oxygen. One of the most important controls of hemoglobin affinity for oxygen is the RBC organic phosphate 2, 3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG). The unloading of oxygen by hemoglobin is accompanied by the widening of the space between beta chains and the binding of 2,3-DPG, on a mole-for-mole basis, with the formation of anionic salt ridges between the beta chains. The resulting confirmation of the deoxyhemoglobin molecule is know as the tense ("T") form, which has a lower affinity for oxygen. When hemoglobin loads oxygen and becomes oxyhemoglobin, the established salt bridges are broken and beta chains are pulled together, expelling, the 2, 3-DPG. This is the relaxed ("R") form of hemoglobin molecule and has a higher affinity for oxygen (Fig. 3.4).</p>

                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_09_20_6dc34e0338b37aad296bg-056-1.jpg" alt="A diagram comparing the structures of oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin, showing the conformational changes that occur upon oxygen binding." class="content-image">

                        </figure>
                        <p>These allosteric changes that occur as the hemoglobin loads and unloads oxygen are referred to as the "respiratory movement". The dissociation and the binding of oxygen by hemoglobin are not directly proportional to the PO₂ of its environment but instead exhibit a sigmoid-curve relationship, the hemoglobin-oxygen dissociation curve is depicted in Fig. 3.5.</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_09_20_6dc34e0338b37aad296bg-056-2.jpg" alt="A graph showing the normal sigmoid-shaped hemoglobin-oxygen dissociation curve, plotting percent saturation against partial pressure of oxygen." class="content-image">

                        </figure>
                        <p>The shape of this curve is very important physiologically, as it permits a considerable amount of oxygen to be delivered to the tissues with a small drop in oxygen tension. For example, in the environment of lungs, where the partial pressure of oxygen (oxygen tension), measured in millimeters of mercury (Hg), is nearly 100 mm Hg, the hemoglobin molecule is almost 100% saturated with oxygen (point A, as given in Fig. 3.5). As the RBC travels to tissues where the partial pressure of oxygen drops to an average 40 mm Hg (mean venous oxygen tension), the hemoglobin saturation drops to approximately 75% saturation, releasing about 25% of oxygen to tissues (point B).</p>
                        <p>In situations such as hypoxia, a compensatory "shift to the right" of hemoglobin-oxygen dissociation curve occurs to alleviate a tissue oxygen deficit (Fig. 3.6).</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_09_20_6dc34e0338b37aad296bg-057-1.jpg" alt="A graph illustrating a right-shifted hemoglobin-oxygen dissociation curve, indicating decreased oxygen affinity and enhanced oxygen delivery to tissues." class="content-image">
                            <figcaption>Fig. 3.6: Right-shifted hemoglobin-oxygen dissociation curve</figcaption>
                        </figure>
                        <p>This rightward shift of the curve, mediated by increased levels of 2,3-DPG, results in a decrease in hemoglobin's affinity for the oxygen molecule and an increase in oxygen delivery to tissues. Note that the oxygen saturation of hemoglobin in the environment of the tissues [40 mm Hg PO₂ (see point in the Fig. 3.6)] is now only 50%; the other 50% of the oxygen is being released to the tissues. The RBCs thus have become more efficient in terms of oxygen delivery.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, a patient who is suffering from anemia due to loss of RBCs may be able to compensate by shifting the oxygen dissociation curve to the right, making the RBCs, while few in number, more efficient. Some patients may be able to tolerate anemia better than others because of this compensatory mechanism. A shift to the right may also occur in response to acidosis or a rise in body temperature. This shift to the right of the hemoglobin-oxygen dissociation curve is only one way in which patients may compensate for various types of hypoxia. Other ways include an increase in total cardiac output and increase in erythropoiesis.</p>
                        <p>A "shift to the left" of the hemoglobin-oxygen dissociation curve results, conversely, in an increase in hemoglobin-oxygen affinity and decrease in oxygen delivery to tissues (Fig. 3.7).</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_09_20_6dc34e0338b37aad296bg-057-2.jpg" alt="A graph showing a left-shifted hemoglobin-oxygen dissociation curve, representing increased oxygen affinity and reduced oxygen delivery." class="content-image">

                        </figure>
                        <p>With such a dissociation curve RBCs are much less efficient since only 12% of oxygen can be released to the tissue (point B). Among conditions that can shift the oxygen dissociation curve to the left are alkalosis; increased quantities of abnormal hemoglobins, such as methemoglobin and carboxyhemoglobin; increased quantities of HbF; or multiple transfusions of 2, 3-DPG-depleted stored blood.</p>

                        <p>Fortunately enough, RBCs metabolic pathways are anerobic, since its function is to deliver oxygen and not to consume it. Four pathways of RBC metabolism will be considered: The anaerobic glycolytic pathway and three ancillary pathways that serve to maintain the function of hemoglobin. All of these processes are essential if the RBC is to transport oxygen and maintain the physical characteristics required for its survival in circulation (Table 3.1).</p>
                        <p>Ninty percent of the ATP needed by RBCs are generated by the Embden-Meyerhof glycolytic pathway, the RBCs main metabolic pathway. Here the metabolism of glucose results in the net generation of two molecules of ATP. Although this ATP synthesis is inefficient when compared with cells that use the Krebs' cycle (aerobic mechanism), it provides sufficient ATP for the RBC's requirements. Glycolysis also generates NADH from NAD⁺, important in some of the RBCs other metabolic pathways (Fig. 3.8).</p>
                        <p>Another 5-10% of glucose is metabolized by the hexose monophosphate shunt (also called the phosphogluconate pathway), which produces the pyridine nucleotide NAPH from NADP⁺. NADPH, together with reduced glutathione, provides the main line of defence for the RBC against oxidative injury. Oxidative drugs as well as infections, can cause accumulation of hydrogen peroxide and other oxidants, which can be toxic to cell proteins (Fig. 3.8).</p>
                        <p>When the hexose monophosphate pathway is functionally deficient, the amount of reduced glutathione becomes insufficient to neutralize intracellular oxidants. This results in globin chain denaturation and precipitation as aggregates (Heinz bodies) within the cell. If this process sufficiently damages the membrane, cell destruction occurs. Inherited defects in the pentose phosphate glutathione pathway, the most common of which is G6PD deficiency, result in the formation of Heinz bodies with subsequent extravascular hemolysis. (It should be remembered that glutathione not only is crucial to keeping hemoglobin in a functional state but also is important in maintaining RBC integrity by reducing sulfhydryl groups of hemoglobin, membrane protein, and enzymes subsequent to oxidation).</p>

                        <p>The methemoglobin reductase pathway is another important component of RBC metabolism. Two methemoglobin reductase systems are important in maintaining heme iron in the reduced (Fe⁺⁺, ferous), functional state. Both pathways are dependent on the regeneration of reduced pyridine nucleotides and are referred to as the NADH and NADPH methemoglobin reductase pathways. In the absence of the enzyme methemoglobin reductase and the reducing action of the pyridine nucleotide NADH, there is an accumulation of methemoglobin resulting from the conversion of the ferrous iron of heme to the ferric form (Fe⁺⁺⁺). Methemoglobin is a nonfunctional form of hemoglobin, having lost its oxygen transport capability as the metheme portion cannot combine with oxygen. Normal efficiency of the methemoglobin reductase pathway is exemplified by the fact that usually no more than 1% of RBC hemoglobin exists as methemoglobin in the RBCs of healthy persons (Fig. 3.8).</p>
                        <p>Another important pathway which is important to RBC function is the Leubering-Rapoport shunt. This pathway causes an extraordinary accumulation of the RBC organic phosphate 2,3 -DPG, important because of its profound effect on hemoglobin's affinity for oxygen and also because its stores can serve as a reserve for additional ATP generation (Fig. 3.8).</p>

                        <p>During its life span RBCs undergo the process of aging just as other cells of the human body. Each day 1% of the old RBCs in circulation are extricated by a system of fixed macrophages in the body known as the reticuloendothelial system (RES). These RBCs are replenished by 1% of the younger RBCs, reticulocytes, from the bone marrow storage pool. As RBCs age, certain glycolytic enzymes decrease in activity, resulting in a decrease in the production of energy and loss of deformability. At a certain point the RBCs are no longer able to traverse the microvasculature and are phagocytosed by the RES cells (Table 3.2).</p>

                        <p>Although RES cells are located in various organs and throughout the body, those of the spleen, called "littoral cells" are the most sensitive detectors of RBC abnormalities. This is mainly due to the typical microvasculature of spleen which reduces the plasma volume and flow of blood, exposing the RBCs to the phagocytic action of RES cells of the spleen for a longer time. 90% of the destruction of aged RBCs occurs by the process of extravascular hemolysis. During this process, old or damaged RBCs are phagocytized by the RES cells and digested by their lysosomes. The hemoglobin molecule is disassembled, being broken down into its various components. The iron recovered is salvaged and returned to plasma protein carrier, transferrin, to the erythroid precursors in the marrow for synthesis of the new hemoglobin. Globin is broken down into amino acids and sent over to the amino acid pool of the body. Finally, the photoporphyrin ring of heme is broken down, exhaling its alpha carbon as carbon monoxide. The opened tetrapyrrole, biliverdin is converted to bilirubin and carried by plasma protein albumin to the liver. In the liver, bilirubin is conjugated to bilirubin glucuronide and excreted along with bile into intestines. By bacterial action, in the intestines, it is converted into urobilinogen (stercobilinogen) and excreted via the stool. A small amount of urobilinogen is reabsorbed through the enterohepatic circulation, filtered by kidneys, and excreted in small amounts in the urine.</p>
                        <p>Five to ten percent of normal RBC destruction occur through the process of intravascular hemolysis. Here, the RBC breakdown occurs in the lumen of the blood vessels. The RBC ruptures, releasing hemoglobin directly into the bloodstream (Fig. 3.9).</p>

                        <p>The hemoglobin molecule dissociates into alpha-beta dimers and is picked up by the protein carrier, "haptoglobin". The haptoglobin-hemoglobin complex prevents renal excretion of the hemoglobin and carries the dimers to the liver cell for further catabolism. The hepatocyte processing and uptake is identical at this point to the process earlier described for extravascular hemolysis. Haptoglobin levels, therefore, fall in plasma as it is removed as the hemoglobin-haptoglobin complex. It is thought that as little as 1-2 mL of RBC intravascular hemolysis can totally deplete the amount of plasma haptoglobin. Normally, 50-200 mg/dL of plasma haptoglobin is available and represents the hemoglobin-dimer binding capacity. As haptoglobin is depleted, unbound hemoglobin dimers appear in plasma (hemoglobinemia) and are filtered through the kidneys and reabsorbed by the renal tubular cells. The renal tubular uptake capacity is approximately 5 g per day of filtered hemoglobin. Beyond this level, free hemoglobin appears in urine (hemoglobinuria) (Fig. 3.10).</p>

                        </figure>
                        <p>Hemoglobinuria is always associated with hemoglobinemia. Normal plasma hemoglobin levels are 2-5 mg/dL, which is exceeded when free hemoglobin is released as a result of excessive intravascular hemolysis. Depending upon the amount of hemolysis and type of hemoglobin, the plasma may be pink, red, or brown. Likewise in hemoglobinuria the urine may also be pink, red, brown or black. Two hemoglobin pigments, oxyhemoglobin and methemoglobin, are produced by auto-oxidation of the hemoglobin in the urinary tract when the urine is acidic. Oxyhemoglobin is bright red, and methemoglobin is dark brown. The color of urine, therefore, depends upon the amount of hemolysis and concentration and relative proportions of these two hemoglobins. Oxyhemoglobin predominates in alkaline urine, and methemoglobin predominates in acidic urine.</p>
                        <p>Hemoglobin, which is neither processed by the kidneys nor bound to haptoglobin, is oxidized to methemoglobin, which is further disassembled as metheme groups are released and globin degraded. Free metheme is quickly bound by another transport protein "hemopexin", and carried to the liver cell to be catabolized as described earlier. The heme binding capacity of hemopexin is approximately 50-100 mg/dL, and when this is exceeded the metheme groups combine with albumin to form methemalbumin. Albumin cannot transfer the metheme across the hepatocytic membrane for further degradation. As a result, the methemalbumin circulates until additional hemopexin is produced by the liver to serve as the protein carrier. It is this circulating methemalbumin that imparts a brown tinge to the plasma or blood. Under normal circumstances, the intravascular hemolysis is so minimal that it is limited to the involvement of only haptoglobin, which is rarely depleted. Other processes, described herein, come into play, only when excessive intravascular hemolysis occurs, which occurs in various types of hemolytic anemias.</p>

                        <h3>Definition</h3>
                        <p>It is defined as a reduction is the concentration of hemoglobin in the peripheral blood below the normal for the age and sex of the patient.</p>
                        <p>Broadly speaking the levels for adult males ia 14 g% and adult females is 12 g%, of late these values have been brought down to 13.2 g% for adult males and 11.7 g% for adult females respectively. The lower limit for both male and female children from three months to puberty is considered to be 10.7 g%, it increases with advancing age until adult levels are reached at age 15-18 years. Reduction of hemoglobin is usually accompanied by a fall in red cell count and packed cell volume but these may be normal in some patients with subnormal hemoglobin levels (and therefore by definition anemic). Alterations in total circulating plasma volume as well as of total circulating hemoglobin mass determine whether or not anemia is present. Reduction in plasma volume (as in dehydration) may mask anemia; conversely, an increase in plasma volume (as with splenomegaly) may cause anemia even with normal circulating red cell and hemoglobin mass.</p>
                        <p>After acute major blood loss, anemia is not immediately apparent since the total blood volme is reduced. It may take up to three days for the plasma volume to be replaced and so for the degree of anemia to become apparent. Regeneration of the hemoglobin mass takes substantially longer. The initial clinical features of major blood loss are, therefore, due to reduction in blood volume rather than to anemia.</p>
                        <p>As per many studies conducted, it is suggested that somewhat lower limits of normal may be used in evaluating the elderly. The lower levels could result from decreased androgen secretion in men or from age related decreases in the stem cell proliferation.</p>
                        <p>Anemia has to be considered vis-a-vis hematocrit and the red cell mass. Given below are conditions associated with a significant disproportion between hematocrit and the red cell mass.</p>

                        <h4>Decrease in Both Plasma Volume and Red Cell Mass (Hematocrit Normal, Red Cell Mass Low)</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Acute blood loss</li>

                        <p>The effects of changes in posture on red cell concentration may lead to confusion. When normal individuals assume a recumbent position, the hematocrit falls an average 7% (range 4-10%) within 1 hour. When they resume the upright position, the hematocrit increases by a similar amount within 15 minutes. These changes have been attributed to alterations in plasma volume as fluid moves between the circulation and the extravascular spaces in the lower limits as a result of hydrostatic forces. In edematous subjects or in people with low plasma protein or albumin concentration, even greater fluid shifts occur.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Pathophysiology</h3>
                        <p>Tissue hypoxia reduction in oxygen carrying capacity leads to tissue hypoxia symptoms. Referable to systems with high oxygen requirements, such as skeletal musculature, cardiovascular system and central nervous system are particularly prominent.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Compensatory Physiological Adjustments</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Increased delivery of oxygen to the tissue by the red cell.</li>
                            <li>An increase in cardiac output and in the rate of circulation of the blood.</li>
                            <li>Maintenance of total blood volume.</li>
                            <li>Redistribution of blood flow.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Oxygen delivery to the tissues consists of three components: (1) the hemoglobin in red cells, (2) respiration, and (3) circulation. Each of the three can compensate to some extent for deficiencies in the other components. For example, the rate of circulation accelerates in patients with anemia. Another is that hemoglobin levels increase in hypoxic conditions. The amount of oxygen delivered to the tissues by a given volume of blood is a function of the concentration of hemoglobin. The degree to which it is saturated with oxygen, the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen, and the tissue oxygen tension. When fully saturated with oxygen, 1 g of hemoglobin binds 1.34 mL of oxygen. At a hemoglobin concentration of 15 g/dL, 100 mL of arterial blood contain about 20 mL of oxygen, whereas the same volume of mixed venous blood contains about 15 mL . The difference results from the extraction of oxygen by the tissues. In anemic patients with a hemoglobin concentration of 7.5 g/dL, only about 10 mL of oxygen can be carried per deciliter of arterial blood. If tissue oxygen consumption is to be maintained in such a patient without adjustments in the circulation, both the percentage saturation of mixed venous blood and the tissue oxygen tension must fall, resulting in an increase in the percentage of arterial oxygen used. It follows, then, that the quantity of blood that must be pumped by the heart to the tissues, per minute, is inversely related to the blood hemoglobin concentration if the other factors do not vary. In fact, however, the hemoglobin-oxygen dissociation curve shifts in chronic anemia. The resulting reduction in the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen facilitates the delivery of the vital gas to the tissues.</p>
                        <p>The binding and release of oxygen by hemoglobin are profoundly affected by the variations in the concentration of phosphates, especially 2, 3-diphosphoglyceric acid (2,3-DPG). The oxygen affinity of hemoglobin falls as the concentration of 2,3-DPG increases, and rises as it decreases. An increase in red cell level of 2, 3-DPG is found in chronic anemia. This increase facilitates the delivery of oxygen to the tissues by reducing the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen at the oxygen tensions found in the capillaries. At alveolar oxygen tensions, the small 2, 3-DPG-induced change in oxygen affinity does not significantely affect the uptake of oxygen by the red cells in the lungs. The net result favors the heart by allowing the tissues to extract oxygen during exercise at a lower cardiac index for an equivalent oxygen consumption and work load than otherwise would be the case. The DPG-induced changes may compensate for up to one-half the expected oxygen deficit in association with anemia.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Cardiovascular Adjustments</h4>
                        <p>The cardiac index generally is increased in patients with anemia, and the arteriovenous oxygen difference is narrowed. The increase in cardiac output is first accomplished by an acceleration in heart rate, rather than by a change in stroke volume. Hence, tachycardia at rest, or with slight exertion, is characteristic of the patient with greater degrees of anemia. Central venous and intracardiac pressures are not altered, although at times the right-atrial pressures may be increased. The total circulating blood volume sometimes, but not always, decreases when the hemoglobin concentration is less than 7 g/dL, the cardiac output is usually increased; when it is less than 5 g/dL, the increase in cardiac index results principally from an increase in stroke volume and, to a lesser extent, in heart rate, especially with exercise. By contrast, in people without anemia, the increase in cardiac output accompanying exercise is caused mainly by tachycardia. In children with severe anemia, the mean cardiac index is approximately the same as in adults with equally severe anemia, however, this state is achieved by greater tachycardia and a lesser increase in stoke volume than in comparably anemic adults. Nevertheless, the capacity of chronically anemic children to tolerate exercise burdens is generally excellent. If congestive heart failure develops, the child usually has some underlying heart disease. Such is not always the case, however, in adults with chronic anemia if the hemoglobin concentration is less than 5 g/dL CHF can develops.</p>
                        <p>The hyperdynamic circulation in anemia results from diminished vascular resistance. As one consequence, renal blood flow is reduced, leading to salt and water retention. The decreased vascular tone probably results from reduced activity of endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF) or nitric oxide. Hemoglobin normally inhibits EDRF; therefore, the lowered hemoglobin values in anemia lead to increased activity. These alterations may be viewed as a mechanism to control blood pressure in the face of cardiac output.</p>
                        <p>Cardiac compensation may be marginal in patients with severe anemia, and congestive heart failure may be precipitated by blood transfusion unless precautions are taken. As the cardiovascular system adapts to anemia, the velocity of blood flow tends to increase, thereby shortening the circulation time; this condition may persist even with the development of congestive heart failure. Mild-to-moderate anemia is accompanied by greater coronary flow per unit of left-ventricular work; ultimately, however, when the hemoglobin concentration is reduced below 50% of normal levels, ventricular function is impaired, presumably because the coronary flow has approached its maximum. In contrast to the reflex vasoconstriction that accompanies acute blood loss, the peripheral vascular resistance in chronic anemia falls, a phenomenon that plays a dominant role in the high-output, hyperkinetic circulatory response. Increasing peripheral resistance, as with methoxamine or orthostatic stress, reduces cardiac output. Changes in peripheral resistance are regional, rather than generalized. Muscle flow is increased, whereas skin flow is reduced. Cerebral blood flow is increased. Renal blood flow is diminished. Usually the systemic and pulmonary artery systolic pressures are unaffected, but the diastolic pressures are lower.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Clinical Features</h3>
                        <p>Patients with anemia usually seek medical advice because of decreased work tolerance, shortness of breath, palpitations, or other signs of cardiorespiratory adjustments to anemia. At times, they feel fine, but their friends or family members may note pallor.</p>
                        <p>The manifestations of anemia depend on five factors:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>The reduction in oxygen carrying capacity of the blood.</li>
                            <li>The degree of change in total blood volume</li>
                            <li>The rate at which the previous two factors developed.</li>
                            <li>The capacity of cardiovascular and pulmonary systems to compensate for the anemia and</li>
                            <li>The associated manifestations of the underlying disease that resulted in the development of anemia or any other associated disease.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>The hemoglobin concentration is not the sole determinant of the observed symptoms, nor of the urgency with which measures must be taken to correct the anemia. Coexistent cardiovascular or pulmonary disease may aggravate the symptoms associated with a degree of anemia that would be well-tolerated under other circumstances.</p>
                        <p>In slow developing anemias, symptoms may not appear till hemoglobin falls to 8 or even 6 g/dL. In children, particularly, restriction of capacity for physical exertion may hardly be apparent, despite the presence of severe anemia. The physiologic adjustments that take place chiefly involve the cardiovascular system and changes in the hemoglobin oxygen dissociation curve.</p>
                        <p>In general, symptoms occur at a higher Hb. level with rapidly developing anemias, e.g. anemia of acute blood loss than in a slowly developing chronic anemia.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Symptoms and Signs</h4>

                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The symptoms of acute hemorrhage are those of hypovolemia rather than of anemia. Depending upon amount of blood lost, the patients may experience no symptoms, mild hypotension or progressively severe degrees of shock.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Cardiorespiratory System</h4>
                        <p>In many patients, respiratory and circulatory symptoms noticeable only after exertion or excitment; however, when anemia in sufficiently severe, dyspnea and awareness of vigorous or rapid heart beat may be noted even at rest. When anemia develops rapidly, shortness of breath, tachycardia, dizziness or faintness (particulary upon arising from a sitting or recumbent posture), and extreme fatigue are prominent. In chronic anemia, only moderate dyspnea or palpitation may occur, but in some patients, congestive heart failure, angina pectoris, or intermittent claudication can be the presenting manifestation. A humming or whirring sound in the head, attributed to the rapid blood flow through cranial arteries, may be bothersome to the patient and signal the point at which significant anemia has developed.</p>
                        <p>With severe prolonged anemia, hyperdynamic cardiac failure may supervene, with salt and water retention, edema, and even ascites. Eventually left ventricular hypertrophy may occur. With correction of the anemia, these abnormalities gradually resolve. The cardiac index falls fastest, usually over a 6-month period. Left ventricular hypertrophy is the last to be corrected, often requiring a year or more.</p>
                        <p>The rate and depth of respiration often increase even though the mechanical properties of the lungs remain normal. The minute ventilation increases, as does the residual air, but the forced expiratory volume decreases. At rest, arterial oxygen tension is reduced in anemic patients, and as a consequence, the alveolor-blood oxygen tension gradient is greater than normal. During strenuous exercise, a marked depression of both oxygen uptake and carbon dioxide production is observed when anemic individuals are compared with normal subjects exercising at comparable levels.</p>
                        <p>The oxygen debt incurred during a standard workload and rate of work is greater in an anemic subject than in the same person after recovery from anemia. In the anemic state, it takes longer to restore the heart rate and respiratory minute volume to pre-exercise values than it does after anemia was relieved. The recovery period for oxygen update is prolonged beyond that of carbon dioxide output, reversing the order noted in healthy individuals after exercise. This difference is accentuated by greater degree of anemia and also by greater physical exertion. In the anemic patient, the greater oxygen cost of exercise (that is the volume of oxygen consumed per unit of useful work performed) can be attributed to the greater work required of the respiratory muscles.</p>
                        <p>The physical signs of chronic anemia may include a bounding pulse and Duroziez sign. Systolic bruits may be heard over the carotid arteries and the cranium, as well as a venous hum, particularly over the internal jugular bulb. Sometimes, by radiation to the chest, the latter may mimic the murmur of a patent ductus arteriosus. These adventitious cardiovascular sounds have been attributed to the greatly increased velocity of blood flow, the reduction in the velocity of the blood, and the turbulence that accompanies these changes.</p>
                        <p>Heart murmurs are a common cardiac sign associated with anemia. They are systolic in time and best heard in the pulmonic area. Often, they are moderate in intensity, and at times may be rough in quality and raise suspicion of organic valvular heart disease. With severe anemia, rather than simply reflecting increased blood flow and turbulence. The murmurs may be a sign of mitral and tricuspid insufficiency resulting from cardiac dilation. Although these murmurs usually are easily distinguishable from those of organic heart disease, in some cases-particularly those involving sickle cell anemia-it may not be possible to do so. Gallop rhythms of both S3 and S4 type may be detected.</p>
                        <p>ECG changes can occur in severe anemia and may disappear as anemia is relieved. The most common changes are depression of the S-T segment, and flat or inverted T waves. Changes in the duration of the electrical systole (Q-T interval) and abnormalities of the electrical conduction may be observed. Atrial fibrillation may be associated with severe anemia and revert to normal sinus rhythm when the anemia is relieved.</p>

                        <h4>Skin</h4>
                        <p>Pallor is usually the first sign of anemia, but many other factors besides hemoglobin concentration affect skin color. These factors include the degree of dilatation of the peripheral vessels, the degree and nature of the pigmentation, and the nature and fluid content of the subcutaneous tissues. Certain people routinely have pale-looking skin. The pale appearance of otherwise healthy people residing in tropical and subtropical climates is not the result of a generally lower hemoglobin concentration. Patients with myxedema may present with pallor without anemia. In simple vasovagal syncope, pallor results from cutaneous vasoconstriction. Jaundice, cyanosis, racial skin pigmentation, and dilation of the peripheral blood vessels may all mask the pallor of anemia.</p>
                        <p>Pallor can be better appreciated in the mucous membranes of the mouth and pharynx, the conjunctivae, the lips, and the nailbeds. In the hands, the skin of the palms first becomes pale, but the creases may retain their usual pink colour until the hemoglobin concentration is less than 7 g/dL. To best appreciate the colour of the hands, they must be normally warm and held at about the level of the heart. A satisfactory judgement cannot be made in the presence of cyanosis or abnormal vasoconstriction.</p>
                        <p>Character of pallor can assist further. A waxy, dead whiteness of the skin suggests acute blood loss, particularly when accompanied by cold and moist palms. A distinctly sallow color implies chronic anemia. A lemon-yellow coloured pallor suggests advanced pernicious anemia. Definite pallor with mild scleral and cutaneous icterus suggests hemolytic anemia. Marked pallor associated with petechiae or ecchymoses may be seen in leukemias.</p>
                        <p>Other changes described with anemia are loss of normal skin elasticity and tone, resulting in a dry shriveled appearance. Thinning, loss of luster, and early greying of hair may occur, the last especially in patients with pernicious anemia. The nails may lose their luster, become brittle and break easily (seen especially in chronic iron deficiency anemia, wherein, nails also become concave instead of convex). Chronic leg ulcers may occur, especially in patients with sickle cell anemia and rarely in those with other hemolytic anemias. Glossitis occurs in association with pernicious anemia. When nutritional deficiency is associated with anemia, symmetric dermatitis may develop, fissures may be present at the angles of the mouth, glossitis may occur, and erythematous lesions on the face, neck, hands or elbows may be found.</p>

                        <h4>Neuromuscular System</h4>
                        <p>Headache, vertigo, tinnitus, faintness, scotomata, lack of mental concentration, drowsiness, restlessness, and muscular weakness are common symptoms of severe anemia. Some of these signs may be a manifestation of cerebral hypoxia. In exceptional cases, headache may be as severe as in meningitis. Paresthesias are common in pernicious anemia and may be associated with other symptoms and signs of peripheral neuropathy, and more especially with combined system disease.</p>

                        <h4>Retinopathy</h4>
                        <p>About 20% of anemic patients have flame-shaped hemorrhages, hard exudates, cotton-wool spots, or venous tortuousness affecting the retina. The anomalies are not proportionate to the severity of anemia and for unknown reasons are seen more frequently in males. The hemorrhages occur even in the absence of thrombocytopenia. Papilledema related solely to anemia has been described, it clears as the anemia is fully treated.</p>

                        <h4>Gastrointestinal System</h4>
                        <p>Symptoms may occur as a consequence of basic disease (as ulcers) or because of anemia itself, irrespective of the cause. Glossitis and atrophy of papillae of the tongue commonly occur in pernicious anemia and much less often in iron deficiency anemia. Painful, ulcerative, and necrotic lesions in the mouth and pharynx occur in aplastic anemia and in acute leukemia, usually reflecting the neutropenia accompanying these conditions. Dysphagia may occur in chronic iron-deficiency anemia.</p>

                        <h4>Genitourinary System</h4>
                        <p>Slight proteinuria may occur in severly anemia. Microscopic hematuria may be seen in patients suffering from sickle cell anemia.</p>

                        <h4>Other Signs</h4>
                        <p>In severe anemia, the basal metabolic rate may be increased. When anemia is severe, fever of mild degree may occur without other cause. With the exception of acute hemolytic episodes, however, a temperature of 38.3°C (101°F) or more should be taken as a reason to search for infection, lymphoma, and other disorders. When an acute hemolytic episode occurs, jaundice may develop without bile in the urine (acholuric jaundice). If the hemolysis takes place within the circulation, patients may manifest hemoglobinemia, methemalbuminemia, and hemoglobinuria, as well as pain in the abdomen or back and fever. These manifestations are related to the sudden release of hemoglobin and to its destruction and disposal.</p>
                        
                        <h3>History and Physical Examination</h3>
                        <p>History taking in an anemic patient is important and consists of relevant guided questions. The duration of the symptoms and their outset, whether insidious or accute, should be established. Knowing the most recent date at which a hematologic examination indicated anemia was absent is usual. If this information is not forthcoming, a history of acceptance or rejection as a volunteer blood donor or the previous prescription of iron, folic acid, or vitamin B₁₂ may help elicit the date of onset of anemia. The family history is important with respect to spells of jaundice, splenectomy, bleeding disorders, and hemoglobin associated abnormalities. The patient's occupation, household customs, and hobbies must be ascertained because certain drugs, solvents and other chemicals may produce hemolytic anemia or aplastic anemia as well as granulocytopenia and thrombocytopenia. Equally important is place where the patient hails from, e.g. kala-azar is geographically distributed as is schistosomiasis and both can lead to anemia. Many other parasites specific to certain geographic locations can produce anemia and other hematologic disorders.</p>
                        <p>The patient should be questioned about early graying of the hair, burning sensations of the tongue, sores about the angles of the mouth, and discomfort and brittleness of the fingernails, which are symptoms of the anemias caused by deficiency of specific substances can be treated successfully.</p>
                        <p>Change in stool habits can provide an important clue to the neoplasms of the colon and rectum underlying the anemia. Patients do not understand the significance of tarry stools and a specific inquiry is essential. The amount of blood lost from hemorrhoids may be overlooked or overestimated. In men occult blood loss is most often from the gastrointestinal tract.</p>
                        <p>In women, in addition to the preceding, necessary information includes an appraisal of the amount of blood lost during menstruation. Data about number of pads or tampons used and the presence or absence of clots should be ascertained. Menstrual flow should be considered excessive if more than 12 pads are used each period, if clots are passed after the first day or if the period duration exceeds 7 days. The number of pregnancies and abortions and the interval since the most recent of these are also important, for each represents significant iron loss. In a child or adolescent, the rate of growth is noteworthy</p>
                        <p>The dietary history is very important, but an accurate history is difficult to obtain. You must know what the patient eats or does not eat. Patient may deliberately deceive the physician because of embarassment over eating habits or financial restrictions. Questions regarding the diet must be specific, meal by meal, in the hope of obtaining quantitative information. A record regarding dietary fads and cooking habits may be valuable, especially with reference to folic acid and vitamin C intake. Changes in weight are also very important.</p>
                        <p>The presence or absence of fever must be known, its presence suggesting infection, lymphoma or other neoplasm or collagen disease. Inquiry regarding cough, pleurisy and hemoptysis is important, because either infection or a lung neoplasm may cause anemia. Pains in the limbs, paresthesias, and difficulty in walking suggest pernicious anemia. Abnormal colour of the urine, suggesting blood or hemoglobin, may signify urinary tract disease or hematologic problems. Bilirubin is not detected in the urine of people with uncomplicated hemolytic anemia, but a darker than normal colour may result from the increased excretion of urobilinogen and its conversion to urobilin.</p>
                        <p>Bruises, ecchymoses, and petechiae are other important points in the history. Their presence indicates that the disorder producing the anemia may also involve platelets or the liver. Alternatively, the anemia itself may be the consequence of blood loss resulting from a disorder of hemostasis.</p>
                        <p>In all instances, the presence or absence of symptoms suggestive of an underlying disease such as chronic renal disease, chronic infection, an endocrinopathy, or malignancy must be explored.</p>
                        <p>The physical examination should include a careful evaluation of the optic fundi and the nervous system. Scleral icterus hints toward hemolytic anemia or ineffective erythropoiesis. Sternal tenderness is a useful and often overlooked sign. In acute leukemia, physical examination often reveals a small, acutely tender area near the middle or lower one-third of the sternum of which the patient may be unaware. A systemic check for palpable lymphadenopathy is necessary, with reference to infection, lymphoma, leukemia, and metastatic carcinoma. Cardiac murmurs may yield the first evidence of subacute bacterial endocarditis, thereby explaining the presence of anemia. Neither the pelvic nor the rectal examination can be neglected, for tumor or infection in these regions may also cause anemia.</p>
                        <p>Even when the colour of the urine does not suggest blood, the routine urinalysis should include a test for occult blood. This simple confirmatory procedure should also be performed when hemoglobinuria is suspected or is apparent. A positive reaction, however, may also be due to hematuria or even myoglobinuria. Hematuria may be differentiated from other conditions by finding RBCs on microscopic examinations. Hematuria may be the result of diseases of the kidneys or urinary tracts themselves, or the consequence of thrombocytopenia or of acquired or congenital abnormalities. The sickle cell trait may be accompanied by innocuous hematuria. Hemoglobinuria implies intravascular hemolysis, usually a serious situation. The examiner must not confuse true hemoglobinuria with the release of hemoglobin from RBCs that lyse in the urine after it has been voided.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Classification</h3>
                        <p>There are two main classifications of anemia:</p>

                        <h5>Increased Red Cell Destruction (Hemolytic Anemia)</h5>
                        <ol type="a">

                        </ol>
                        
                        <h4>Morphological Classification</h4>
                        <p>Based mainly on two features:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The average cell volume (MCV) and</li>
                            <li>The average cell hemoglobin concentration (MCHC).</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h5>Three Main Types of Anemias are Recognized</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The normocytic anemias in which MCV is within normal range (76-96 fL). Most normocytic anemias are also normochromic (i.e. MCHC is between 30 and 35 g%) but in some, mild hypochromia may occur.</li>
                            <li>The hypochromic, microcytic anemias in which the MCV is reduced (< 76 fL) and MCHC is reduced (< 30 g%).</li>
                            <li>The macrocytic anemias in which the MCV is increased (> 96 fL). Most macrocytic anemias are normochromic but in some, a mild hypochromia may occur.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4>Kinetic Classification</h4>
                        <p>The number of erythrocytes present in the circulation at a given time is the result of a dynamic equilibrium between the production and delivery of red cells into the circulation on one hand and their destruction or loss from the circulation on the other. Anemia can be construed to be primarily related to an alteration in production or in destruction/loss, or in both of these factors.</p>
                        <p>The normal homeostatic mechanisms of the body bring about recovery from anemia by accelerating erythropoiesis (e.g. subsequent to acute blood loss or blood donation), this occurs subsequent to release of erythropoietin and its action on the bone marrow. If the system functions normally, the degree of marrow stimulation is inversely proportional to the degree of anemia. At maximum stimulation, the bone marrow is capable of producing erythrocytes at 6-8 times the normal rate. Based on these principle, a classification of anemia and an approach to the diagnosis have been recommended. An estimate of marrow production using the reticulocyte count is the first step in the process.</p>
                        <p>Increased red cell production is reflected by an increase in circulating reticulocytes. A reticulocyte production index (RPI) can be easily calculated from hematologic data. The calculation converts the reticulocyte count, expressed as a percentage, to an index reflecting the production rate, expressed as a multiple of normal. Two corrections are incorporated into the calculation, one for the degree of anemia (or the number of nonreticulocytes in the circulation) and another for early release of reticulocytes from the marrow, a process known as shift. Because these shift reticulocytes are released at an earlier stage of their development, they survive as reticulocytes for a longer time in the circulation.</p>
                        <p>The correction for anemia is made by multiplying the reticulocyte percentage by a ratio of patient's hematocrit (VPRC) to an average normal value. The correction for shift incorporates a value for the reticulocyte maturation time. The reticulocyte production index (RPI), proposed to correct both for shift and for anemia is calculated as per formula given below:</p>
                        <p>RPI = (Reticulocyte percentage / Reticulocyte maturation time (days)) $\times$ (Patients hematocrit (L/L) / 0.45)</p>
                        <p>The maturation time of the reticulocyte in the circulation, a measure of shift, is taken to be 1.0 day when VPRC is 0.45 L/L, 1.5 days at 0.35, 2.0 days at 0.25, and 2.5 days at 0.15. For instance, at a VPRC of 0.25 L/L and a reticulocyte count of 20%.</p>
                        <p>RPI = 20 / 2.0 $\times$ 0.25 / 0.45 = 5.5</p>
                        <p>Indicating that erythrocyte production is increased to 5.5 times the normal rate. The average normal RPI is 1, but in the presence of anemia, an increase is to be expected. If the RPI exceeds 3, production is thought to be increased, and the anemia is therefore the result of hemolytic anemia. At RPIs less than 2, a defect in production is assumed. Production defects are of two kinds. Erythropoiesis may be insufficient with an absence, reduction or suboptimal increase in red cell precursors (hypoproliferative). Alternatively, red cell production may be ineffective, a condition characterised by erythroid hyperplasia, but with the production of essentially nonviable red cells. Within the RPI range of 2-3, the kinetic situation is uncertain.</p>
