                        <p>Spleen can be considered to be a huge lymph node that has a special anatomical and physiological relation to the circulating blood.</p>
                        <h3>Antibody Elaboration</h3>
                        <p>Spleen, like lymph nodes shares this function. Splenectomy is known to reduce resistance to infections in man and experimental animals.</p>
                        <h3>Blood Destruction and Phagocytosis</h3>
                        <p>The aged and effete red blood cells are removed from circulation by phagocytic cells of the reticuloendothelial system. Spleen is an important organ for this. It also removes imperfectly formed, fragmented and damaged cells from the blood-called the culling function. It is probable, too, that spleen plays a part in removal of leukocytes and platelets from the blood at the end of their lifespan. In addition, particulate matter and organisms, bacterial, fungal, and protozoal, are removed from the circulation by phagocytosis in the spleen.</p>
                        <h3>Blood Storage</h3>
                        <p>In man, the amount of blood contained in the normal spleen is about 20-60 mL of red blood cells (much more in other animals). In certain disorders there can be excessive pooling of blood (harmful) in pathologically enlarged spleens. There is evience that reticulocytes are to some extent selectively concentrated in spleen. Spleen contains a pool of platelets and dynamic exchange exists between splenic and circulating platelets: the exchangeable pool in the normal spleen represents approximately 30% of the total circulating mass of platelets. The size of the splenic platelet pool is related to splenic size: an increase in size of this platelet pools is a major factor in hypersplenic thrombocytopenia. Leukocyte storage in spleen is not clearly defined. Lymphocytes constitute half the spleen cell population. Granulocytopenia is common in patients with splenomegaly.</p>
                        <h3>Blood Production</h3>
                        <p>In fetal life spleen provides all the blood cells, however, after birth it produces only lymphocytes and monocytes. In certain pathological conditions the spleen may undergo myeloid metaplasia and revert to its embryonic function of producing all the three cellular elements of blood.</p>
                        <h3>Blood Maturation</h3>
                        <p>The effect of splenectomy on blood suggests that the spleen contributes, at least partially, to the process of maturation of cells once they have been released from the bone marrow.</p>

                        <p>With chronic splenomegaly in certain patients there can be pan/bi/monocytopenia-this is called hypersplenism. Contemporary evidence suggests that in the case of red cells, Pooling or sequestration in the spleen which is often but not invariably associated with excess destruction is the major factor in pathogenesis; expansion of plasma volume may also contribute to anemia. Similarly, an increase in the splenic platelet pool related to the increased size of the spleen is the main cause of thrombocytopenia. Another, yet not confirmed school of thought states, that spleen elaborates a splenic hormone (not yet identified) that inhibits the release of mature cells from the marrow, and sometimes arrests the maturation of developing cells.</p>
                        <h3>ETIOLOGY</h3>
                        <h4>Causes of Hypersplenism</h4>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Primary (idiopathic)</strong></li>
                            <li><strong>Secondary (symptomatic)</strong>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Portal hypertension with congestive splenomegaly (Banti's syndrome)</li>
                                    <li>Malignant lymphomas</li>
                                    <li>Rheumatoid arthritis-Felty's syndrome</li>
                                    <li>Lipoid storage disease-Gaucher's disease</li>
                                    <li>Sarcoidosis</li>
                                    <li>Kala-azar, chronic malarial splenomegaly, tropical splenomegaly</li>
                                    <li>Chronic infections—tuberculosis, brucellosis, bacterial endocarditis, chronic bacteremia</li>
                                    <li>Thalassemia</li>
                                    <li>Chronic lymphatic leukemia, myelosclerosis.</li>
                                    <li>Hairy cell leukemia.</li>
                                </ol>
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                        <h3>DIAGNOSIS</h3>
                        <p>One has to establish that hypersplenism exists and secondly one has to ascertain its cause.</p>
                        <h4>Diagnostic Criteria of Hypersplenism</h4>
                        <p>These are four, viz.,</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>A peripheral blood picture of anemia, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, either singly or in combination.</li>
                            <li>A normally cellular or hypercellular bone marrow</li>
                            <li>Splenomegaly</li>
                            <li>Return of the peripheral blood picture to normal or near normal following splenectomy.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <h3>TREATMENT</h3>
                        <p>Splenectomy produces partial or complete recovery of the abnormal blood picture in otherwise uncomplicated cases. When the effect of the hypersplenism is not sufficient to cause symptoms, splenectomy offers no benefit to the patient. Splenectomy is indicated when significant problems are caused by the sole or the additional effect of hypersplenism in reducing the count of blood cells, usually anemia of sufficient severity to cause symptoms, neutropenia predisposing to infections, or thrombocytopenia causing spontaneous bleeding.</p>

                        <h3>EFFECTS OF SPLENECTOMY</h3>
                        <h4>Hematological Effects</h4>
                        <p>Changes given below refer to those that occur in normal subjects after splenectomy. Consequences of splenectomy for pathological conditions on one or more of the cellular elements may be substantially modified by the effect of the underlying disorder on the production of blood cells by the bone marrow. In autoantibody-mediated hemolysis or thrombocytopenia, for example, the relative increase in the respective cell counts following splenectomy is often significantly increased.</p>
                        <h5>Red Cells</h5>
                        <p>Target cells usually appear in the blood film, and the cells have increased resistance to hemolysis in the osmotic fragility test. Occasional spherocytes may be detected. Small remnants of nuclear material, Howell-Jolly bodies, characteristically are present in red cells, as they are no longer selectively 'pitted' from circulating red cells by the spleen. Other inclusions, such as aggregates of iron-containing material, may also be observed. Changes of this type often persist indefinitely after splenectomy.</p>
                        <h5>White Cells</h5>
                        <p>After splenectomy, there is an increase in the total white cell count within several hours, and it usually reaches a maximum after a day or two. The count then gradually falls over a period of weeks or months in the uncomplicated situation, to normal values. In some cases, a mild increase, e.g. up to 15 x 10⁹/L, persists for many years. The maximum reached by the white cell count is usually about twice normal, although it may be higher. The sharp rise in the count is due mainly to an increase in neutrophils, but after a few weeks to months, the neutrophil count falls to near normal levels, and the count of circulating lymphocytes and monocytes rises, and remains increased, apparently permanently. There may also be a slight increase in eosinophils and basophils. In splenectomized subjects, leucocytosis in response to infection is characterized by a greater than normal shift to the left, with the appearance of myelocytes.</p>
                        <h5>Platelets</h5>
                        <p>The platelet count rises sharply, often within a matter of hours, reaches a peak in 1-2 weeks, and then usually falls to normal values over a period of weeks or months. In about one-third of cases, it remains raised indefinitely. This is especially so in patients with continuing hemolysis, and this group has a reported increased risk of thromboembolism. The maximum platelet count is usually 3-4 times normal, and on occasion reaches 2000-3000 x 10⁹/L.</p>
                        <p>The current view is that changes after splenectomy are a reflection of the capacity of the spleen to sequester cells newly released from the bone marrow. The spleen contributes to the maintenance of normal red cell appearance by its 'pitting' function-the selective removal of particles from the cytoplasm of the red cell without injuring the cell.</p>
                        <h3>SPLENIC ATROPHY</h3>
                        <p>Changes similar to those occurring after splenectomy have been described accompanying congenital absence or acquired atrophy of the spleen. Disorders in which acquired atrophy may occur include sickle cell disease, coeliac disease, dermatitis herpetiformis, and essential thrombocythemia.</p>
                        <h4>CLINICAL EFFECTS</h4>
                        <p>The spleen is not essential for life. In otherwise healthy adults it can be removed without apparent alteration of health or longevity.</p>
                        <h5>Susceptibility to Infection after Splenectomy</h5>
                        <p>Splenectomy does not appear to render normal adults more susceptible to infection. However, there is evidence in infants and young children of an increased incidence of severe, and sometimes fatal, infections after splenectomy. It appears that children under the age of three years are most frequently affected, particularly infants under 1 year. The interval between splenectomy and the onset of infection has been less than 3 years in most reported cases, but may be longer. The Pneumococcus has been the organism most commonly isolated (>50% of cases) but infections with group A Streptococcus, Hemophilus influenzae, enteric bacteria, and other organisms have also been reported. No increase in incidence of viral infections has been noted. Reported infections include septicemia, meningitis, pneumonia, pericarditis, and acute endocarditis. A feature of many infections has been their fulminating character. With septicemia and meningitis, death may occur within 12-24 hours of the onset of symptoms. It has been shown that some cases of severe infection are associated with acute disseminated intravascular coagulation. Although the incidence of infection in children over the age of 3 years does not appear to be much increased, when it does occur, infection may be severe and overwhelming. It is recommended that the young splenectomized patient has close supervision for several years postoperatively, so that immediate several years postoperatively, so that immediate and energetic treatment can be instituted in the event of sudden and severe infectious illness.</p>
                        <p>Investigators have pointed out that the nature of the disorder that led to the splenectomy influences the risk of postoperative infection. Infection is not markedly increased following splenectomy for trauma, hereditary spherocytosis, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, Gaucher's disease, and portal vein thrombosis with congestive splenomegaly, while it is more common in other disorders such as thalassemia major, lymphoma, leukemia, hepatitis with portal hypertension, and diseases requiring treatment with corticosteriods in relatively high doses. Septicemia of an unusually fulminant nature is sometimes encountered in hyposplenism due to sickle cell disease. Prophylactic immunization with pneumococcal vaccine should be considered in individuals at increased risk. However, even when polyvalent vaccines are employed, septicemia may still occur. Long-term prophylaxis with penicillin may therefore be needed in susceptible patients.</p>
