                        <h4>Basis of Serum Biochemical Tests for Leishmaniasis</h4>
                        <p>These tests assess alterations in serum proteins particularly serum gamma globulin. The positive results are obtained after 2-3 months or more.</p>
                        <p><strong>Napier's aldehyde test:</strong> When serum of the patient is treated with formaldehyde, it causes flocculation and opacity. To 1 mL of patient's serum, add 2 drops of formaldehyde-if flocculation and opacity occur within 10 minutes, the test is strongly positive. If this change occurs in about 2 hours time, it is labeled as weakly or doubtful positive.</p>
                        <p><strong>Chopra's antimony test:</strong> Dilute patient's serum 10 times with normal saline. To 1 mL of diluted serum, add 2 drops of 4% urea stibamine solution. Immediate appearance of flocculum and turbidity indicates a positive test.</p>
                        <p>For exact determination of individual classes of gamma globulins, immunoturbidometric or nephalometric techniques may be used. However, for screening purposes and normal routine clinical testing, the given above tests are quite satisfactory.</p>
                        <p>ELISA techniques are ideal.</p>

                        <h3>TOXOPLASMOSIS (Fig. 23.1)</h3>
                        <p>Toxoplasmosis a common infection, is caused by Toxoplasma gondii. Most human infections are acquired from cats. Affected patients may be symptomless or suffer a brief illness with lymphadenopathy and fatigue. Severe infection, most commonly seen in foetus (congenital toxoplasmosis) or in patients with immunodeficiency, is associated with extensive damage to the brain, eyes, muscle, heart and lungs. Diagnosis is usually confirmed by positive serology. Lymph node biopsy may be needed. Rarely, the trophozoite forms are present in blood monocytes.</p>

                        <p>Babesiosis is a tick-borne disease caused by protozoan parasites of the genus Babesia. The disease affects a number of animal species and is occasionally transmitted to humans. In most patients the illness is mild and characterized by fever, malaise, myalgia, mild hepatosplenomegaly and hemolytic anemia. Occasional patients who have had previous splenectomy are known to have developed a more fulminant infection with massive intravascular haemolysis which may prove to be fatal.</p>

                        </figure>
                        <p>The majority of human infections have been caused by Babesia microti, a species usually infecting rodents. Several cases In splenectomised patients have been due to Babesia bovis, a species, associated with redwater fever in cattle. Diagnosis is made by finding the trophozoites, which resemble small ring forms of Plasmodium falciparum in RBCS.</p>
                        <h3>BARTONELLOSIS (Fig. 23.3)</h3>
                        <p>Bartonella bacilliformis causes a severe febrile hemolytic anemia. The disease occurs in inhabitants of the Andes mountains in Peru, Columbia and Ecuador. The characteristic rod-shaped coccobacilli are found in RBCs. The infection is known as Oroya fever and Carrion's disease and is transmitted by phlebotomus sandflies.</p>

                        <p>Various spirochaetes of the genus Borrelia cause relapsing fever. Louse-borne relapsing fever is a human disease caused only by Borrelia recurrentis, but tick-borne relapsing fever is a zoonosis caused by a number of different species. It is during the febrile period of the disease that the organisms are present in the blood with the production of antibodies, the Borrelia disappear and the patient becomes afebrile. Relapses occur, after 7-10 days, with the production of new antigenic variants of the organisms. In louseborne relapsing fever there is usually a single relapse, while in the tick- borne forms of the disease multiple relapses may occur.</p>
