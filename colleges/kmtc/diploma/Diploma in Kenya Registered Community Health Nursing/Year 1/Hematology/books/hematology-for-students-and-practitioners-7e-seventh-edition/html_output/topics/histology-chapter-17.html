                        <p>The mechanism of coagulation is one of the components of the hemostatic mechanism. It comprises three separate, though related, systems, the coagulation system, the coagulation-inhibitory system, and the fibrinolytic system. Pathological disturbances may occur in any one or more of these systems and lead to a bleeding tendency or intravascular coagulation, or to a combination of two, depending on a wide variety of factors. A bleeding tendency occurs when there is a deficiency of clotting factors, inhibition of the coagulation process, or excessive activity of the fibrinolytic system.</p>
                        <p>Although hemorrhagic disorders due to abnormalities of coagulation are relatively uncommon, their early recognition and accurate diagnosis is important as there are specific forms of treatment for many of them.</p>

                        <p>The vital role of the coagulation mechanism is carried out by the coagulation factors. The coagulation-inhibitory and the fibrinolytic systems have the important functions of preventing accidental intravascular clotting and maintaining the patency of the vascular lumen after intravascular clotting has occurred. The interrelationship of these three mechanisms may be represented diagrammatically, as given in Fig. 17.1.</p>

                        <h3>COAGULATION SYSTEM</h3>
                        <p>The main function of the coagulation system is, in the event of injury, to produce thrombin, which firstly aids the activation of platelet in hemostasis, secondly forms a stable fibrin network from circulating fibrinogen, and thirdly stimulates coagulation inactivating mechanisms, thus limiting the process to the vicinity of the injury. The components of the system are:</p>
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li>The plasma protein coagulation factors, calcium, and platelets, all of which are present in the circulating blood;</li>
                            <li>Certain surfaces not normally in contact with the circulating blood; and</li>
                            <li>Lipoprotein derived from injured tissue cells and termed 'tissue factor'.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <h4>PLASMA PROTEIN COAGULATION FACTORS</h4>
                        <p>The factors and their most important features are listed below. They are present in the plasma in trace to small amounts and although difficult to isolate in pure form, they can be identified and quantitated by characterized behavior in in vitro tests (Table 17.1).</p>
                        <p>Factors II, VII, IX, X, XI, XII, and pre-kallikrein are inactive precursors of serine proteases, all retaining considerable homology with trypsin, which is one of the earliest evolutionary prototypes. The carboxy-terminal region is similar in all the serine proteases, consists of about 250 amino acid residues, and contains the active site region. The vitamin Kdependent factors (II, VII, IX, and X) shows considerable identity of the amino-terminal region, containing 10-12 carboxy glutamic acid residues essential for Ca⁺⁺-mediated phospholipid binding. The inactive zymogens are activated by limited proteolysis, often accompanied by the release of an activation peptide. Each of the active coagulation factors has a considerable degree of specificity for its substrate, this specificity being conferred by the 'binding pocket' and the conformation of the protein as a whole, which probably limits its substrate recognition.</p>
                        <p>Factors V and VII are larger glycoproteins; factor V has a molecular weight of approximately 330000 and factor VIII 360000. Activation of these factors is also achieved by limited proteolytic cleavage, resulting in the formation of two noncovalently associated peptides derived from the amino-terminal and carboxy- terminal portions of the case of factor Va.</p>

                        <p><em>* Prekallikrein and high molecular weight kininogen are also involved (see text).<br>† Neonatal deficiency may involve all four of these factors. APTT = activated partial thromboplastin time. PT = prothrombin time.<br>TCT = thrombin clotting time.<br>DIC = disseminated intravascular coagulation.</em></p>
                        <p>being of molecular weight of 94000 and 74000, respectively. There is substantial homology between the heavy and light chains of factor Va and factor Va and factor VIIIa.</p>
                        <p>von Willebrand factor forms a noncovalent complex with factor VIII, thus preventing more rapid removal of the coagulation protein from the plasma. The other contributions of von Willebrand factor to hemostasis also related to its adhesive properties, mediating adhesion of platelets to the subendothelial tissues and involvement in platelet aggregation. von Willebrand factor circulates as heterogeneous collections of oligomers ranging from the dimer of 500000 to species of greater than 10000000.</p>
                        <p>Factor I, or fibrinogen, is an asymmetrical protein consisting of three pairs of dissimilar polypeptide chains, A$\alpha$, B$\beta_2$ and $\gamma_2$ linked by disulfide bonds. The molecular weight of fibrinogen is 340000. The amino-terminl segments of all six chains are probably clustered in a central domain with fibrinopeptides A and B protruding. The proteolytic cleavage of fibrinogen by thrombin, with the release of the fibrinopeptides, is responsible for the spontaneous polymerization of fibrin molecules to form an insoluble network.</p>
                        <p>Factor XIII is an inactive proenzyme composed of two pairs of polypeptide chains ($\alpha_2\beta_2$). A platelet factor XIII consists of only two '$\alpha$' chain subunits. Factor XIII is activated to a calcium-dependent transglutaminase by thrombin cleavage of a small peptide from the amino-terminal end of the '$\alpha$' subunit. The transglutaminase activity of factor XIII is primarily directed to forming isopeptide bonds between lysine and glutamine residues of the fibrin $\gamma$ chains to form $\gamma-\gamma$ dimers, and the a chains to form polymers. These reactions, termed crosslinking or stabilization, make fibrin resistant to plasmin attack and confer structural stability.</p>
                        <p>The liver hepatocyte is the site of synthesis of most of the coagulation proteins. Vitamin K is required to convert the inactive forms of factors II, VII, IX, X in the liver to their active froms of carboxylation of amino-terminal clusters of glutamic acid residues of $\gamma$-carboxy glutamic acid. Factor VIII is probably synthesized in hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cells. von Willebrand factor is synthesized in vascular endothelium and bone marrow megakaryocytes. Plasma factor V is derived from hepatic synthesis, while platelet factor V is probably synthesized in megakaryocytes. Factor XIII is similarly disposed.</p>
                        <p>Production of these proteins is controlled by autosomal genes, with the exception of factor VIII and factor IX where sex-linked genes operate. Inherited deficiency states usually result from the production of a defective molecule, although complete or partial failure of synthesis may occur in some cases. Autosomal recessive inheritance probably explains the extreme rarity of most disorders; the disorders in which factor VIII or factor IX are inherited in the sex-linked manner (hemophilia A and hemophilia B) are relatively much more common.</p>
                        <p>Fibrinogen concentration may be measured directly as clottable protein, but the other coagulation proteins are usually expressed in units of activity compared to that of a pool of normal plasma. Immunoreactive protein levels can also be measured. It is general rule that the hemostatic efficiency of the coagulation system is not impaired unit the activity of one or more clotting factor is less than 30% of normal (0.3 U/mL).</p>
                        <h4>CALCIUM</h4>
                        <p>Calcium ions are essential in low concentrations for normal blood coagulation, both in the binding of coagulation factor complexes to phospholipid and in the dependency of some coagulation enzymes. When blood is collected from coagulation tests it must be prevented from clotting by the addition of a suitable concentration of a calcium-binding chemical, e.g. sodium citrate. When coagulation tests are performed on the separated plasma, an appropriate amount of calcium chloride must be added to permit clotting to proceed.</p>
                        <p>There is no evidence that coagulation disorders result from pathological reduction in ionized calcium. Nevertheless, transient prolongation of the whole blood clotting time has been observed with very rapid blood transfusion of citrated blood.</p>
                        <h4>PLATELET AND LIPID (PLATELET FACTOR 3) AND MEMBRANE-BINDING SITES FOR COAGULATION FACTORS</h4>
                        <p>During hemostasis, activated platelets provide negatively charged phospholipid on the membrane surface, a site for binding Ca⁺⁺ which, in turn, binds prothrombin and the other vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors. Other specific binding sites appear on the platelet surface during the process of aggregation. Factor Va is bound to the platelet surface, providing binding sites for factor Xa. This congregation of components facilitates that local, rapid activation of prothrombin to thrombin. In coagulation tests, a substitute for platelet factor 3 is necessary, and lipids of animal or vegetable origin are commonly used.</p>
                        <h4>FOREIGN SURFACES</h4>
                        <p>That the blood remains fluid in the blood vessels is partly due to the fact that normal vascular endothelium does not promote blood coagulation. Foreign surfaces, both endogenous and exogenous, promote clotting in varying degrees; this appears to depend upon the surface electrical charge and the property of wettability. The inactive coagulation factor XII (Hageman factor) is activated by contact with foreign surfaces, and thus the coagulation process initiated. Coagulation may be initiated in the intravascular space by such foreign surface as tumor cells, disrupted villi as in accidential antepartum hemorrhage, and endothelial cells damaged by trauma and infarction. Potent activators include sulfate glycophospholipids and sulfatides. Some silicone surfaces and a number of plastics have a negligible or very weak effect in promoting blood clotting; this property is particularly desirable for intravenous prostheses, catheters, and extracorporeal equipment, e.g. heart-lung machines.</p>
                        <p>Earlier, a number of blood clotting tests used were insensitive or unrealiable due to the inconstant activation of the clotting process by the glass tubes; however, the addition of one of a number of surface active agents, e.g. kaolin, celite, or ellagic acid to plasma, shortly before testing, results in constant activation of the process and thus great improvement in sensitivity of the tests, e.g. activated partial thromboplastin time test.</p>
                        <h4>TISSUE FACTOR (TISSUE THROMBOPLASTIN)</h4>
                        <p>Disrupted tissue cells expose a lipoprotein called tissue factor, which promotes blood coagulation. Induction of tissue factor expression on the surface of monocytes and vascular endothelium by a number of stimuli, including lipopoly-saccharide (endotoxin), interleukin-I, and tumor necrosis factor, has also recently been shown. This would provide a mechanism for fibrin formation in inflammatory lesions and tumors as well as after trauma.</p>
                        <p>Tissue factor consists of a single protein species, apoprotein III, in a complex with a mixture of phospholipids. The protein is oriented across the cell membrane, with a short intracytoplasmic domain. Only in combination with phospholipids, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, and phosphatidyl-serine does apoprotein III maintains its procoagulant activity. Tissue factor probably represents the cell surface receptor for factor VII. Factor VII itself is unlike the other coagulation factors in that it appears to circulate in a partially activated form. For the full expression of its activity and the initiation of coagulation, however, it requires binding to tissue factor, which, of course, is not normally exposed to the circulating blood.</p>
                        <h3>THEORY OF BLOOD COAGULATION</h3>
                        <p>Coagulation was formerly conceived as a process initiated by the release of an activating substance (thromboplastin) from platelets and tissue cells with a simple scheme which can be illustrated in the following ways:</p>
                        <p>Prothrombin $\xrightarrow[\text{Ca⁺⁺}]{\text{Thrombolastin}}$ Thrombin</p>
                        <p>Fibrinogen $\xrightarrow[\text{Thrombin + Ca⁺⁺}]{\text{(soluble)}}$ Fibrin (insoluble)</p>
                        <p>With the acquisition of knowledge about individual clotting factors, the classical theory has undergone considerable changes. It is presently known that inactive prothrombin is converted to thrombin by the products formed during earlier stages of coagulation, and which can be brought about by two well-defined sets of reactions known as the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways.</p>
                        <h4>REACTION SEQUENCE</h4>
                        <p>A schematic diagram of coagulation sequences is shown in Fig. 17.2. A number of explanatory notes may help an appreciation of this complex system.</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_09_20_6dc34e0338b37aad296bg-505-1.jpg" alt="A flowchart of the proposed reaction sequence in blood coagulation, illustrating both the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways, the role of various factors, and their convergence to form a fibrin clot." class="content-image">
                            <figcaption>Fig. 17.2: Proposed reaction sequence in coagulation. It is of interest that components of both the kallikrein and the kinin systems are required for the effective operation of factor XII and for activation of factor XI in the test tube, and yet deficiencies in these systems do not reuslt in a clinical bleeding tendency. PK = pre-kallikrein, KK = kallikrein, HMW-K = high molecular weight kininogen, TF = tissue factor, PL = phospholipid</figcaption>
                        </figure>
                        <p>The mechanism of contact activation is ill understood. Surface-bound factor XII becomes susceptible to limited cleavage by kallikrein and also ultimately to autoactivation by factor XIIa itself. The same activating surfaces result in high molecular weight kininogen acting as a nonenzymatic cofactor, which interacts with both factor XII and plasma pre-kallikrein with the ultimate reciprocal activation of both. High molecular weight kininogen is also a cofactor for the activation of factor XI by factor XIIa. The contact system may activate a number of other enzyme systems, including the fibrinolytic and the kinin. Paradoxically, deficiency of factor XII, high molecular weight kininogen, and pre-kallikrein (Fletcher factor), while prolonging the coagulation times depending on the contract activation in the test tube, do not result in a clinical bleeding disorder.</p>
                        <p>Factor IXa is formed by the proteolytic activation of factor IX by factor XIa in the classical 'intrinsic' system. It is clear, however, that factor IX may also be activated by the VIIa- tissue factor complex of the 'extrinsic' system; thus the distinction between the two enzyme cascades becomes artificial. Despite the blurring of this distinction between intrinsic and extrinsic pathways, proper functioning of both is required for normal hemostasis.</p>
                        <p>Factor IXa forms a complex with factor VIIIa, Ca⁺⁺, and phospholipid to complete the factor X activator, termed 'tenase'. A similar complex is assembled by factor Xa, factor Va, Ca⁺⁺, and phospholipid to form the prothrombin activator 'prothrombinase'. The reactions are massively accelerated on the surface of activated platelet, and probably other activated cells including the vascular endothelium.</p>
                        <p>Thrombin has multiple functions which are not all shown in preceding Fig. 17.2. Note, however, the positive amplification of coagulation by thrombin activation of factor V and VIII. At the same time, thrombin activation of protein C and of vascular prostacyclin release has an opposing function to limit the coagulation process.</p>
                        <h3>INHIBITORS OF COAGULATION</h3>
                        <p>The naturally occurring inhibitors of coagulation provide a mechanism to limit clotting to the vicinity of tissue injury. A number of these inhibitors bear homology to the inhibitors of fibrinolysis and constitute a superfamily to protein known as 'serpins'. This group of inhibitors functions by offering their active protease an alternative high-affinity substrate that resists complete cleavage. They form a stoichiometric complex with the target protease, the complex being subsequently catabolized and cleared from the circulation. Thus the inhibitors are consumed in the process of coagulation, as are coagulation factors, and this is important when considering massive thrombosis or disseminated intravascular coagulation.</p>
                        <p>Table 17.2 lists the major inhibitors of coagulation and some of their features. Antithrombin III is the major antithrombin activity, contributing about 70% of the capacity of plasma, but it also inhibits factor XIIa, XIa, IXa, and in particular Xa. Inhibition of coagulation factors by antithrombin III is greatly enhanced by the presence of heparin, primarily due to acceleration of both the cleavage and the complexing of the protease to the inhibitor. Antithrombin III is synthesized by hepatocytes and the vascular endothelium.</p>

                        <p>Heparin cofactor II selectively inhibits thrombin, and its activity is enhanced by heparin and by other proteoglycans, particularly dermatin sulfate, a major component of the vascular wall. Alpha-2 macroglobulin may contribute to overall anticoagulant activity, but the physiological significance is ill-understood.</p>
                        <p>Protein C, a vitamin K-dependent protein, is a potent inactivator of factor Va and factor VIIIa when it is itself activated by thrombin with a cofactor expressed on the plasma membrane of vascular endothelium termed thrombomodulin. Factor Va-light chain also enhances the activation of protein C. A further vitamin K-dependent glycoprotein, protein S promotes binding of activated protein C to lipid and platelet surface, thus enhancing anticoagulant activity.</p>
                        <p>The protein C-thrombomodulin system is thus localized to the endothelium, an appropriate site to limit coagulation and thrombosis. Antithrombin III and heparin cofactor II have also the potential for local enhancement due to the glycosaminoglycan concentration in the vessel wall.</p>
                        <p>Other naturally occurring inhibitors are fibrin itself, which bind thrombin, and the breakdown products of fibrinogen and fibrin produced by the action of the fibrinolytic enzyme, plasmin. These are known as fibrin(ogen) degradation products, and have a potent antithrombin action when present in high concentrations.</p>
                        <h3>PLASMA FIBRINOLYTIC SYSTEM</h3>
                        <p>Physiological function of the fibrinolytic enzyme system is to digest intravascular deposits of fibrin (thrombi) in both large and small vessels and extravascular fibrin present in hemostatic plugs and in inflammatory exudates.</p>
                        <p>A simplified scheme of the fibrinolytic system is shown in Fig. 17.3.</p>
                        <figure>

                        </figure>
                        <h4>PLASMINOGEN-PLASMIN SYSTEM</h4>
                        <p>Plasminogen is a glycoprotein of molecular weight 90000 which is synthesized in the liver. It is converted enzymatically by plasminogen activators to the fibrinolytic enzyme, plasmin. This enzyme not only digests fibrin (the desired physiological effect) but also digests fibrinogen and the clotting factor V and VIII.</p>
                        <h4>ACTIVATORS</h4>
                        <p>Plasminogen activator is present in the tissue (tissue plasminogen activator), in plasma, and in urine (urokinase). Tissue plasminogen activator is localized in the vascular endothelium of veins, capillaries, and pulmonary arteries, and in the microsomal fraction of cells. Tissue plasminogen activator is realeased into the bloodstream in response to a number of stimuli, including ischemia, vasoactive drugs, and exercise. Released activator is inactivated rapidly in the bloodstream by complexing to tissue plasminogen activator inhibitors, and has a half-life of about 5 minutes.</p>
                        <p>The important tissue plasminogen activator inhibitors are manufactured in the liver and in the vascular endothelium, but about 30% of the total is probably megakaryocyte-derived and is stored in platelet a granules. The activator in the urine, urokinase, differs structurally from tissue plasminogen activator, and is produced primarily in the kidneys and excreted in the urine where it may help to maintain urinary tract patency. Endothelial urokinase probably contributes a small proportion of plasma activator activity. Factor XIIa not only initiates coagulation, but also accelerates the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin via a proactivator, almost certainly kallikrein. This enzyme, together with factor XII fragments, may also react in the plasma kinin system, influencing vessel tone and permeability.</p>
                        <h4>FIBRINOLYSIS</h4>
                        <p>When clotting occurs, a small amount of plasminogen is trapped in the fibrin strands. Plasminogen activator, released locally from the vascular endothelium or traumatized tissues, binds to the fibrin of the thrombus and converts plasminogen to plasmin, itself bound to its substrate fibrin, and in this conformation protected from its otherwise highly effective inhibitor $\alpha_{2}$ antiplasmin. Fibrin is thus digested. There is little or no plasma fibrinolytic activity because plasmin that is formed in the bloodstream from activation of plasma plasminogen is rapidly inactivated by circulating $\alpha_{2}$ antiplasmin unless there is a gross excess. Alpha-2 macroglobulin also acts as a secondary plasmin inhibitor in the presence of excess plasmin.</p>

                        <p>From a knowledge of the physiology of coagulation it is evident that impairment of coagulation, and thus a hemorrhagic tendency, may result from one or more of the following mechanisms.</p>
                        <h3>DEFICIENCY OF ONE OR MORE BLOOD COAGULATION FACTORS</h3>
                        <p>Deficiency may be due either to defective synthesis or excessive utilization with normal synthesis. Defective synthesis of the plasma protein coagulation factors results from many causes:</p>
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li>Genetic causes which usually lead to deficiency or reduced activity of a single coagulation factor;</li>
                            <li>Deficiency of vitamin K or its antagonism by the oral anticoagulants;</li>
                            <li>Severe disease of liver; and</li>
                            <li>Rarely in association with other diseases.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Excessive utilization of some coagulation factor occurs with intravascular coagulation and in some cases of pathological fibrinolysis.</p>
                        <h3>INHIBITION OF COAGULATION BY ACQUIRED INHIBITORS</h3>
                        <p>Alterations in the naturally occurring inhibitors do not cause pathological inhibition of coagulation. However, in certain circumstances, abnormal inhibitors appear and interfere with blood coagulation.</p>
                        <p>Acquired inhibitors of coagulation, although rare, are well-recognized and are usually autoantibodies with specificity for a particular coagulation factor. This is in contrast to the naturally occurring inhibitors whose action is against the active intermediate products of coagulation. Monoclonal immunoglobins produced in multiple myeloma and Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia may interfere with coagulation reactions, particularly fibrin polymerization, in a nonspecific fashion.</p>
                        <p>It should be kept in mind also that the fibrinogen and fibrin breakdown products which occur in acute pathological fibrinolysis are potent, though transient inhibitors of fibrin polymerization and thus blood clotting.</p>
                        <h3>FIBRINOLYSIS</h3>
                        <p>In a few rare conditions, large amount of tissue activator may be released into bloodstream, producing a transient but marked hyperplasminemic state. Abnormal bleeding may then occur because:</p>
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li>Fibrin which is present in wounds or hemostatic plugs is rapidly digested;</li>
                            <li>The products of fibrinogen and fibrin digestion (breakdown products) act as anticoagulants which interfere with fibrin clot formation and platelet function; and</li>
                            <li>The plasmin digests fibrinogen and factors V and VIII.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <h3>MISCELLANEOUS</h3>
                        <p>Congenital and acquired disorder of platelets sometimes result in the diminished availability of platelet factor 3 in vitro or other platelet procoagulant activity.</p>
                        <p>In patients with primary and secondary polycythemia, abnormal bleeding occasionally complicates surgery. The bleeding probably results from an abnormally high concentration of red cells in the hemostatic plug, disordered platelet function, the effect of sludging in small vessels, and occasionally, disseminated intravascular coagulation.</p>
