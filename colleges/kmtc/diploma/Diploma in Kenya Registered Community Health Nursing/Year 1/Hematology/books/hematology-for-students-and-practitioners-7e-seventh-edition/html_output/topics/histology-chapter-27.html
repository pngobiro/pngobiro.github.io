                        <p>An immunoassay is a biochemical test that measures the presence or concentration of a macromolecule or a small molecule in a solution using an antibody (usually) or an antigen (sometimes). The molecule detected by the immunoassay is often referred to as an "analyte". Immunoassay techniques were used traditionally for the assay of polypeptide, thyroid, and steroid hormones in human serum, contributing most to studies in endocrinology. Increasingly, immunoassays have come to contribute to other areas of clinical biochemistry.</p>
                        <p>There are mainly two types of immunoassays: Qualitative and quantitative.</p>
                        <h3>Difference between Qualitative and Quantitative Immunoassays</h3>
                        <p>Assays which detect the presence or absence of analyte in the sample are known as Qualitative immunoassays, e.g., Qualisa Ds-DNA, Qualisa CMV IgG, Qualisa HIV 4.0, Qualisa HBsAg.</p>
                        <p>Assays that measure/quantify, e.g. the concentration of an analyte in a sample are known as quantitative immunoassays, e.g., Qualisa 25 OH vitamin D.</p>
                        <p>Most common forms of immunoassays are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>ELISA: Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay</li>

                        <p>Fluorescent immunoassays (FIA) are simply a different type of immunoassay. The key variable is the biochemical technique used for detecting the binding of the "detection" antibody and the analyte molecule. The advantages of a fluorescent detection system have been known for many years. These include higher sensitive detection of the analyte, simplified reagents, and simpler assay designs. Several breakthroughs have occurred over the past few years that have enabled the implementation of rapid fluorescence-based immunoassay systems.</p>
                        <p>A modern fluorescent-based immunoassay use as the detection reagent a fluorescent compound which absorbs light or energy (excitation energy) at a specific wavelength and then emits light or energy at a different wavelength. The difference between the wavelength of the excitation light and the emission light is called the Stokes shift. The greater the shift or difference in the wavelength the less interference there will be by having the excitation light detected as part of the emission light (Fig. 27.1). Recently, several technical improvements have occurred that has enabled the implementation of a high sensitivity rapid immunoassay systems. These include the availability of narrow wavelength light sources, newer more stable fluorophores that have very wide Stokes shifts, stable solid state light detectors and microprocessors to process and analyse the data from each test.</p>

                        <h3>Types of Fluorescence Immunoassays</h3>
                        <p>Presently for diagnostic use two types of fluorescence immunoassays are used: Steady-state fluorescence and time-resolved fluorescence.</p>
                        <h4>Steady-state Fluorescence</h4>
                        <p>A type of spectroscopy where the intensity of the fluorescence emitted by molecules excited by constant illumination of ultraviolet light is detected as a function of wavelength.</p>
                        <p>The applications of steady-state fluorescence include excitation and emission scans, synchronous scans and maps, steady-state fluorescence anisotropy, excitation-emission maps, kinetic measurements, and temperature maps.</p>
                        <h4>Time-resolved Fluorescence (TRFIA)</h4>
                        <p>Time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy is a spectroscopy technique used to monitor interactions between molecules and motions that occur in short periods. The ability to measure changes in the picoseconds or nanosecond time range makes it a useful technique in biomolecular structure analysis and dynamics.</p>
                        <p>Time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy can detect events within a fluorophore's environment. The events that can be measured are fluorescence decay, indicated by a decrease in fluorescence after excitation, and polarization anisotropic decay, where the reorientation of the emission dipole during excitation is measured.</p>
                        <p>Measured decay time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy works based on the duration of the excited state, which can be shortened by certain dynamic events including macromolecular conformation changes, solvent relaxation, side-chain rotation, interactions between neighboring residues, and other changes in the local environment. The variation is of only a few picoseconds or tens of nanoseconds, meaning measurable changes must occur within this time range. Developments in this type of measurement are making it possible to understand structural information, for example, by discerning distances between probes.</p>
                        <h4>Stokes Shift</h4>
                        <p>The difference between the excitation and the emission wavelength is known as stokes shift (Fig. 27.3).</p>

                        <p>Point-of-care testing (POCT), also called near-patient testing or bedside testing, is defined as medical diagnostic testing, at the time and place of patient care. The driving notion behind POCT is to bring the test conveniently and immediately to the patient. This increases the likelihood that the patient, physician, and care team will receive the results quicker, which allows for better and immediate decisions to be made.</p>
                        <p>The goal is to collect the specimen and obtain the results in a very short period of time at or near the location of the patient so that the treatment plan can be initiated.</p>
                        <p>The FIAcheck 1.0 portable instrument is coupled with an in-built battery source to provide the system when the primary source of power is down, and an in-built thermal printer which enables the healthcare provider to quickly access patient test results from a POCT instrument.</p>

                        <p>During standard fluorometric detection excitation and emission are simultaneous; the light emitted by the sample is measured while excitation is taking place. In contrast to this, TRF relies on the use of very specific fluorescent molecules, called lanthanide chelate labels, which allow detection of the emitted light to take place after excitation has occurred (Fig. 27.6).</p>

                        <h3>Two Different Test Principles</h3>
                        <h4>1. Double-antigen Sandwich (Example of TSH)</h4>
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li>Test line coated with immobilized TSH monoclonal antibody 1.</li>
                            <li>Sheep anti-chicken IgY in the control line.</li>
                            <li>Mixture of TSH mouse monoclonal antibody 2 on binding pad along with chicken IgY labeled with fluorescent microspheres.</li>
                            <li>TSH in the samples binds to the fluorescent microspheres labeled with TSH mouse monoclonal antibody 2 in the binding pad.</li>
                            <li>The Ag-Ab-F moves forward due to capillary action.</li>
                            <li>The complex binds to the immobilized antibody on the test area forming complex of fluorescence labeled TSH monoclonal antibody 2-TSH-TSH monoclonal antibody 1</li>
                            <li>Fluorescent labeled chicken IgY binds with goat-anti chicken IgG on control line</li>
                            <li>When test strip is inserted the analyzer scans both T and C and quantify based on the regression graph uploaded by the calibration.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <h4>2. Competitive (Example of T3)</h4>
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li>The test line is coated with T3-BSA full antigen complex.</li>
                            <li>Sheep anti-chicken IgY coated in the control pad.</li>
                            <li>Binding pad coated with T3 sheep monoclonal antibody labeled with fluorescent microspheres and chicken IgY labeled with fluorescent microspheres.</li>
                            <li>T3 in the samples binds to the monoclonal T3 antibody labeled with fluorescent microspheres in the binding pad.</li>
                            <li>Unconjugated fluorescent microspheres with T3 antibody binds to the T3-BSA antigen on the test area forming a band.</li>
                            <li>The chicken Ig Y labeled with fluorescent microspheres binds to sheep anti-chicken IgY in the control line forming a band.</li>
                            <li>The florescence intensity is inversely proportional to the concentration of T3 in the sample.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <h3>Usage</h3>
                        <p>Test procedures are divided into two:</p>
                        <h4>One step procedure</h4>
                        <p>Example: FSH test procedure</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>To calibrate the FIAcheck FSH kit, scan the QR code card provided with the kit.</li>
                            <li>Remove FIAcheck FSH test device from sealed pouch and place it horizontally on a clean table, label the device with sample identity.</li>
                            <li>Dispense 100 $\mu$L of the sample onto the sample port in the FIAcheck FSH test device.</li>
                            <li>Incubate at room temperature (18-30°C) for 15 minutes.</li>
                            <li>After 15 minutes, insert the test device immediately into the FIAcheck analyzer and read results.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <h4>Two steps procedure</h4>
                        <p>Example: TSH test procedure</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>To calibrate the FIAcheck TSH kit, scan the QR code card provided with the kit.</li>
                            <li>Dispense 400 $\mu$L of sample diluent into the empty sample dilution vial.</li>
                            <li>Add 100 $\mu$L of the test sample into this sample diluent and mix by rinsing the tip 3 times.</li>
                            <li>Close the lid of the sample dilution vial, label with sample identity and mix the content of the vial by gently inverting it for 10 times.</li>
                            <li>Remove FIAcheck TSH test device from sealed pouch and place it horizontally on a clean table, label the device with sample identity.</li>
                            <li>Dispense 100 $\mu$L of the above mixture at the sample port in the FIAcheck TSH test device.</li>
                            <li>Incubate at room temperature (18-30°C) for 15 minutes.</li>
                            <li>After 15 minutes, insert the test device immediately into the FIAcheck analyzer and read results.</li>
