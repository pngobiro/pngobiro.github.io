                        <p>The recipient has severe aplastic anemia, poor-prognosis leukemia (for example, myeloid leukemia in first remission, acute lymphoblastic leukemia in second or subsequent remission, or in first remission with poor prognostic features, or chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase), a severe genetic abnormality (for example, thalassemia major) or a severe acquired marrow disorder (for example, myelodysplasia. myeoma or paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria).</p>
                        <p>In autologous bone marrow transplantation, the patient's own bone marrow is used to rescue the patient from profound marrow ablation caused by high-dose chemotherapy, with or without total body irradiation, for malignant disease.</p>
                        <p>Peripheral stem cells may be harvested using a stem cell separator and used instead of bone marrow for an allogeneic and autogenous transpiration. Recovery of platelets appears to be enhanced by the technique.</p>
                        <p>Bone marrow transplantation has also been carried out for certain benign congenital or acquired abnormalities of the marrow (for example, thalassemia major a paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria), or no lymphoid system (as in severe combined immune deficiency) or of the macrophage system (as in Hulen's disease).</p>
                        <p>Failure of engraftment is unusual in well-matched transplants for leukemia but is more common when the recipient has aplastic anemia or when donor and recipient are not fully matched.</p>

                        <h4>Leukoencephalopathy</h4>
                        <h4>Secondary malignancy</h4>
                        <p>Infections are a major hazard during the post-transplant period. Attempts at presentation include reverse-barrier or laminar flow nursing, prophylactic non-absorbable antibiotics and antifungal agents, and early use of systemic antibiotics for febrile episodes. Prolonged antibiotic therapy, however, increases the likelihood of fungal infections. Hemopoietic growth factors may be used to enhance granulocyte recovery.</p>
                        <p>Cytomegalovirus infection may result from reactivation of a previous latent infection or growth transmission of the virus in blood products, and may result in severe pneumonitis.</p>
                        <p>Herpes simplex virus infection is a frequent complication. which tends to become generalized and may cause pneumonia, encephalitis or skin lesions. Infection can be prevented by the use of prophylactic acyclovir. Pneumonia due to Pneumocystis carinii is another frequent complication of the immunosuppression and neutropenia.</p>
                        <p>Total body irradiation itself may cause side effects involving epithelial strictures; there is damage to nails and nailbeds and temporary complete alopecia.</p>
                        <p>Veno-occlusive disease (VOD) of the liver is an acute condition due to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Preceding chemotherapy any abnormal liver function may also predispose to veno-occlusive disease.</p>
                        
                        <h3>GRAFT VERSUS HOST DISEASE (GVHD)</h3>
                        <p>This is another major post-transplant development because of the reaction of the immunocompetent cells in the graft against the tissues of the host, causing graft versus host disease (GVHD) which may be acute (occurring in the first hundred days post-transplant) or chronic. There is triad of skin, mucous membrane and gut, and liver involvement which is classified according to severity into grades I, II, III and IV. In acute cases of GVHD there is a widespread erythematous itchy skin rash which tends to be particularly severe on the hands and feet. In severe cases there may be a bullous eruption and subsequent widespread exfoliation.</p>
                        <p>In chronic cases the lesions tend to be firm, red and plaque-like and ultimately may, in some patients, form a scleroderma-like picture with contractions and ulceration.</p>
                        <p>The mucous membrane may also be affected, with formation of lichen planus-like lesions in the mouth and pharynx. The histological appearances of GVHD are normally seen in life after skin or rectal biopsy. In acute GVHD the skin shows inflammatory changes with death of epidermal cells and a lymphoid infiltrate leading in severe cases, to denudation.</p>
                        <p>The rectal mucosa also shows death of epithelial (crypts) cells and inflammatory changes when severe, there is loss of small and large intestinal mucosa.</p>
                        <p>Liver function is abnormal in acute and chronic GVHD, except in mild cases. The histological appearances includes damage to bile duct epithelial cells, inflammatory changes and cholestasis. GVHD can now largely be prevented in HLA-matched allogeneic transplantation if T lymphocytes are completely removed in vitro from donor marrow.</p>
                        <p>A frequent post-transplantation complication is an interstitial pneumonia, which is more common in GVHD may also be related to lung irradiation and to infection, particularly with cytomegalovirus.</p>
