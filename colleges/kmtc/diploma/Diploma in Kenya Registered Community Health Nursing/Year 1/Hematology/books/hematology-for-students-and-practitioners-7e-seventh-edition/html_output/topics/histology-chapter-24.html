                        <p>The blood consists of a fluid of complicated and variable composition, the plasma, in which are suspended erythrocytes (red blood cells—RBCs), leukocytes (white blood cells—WBCs) and platelets. By using an anticoagulant, the formed elements can be separated from plasma. When blood coagulates, the fluid that remains after separation of the clot is called serum. Serum = Plasma - fibrinogen. The techniques of hematology are concerned mainly with the cellular formed elements of blood, their number or concentration, the relative distribution of various types of cells and the structural or biochemical abnormalities that promote disease.</p>

                        <h3>CAPILLARY OR PERIPHERAL BLOOD</h3>
                        <p>For hematologic exercises, venous blood obtained from a vein is better. However, for total and differential blood counts and for hemoglobin estimation, blood can be taken by pricking: (i) the lobe of the ear, (ii) the palmar surfaces of the tip of the finger, (iii) in infants, from the plantar surface of the (a) heel, or (b) the great toe. The puncture should be about 3 mm deep. An edematous or a congested part should not be used. If the area to be punctured is cold and cyanotic, warm it by massaging or else erroneous results may be obtained. Clean the site with spirit or alcohol, let dry and puncture. Wipe off the first drop of blood, never press out blood. Having obtained the requisite amount of blood, let the patient apply slight pressure over the area with sterile swab (Fig. 24.1).</p>

                        <h3>VENOUS BLOOD (VENIPUNCTURE)</h3>
                        <p>Reassure the patient about what is to be done. Inspect the veins, use a tourniquet if needed (Fig. 24.2). Use a syringe of a size according to the amount of blood required. Needles of gauge less than 22 should be used and be 1-1½ inches long. Instead of a tourniquet, one can use a sphygmomanometer cuff, apply pressure that is midway between systolic and diastolic pressure. Ask the patient to open and close his fist several times. Take aseptic precautions, and puncture the vein. Sometimes, it may be difficult to obtain blood at the first instance, in such a case, first the skin around the vein is punctured and then the vein is punctured, the moment needle enters the vein, blood flows back into the syringe. If still blood has not been obtained withdraw the needle and in many instances blood would be obtained. Having withdrawn blood, loosen the tourniquet and ask the patient to open his fist. Let the patient apply a sterile gauze piece with gentle pressure over the area. The patient should apply pressure gently with three fingers. Why three fingers? Simply because the site of skin puncture is not the same as the site of venipuncture. Make sure that the bleeding has stopped before the patient leaves. In infants blood may be secured from femoral or external jugular vein. Wash the syringe after dispensing the blood in the right container. Transfer blood from syringe into the container gently (not through the needle). Ideally use disposable syringes and needles.</p>

                        <h4>Complications</h4>
                        <h5>Immediate</h5>
                        <p>Hematoma and syncope. Hematomas can be avoided by applying adequate gentle pressure at the site and for syncope a physician should be brought to take care. In any case, let the patient lie down if he or she is already not and raise the foot end. Some patients with a bleeding tendency may overbleed.</p>
                        <h5>Late Local Complications</h5>
                        <p>Thrombosis of the vein. Rarely thrombophlebitis may occur. Apply Thrombophob® if it happens. Seek professional medical help.</p>
                        <h5>Late-general Complications</h5>
                        <p>Transmission of serum hepatitis, AIDS by using contaminated needle and syringe.</p>

                                <li>If oozing from the puncture site is difficult to stop, elevate area and apply a pressure dressing. Stay with the patient until bleeding stops.</li>
                                <li>Never draw blood for any laboratory test from the same extremity that is being used for IV fluids, IV medications or blood transfusion.</li>
                                <li>In patients with leukemia or agranulocytosis and in others with lowered resistance, the finger-prick and ear lobe puncture are more likely to cause infection than venipuncture. If capillary sample is necessary in these patients, the cleansing agent should remain in contact with the skin for 7-10 minutes. Alcohol is not bactericidal, povidone iodine (Betadine®) is the cleansing agent of choice on leukemic patients.</li>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>On letting blood stand, it clots after some time. Anticoagulants are agents that prevent clotting when mixed with blood in an appropriate proportion. The common pathway of the clotting mechanism is represented as under:</p>
                        <p class="equation">Prothrombin $\xrightarrow{\text{Thromboplastin + Ca}^{++}}$ Thrombin</p>
                        <p class="equation">Fibrinogen (soluble) $\xrightarrow{\text{Thrombin + Ca}^{++}}$ Fibrin (insoluble)</p>
                        <p>Fibrin with blood cells with entrapped constituents comprise a clot. The thromboplastin released by damaged tissue, or platelets converts inactive prothrombin into active thrombin in the presence of calcium ions. Thrombin converts soluble fibrinogen into insoluble fibrin clot in the presence of calcium ions. Anticoagulants commonly used for hematological investigations are as follows.</p>
                        
                        <h3>EDTA</h3>
                        <p>Ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA), disodium or potassium salt. EDTA acts by chelating calcium and preserves cellular element better than oxalates. Eight milligrams of the salt is enough for anticoagulating 3-4 mL of blood.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>EDTA can be used for hemograms, ESR (Wintrobe's method), platelet count, DLC and peripheral smear examination.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Advantages of EDTA</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Cellular morphology is preserved better, even 2-3 hours after blood collection</li>
                            <li>As platelet clumping is prevented, EDTA is a better anticoagulant for platelet counts</li>
                            <li>EDTA 2K salt is recommended for CBC, is more water soluble (1.5 + 0.25 mg/mL of blood).</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Disadvantages of EDTA</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>When in excess, EDTA shrinks RBCs and leukocytes. If in excess of 2 mg/mL:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>PCV is significantly reduced</li>
                                    <li>MCHC is proportionately increased</li>
                                    <li>Platelets swell and disintegrate, therefore, a fallaciously high platelet count may be obtained</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>It cannot be used for coagulometry applications</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Making EDTA Bulbs</h4>
                        <p>Four grams of disodium or dipotassium salt is added to 100 mL of deionized water. About 0.2 mL of this solution is added to chemically clean vials, the vials are later kept in an incubator or hot air oven till complete liquid dries up (may take 1-2 hours at 60-80°C). White layer of anticoagulant can be seen at the bottom. This bulb is for 3-4 mL of blood, as it contains 8 mg of EDTA per vial.</p>
                        
                        <h3>OXALATES</h3>
                        <p>These act by chelating calcium, calcium oxalate is formed as insoluble precipitate. These are used for blood chemistry and hematocrit.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Potassium oxalate (2-3 mg/mL of blood) but it may cause shrinkage of cells. Not used anymore.</li>
                            <li>Double oxalate used for ESR and hematocrit. Potassium oxalate and ammonium oxalate are used together in a ratio of 2:3, this is done to counter the swelling effect of ammonium oxalate and shrinking effect of potassium oxalate on the RBCs.</li>
                            <li>Double oxalates can be used for
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Hemoglobin, TLC, RBC count, ESR by</li>
                                    <li>Wintrobe's method and PCV estimation.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Disadvantages</strong>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Leukocytic morphology is not well preserved and hence not suitable for peripheral smear studies</li>
                                    <li>The calcium chelated is precipitated in calcium oxalate which is a toxic substance, it is never to be used for blood banking applications.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Making Double Oxalate Bulbs</h4>
                        <p>Prepare double oxalate solution as follows:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Potassium oxalate 1.6 g.</li>
                            <li>Ammonium oxalate 2.4 g.</li>
                            <li>Deionized water 100 mL. Mix well, 0.2 mL of the solution will contain 8 mg of the oxalates which prevent clotting of about 3-4 mL of blood.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3>TRISODIUM CITRATE</h3>
                        <p>Trisodium citrate is used for ESR and some coagulation studies. This too acts by chelating calcium. For ESR, ratio is 1:4; while for coagulation studies ratio is 1:9. 1 part of 3.8% trisodium citrate and 4 or 9 parts of blood respectively.</p>
                        
                        <h3>HEPARIN</h3>
                        <p>Heparin (powder or liquid) acts by inhibiting thrombin and other stages of clotting factor activation.</p>
                        
                        <h3>SPECIAL ANTICOAGULANTS</h3>
                        <p>Special anticoagulants include ACD (acid-citrate-dextrose) used in blood banking and fluoride and oxalate for sugar estimations. Other blood banking anticoagulants are also used.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>WHEREVER POSSIBLE, THE NECESSARY TESTS, INVESTIGATIONS AND PREPARATION OF BLOOD FILMS SHOULD BE DONE IMMEDIATELY</strong></p>
                        <p>If this is not possible, refrigerate the sample at 4°C. Before taking blood from the venous blood containers, invert them gently several times (60) or else unacceptable deterioration in precision may ensue.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Whatever be the reason for obtaining blood, in the interest of the patient and your own interest, it is ideal and necessary to use sterile disposable blood collection systems, viz., disposable syringes or the Vacutainers. These are meant for single use and are to be discarded (never to be used again). Relatively new in our country, but established all over the world and being used for decades, is the Vacutainer blood collection system manufactured by Becton Dickinson (BD). Other makes/brands are also available</p>
                        <p>The Vacutainer system consists of a needle, a needle holder and a glass/plastic vacuum tube instead of the syringe barrel and plunger. Once the vein is punctured, the Vacutainer tube appropriately in contact with the needle, the requisite quantity of blood flows automatically into the Vacutainer tube so that the need to pull the plunger out is obviated. Vacutainer is simple to use, quicker, cleaner and safer. It offers-leakproof tubes, standardization of specimen quality at high level, opportunity to rationalize laboratory procedures and innovative, high technology tubes. Appropriate anticoagulants, and other additives are pre-added in appropriate quantities so that all that is required is clean venipuncture. Containers also available for collecting blood from infants with the help of a skin puncture, these are called Microtainers. The blood so collected is adequate for micro or dry chemistries. From a single venipuncture, blood can be collected in separate Vacutainers (for different purposes-EDTA or oxalate-fluoride or citrate Vacutainers) meant for different purposes and very easily identified by the color of their caps. The Vacutainer system is a cleaner system, as blood does not come in contact with atmosphere as it flows straight from the vein through the sterile needle into the sterile tube. The process of transferring blood from syringe to different bulbs is eliminated. Contamination from fallen blood is entirely removed. The incidence of hemolysis is significantly reduced because the major cause of it-the transfer of blood from the syringe to container-is eliminated. In hematology, because of the instant contact between blood and anticoagulant minimises microclot formation. Furthermore, all Vacutainer tubes are sterile, guaranteeing the biological integrity of the sample-a particularly important factor with ESR determinations and coagulation studies, which can be seriously distorted by microbial growth in the citrate solution. The maximum benefit is derived by the laboratory personnel (by use of Vacutainers) though the physician is assisted only indirectly in the form of quality reports. Also available are Vacutainer culture systems, where blood is injected into the culture media directly without even coming in contact with atmosphere.</p>
                        <p>Table 24.1 gives color codes for the Vacutainer systems and in all cases different volume containers are available from 2 to 15 mL.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Hemoglobin is the main constituent of the RBCs and carries out the important function of transportation of oxygen from lungs to various parts of the body. To a lesser extent, it transports back carbon dioxide from the body to the lungs. When fully saturated, each gram of hemoglobin holds approximately 1.34 mL of oxygen. The red cell mass of an adult contains approximately 600 g of hemoglobin, capable of carrying 800 mL of oxygen.</p>
                        <h3>HEMOGLOBIN ESTIMATION: SAHLI'S METHOD (SAHLI'S HEMOGLOBINOMETER) (Fig. 24.3)</h3>
                        <p>This is based on conversion of hemoglobin to acid hematin, which has a brown color. Fill hemoglobin tube till 20 mark with N/10 HCl. To this, add blood sucked till the specific mark (20 $\mu$L) on the hemoglobin pipette and wait for 5-45 minutes. During this time keep stirring the mixture of acid-blood in the tube. Add distilled water until a match is obtained with the brown glass standard (comparator) provided. Read the lower level of fluid meniscus on g% side of the tube. Report hemoglobin in g/100 mL of blood. If hemoglobin is less than 2 g%, take double the quantity of blood and divide the result by 2. If hemoglobin concentration is extremely high-dilute blood with equal amount of normal saline, take the reading and multiply by 2. This method, however, does not estimate carboxyhemoglobin, methemoglobin and sulph-hemoglobin. Nonhemoglobin substances (protein, lipids) in plasma and cell stroma may influence the color of blood diluted with acid. It is, therefore, not a very satisfactory method.</p>

                        <h3>CYANMETHEMOGLOBIN METHOD</h3>
                        <p>(Drabkin's solution and the standard available from Coral Clinical Systems, Goa)</p>
                        <h4>Drabkin's Reagent</h4>
                        <p>In 1000 mL of deionized water are mixed:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Potassium ferricyanide: 400 mg</li>
                            <li>Potassium dihydrogen phosphate: 280 mg</li>
                            <li>Potassium cyanide: 100 mg</li>
                            <li>Nonidet (nonionic detergent): 1 mL</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>This reagent can be stored in a polythene container. Concentrated stock solutions can also be prepared and diluted accordingly when needed.</p>
                        <p>Pipette carefully and take care not to discard cyanide solutions into sinks or receptacles containing acid (to prevent formation of hydrocyanic acid). To 5 mL of Drabkin's solution, add 20 $\mu$L of blood. Mix well. Read in a photocolorimeter at 540 nm (green filter).</p>
                        <p>For this procedure, certified standard hemoglobin solution may be obtained from reputable laboratory supply firms. By diluting the known standard hemoglobin solution, a graph (linear) may be obtained by plotting the known Hb concentration against the colorimetric optical density reading so that in future the corresponding hemoglobin value can directly be read off from the calibration curve after knowing the optical density of a particular unknown blood sample.</p>
                        <h3>SHEARD-SANFORD OXYHEMOGLOBIN METHOD</h3>
                        <p>Mix 20 mL of 0.1% sodium carbonate and 0.1 mL of blood or aliquots of these (e.g., 4 mL diluent for 20 $\mu$L blood); read optical density in photometer at 540 nm within 30 minutes. Photometer calibration should be based on blood iron determination or oxygen capacity determination.</p>
                        <h3>OTHER METHODS</h3>
                        <h4>Alkali Hematin Method</h4>
                        <p>It does not estimate fetal hemoglobin and is no longer used in routine hemoglobinometry.</p>
                        <h4>Gasometric Method</h4>
                        <p>Van Slyke's oxygen capacity method. It is an indirect method, which estimates the amount of hemoglobin from the amount of oxygen it absorbs. This method is very complicated for routine clinical work.</p>
                        <h4>Specific Gravity Method</h4>
                        <p>The normal specific gravity of blood ranges from 1.048 to 1.066. The average for men is 1.057 and for women it is 1.053. From specific gravity of the unknown sample, its hemoglobin is calculated. This is a very rapid and an uncomplicated method and finds its main use in screening potential blood donors for anemia.</p>
                        <h4>Chemical Methods</h4>
                        <p>Obsolete. Hemoglobin is estimated by finding the iron content.</p>
                        <h3>SODIUM LAURYL SULFATE METHOD (AVAILABLE FROM CORAL CLINICAL SYSTEMS, GOA)</h3>
                        <p>This is a KCN-free reagent where SLS substitutes KCN. The color complex formed is SLSHb which is read at 540 nm. The greatest advantage being that all forms of Hb are converted. The method is relatively free from inter-ferences due to lipemia and presence of WBCs. Linearity is superior to that of Cyanmeth Hb method.</p>
