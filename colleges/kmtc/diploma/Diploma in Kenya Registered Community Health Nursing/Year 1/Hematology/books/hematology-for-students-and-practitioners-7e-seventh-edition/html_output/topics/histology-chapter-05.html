                        <p>Iron enters the cell with transferrin and is combined with protoporphyrin, synthesized largely from glycine and succinyl CoA in mitochondria, to form hem. One molecule of hem attaches to one of the globin polypeptide chains and one hemoglobin molecule is made up of four hemoglobin units. Transferrin together with its receptor enters the cell by receptor mediator endocytosis. Iron is released by a fall in a pH and the apotransferrin and receptor are recycled to plasma and membrane, respectively.</p>

                        <p>Most body iron is present in hemoglobin in circulating RBCs (Table 5.1). The macrophages of the reticuloendothelial system store iron released from hemoglobin as ferritin and hemodiserin. They also release iron to plasma, where it attaches to transferrin which takes it to tissues with transferrin receptors especially the bone marrow where the iron is incorporated by erythroid cells into hemoglobin. There is a small loss of iron each day in urine, faeces, skin and nails, and in menstruating females as blood. This loss (1-2 mg daily) is replaced by iron absorbed from the diet.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Negative iron balance causes decreased iron supply to the bone marrow and hence the anemia. Various factors responsible for negative iron balance are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Blood loss</li>
                            <li>Increased requirement during childhood and reproductive life in females</li>
                            <li>Impaired absorption</li>
                            <li>Inadequate intake.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Iron Deficiency: Stages of Development</h3>
                        <p>A prolonged period of negative iron balance results in iron deficiency. At first, the iron stores in hepatocytes and the macrophages of the liver, spleen, and bone marrow are depleted. Once the stores are gone, plasma iron content diminishes and consequently, the supply of iron to the marrow becomes inadequate for the normal regeneration of hemoglobin. Then, the amount of free erythrocyte protoporphin increases, production of microcytic erythrocytes begins, and the blood hemoglobin level decreases, eventually approaching abnormal levels.</p>
                        <p>There are three stages:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Prelatent</li>
                            <li>Latent</li>
                            <li>Acutal iron deficiency anemia.</li>
                        </ol>
                        
                        <h4>Prelatent Iron Deficiency</h4>
                        <p>Prelatent iron deficiency or iron depletion refers to a reduction in iron stores without reduced serum iron levels. This can be detected by assessing iron stores by using biopsy techniques or the measurement of serum ferritin.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Latent Iron Deficiency</h4>
                        <p>Latent iron deficiency is said to exist when iron stores are exhausted but the blood hemoglobin level remains higher than the lower limit of normal. There is reduced transferrin saturation. An increase in the amount of free erythrocyte protoporphyrin is apparent in the middle and later stages of latent deficiency. Other observations include subnormal urinary iron excretion after deferoxamine injection, decreased tissue cytochrome oxidase levels, and increased total iron binding capacity (TIBC). The MCV usually remains within normal limits, however, a few microcytes can be detected on peripheral smear.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Iron Deficiency Anemia</h4>
                        <p>Iron deficiency anemia is said to have developed when hemologin concentration falls below the lower limit of normal. Other iron containing enzymes, such as the cytochromes, also reach abnormal levels during this period. Epithelial manifestations of iron deficiency usually represent a very late phase of iron deprivation.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Cutoff Values of Diagnosing Anemia</h5>
                        <p>The cutoff values of diagnosing anemia as defined by WHO are 14 g/dL for adult men; 12 g/dL for adult women (non-pregnant); and 11 g/dL for adult pregnant women. However, now, values of 11.7 g/dL for nonpregnant women, 13.2 g/dL for adult males are considered correct for diagnosing anemias.</p>

                        <h3>Prevalence</h3>
                        <p>Iron deficiency anemia is more common in women (both pregnant and non-pregnant) and growing children (especially 6 months to 24 months age group). The prevalence of iron deficiency is high in subject groups living in chronic poverty. Probably because of economic factors, iron deficiency tends to run in families. If an iron deficient child is identified, in all probability, the mother and siblings of that child would also be found to be iron deficient.</p>
                        <p>The iron requirement of an adult male is 5-10 mg/day, while women require 7-20 mg/day (Table 5.3). Poverty, war, unwise agricultural practices, or religious and social tenets aid in increasing the incidence of iron deficiency anemia. Some nations recommend fortification of daily use diets with iron containing salts, etc. The iron salt added should be absorbable but ideally should not affect appearance, taste, or shelf life or the food.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Impaired Absorption</h3>
                        <p>Histamine-fast achlorhydria is common in iron-deficiency subjects, but may be a result of the deficiency as well as a factor in its development. Gastric acid facilitates absorption of ferric iron and food iron, but it has a little effect on hem iron or ferrous iron. Iron deficiency anemia is a common complication of gastric operations, including total gastrectomy, partial gastrectomy and vagotomy with gastrojejunostomy. Malabsorption associated with celiac disease often leads to iron-deficiency anemia (there is often intestinal blood loss also). Although the rate of iron absorption is usually increased in iron deficient subjects, severe deficiency in infants can be associated with impaired iron absorption. Malabsorption of other nutrients, such as fat and D-xylose, may also occur in severely iron-deficiet infants. Pica is usually a manifestation of iron deficiency and is relieved when the condition is treated. Iron deficiency is a common complication of both clay-eating and starch-eating.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Blood Loss</h3>
                        <p>This is the single most important factor as regards iron deficiency. Identification of source and its apt treatment is equally or may be more important than the anemia itself. 1 mg of blood is considered to contain 0.5 mg of iron. So, a daily blood loss of 3-4 mL/day (1.5-2 mg/day) can result in negative iron balance (Fig. 5.2).</p>
                        
                        <h4>Gastrointestinal Bleeding</h4>
                        <p>It is the most common cause of iron deficiency in men and is second only to menstrual blood loss in women. Occult bleeding is likely to go unnoticed and therefore more likely to cause anemia.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Hemorrhoids</strong> are one of the most common ailments, affecting more than 25% of the population. Even if very obvious, the clinician should not end the search for a bleeder at hemorrhoids alone.</li>
                            <li><strong>Upper GI blood loss</strong>—duodenal and gastric ulcers are the most common lesions and the bleeding can be massive or occult. Certain drugs are associated with GI bleeding, of which the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including aspirin are the most important. NSAID administration causes mucosal damage manifested by petechial hemorrhage, erosions, and ulcers. Both gastric and small intestinal tissues are affected. Blood loss can be occult or overt. All NSAIDs have this side effect. Newer drugs are no better than older ones in this respect. These drugs are thought to inhibit epithelial cyclooxygenase with a consequent reduction in prostaglandins with mucosal protective properties. Other drugs associated with gastrointestinal bleeding include stanozolol, anticoagulants, corticosteroids, and ethacrynic acid.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>About 15% of patients with hiatus hernia develop iron deficiency, especially, with the paraesophageal variety of lesion and is more common when hernias are large. Colonic diverticulosis and diverticulitis can also cause hemorrhage. Keeping in mind the age and other factors a gastric neoplasm should also be associated with bleeds. Iron deficiency anemia may be the first sign of a neoplasm of the GI tract.</p>
                        <p>Fair number of ulcerative colitis patients develop iron deficiency anemia. In tropical countries, hookworm infestation (Necator americanus or Ancylostoma duodenale) is also a significant cause of blood loss. The worms attach to the upper small intestine and suck blood from the host. Schistosomiasis and trichuriasis are other parasitic infections associated with iron deficiency anemia. Schistosoma mansoni causes blood loss from the intestine while Schistosoma hematobium causes blood loss from the urinary tract.</p>

                        <h4>Menstruation</h4>
                        <p>Most common reason of iron deficiency anemia in women. Average blood flow per cycle is considered to be 35 mL while 80 mL is the upper limit of normal. Women bleeding more than 80 mL and not taking hematinics are likely to be anemic. Intrauterine contraceptive devices (IUCDs) enhance menstrual flow, while contraceptive pills diminish it.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Blood Donation</h4>
                        <p>Regular blood donation is a source of iron loss. Each unit donated, contains 250 mg of iron, which is often enough to exhaust the stores of a normal woman. Three or four such unreplenished donations would exhaust the stores of a normal man. Among donors, the prevalence of deficiency increases with the frequency of donation.</p>

                        <h4>Alveolar Hemorrhage</h4>
                        <p>Hemorrhage into the pulmonary alveoli may cause the blood hemoglobin level to fall 1.5-3 g/dL in 24 hours. Reticulocytosis and hyperbilirubinemia may accompany such episodes, leading to an incorrect diagnosis of hemolytic anemia. Iron thus lost is converted to hemosiderin by pulmonary macrophages, but it cannot be used for hemoglobin synthesis.</p>
                        <p>Anemia is frequent finding in antibasement membrane antibody disease (Goodpasture syndrome). Eventually most patients develop azotemia.</p>
                        <p>Other illnesses associated with alveolar hemorrhage include rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and certain other collogen vascular diseases and systemic vasculitides. Alveolar hemorrhage is also observed as a toxic reaction to trimellitic anhydride, D-penicillamine, or lymphangiography.</p>

                        <h4>Hemoglobinuria</h4>
                        <p>Urinary iron losses from 2-8 mg/day accompany paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria. Eventually leading to hypoferremia and hypochromic anemia. Hemoglobinuria in other disorders, such as the erythrocyte fragmentation syndromes associated with prosthetic cardiac valves, also may be complicated by iron deficiency anemia.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia</h4>
                        <p>Recurrent hemorrhages occur from the nose, GI tract, and other sites. Iron deficiency anemia develops eventually.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Hemostasis Disorders</h4>
                        <p>These disorders rarely cause chronic blood loss leading to hypoferremia. As a rule, the bleeding is acute, and treatment often involves replacement of blood as well as coagulation factors that are leaking.</p>

                        <h4>Chronic Renal Failure Treated with Hemodialysis</h4>
                        <p>Iron deficiency affects 50%, or more of those patients treated with hemodialysis when transfusions are restricted. An important reason is the loss of blood associated with frequent diagnostic tests. Estimated iron losses from these sources is 1.5-2 g/year. GI blood losses from telangiectasias appear to be common. Other factors contributing to negative iron balance include reduced dietary iron intake and iron malabsorption due to aluminium hydroxide used to control hypophosphatemia.</p>
                        <p>Transferrin saturation is a misleading measure iron metabolism in renal disease, and serum ferritin levels are the best guide to the need of iron supplementation.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Nosocomial Blood Loss</h4>
                        <p>Phlebotomy, especially if repeated, for diagnostic tests can lead to significant blood loss.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Infancy</h3>
                        <p>Etiology of iron deficiency in infancy.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Decreased total body iron at birth</li>
                            <li>Low birth weight, prematurity</li>
                            <li>Twins</li>
                            <li>Early clamping of umbilical cord</li>
                            <li>Fetomaternal hemorrhage</li>
                            <li>Growth</li>
                            <li>Inadequate diet</li>
                            <li>Blood loss.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4>Decreased Total Body Iron at Birth</h4>
                        <p>Body iron mass the birth averages 78 mg/kg body weight (range being 65-90 mg/kg), of which 60 mg are in circulating hemoglobin and the rest in stores. Similar concentrations are found throughout fetal development, so a roughly linear relation exists between body iron and body weight. Birth weight of over 4 kg is rarely accompanied by anemia, while birth weight of less than 3 kg is often accompanied by anemia. Iron deficiency is more common in twins as compared to infants born singly. Twins have smaller birth weights. Another factor is occurrence of placental transfusion of one monozygotic twin to another. Early clamping of umbilical cord leads to loss of important blood (as much as 100 mL) present in the placenta. Cord clamping delayed for only 3 minutes can result in 58% increase in red cell volume. If delayed clamping is not practical, as in cesarean sections, a similar effect can be achieved by clamping the cord at the placental end, raising the clamp and allowing gravity to drain the cord. Although the newborn has no immediate need for these erythrocytes, the iron they contain can be used later to meet the demands of growth. Depletion of maternal iron has a little or no effect on the body stores of the newborn. Also, iron supplementation during pregnancy has no effect on the subsequent development of iron deficiency in the infant. Maternal iron levels bear no relation to fetal stores.</p>

                        <h4>Fetomaternal Transfusion</h4>
                        <p>The transplacental passage of fetal erythrocytes into the maternal circulation is a physiologic event. In about half the pregnant women, small amount of foetal blood is found between 21 and 42 weeks of gestation. In the immediate postpartum period about 50% of mothers' peripheral blood shows foetal erythrocytes. In 10% the foetal losses are large and about 1% of fetuses show massive losses of RBCs to the maternal circulation. If fetomaternal loss goes on for a long period, it can cause iron deficiency in the fetus. In a few cases, massive foetomaternal hemorrhage near term may lead to hemorrhagic anemia, shock, or hydrops fetalis in the affected newborns.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Growth</h4>
                        <p>Requirements of adult men, in the absence of disease, are low and vary little. However, in infancy, childhood and adolescence, because of increased needs of rapidly growing tissues, the requirements for iron are relatively great. First year of life places highest demands. The same in premature and low-birth weight infants are still higher. To meet the demands imposed by growth the normal term infant must acquire 135-200 mg of iron in the first year of life. A premature infant may require up to 350 mg during the same period. The relatively slower rates of growth in children from 1 to 12 years of age require a positive iron balance of about 0.2-0.3 mg/day. The sudden growth spurt occurring from 11 to 14 years increases this positive balance demand to 0.5 mg/day in girls and 0.6 mg /day in boys.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Diet in Infancy and Childhood</h4>
                        <p>In an average infant, the iron stores are depleted by 2-6 months of age consequent to demands of growth. During this period, a normal full term infant must absorb 0.4-0.6 mg iron daily from the diet. To achieve this level of absorption, an iron intake of 1 mg/kg/day is recommended for full term infants and 2 mg/kg/day for preterm infants to a maximum of 15 mg/day. Supplementation, by and large, is a must. The recommended dietary allowance for children up to 6 years is 15 mg/day; for 6-11 years, 10 mg/day; and during puberty, 18 mg/day. Both, human and cow's milk contain relatively small amounts of iron, however, of what is available, about 50% of iron in human milk is absorbed as compared to 10% from cow's milk. Consequently, infants fed breast milk during the first 6 months of life have greater serum ferritin levels and transferrin saturation than these fed cow's milk; iron deficiency in these children is uncommon. Excessive dependence of infants on unsupplemented cow's milk is an important cause of iron deficiency.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Blood Loss in Infancy</h4>
                        <p>Occult hemorrhage, often without obvious anatomic lesions has been observed in iron-deficient infants. The process is often accompanied by diffuse disease of the bowel with protein-losing enteropathy and impaired absorption of several nutrients. Generalized hypoproteinemia may be observed, along with hypocupremia resulting from ceruloplasmin loss. Considerable evidence shows that the disorder results from hypersensitivity to a heat labile protein in cow's milk. The daily loss of 1-4 mL of blood, along with increased serum albumin turnover occurs while fresh cow's milk is consumed, and these abnormality ceases abruptly with the substitution of heat-treated or soyabean-protein feeding formulas.</p>
                        <p>An uncommon cause of blood loss, almost unique to infancy is bleeding from Meckel's diverticulum. Diagnosis may be difficult before abdominal exploration.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Pregnancy and Lactation</h3>
                        <p>Each pregnancy results in an average loss to the mother of 680 mg of iron or equivalent to 1300 mL of blood. An additional 450 mg of iron must be available to meet the needs of an expanded blood volume during pregnancy. The latter amount of iron does not represent a net loss after delivery because the iron is returned to stores; it must be available, however, during the pregnancy or else iron deficiency will supervene. On an average the iron requirements over the full term of pregnancy amount to 2.5 mg/day. Most of the requirement occurs during the third trimester. Supplementation is essential. Daily lactational loss is about 0.5-1 mg of iron. The content of human breast milk is probably not affected by the maternal iron stores. Because normal menstruation is usually inhibited while breastfeeding continues, iron requirements in the lactating mother approximate those of the menstruating woman.</p>

                        <h3>CLINICAL PRESENTATION</h3>
                        <p>The clinical manifestation of the underlying disease process with or without those of the iron deficiency state may be observed. About 63% of patients go to a doctor because of symptoms of anemia, 16% visit the physician on account of related disorder causing anemia. In 21% it is an incidental finding.</p>
                        <p>The onset of iron-deficiency anemia is almost invariably insiduous and the progression of symptoms is gradual. As a result, patients accommodate remarkably well to advancing anemia and may postpone their visit to the doctor for prolonged periods.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Growth</h4>
                        <p>Iron deficiency impairs growth in infancy, and the growth rate is restored on correction of iron deficiency.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Fatigue</h4>
                        <p>Fatigue is a common complaint of anemic patients, and also found in non-anemic patients. With hemoglobin levels of 8-12 g/dL there is usually no correlation between degree of anemia and intensity of the following symptoms: Fatigue, irritability, palpitations, dizziness, breathlessness, and headache. At some point the hemoglobin reaches a level that produces symptoms. Significant number of patients seek medical assistance when hemoglobin levels are between 7 and 8 g/dL.</p>
                        <p>Some patients with hemoglobin values as low as 4 g/dL, have remarkably a few complaints. When signs do develop, they usually are manifestations of cardiovascular adjustments to anemia. Symptoms may, however, develop in latent iron deficiency too (i.e. iron deficiency without anemia), iron intake significantly diminishes their symptoms.</p>

                        <h4>Neuromuscular Symptoms</h4>
                        <p>Even mild degrees of iron-deficiency anemia impair muscular performance. Total exercise time, maximal work load, heart rate, and serum lactate levels after exercise are all affected adversely in proportion to the degree of anemia. Furthermore, work performance and productivity at tasks requiring sustained or prolonged activity are impaired in deficient subjects which improve when iron is administered.</p>
                        <p>Even when deficiency is mild, muscle abnormalities are noted. The muscle function is disturbed in iron deficiency.</p>
                        <p>In anemic children behavioural disturbances are found. These are irritability, short attention spans and lack of interest in their surroundings. Neurologic development in infants and scholastic performance in older children are impaired. With proper therapy all these changes revert back to normal.</p>
                        <p>The ability to maintain body temperature with exposure to cold is impaired in the iron-deficient patients. About 15-30% of chronic hypochromic anemia complain of neuralgia pains, vasomotor disturbances, or numbness and tingling sensations. Rarely iron deficiency can lead to increased intracranial pressure, papilloedema and the clinical picture of pseudotumor cerebri. It gets corrected after institution of iron therapy. The exact mechanism is not understood but is said that severe anemia and reduced levels of tissue iron enzymes might lead to cerebral anoxia and edema.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Epithelial Changes</h4>
                        <p>Iron deficiency is associated with defective structure or function of epithelial tissue. Nails, tongue and mouth, hypopharynx and stomach are most affected. Iron deficiency can cause generalised pruritis too.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Nails</h5>
                        <p>The fingernails become brittle, fragile or longitudinally ridged. Also seen is thinning, flattening and finally koilonychia, concave or "spoon-shaped" nails. Koilonychia can be induced by caustic chemicals and chronic infections of the nails too.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Tongue and Mouth</h5>
                        <p>Atrophy of the lingual papillae, the most common of the deficiency induced epithelial changes may be accompanied by soreness or burning of the tongue, either spontaneously or stimulated by food or drink, and by varying degrees of redness. Glossitis is found in 15-50% cases of iron deficiency anemia. The filiform papillae over the anterior two-thirds of the tongue are the first to atrophy and may disappear completely. In severe cases, the fungiform papillae also may be affected, leaving the tongue completely smooth and waxy or glistening. One to two weeks of therapy can reverse these changes.</p>
                        <p>Angular stomatitis is characterised by ulcerations or fissures at the corners of the mouth. It is a less specific sign of iron deficiency than of koilonychia, and it also occurs in riboflavin and pyridoxine deficiencies.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Dysphagia</h5>
                        <p>Paterson and Kelly first described the association of dysphagia, angular stomatitis and lingual abnormalities. Later these findings were confirmed by Plummer and Vinson also. This syndrome can be seen in 5-20% cases of chronic iron deficiency anemia. Patients with sideropenic dysphagia (Paterson-Kelly syndrome or Plummer-Vinson syndrome) note the usually gradual onset of dysphagia; this is described as sharply localised to the area of the neck near the cricoid cartilage. They experience difficulty in swallowing solid foods but have a little problem with the ingestion of liquids. Non-treatment makes it worse to an extent that it interferes with the maintenance of balanced nutrition. The most common anatomic lesion is a "web" of mucosa at the junction between the hypopharynx and the esophagus. These webs which may be multiple, usually extend from the anterior wall into the lumen of the esophagus, but they may encircle the lumen completely, forming a cufflike structure. In some patients a benign structure, with or without a web, is found, and the opening of the esophagus at the cricoid area may be reduced to a pinhole size or slit. These webs and strictures can be demonstrated radiographically by taking a lateral view of the neck after barium swallow. In mild cases, iron supplementation gives relief, but others may need surgical intervention.</p>
                        <p>At biopsy, the webs appear to be constructed of normal epithelium with underlying loose connective tissue, within which may be a chronic inflammatory reaction. A few cases may reveal increased mitotic activity in the basal layer. Biopsy of stricture demonstrates chronic nonspecific inflammation and degeneration of striated muscle. A few of these cases may proceed on to malignancy.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Stomach</h5>
                        <p>About 75% cases of iron deficiency anemia reveal gastritis microscopically. It, however, produces a little or no symptoms at all. As atrophy progresses, there is loss of ability to secrete acid, pepsin, and intrinsic factor, in that order. About 33% cases of iron-deficiency anemia develop antibodies to gastric parietal cells.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Immunity and Infection</h4>
                        <p>Lack of iron results in at least two abnormalities in the immune response: Defective cell mediated immunity and impaired bacterial killing by phagocytes. Evidence of defective cell mediated immunity includes as much as 35% reduction in the number of circulating T cells. Both helper and suppressor T cells are affected. These abnormalities can be corrected by administration of iron. Additionally, the production of lymphokines interleukin-1 and interleukin-2 are also impaired in iron deficiency. In neutrophils-phagocytosis, rather than the oxidative burst is considered to become faulty in iron deficiency. Taken together, these abnormalities provide a basis for an expectation that resistance to infection may be impaired in iron deficiency.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Pica</h4>
                        <p>Iron deficient subjects eat ice or other non-food substances. These habits reverse on iron therapy.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Genitourinary System</h4>
                        <p>Menstrual disturbances are common. Whether they are the cause or the result of iron deficiency becomes difficult to ascertain sometimes.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Skeletal System</h4>
                        <p>In children with long-standing iron-deficiency anemia, changes akin to thalassemic skull can be found. The diploic spaces often are widened, and the outer tables are thinned, at times with vertical striations producing a hair-on-end appearance. In addition, abnormalities of the long bones are noted, especially the metacarpals and phalanges, with expansion of the medulla and thinning of the cortices. These changes may result from expansion of the erythroid marrow during bone growth and development.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Spleen</h4>
                        <p>There can be mild splenomegaly (tip just palpable) in about 10 percent of chronic iron deficiency anemia patients.</p>

                        <p>Iron is useful in treating iron deficiency and it has no other legitimate therapeutic use. Iron can be given, intramuscularly or intravenously.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Oral Iron Therapy</h4>
                        <p>Usually ferous sulphate is given orally-as it is effective, well-tolerated and inexpensive. Ferrous fumarate and ferrous gluconate can also be used and they have equivalent side effects. The optimal adult dose is 200 mg of elemental iron given each day. As iron causes gastric irritation, it is advisable to give iron with meals. Absorption is enhanced with citrus fruits/juices, meat, poultry and fish but inhibited by cereals, tea and milk. Iron therapy can be commenced with relatively lower dosages and may be increased gradually-this reduces the severity and incidence of gastrointestinal side effects. For children, the effective dosage is 1.5-2 mg elemental iron per kilogram of body weight 3 times a day. Children usually tolerate elixirs and syrups even on an empty stomach. The 200 mg daily (adult) dose produces a maximal rate of hemoglobin regeneration. It is important to continue oral therapy for 3-6 months after the anemia is relieved, otherwise, a relapse is likely to follow. This continued therapy allows for repletion of iron stores.</p>

                        <h4>Side Effects</h4>
                        <p>Some patients on being given oral iron complain of gastrointestinal symptoms, including heartburn, nausea, abdominal cramps and diarrhoea. About 100 mg of elemental iron per day usually does not produce significant side effects. Other preparations available are a polysaccharide-iron complex and carbonyl iron. Carbonyl iron offers the benefit of lesser side effects. If given in sufficient quantities, both ascorbic acid and succinic acid increase absorption of ferrous iron. Enteric coated or sustained release medications may reduce side effects but they are also less likely to be absorbed adequately.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Failure to Respond to Oral Iron</h4>
                        <p>Reasons can be (1) incorrect diagnosis. (2) complicating illness (3) failure of patient to take prescribed medicine (4) inadequate prescription (dose or form) (5) continuing iron loss in excess of intake and (6) malabsorption of iron.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Parenteral Iron Therapy</h4>
                        <p>Parenteral iron therapy is effective but more dangerous and considerably more expensive. Parenteral iron therapy is indicated when the patient (a) is unable to tolerate iron compounds given orally (b) repeatedly fails to heed instructions or is incapable of accepting or following them (c) loses iron at a rate too rapid to be compensated for by oral therapy; as may occur in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, (d) has a disorder of gastrointestinal tract, such as ulcerative colitis in which symptoms may be aggravated by oral iron therapy (e) is unable to absorb iron given orally. (f) is unable to maintain iron balance on treatment with hemodialysis or (g) is donating huge amounts of blood for autotransfusion programs.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Iron Dextran Complex</h5>
                        <p>Iron dextran complex, which contains 50 mg of iron per mL of solution, is the preparation of choice. The total dose is calculated from the amount of iron needed to restore the hemoglobin deficit plus an additional amount to replenish the stores.</p>
                        <p>Iron to be injected (mg) = (15 - patient's Hb in g/dL) $\times$ body weight in kg $\times$ 3</p>
                        <p>Iron-dextran can be given intramuscularly or intravenously. The intramuscular injections are best made deep into the upper outer quadrant of the buttock, and the skin should be laterally displaced before injection (z-track technique) to prevent staining of the skin. A dose of 0.5 mL should be given to test for hypersensitivity. After a day, or at least one hour, the full dose may be given. The maximal recommended daily dose is 2 mL (or 100 mg). About 75% of injected dose is absorbed from injection site and 25% may remain there itself and be essentially unavailable.</p>
                        <p>Iron-dextran complex can be given intravenously too. After testing for hypersensitivity, 2 mL of undiluted iron-dextran complex may be given daily at the rate of 1 mL/minute. Or else the total iron dose can be given in a single infusion (TDI or total dose infusion). 5 mL of iron dextran complex is diluted with 100 mL of normal saline. The whole dose can be given as a single infusion or may be broken into three parts to be given intravenously on three consecutive days. The initial flow should be 20 drops/min for 5 minutes, if no side effects are observed, the rate may be increased to 40-60 drops/minute.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Side Effects</h5>
                        <p>These can be local and/or systemic. Local reactions to intramuscular injections include pain at the injection site and discolouration of the skin. Regional lymph nodes may become tender for several weeks.</p>
                        <p>When intravenous injections of more than 100 mg/minute are infused, there can be pain in the vein injected, flushing, and a metallic taste. Such reactions are brief in duration and often are relieved immediately by slowing the infusion rate.</p>
                        <p>Systemic reactions to both intramuscular and intravenous injections are either immediate or delayed. Immediate side effects include hypotension, headache, malaise, urticaria, nausea and anaphylactoid reactions. Delayed reactions include lymphadenopathy, myalgia, arthralgia, and fever. Most of the reactions are mild and transient but anaphylactoid reactions can be life-threatening.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Response to Treatment</h4>
                        <p>Much before the anemia, the other related symptoms improve. Patients may show rapid subjective improvement, with disappearance or marked decrease in the sense of fatigue, lassitude, and other nonspecific symptoms. Pica gets relieved within a week or two.</p>
                        <p>The earliest hematologic response to treatment is reticulocytosis. The increase generally is slower to appear and is not so marked as may be observed after vitamin B₁₂ therapy for pernicious anemia. Reticulocytosis reaches 5-10% on the fifth to tenth day after institution of therapy and thereafter gradually returns to normal. Rate of hemoglobin increase is higher in severe anemias and about 2 months elapse before it returns to normal. The hemoglobin value should increase to a point half way between starting level and normal in an average of 18 days; and at 3 weeks, the hemoglobin value should have risen 59 $\pm$ 17% toward normal. Hemoglobin estimation is the most accurate representation of the degree of anemia in iron deficiency. During the response to therapy, the red cell count may increase temporarily to values above normal, but the hemoglobin value lags behind. The red cell indices may remain abnormal for sometime after the normal hemoglobin level is restored. As recovery takes place, the normocytic cell population gradually replaces the microcytic cell population. Of the epithelial lesions, the first to respond are, those affecting the tongue and nails. After 1-2 weeks, small regenerating filiform papillae are observed, and after six months, the tongue reverts back to normalcy; however, in severe anemias, some atrophy may persist. Koilonychia usually disappears in 3-6 months, the concavity moving towards the end of the nails as the nail grows. Gastritis and the associated defects in gastric secretion often do not respond to therapy, especially in aged individuals. In under 30 years individuals, gastric acid secretion and normal epithelial architecture may be restored.</p>
                        <p>Dysphagia may be relieved by iron therapy if the associated postcricoid webs are small or medium sized. The webs themselves are not altered, however, and relapse of the anemia is associated with recurring dysphagia. With more severe lesions, dilatation of the esophagus is needed to provide relief.</p>
                        <p>Relapse occurs in about 33 percent of the patients who respond to iron therapy, in part because of failure to complete the full course of treatment and in part because of recurrent disease.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Preventive Therapy</h4>
                        <p>High-risk individuals need prophylactic measures. Among these persons there are infants, pregnant women, adolescents, regular blood donors, women with menorrhagia, and patients receiving continuous, high dose aspirin therapy.</p>

                        <h3>HEMOSIDEROSIS</h3>
                        <p>Hemosiderosis is the accumulation of iron to supranormal levels, producing gross hemosiderin deposition in macrophages of the spleen, liver, bone marrow, and other tissues. In hemosiderosis iron deposition is predominantly in reticuloendothelial cells, whereas the iron overload in hemochromatosis leads to deposition in parenchymal cells. The most important causes of hemosiderosis are hemolytic anemias, multiple blood transfusion, and disorders of erythropoiesis (megaloblastic anemia, sideroblastic anemia, and thalassemias). Chronic exposures to high dietary iron and increased iron absorption caused by chronic alcohol abuse can also generate systemic iron overload. In general, the reticuloendothelial iron deposition in hemosiderosis is not usually accompanied by organ damage but may lead to hemochromatosis, in which such damage can occur. An increase in iron stores is usually associated with high percentage saturation of transferrin, except in situations of chronic disease. Desferrioxamine-induced urinary iron excretion is generally greater than 4 mg/day (normal being <2 mg/day). Desferrioxamine may also be used in the therapeutic management of the iron overload states.</p>
                        
                        <h3>HEMOCHROMATOSIS</h3>
                        <p>Hemochromatosis is a more severe form of iron accumulation that has progressed over a long period of time to involve widespread parenchymal iron deposition and organ injury. It presents classically as a triad of skin pigmentation, diabetes mellitus and hepatomegaly (often cirrhosis), with or without heart disease and hypogonadism. This has led to the classic terms "bronze diabetes" and pigment cirrhosis. The bronze skin colour is due primarily to an effect on the melanin synthesis and is not due to frank iron deposition in the skin. Morbidity is most commonly related to cirrhosis and diabetes when the disease is advanced and there is an elevated incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma. Heart failure and arrhythmias may also develop. Hematologic consequences of hemochromatosis are a few. Serum iron may be elevated tenfold or more, with transferrin saturation approximating 100%, and total body stores may be 20-100 g. Desferrioxamine-induced urinary excretion ranges from 5 mg/24 hr to more than 20 mg/24 hr. The standard therapy is frequent and periodic phlebotomy in an attempt to induce iron depletion except when iron overload is secondary to transfusions for anemia conditions. In the latter case, chelation therapy with desferrioxamine is used to reduce iron deposition.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Sideroblastic anemias are a heterogenous group of disorders characterized by the presence of amorphous iron deposits in the form of ferric phosphate and ferric hydroxide in erythroblast mitochondria. The iron-laden mitochondria often assume a perinuclear distribution, particularly in the later stages of erythroblast maturation, and account for the so-called ringed sideroblast, a nucleated red cell in which large prussian blue-positive granules form a full or partial ring around the nucleus.</p>
                        <p>The basis for the mitochondrial iron accumulation in the various sideroblastic anemias is considered to be insufficient generation of hem as a result of decreased production of protoporphyrin or impaired insertion of iron into protoporphyrin in the erythroid cell. Globin synthesis is also impaired, but this effect is secondary as it can be corrected by the addition of hem in vitro. Iron delivery to the erythroid cell is not down regulated in the fact of the diminished hem synthesis, and iron continues to be transported normally to mitochondria, where it accumulates.</p>
                        <p>Kinetically, the sideroblastic anemias are characterized by ineffective erythropoiesis, like other erythroid disorders with defective cytoplasmic or nuclear maturation. Erythroid hyperplasia of the bone marrow is accompanied by a normal or only slightly increased reticulocyte count. The plasma iron turnover rate is increased but iron incorporation into circulating red cells is reduced. Red cell survival tends to be normal or slightly reduced. Mild hyperbilirubinemia may be noted, as well as an increase in urobilinogen excretion as a result of raised erythropoietic component of the "early label" bilirubin peak. Thus it can be inferred that a substantial proportion of the developing ringed sideroblasts are non-viable and their destruction within the marrow accounts for the kinetic abnormalities.</p>
                        <p>The progeny of the ringed sideroblasts are hypochromic and microcytic erythrocytes, a finding that provides morphologic evidence of impaired hemoglobin formation as well as the initial clue to the diagnosis. The degree of microcytosis varies considerably from one form of sideroblastic anemia to another. Often, dimorphism is pronounced, with a hypochromic/microcytic population of cells co-existing side by side with a normal or even a macrocytic one, the siderotic mitochondria of the developing cell may be retained in some circulating erythrocytes (Pappenheimer bodies), and are regularly found with concomitant hypofunction or absence of the spleen; these cells are nearly pathognomonic siderocytes in the usually Wright's stained peripheral smears. A constant feature of those sideroblastic anemias that are not reversible is an increase in total body iron. The serum iron concentration is increased, often to the point of complete saturation of transferrin, and the level of serum ferritin roughly reflects the degree of iron overload. The ineffective erythropoiesis mediates, in an unknown manner, increased intestinal absorption of iron. The consequent iron overload state is called erythropoietic hemochromatosis and its clinical and pathologic features and course are indistiguishable from those of hereditary hemochromatosis.</p>
                        <p>Iron containing nucleated red cells are called sideroblasts and red cells are called siderocytes.</p>

                        <p>Bone marrow iron can be appreciated directly in unstained preparations of aspirations as the golden refractile granules of hemosiderin. More reproducible assessments are obtained with Prussian blue staining, which renders the hemosiderin blue. Histologic grading (0 to 6+) correlates reasonably well with iron content of the sample.</p>

                        0 is considered iron deficient.<br>
                        4+ to 6+ are present in iron overload states<br>
                        2+ to 5+ are seen in anemia of chronic disease (conversely, anemia of Fe deficiency shows grade 0)<br>
