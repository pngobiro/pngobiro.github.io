                        <p>Concurrent presence of anemia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia. Pancytopenia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia is referred to as pancytopenia. Pancytopenia therefore exists in an adult when the hemoglobin level is less than 13.5 g/dL in males, or 11.5 g/dL in females; the leukocyte count is less than 4 x 10⁹/L; and the platelet count is less than 150 x 10⁹/L.</p>
                        <p>Patients present with symptoms are usually attributable to the anemia or the thrombocytopenia. Leukopenia is an uncommon cause of the initial presentation of the patient, but can become the most serious threat of life during the subsequent course of the disorder. Sometimes, pancytopenia is detected as an incidental feature in a patient who has presented with symptoms of a disorder that is capable of depressing the levels of all cellular elements in the blood. A wide variety of disorders can cause pancytopenia, as indicated in Table 10.1, although the frequency with which each condition is associated with pancytopenia differs considerably. However, pancytopenia is essentially always present at some stage in the course of aplastic anemia, very common in subleukemic leukemia, relatively uncommon in lymphoma, and rare in metastatic carcinoma involving the bone marrow. The prognosis depends both on the severity of the pancytopenia and on the nature of the underlying condition.</p>

                        <h3>DIAGNOSIS OF PANCYTOPENIA</h3>
                        <p>Clinical presentation is based upon features of pancytopenia per se, and those of the causative disorder. Sometimes, the clinical picture and examination of the blood readily indicate the nature of the causative disorder. The major diagnostic problems occur when there are no specific features in the blood to suggest the diagnosis, or when the clinical features are not sufficiently specific to point to the cause of an associated feature such as splenomegaly or lymphadenopathy.</p>
                        
                        <h3>INVESTIGATION OF CASES WITH PANCYTOPENIA</h3>
                        <p>Clinical presentation usually indicates the aetiology. Blood examination, and examination of the bone marrow aspirate and trephine biopsy assist further. When these data do not establish the diagnosis, further investigations are necessary. The nature and order of these investigations vary with the provisional diagnosis, and are appropriate for establishing the presence or absence of the disorders listed in Table 10.2. Certain biochemical investigations can, for instance, be helpful. Detection of an elevated serum lysozyme concentration, for example, in a patient with pancytopenia is indicative of an underlying myeloid neoplastic infiltrative process rather than aplasia of the bone marrow. Occasionally, extensive investigation and/or prolonged observation are necessary before a definite diagnosis can be established.</p>
                        <p>The features of particular relevance to the investigation of a patient with pancytopenia are listed below. A careful examination of the blood film is often helpful in giving a lead to the diagnosis and, as marrow examination usually establishes the diagnosis, some of the more important points of these investigations are summarized below.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Blood Examination</h4>
                        <h5>Anisocytosis and Poikilocytosis</h5>
                        <p>Anisocytosis and poikilocytosis of moderate degree are common in acute leukemia, but are by no means invariably present in this disorder. They are present, but less marked, in aplastic anemia. Both changes may be quite conspicuous in metastatic bone carcinoma. They are usually less obvious in marrow infiltration by lymphomas or multiple myeloma. Poikilocytosis is often very marked in myelofibrosis, pear and tear-shaped poikilocytes being especially significant.</p>
                        
                        <h5>White and Red Cell Precursors</h5>
                        <p>These are almost invariably present in myelofibrosis as a relatively small proportion of the total nucleated cells in the blood. Such a leukoerythroblastic picture is also common in subleukemic leukemia and metastatic carcinoma in bone. It is less characteristic but can occur in multiple myeloma and marrow involvement by lymphoma. It is not typical of aplastic anemia, so that its presence in pancytopenia suggests a diagnosis other than aplastic anemia. In subleukemic leukemia and acute myelofibrosis, occasional typical and atypical 'blast' cells can be present and suggest the diagnosis. Immature lymphoid or plasmacytic cells can likewise occur occasionally in lymphoma and multiple myeloma, respectively.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Abnormal Granulation in Neutrophils</h5>
                        <p>Toxic granulation occasionally occurs in aplastic anemia independently of infection, which is the usual cause of this abnormality.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Hyposegmentation or Hypersegmentation in Neutrophils</h5>
                        <p>Hypogranular neutrophils are found in some myelodysplastic disorders and acute nonlymphoblastic leukemias. Pelger-Huet-like cells are seen in myelodysplastic disorders and some leukemias. An increased number of nuclear lobes is not specific for megaloblastosis, but this feature, coupled with macrocytic poikilocytic erythrocytes, strongly points to such a diagnosis.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Peripheral Smears</h5>
                        <p>These may show rouleaux formation of slight to moderate degree in patients with a high sedimentation rate, but the marked rouleaux formation seen in cases of multiple myeloma and macroglobulinemia is seldom seen in other causes of pancytopenia. Giant platelet forms may be seen in leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes, but platelet size is normal in aplastic anemia.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate</h5>
                        <p>The sedimentation rate is commonly raised in many of the disorders causing pancytopenia. In aplastic anemia, it is almost invariably raised. In multiple myeloma and macroglobulinemia, values are commonly very high and may exceed 150 mm/hour; this is seldom seen in other disorders causing pancytopenia.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Bone Marrow Aspiration and Trephine</h5>
                        <p>A 'dry' or 'blood tap' is not uncommon in disorders causing pancytopenia, and repeated attempts may fail to obtain sufficient marrow particles for adequate examination. A marrow trephine biopsy should be routinely performed, as it not only provides information about the cellularity of hemopoietic elements, but also about the presence of reticulin and certain types of abnormal cells which are difficult or impossible to aspirate from the bony cavity. Sometimes the diagnosis can be established only when the procedure is performed at a site of focal bone involvement indicated by localized tenderness, deformity, or radiological abnormality.</p>
                        <p>Marrow aspiration is usually diagnostic in subleukemic leukemia, multiple myeloma, and aplastic anemia. It is often diagnostic in marrow involvement by caricinoma and in myelodysplastic disorders. It can be helpful in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and in macroglobulinemia, but a trephine biopsy is necessary to establish the presence of myelofibrosis or involvement by Hodgkin's disease. The marrow in hypersplenism does not show any specific changes, but is usually hypercellular due to active erythropoiesis and leukopoiesis. When disseminated tuberculosis is suspected, a marrow film should be stained by the Ziehl-Neelsen method, and isolation of typical or atypical mycobacteria by culture should be attempted.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>This is not the most common cause of pancytopenia, but it is a serious and usually chronic disorder and is described here in some length. The other conditions causing pancytopenia, as indicated in Table 10.1, are discussed in detail in the relevant sections which deal with each particular disorder.</p>
                        <p>Introduced in 1888 by Ehrlich, the term aplastic anemia describes a disorder of unknown etiology characterized by anemia, leukopenia, and thrombocytepenia resulting from a aplasia of the bone marrow. The fundamental pathological feature is reduction in the amount of hemopoietic tissue, causing an inability to produce normal numbers of mature cells for discharge into the peripheral blood. Although there is a marked reduction in the total amount of hemopoietic tissue in the bone marrow, the marrow is not always uniformly hypocellular, and patchy areas of normal cellularity or even hypercellularity are sometimes interspersed between the area of hypocellularity.</p>
                        <p>Administration of cytotoxic agents and antimetabolites, or exposure to substantial amounts of ionizing radiation, also decrease the amount of hemopoietic tissue in the bone marrow, but the defect differs from that in aplastic anemia in that it most commonly undergoes progressive recovery from the time that exposure to the offending agent is terminated. Ingestion of radioactive materials with a propensity to localize in bone can cause pancytopenia, which represents an industrial hazard formerly prevalent in the mining and handling of radioactive materials.</p>
                        
                        <h3>CLASSIFICATION</h3>
                        <p>Aplastic anemia is generally classified as follows:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Idiopathic</strong> when no cause, or any association with other conditions, is evident.</li>
                            <li><strong>Secondary</strong> when the disorder is the result of exposure to certain drugs or chemicals, a sequel to certain viral infections, or related to certain other specific conditions. The most important relationships are with:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Drug idiosyncrasy</li>
                                    <li>Chemical exposure</li>
                                    <li>Infectious hepatitis</li>
                                    <li>Pancreatic insufficiency</li>
                                    <li>Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria</li>
                                    <li>Pure red cell aplasia</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Constitutional</strong> when associated with inherited defects in DNA repair as seen in Fanconi's syndrome.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Selective aplasia of erythroid precursors is referred to as pure red cell aplasia, and the two main categories of this disorder exhibit different chemotherapeutic responses from aplastic anemia. The major caterogies are classified as: congenital or Diamond-Blackfan anemia, and acquired either with or without associated thymoma.</p>
                        
                        <h3>ETIOLOGY OF APLASTIC ANEMIA</h3>
                        <p>Despite the diversity of causative relationships, there are no basic differences in the course of the disorder, or the response to therapy. There is no unanimity of opinion as to the etiology of aplastic anemia, and it may represent a common end-result of different toxic mechanisms, which are abetted in some instances by an, as yet unexplained, increase in susceptibility to toxic processes in certain individuals.</p>
                        <p>A feature of the disorder, apart from in the relatively uncommon familial form, is that it often develops as a response to extrinsic factors, drugs and certain chemicals, which are normally tolerated by the majority of the population. Such idiosyncratic reactions to commonly employed therapeutic agents represent one of the most important causes of aplastic anemia. It is on the other hand clear that the disorder can develop at least as frequently in absence of evident exposure to drugs or chemicals. Such instances are therefore due either to an idiosyncratic response to hitherto unrecognized extrinsic factors, or to a different type of pathological process. The response in aplastic anemia patients who are recipients of transplanted genetically identical bone marrow from a healthy identical twin, indicates the existence in some cases of an ongoing toxic process which can injure hemopoietic tissue. This toxic process can be suppressed by measures that involve potent cytotoxic and immunosuppressive capability, although the precise nature of the mechanism responsible for the injury to hemopoietic tissue remains unexplained.</p>
                        
                        <h3>DRUG IDIOSYNCRASY</h3>
                        <p>Idiosyncratic reactions are qualitatively abnormal reactions to a drug which cause hypoplasia of the bone marrow, and may occur when a drug is first given. The relationship to the daily or total ingested dose is very variable. Toxic effects sometimes appear only after large doses or prolonged courses, but have been reported to occur after small doses or short courses. The risk to any one individual in the population is small, but if the drug is widely used, the number of persons affected can become significant.</p>
                        <p>Drugs that cause aplastic anemia due to idiosyncrasy or hypersensitivity may be broadly subdivided into 'higher-risk' and 'lower-risk' drugs. With 'higher-risk' drugs, the per capita incidence of individual developing aplastic anemia is relatively small, but nevertheless constitutes a fairly constant proportion of patients receiving the drug. With 'lower-risk' drugs, aplasia occurs only rarely, considerably less than in 1 in 10000 patients treated. Oxyphenbutazone, chlorpromazine, phenylbutazone, gold salts, and chloramphenicol have, overall, been the drugs most commonly linked with aplastic anemia (Table 10.3).</p>
                        <p>Chloramphenicol produces two distinct patterns of hematological toxicity: dose dependent reversible hemopoietic depression in all individuals, and idiosyncratic aplastic anemia in a small proportion of individuals.</p>
                        <p>The reversible toxic effect takes the form of an arrest of erythropoiesis and consequent depression of the reticulocyte count when serum levels of chloramphenicol are sustained at or above 15-20 $\mu$g/mL for at least several days. Production of platelets can also be depressed under these circumstances, leading to the development of thrombocytopenia. Examination of the bone marrow reveals decreased proportions of erythroid precursors which may also have vacuolated cytoplasm. These changes are normal pharmacological responses to relatively high blood levels of chloramphenicol, and occur in all individuals. Recovery of erythropoiesis and thrombopoiesis normally takes place in a matter of days when the administration of chloramphenicol is stopped.</p>

                        <p><em>*Selective neutropenia or thrombocytopenia more common toxic effects; (H) relatively high-risk drug.</em></p>
                        <p>This kind of an effect is not usually observed with conventional therapeutic doses, because the relatively high blood levels required to produce a significant degree of reversible toxicity are not achieved unless detoxification of the drug is impaired, either by hepatic disease or immaturity. This type of reaction is thus normally restricted to individuals receiving relatively high doses such as 50 mg/kg/day. As the response is readily reversible, it is not of serious clinical importance, unless it is not recognized and depression of all hemopoietic elements develops during protracted treatment.</p>
                        <p>Chloramphenicol causes this effect by depressing cellular proliferation as a result of its ability selectively to inhibit the synthesis of certain mitochondrial proteins normally produced by the protein synthesizing system in mitochondria. The affected proteins include cytochrome oxidase, an essential component of the major energy generating system in the cell. The ensuing lack of energy availability leads to arrest of proliferation, which is evident first in rapidly dividing tissues such as erythroid precursors.</p>
                        <p>Idiosyncratic aplastic anemia, on the other hand, develops without a specific relationship to the daily or total ingested dosage of chloramphenicol. There may be a history of previous exposure to chloramphenicol, but this is far from inevitable. The majority of instances follow administration of chloramphenicol for several days or more at conventional dosages. Symptoms may not become evident for weeks or months, but the epidemiological evidence is overwhelming that this drug is a cause of aplastic anemia.</p>
                        <p>Attempts to define the degree of risk in any individual taking a course of chloramphenicol suggest the incidence is approximately ten times greater than the background level of spontaneously occuring idiopathic aplastic anemia. It appears that somewhat fewer than 1 in 10000 individuals develops aplastic anemia when administered chloramphenicol, but such a degree of risk is unacceptable when alternative antibiotics with less serious side-effects are equally satisfactory in eradicating infection. Such widespread administration of chloramphenicol occurred at one point in time that it appeared responsible for an overall increase in the incidence of aplastic anemia, and as a result the drug was withdrawn from general use in some countries. There is currently insufficient epidemiological data to establish whether the few reports of aplasia associated with the use of chloramphenicol responses, or chance associations with a condition that can occur spontaneously.</p>
                        <p>Consumption of a number of other therapeutic agents such as gold salts and phenylbutazone is associated with an increased incidence of aplastic anemia. A large number of other drugs have been associated in a small number of instances with aplastic anemia, but it is difficult to ascertain whether these represent chance relationships or otherwise. There is currently no evidence of a mechanism to account for the idiosyncratic response to any drug. Efforts to identify increased drug sensitivity in proliferating cultured myeloid progenitors from subjects who have had aplastic anemia have in fact demonstrated the opposite finding of reduced susceptibility to the toxic action of the incriminated drug in the case of chloramphenicol and phenylbutazone.</p>
                        
                        <h3>CHEMICAL EXPOSURE</h3>
                        <p>The most significant chemical associated with aplastic anemia is benzene. This is a cyclic hydrocarbon and should not be confused with petroleum. Three factors influence the development of aplastic anemia: susceptibility of the individual, duration of exposure, and concentration of vapor.</p>
                        <p>Aplastic anemia is usually produced by inhalation of benzene vapour for considerable periods, as it has been mostly associated with prolonged confinement in poorly ventilated spaces in which benzene is employed as a solvent, often in glues. Other solvents, such as toluene and xylene, do not appear to have the same propensity for causing aplastic anemia as benzene.</p>
                        <p>Benzene can also be found in products used in the home, and in hobbies. Paint removers, and adhesive and cleaning solutions, may contain benzene. The syphoning by mouth of petrol containing benzene has been followed by aplasia. Aplasia has also been reported following exposure to the commercial solvent known as 'Stoddard's solvent', which is used as an all purpose solvent, particularly as a dry cleaning agent, paint thinner and for cleaning machinery.</p>
                        <p>Aplastic anemia has been attributed to inhalation of vaporized lindane (gamma benzene hexachloride) when used in an insecticide. The vaporizers that volatilize lindane have been widely used in homes, offices, public eating places and industrial workplaces. Lindane is also present in some spray insecticides used in the home and in agricultural work. Aplasia has also been reported following exposure to the insecticides chlordane and chlorophenothane (DDT), and to trinitrotoluene in explosives factories.</p>
                        
                        <h3>APLASTIC ANEMIA AND INFECTIOUS HEPATITIS</h3>
                        <p>Aplastic anemia occurs as a rare, but recognized, complication of infectious hepatitis, usually developing as an apparent idiosyncratic phenomenon after recovery from the hepatitis has taken place. It is most commonly associated with epidemic hepatitis infections (hepatitis A), and thus occurs more commonly in the younger age group affected by this type of hepatitis virus. Infections with a number of other viruses can cause marrow hypoplasia which is usually transient, although occasional instances of aplastic anemia have been reported.</p>
                        
                        <h3>FANCONI'S ANEMIA</h3>
                        <p>Familial aplastic anemia can occur, and usually the onset is in the first decade of life. There may be associated abnormalities, such as patchy brown cutaneous pigmentation and neurological, renal, or skeletal malformations. Associated biological abnormalities are a diminished capacity for DNA repair and increased random chromosome breakage during mitosis. A resulting aberration involving DNA may serve as an initiating event in the development of aplastic anemia, or of leukemia which occurs more frequently in individuals with decreased DNA repair capability. Although an initial satisfactory response to anabolic agent therapy may occur, the disorder most commonly tends to pursue an inexorable course to fatal pancytopenia.</p>

                        <h3>COURSE AND PROGNOSIS</h3>
                        <p>Aplastic anemia is a serious disorder which frequently terminates in death within 6 months. Mortality rates vary in different series from somewhat less than 50%, to as high as 80% in the first year after presentation. It is too early to be certain of the extent to which therapeutic modalities such as allogeneic bone marrow transplantation and administration of antithymocyte globulin will improve survival. Both forms of treatment are associated with some reduction in mortality, but transplantation is currently restricted to patients who have a histocompatible donor, and antithymocyte globulin administration is not always successful or sustained in its effect. It does, however, appear that one or other modality will enable a proportion of patients to survive who would otherwise die from the disorder.</p>
                        <p>Mortality is usually due to bleeding and/or infection, and most commonly occurs in the first 6 months of presentation. The longer the patient survives, the greater is the chance of improvement in hematological parameters, although partial remission can be followed by subsequent deterioration, and the risk of death remains greater than normal even in long-term survivors. It is not adequately appreciated that aplastic anemia is generally a chronic condition in which the hemopoietic abnormality can persist for years in spite of the withdrawal of causative agents.</p>
                        <p>In many instances, hematological parameters have continued to deteriorate for a considerable period after exposure to an incriminated drug has ceased. Recovery to complete normality occurs in the minority of cases although the degree of abnormality in other survivors, is frequently compatible with a clinically satisfactory state. Improvement, on rare occasions, can occur over a matter of weeks, but usually occurs slowly, the platelet count is particularly slow to rise, with thrombocytopenia often persisting after the hemoglobin level and leukocyte count have returned to normal. Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria sometimes develops during the course of the disorder and acute leukemia in rare instances.</p>
                        <p>The outcome is difficult to predict in any one individual at presentation, and efforts have been made to identify factors associated with a good or bad prognosis. One analysis suggested that bleeding at presentation, male sex, abrupt onset, low absolute reticulocyte count, more severe thrombocytopenia, more severe neutropenia, and greater depression of hemopoietic cells in the marrow aspirate were associated with a worse prognosis.</p>
                        
                        <h3>PREVENTION</h3>
                        <p>Cautious selection of therapeutic agents. Before prescribing a medicine which is a potential cause of aplastic anemia, the physician should weigh the risk of alternative measures for treating the disease against the risk associated with the drug. No potentially toxic drug should be used if an alternative, effective, non-toxic drug is available. Furthermore, no drug that carries a greater degree of risk than the disease should be used. Many reported cases of fatal aplastic anemia result from administration of potentially toxic drugs to patients with relatively minor complaints which were either self-limiting, or for which an effective, safe, alternative therapy was available. A patient who has developed aplasia following exposure to a particular drug should never receive that drug again, and should be given a warning card to show to all future medical attendants.</p>

                        <p>The prognosis of the disorder is difficult to predict as it can progress rapidly to a fatal outcome, pursue a relatively indolent course, or recover in rare instances after several weeks.

                        <h3>Identification and Elimination of Exposure to Causative Agent</h3>
                        <p>There is no denying the fact that aplastic anemia is precipitated by ingestion or inhalation of certain drugs or chemicals. In such instances, it is logical to terminate the exposure as rapidly as possible in the hope this will lessen the ultimate severity of the disorder. One of the distressing features is that the condition can nonetheless inexorably progress over several months to a fatal outcome after only a brief period of exposure to certain drugs.</p>
                        <p>Sometimes, it may be difficult to establish the extent and identity of drugs or chemicals to which a patient with aplastic anemia has been exposed in the relevant preceding period of six months. Many patients simply do not reliably recall their medication history, and most do not know the extent to which they have been exposed to chemicals. Some insight into the nature of chemicals, such as benzene, with which individuals may have contact at work or in the home, is therefore valuable in the assessment of potential exposure to such agents. A more reliable drug history can usually be obtained from the patient's medical practitioner, but this will not reveal the ingestion of nonproprietary, so-called 'herbal' medications, which in some countries contain additives such as phenylbutazone.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Supportive Therapy</h3>
                        <h4>Prevention and Treatment of Infection</h4>
                        <p>When the patient is at risk from infection because of neutropenia or because of neutopenia or because of glucocorticoid administration, several prophylactic measures are advisable. One is avoidance of areas of microbial contamination such as hospitals, where antibiotic-resistant organisms are common. Reduction of the load of nasal and oral bacteria in patients with severe neutropenia can be achieved with topical antiseptic preparations.</p>
                        <p>Prophylactic antibiotic administration is not recommended, as it tends to alter the microbial flora to resistant organisms, and such a change is highly undesirable. Isolation of patients with extreme neutropenia in specialized low microbial environments imposes severe limitations on the patient. This may be tolerable during relatively limited phases of extreme neutropenia, such as in remission-induction therapy in acute leukemia or in bone marrow transplantation, but impractical in a condition such as aplastic anemia where little change may occur for prolonged periods. Development of Candida albicans infection occurs so commonly in association with administration of high dosages of corticosteroids that concurrent oral administration of a nonabsorbable antifungal agent to suppress the load of such organisms in the mouth gastrointestinal tract should be considered when corticosteroids are given.</p>
                        <p>Infection represents a serious threat to the severely neutropenic patient with aplastic anemia. The absolute neutrophils count can fall when utilization of neutrophils due to infection exceeds the rate at which neutrophils are formed by bone marrow with diminished productive capacity. Such a development further reduces the defences against infection. Infection can be associated with worsening of the degree of thrombocytopenia, and in already severely thrombocytopenic individuals can precipitate potentially fatal bleeding. Treatment of infection under such circumstances should be prompt and vigorous. Oral antibiotics may be appropriate for minor episodes of infection in less severely neutropenic subjects, but intravenous broadspectrum antibiotic therapy is indicated when the degree of neutropenia is severe, because of the tendency for the infection to progress rapidly to overwhelming sepsis.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Prevention and Treatment of Hemorrhage</h4>
                        <p>Thromboctyopenia frequently results in bleeding in this condition. While prophylaxis against potentially fatal bleeding with random donor platelet transfusions has been shown to be of value in thrombocytopenic states of relatively limited duration, such as remission-induction therapy for acute leukemia, it has not proved suitable for the more sustained period of thrombocytopenia in aplastic anemia. A major factor is the development of iso antibodies to allogeneic platelets which occurs in response to repeated platelet transfusions over weeks to months, ultimately rendering random donor platelet transfusions ineffective. It has therefore been a common practice to reserve platelet transfusions for treatment of clinically significant bleeding, as 6-8 units of random donor platelets can markedly improve the hemostatic defect due to thrombocytopenia for up to several days. When random donor platelets are ineffective because of isoantibodies, it is possible to obtain effective platelet support with platelets from donors with greater degrees of HLA compatibility, such as siblings, if sibling bone marrow transplantation is not contemplated. Use of blood products from potential bone marrow donors is avoided in the hope of limiting the degree of rejection of subsequently transplanted bone marrow.</p>
                        <p>A simple but important preventive measure against bleeding is avoidance of the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. They have dual adverse effects: diminution of the functional capacity of platelets, and production of erosions in the upper gastrointestinal tract which tend to bleed. Menorrhagia can also be a serious problem, and the most practical approach to contain it is the uninterrupted administration of hormonal agents that prevent menstruation.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Red Cell Infusion for Anemia</h4>
                        <p>The reason of transfusion is to raise the hemoglobin level to a level at which anemic symptoms are alleviated, and a comfortable life can be led for a reasonable period before transfusion is again required. Because of the better in vivo survival of red cells from recently taken blood, the use of blood taken within the previous few days is preferable. In the presence of bleeding, appropriately collected blood less than 24 hours old has the advantage of containing functionally effective platelets and coagulation factors; however, selective blood component therapy has generally replaced this practice.</p>
                        <p>Individual transfusion requirements vary from patient to patient, depending on the severity of the marrow depression and the extent of blood loss due to hemorrhage. Many patients require transfusion at regular intervals, but a few need only an occasional transfusion. It is not necessary to maintain the hemoglobin continually at normal levels.</p>
                        <p>Many patients are comfortable for 6-8 weeks after the hemoglobin has been raised by transfusion to about 12-14 g/dL, provided that no bleeding occurs. Further transfusion is given when symptoms of anemia again become prominent, usually when the hemoglobin level has fallen to around 7-9 g/dL. Transfusion requirements in women are often greater because of menorrhagia when menstrual activity is not suppressed by hormonal therapy.</p>
                        <p>In patients with marked bleeding, transfusion requirements are sometimes massive. Transfusions tend to become progressively less effective and are therefore required at increasingly shorter intervals, especially in patients who have received many transfusions.</p>
                        <p>This is due to the addition of a hemolytic element to the anemia. While this hemolysis sometimes results from the development of isoantibodies, in many cases no such antibodies can be demonstrated. It appears that the spleen plays some role in the increased destruction of transfused red cells, as splenectomy may result in a lowering of transfusion requirements.</p>
                        <p>An important problem which may develop in patients receiving repeated transfusions is the occurrence of transfusion reactions, which may also lessen the efficacy of the transfusion. Sometimes these are due to the development of red cell isoantibodies which can be detected by careful cross-matching. However, in many such patients, no red cell antibodies can be demonstrated, and it has been shown that the reactions may be due to development of antibodies to leukocytes or platelets. Such reactions can be reduced in severity or avoided by removing the leukocytes and platelets, by taking off the buffy coat when red cell concentrates are prepared by centrifugation, or by freezing the red cells. It is important also to avoid damage to veins which will prevent further transfusion, and thus the cut-down procedure should be avoided. Sometimes, the amount of iron delivered by multiple transfusions is so great that clinical manifestations of hemochromatosis appear.</p>
                        
                        <h3>MEASURES TO ACCELERATIVE RECOVERY FROM PANCYTOPENIA</h3>
                        <h4>Bone Marrow Transplantation</h4>
                        <p>Intravenous infusion of HLA-compatible bone marrow in order to engraft effective hemopoietic tissue in the patient's marrow cavity has achieved a considerable degree of success in the treatment of younger patients with severe aplastic anemia. In the rare situation where the donor is an identical twin, the donor tissue is entirely histocompatible and does not give rise to immune mediated attack on the tissues of the recipient, otherwise known as graft-versus-host disease. Bone marrow transplantation now tends to be restricted to patients under the age of 40 years, and is performed by infusion of marrow from an HLA-identical donor whose lymphocytes shows little or no reactivity to recipient lymphocytes in the mixed lymphocyte reaction. Greater degrees of HLA or mixed lymphocyte reaction incompatibility are associated with rejection of the bone marrow graft, or unacceptably severe graft-versus-host disease. The procedure as it is currently performed is one which is applicable to a minority of subjects with aplastic anemia, as fewer than half have an HLA-compatible donor, and complications are of such severity in recipients over the age of 40 years that the procedure tends to be avoided in this age group.</p>
                        <p>The recipient is given such intense immunosuppressive treatment to prevent graft rejection that it causes extreme marrow suppression. Restoration of effective hemopoiesis by donor marrow infused at this time usually does not take place for 2-3 weeks, and thus specialized facilities and clinical expertise are required to support the patient during the intervening phase of life-threatening pancytopenia. For this reason, better results are obtained in specialized centers.</p>
                        <p>While most recipients survive the initial phase of pancytopenia, a distressing development is graft-versus-host disease in at least half of the survivors, despite attempted prophylaxis against the condition with immunosuppressive agents such as methotrexate or cyclosporin -A. This is due to immunologically mediated attack by the immune system derived from donor marrow on host cells bearing minor antigenic differences, and it causes potentially fatal injury to tissues such as liver, bowel, and skin. There is commonly suppression of immune responses to pathogens, leading to infections such as pneumonia due to cytomegalovirus, yeasts, fungi, Pneumocystis carinii and other organisms. These infections are often fatal. The severity and frequency of such complications are currently sufficiently great for bone marrow transplantation to be restricted to subjects with very severe aplastic anemia in whom alternative forms of management are associated with a very poor prognosis.</p>
                        
                        <h4>ANTITHYMOCYTE GLOBULIN ADMINISTRATION</h4>
                        <p>Intravenous administration of immunoglobin preparations containing antibody to human thymocytes for approximately one week is associated with improvement in hematological indices in about one-half of the treated subjects.</p>
                        <p>Improvement occurs relatively slowly, and uncommonly results in sustained normal values, although the degree of change confers considerable clinical benefit. Antithymocyte globulin thus provides potentially beneficial treatment for patients with aplastic anemia in whom bone marrow transplantation cannot be performed because of advanced age or lack of a suitable donor. The antibody currently employed is mostly raised in the horse, and the patient must be carefully monitored during the infusion because of the low but real possibility of developing an anaphylatic response to horse serum components.</p>
                        <p>What is the best line of action when a histocompatible marrow donor has been identified? Results from allogeneic marrow transplantation are, generally speaking, superior to those obtained with antithymocyte globulin treatment in children and adolescents. A shift towards the reverse situation occurs as the age of the recipient increases further, and results are generally superior with antithymocyte globulin treatment in subjects over the age of 40 years, although allogeneic marrow transplantation still remains an option if the response to antithymocyte globulin is unsatisfactory.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Anabolic Agent Administration</h4>
                        <p>Oxymetholone is currently the most commonly administered anabolic agent for the treatment of aplastic anemia. A variety of androgens have been shown to produce a degree of improvement, and oxymetholone is one orally absorbable form associated with beneficial effects in some patients. Anabolic agents do not appear to decrease mortality in severe aplastic anemia, but are of undoubted benefit in less severely affected cases because they can produce a delayed increase in the cellular elements of the blood. The most dramatic effect is on the hemoglobin level, and may terminate dependence on transfusion. The dosage is usually 100 mg oxymetholone per day, or more, and in some responders, it can be withdrawn successfully after 6-12 months. In other words, the hematological indices may deteriorate after oxymetholone withdrawal and further courses, or maintenance therapy, often effective at lower doses, may be required. Major side-effects include hepatic damage, a problem common to all orally absorbable androgens, and virilization in females.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Corticosteroid Administration</h4>
                        <p>Administration of corticosteroids in high dosages has occasionally been linked with improvement in aplastic anemia. Therapy formerly often consisted of corticosteroids in combination with an anabolic agent, although it is uncertain whether the corticosteroids conferred any benefit. The lack of clearly established benefit in most patients is compounded by the undesirable side-effects of relatively high doses of corticosteroids, such as osteoporotic fractures, glucose intolerance, and increased susceptibility to infection.</p>

                        <p>This type of anemia, described by Diamond and Blackfan in 1938, characteristically develops in infancy, and differs from Fanconi's anemia in that it is not accompanied by impaired production of leucocytes or platelets. It is a chronic disorder, caused by selective depletion of erythroid precursors. Although many explanations have been advanced to account for the lack of erythroblasts, there is currently no consensus as to the pathophysiology of the disorder. Anemia may become extreme, and is not generally associated with other abnormalities, such as thymoma which can accompany acquired pure red cell aplasia. Diamond-Blackfan anemia differs from acquired pure red cell aplasia and aplastic anemia in that the majority of cases respond to glucocorticoid administration, and although maintenance therapy is usually required, the maintenance dosage that sustains effective remission is often surprisingly small. Spontaneous remission may occur during puberty.</p>
                        
                        <h3>ACQUIRED PURE RED CELL APLASIA</h3>
                        <p>The selective depletion of erythroblasts in this condition may involve only the more mature erythroblasts, although most commonly the entire erythroid series is affected. There is characteristically an acquired normochromic normocytic anemia accompanied by a depressed absolute reticulocyte count in the chronic form of the disorder. While the leukocyte and platelet counts are usually normal, depression of leukocytes or platelets occasionally develops at some stage.</p>
                        <p>Chronic acquired pure red cell aplasia differs from aplastic anemia in that there is very good evidence of an autoimmune etiology in the majority of cases. An association with thymoma is common, although in the minority, and the nature of the relationship with the thymoma is poorly understood. A thymoma can be present many years before pure red cell aplasia develops, or alternatively, may have been excised apparently completely years beforehand. The association with many disorders of an established or presumed autoimmune nature, and the frequently beneficial response to immunosuppressive agents, suggests the condition is commonly due to immune-mediated injury to erythroid precursors.</p>
                        <p>Surgical excision of an associated thymoma has been reported to produce remissions, although such a result is far from inevitable. Pure red cell aplasis unassociated with thymoma may occasionally respond well to glucocorticoid administration, but sustained benefit in terms of easily maintained or unmaintained remissions are achieved in about two-thirds of cases after courses of immunosuppressive agents, such as corticosteriods plus cyclophosphamide or azathioprine.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Aplastic anemia is characterized by pancytopenia in which careful scrutiny of the blood film characteristically fails to reveal erythroid or leukocyte precursors. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate is often markedly elevated, and thus does not serve as a specific index of marrow depression due to infiltration by disorders associated with paraprotein production, such as multiple myeloma or macroglobulinemia. Values in excess of 100 mm/hour are, however, sufficiently elevated to raise the possibility of the presence of the latter conditions.</p>
                        <p>Clinical examination usually reveals no positive findings other than those of anemia, or of bleeding or infection resulting from thrombocytopenia or neutropenia, respectively. Lymph node enlargement is not characteristically part of the disorder, although regional nodes draining an infective focus may become moderately enlarged. The spleen and liver are usually impalpable.</p>
                        <p>Occurrence of one or more of the following signs in a patient with pancytopenia suggests a diagnosis other than aplastic anemia: splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, lymph node enlargement, bone tenderness, immature white or red cells in the peripheral blood, normal erythrocyte sedimentation rate.</p>
                        <p>The diagnosis is usually established by examination of a satisfactory bone marrow aspirate containing at least a number of marrow particles, or of a bone marrow trephine. Rarely, the picture in the biopsied material is dominated by a focus of active marrow and may lead to an erroneous diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndrome.</p>
                        <p>Subleukemic leukemia is a more common cause of pancytopenia than aplastic anemia. The leukocyte and platelet counts are depressed on presentation in an appreciable minority of subjects with acute leukemia and the diagnostic problem arises in the subleukemic group when there are very few or no blast cells evident in the blood film. Certain physical signs and, of course, examination of the bone marrow indicate the diagnosis. There may be lymphadenopathy, or enlargement of the liver or spleen, although these features can be present in lymphoma and macroglobulinemia. Features differentiating this condition from aplastic anemia are summarized in Table 10.4.</p>

                        <p>Chemotherapy-related bone marrow depression is usually overtly linked to administration of cytotoxic agents or antimetabolities, and thus poses no diagnostic problem. The connection can, however, be obscure when pancytopenia due to bone marrow hypoplasia is caused by inappropriate administration of these agents, in the treatment of nonmalignant conditions, and in situations where toxicity is enhanced by diminished drug elimination. Examples of diminished drug elimination include the retention of methotrexate in subjects with renal impairment, and diminished degradation of azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine by concurrent administration of the xanthine oxidase inhibitor, allopurinol.</p>
                        
                        <h3>MYELODYSPLASTIC DISORDERS</h3>
                        <p>These disorders can present with pancytopenia. They are a varied group of hematological neoplastic conditions which do not fulfil the criteria of leukemia, although the percentage of blast cells in some forms is above normal in the bone marrow, and blast cells may be present in the blood. Clinical examination can reveal enlargement of the liver or spleen, so that findings of this nature coupled with blasts in the blood film readily distinguish this condition from aplastic anemia. Definition of the type of myelodysplastic syndrome is usually established by bone marrow examination, in which the usual cellular or hypercellular picture differentiates it from aplastic anemia, and the constitution of the cell population usually, but not always, readily differentiates it from acute leukemia.</p>
                        
                        <h3>BONE MARROW INFILTRATION OR REPLACEMENT</h3>
                        <p>Pancytopenia is occasionally present on presentation with lymphoma, either due to bone marrow infiltration in advanced stage disease, or to hypersplenism because of enlargement of the spleen. In most instances the biopsy of an enlarged, readily accessible lymph node establishes the nature of the disorder, although sometimes there is no palpable lymphadenopathy or detectable enlargement of the liver or spleen. The presence of lymphoma may be suggested by the presence of constitutional symptoms, such as fever, night sweats, malaise, and pruritus, or because of radiologically demonstrable mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy. It is often difficult to establish a diagnosis of Hodgkin's disease or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of the nodular or large cell varieties by marrow aspiration when the bone marrow is infilterateded by these disorders. The trephine biopsy is more helpful, as it is far more likely to contain diagnostic material which is difficult to obtain by aspiration. Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia is relatively commonly associated with a clinical picture similar to that of advanced stage, well-differentiated non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and may likewise be accompanied by pancytopenia due to bone marrow infiltration.</p>
                        
                        <h3>MULTIPLE MYELOMA</h3>
                        <p>They present relatively frequently with pancytopenia, although the depression of the blood cell counts is usually only moderate in degree. Distinguishing features are a paraprotein on serum or urine protein electrophoresis, lytic lesions or osteoporosis in bone, and Bence-Jones protein in urine. A histological diagnosis is usually established by examination of the bone marrow, which typically reveals an absolute increase in plasma cells, often with atypical morphological features.</p>
                        <p>Infiltration of the bone marrow with metastatic cancer is a rare cause of pancytopenia, and is usually accompanied by a leukoerythroblastic blood picture, where a relatively small proportion of the nucleated cells consist of erythroblasts and granulocyte precursors.</p>
                        <p>Another infiltrative disorder of the bone marrow associated with pancytopenia and leuko-erythroblastic blood film is myelofibrosis. There is usually marked poikilocytosis with tear-shaped red cells and, almost inevitably, splenomegaly in myelofibrosis. The diagnosis in this condition, and in metastatic cancer of the bone, is best established by trephine biopsy of the bone marrow, as aspiration usually fails to obtain particles of bone marrow in myelofibrosis.</p>
                        <p>Hypersplenism usually causes relatively mild pancytopenia, and should be considered in any subject with splenomegaly. In the absence of complicating factors, the bone marrow contains normal cellular elements which are usually increased in cellularity.</p>
                        <p>Megaloblastosis due to vitamin B₁₂ or folic acid deficiency can, in the extreme case, cause potentially fatal pancytopenia. The blood film usually contains oval macrocytic red cells and hypersegmented neutrophils. Diagnosis is nearly always established by examination of the bone marrow, which is usually hypercellular and contains characteristic megaloblastic erythroid and granulocyte precursors, although on rare occasions the bone marrow is hypocellular.</p>
                        
                        <h3>SYSTEMIC LUPUS ERYTHEMATOSUS</h3>
                        <p>SLE is often accompanied by minor degrees of pancytopenia. Moderate anemia is common and is usually of the type associated with chronic inflammation, although auto-antibody-mediated hemolytic anemia is occasionally the cause. Mild leukopenia is also common, but the leukocyte count rarely falls below 2 x 10⁹/L. Marked depression of the platelet count is more common than severe anemia or leukopenia, and is usually mediated by autoimmune destruction of platelets. Examination of the bone marrow usually reveals relatively cellular tissue without abnormal cells, which excludes aplastic anemia and infiltration by malignant processes. Arthralgia, skin rashes, and other clinical features of systemic lupus erythematosus may be present, and the diagnosis is confirmed by increased DNA-binding capacity or antinuclear antibody levels in the serum.</p>
                        
                        <h3>PAROXYSMAL NOCTURNAL HEMOGLOBINURIA</h3>
                        <p>PNH may present with pancytopenia in which hemolysis may be an inconspicuous feature. The diagnosis of this uncommon condition is indicated by increased susceptibility of red cells to lysis in isotonic sucrose or in the Ham's acid-serum test.</p>
                        <p>Florid and overwhelming infection can produce pancytopenia, and therefore is not immediately distinguishable on clinical grounds from aplastic anemia in which sepsis has developed as a consequence of inadequate neutrophil production. Bone marrow examination is capable of differentiating between these conditions, as the cellularity is greater in the former situation, even though the more mature cells of the neutrophil series tend to be depleted. Disseminated tuberculosis is a less fulminant cause of pancytopenia of this type. Staining of bone marrow differentiates.</p>
