                        <h3>Changes in WBC Count and Morphology</h3>
                        <p>The majority of early published laboratory findings of nonsevere coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) infection are collected from hospital admitted patients at a single time point which limits our understanding of the dynamic hematological changes during the course of the disease. Asymptomatic patients constitute at least 20% of the cases; however, available literature is more concerned with the prevalence and transmission risk they carry and overlooking hematological changes. This probably because those patients were sent for self-isolation and further investigation was not recommended particularly with the overwhelmed health systems.</p>
                        <p>Studies which have looked into the WBC changes in hospitalized COVID-19 patients with none severe symptoms reported a total WBC count range of 3.1-7.6 x 10/L with a mean of 4.3-5.7 x 10/L. Lymphocytopenia was reported in 80.4% of nonsevere patients; however, mean lymphocyte counts was more 1.0 x 10/L in most of the cases. Leukopenia reported in 28.1% of this category with mean neutrophil count reported by different studies to be 0.4-6.6 x 10/L. It is worth noting that both lymphocytopenia and neutropenia in this group of patients were less prominent than those seen in severe cases.</p>
                        <p>A case-control study comparing the complete blood count (CBC) of symptomatic COVID-19 confirmed patients with those of symptomatic COVID-19 negative proposed eosinopenia as a potential predicting parameter of COVID-19 rather than lymphopenia and leukopenia.</p>
                        <h3>Changes in RBC Indices</h3>
                        <p>Hemoglobin and to less extent hematocrit are the only RBC indices reported in COVID-19 studies. Available literature showed no significant alteration in hemoglobin of those with a mild/moderate disease.</p>
                        <h3>Changes in Coagulation Indices</h3>
                        <p>Early studies in Wuhan and Germany showed no significant differences in the platelet count of none severe compared with severe COVID-19 patients. A larger study included 926 nonsevere cases reported a mean platelet count of 172,000 (139,000-212,000), which was significantly higher than that reported in severely ill patients. There was no significant changes in the levels of other blood coagulation parameters in nonsevere illness.</p>

                        <h3>Changes in WBC Count and Morphology</h3>
                        <p>There are consistent data indicating that lymphocytopenia and neutrophilia are features of severe COVID-19 illness.</p>
                        <p>Risk factors associating with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) development and death, concluded that increased neutrophils and decreased lymphocytes were risk factors for ARDS, and increased neutrophils is associated with higher risk of death.</p>
                        <p>Studies addressing peripheral blood film of a COVID-19 patient described a characteristic neutrophil nuclei with C-shaped, single-lobed nuclei, morphologic abnormalities in the granulocytic series and leukoerythroblastic reaction. Blue-green leukocyte inclusions were reported in the circulating neutrophils and/or monocytes of critically ill patients with liver impairment and lactic acidosis and proposed as a poor prognostic indicator. By contrast, activated monocytes were observed in clinically improved patients.</p>
                        <p>Flow cytometry performed on peripheral blood lymphocytes of ICU patients showed a significant reduction in the absolute T-cell count in most cases as well as CD⁺CD⁺, CD4⁺, CD8⁺, CD19⁺, and CD16/56⁺ counts. However, unlike immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and cytomegalovirus, the CD4/CD8 ratio was not inverted in all groups of patients.</p>
                        <p>Many studies have suggested neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) as an independent risk factor for mortality in severely ill patients with COVID-19 with a cutoff value varied between 3.0 and 13.</p>
                        <h3>Changes in RBC Indices</h3>
                        <p>Meta-analysis results regarding hemoglobin level in severely ill COVID-19 patients are conflicting. A meta-analysis study including 224 severely ill COVID-19 patients reported significantly lower hemoglobin than none severe cases with a weighted mean difference (WMD) of -7.1 g/L; 95% CI, -8.3 to -5.9 g/L. Other study found the difference was not significant. The lowest hemoglobin level was seen in patients who reached a composite endpoint (included admission to ICU, requirement of invasive ventilation, and death). The reduction in Hb may indicate disease progression; however, age and comorbidities are confounding factors in this patient group, and data should be interpreted cautiously.</p>
                        <p>Elevated red blood cell distribution width (RDW), a component of complete blood counts that reflects RBC variation in volume and size, has been shown to be associated with elevated mortality risk for patients with COVID-19.</p>
                        <h3>Changes in Coagulation Indices</h3>
                        <p>Altered coagulability is a poor prognostic indicator in severely and critically ill patients with COVID-19. The laboratory manifestations of coagulopathy are elevated D-dimer, slight decrease in platelet count, prolonged PT, and reduced fibrinogen level. Thrombotic events and bleeding often occur in subjects with weak constitutions, multiple risk factors, and comorbidities.</p>
                        <p>Coagulopathy in COVID-19 initiated by endothelial injury results in thrombin generation and fibrinolysis shut down, contributing to a hypercoagulable state, which causes a prolonged PT and aPTT. In the late stages of the DIC, PT, aPTT, fibrinogen, and platelets are decreased due to consumptive coagulopathy as observed in nonsurvivors. Moreover, COVID-19 patients presenting with cardiac injury and elevated troponin-T levels were more prone to coagulation disorders compared with those without cardiac involvement. Studies have also detected lupus anticoagulant and antiphospholipid antibodies in COVID-19 patients, which could contribute to the hypercoagulable state.</p>
                        <p>Altered coagulability is complicated by venous thromboembolism in 24%, deep venous thrombosis 7%, and pulmonary embolism 19% of severely ill COVID-19 patients. Independent predictive parameters for thromboembolism were pneumonia, old age, spontaneous prolongation of PT >3 s, and aPTT >5 s. Arterial embolism in the forms of acute MI, acute limb ischemia, and storks was also reported in COVID-19 patients.</p>
                        <p>The contribution of von Willebrand factor (vWF) in thromboinflammation is well established. Several mechanisms are involved. These mechanisms starts with endothelial dysfunction. In severely ill COVID-19 patient, marked increase in vWF and factor VIIIc level was observed similar to that seen in severely septic non-COVID-19 ICU patients. With disease progression, and in the absence of anticoagulant treatment, VWF and fibrinogen levels decline with persistent high D -dimer levels and even higher P -selectin levels indicating poor prognosis.</p>
