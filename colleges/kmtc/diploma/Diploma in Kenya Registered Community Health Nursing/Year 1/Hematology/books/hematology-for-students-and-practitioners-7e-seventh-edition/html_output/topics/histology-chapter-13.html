                        <p>The antibody molecules of normal human serum comprise five distinct classes of immunoglobulins which have been designated IgG, IgA, IgM, IgD and IgE. The basic unit of all immunoglobulin molecules consists of four polypeptide chains; two identical heavy chains (MW 60,000) and two identical light chains (MW 20,000). The heavy chains of IgG, IgA, IgM, IgD and IgE are referred to as gamma ($\gamma$), alpha ($\alpha$), mu ($\mu$), delta ($\delta$), and epsilon ($\varepsilon$), respectively. Four subclasses of IgG, two subclasses of IgA, and two subclasses of IgM are recognized. There are two types of light chains, kappa ($\kappa$) and lambda ($\lambda$), each immunoglobulin molecule having either two kappa or two lambda light chains. Amino acid sequence analyses of light chains have shown that the amino-terminal half of the chain is characterized by a variable amino acid sequence (the variable region or V<sub>L</sub>) and the carboxyl-terminal half by a constant sequence (the constant region or C<sub>L</sub>). Heavy chains have a similar variable region (V<sub>H</sub>) and three or four constant regions (C¹<sub>H</sub>, C²<sub>H</sub>, C³<sub>H</sub>, and C⁴<sub>H</sub>). IgM occurs in serum as a pentamer of five linked IgM monomeric molecules, although small amounts of the monomer may be present. IgA is largely present as a monomer, but polymers also occur. There are two antigen binding sites on each immunoglobulin monomer, and theses are located at the apposed N-terminal regions of the light and heavy chains. The properties of the various immunoglobulins are summarized in Table 13.1, and The basic structure of the immunoglobulin molecule is depicted schematically in Fig. 13.1.</p>

                        <h3>Synthesis</h3>
                        <p>Immunoglobulin is normally synthesized and incorporated into the outer membrane of resting B-lymphocytes. It is predominantly IgD or monomeric IgM, and serves as the means for recognition of specific antigen. Presentation of such an antigen to the B cell by the helper-inducer cell network results in cell proliferation and subsequent differentiation into a clone of plasma cells. These cells synthesize large amounts of antibody specific for the antigen, and secrete the antibody into the extracellular fluid.</p>
                        <p>The means by which cells are able to generate antibody to molecules to which the body has not been previously exposed is by rearrangement of segments of DNA in the genes that code for the individual chains of immunoglobulin molecules. The basic unrearranged 'germ-line' genes in a previously unexposed B-lymphocyte contain many individual segments, from which certain segments are selected, rearranged, and rejoined in such a manner as to produce a gene coding for an immunoglobulin with a binding site that is specific for the foreign antigen to which the cell has been exposed. The very large number of possible combinations of DNA segments involved in such a process is believed to account for the enormous diversity of different antigen-binding sites on antibodies which can be produced by the immune system.</p>
                        <p>Messenger RNA for the light and heavy chains is translated into protein by the abundant polyribosomes of the plasma cell. The chains are then linked together covalently and carbohydrate attached before the complete immunoglobulin molecule is secreted.</p>
                        <p>It is usual for more than one clone of plasma cells to be generated in response to exposure of the body to a foreign antigen, and the precise antigen-binding characteristics and the properties of the immunoglobulin molecule tend to vary from clone to clone. The net result of stimulation of the immune system by a particular foreign antigen is production of many similar, but not identical, antibody molecules directed against that antigen. About 70% of IgG antibodies to a particular antigen have $\kappa$, and 30% $\lambda$ light chains. The polyclonal nature of the immunoglobulins produced in the normal antibody response gives rise to the diffuse band in the $\gamma$-globulin region of the serum protein electrophoretogram.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Abnormal Synthesis</h3>
                        <p>Abnormal synthesis of secreted immunoglobulin occurs when an abnormally large monoclonal population of plasmacytic or lymphocytic cells develops from a single precursor cell. This cell population produces identical molecules of immunoglobulin, or identical fragments of the immunoglobulin molecules. As the protein is homogeneous, the molecules migrate during serum electrophoresis as a discrete monoclonal (M) protein spike or band, and it is commonly referred to as a paraprotein. The presence of a paraprotein is one of the most common features of neoplastic plasma cell disorders, and also occurs in some instances of lymphocytic neoplastic activity.</p>
                        <p>Imbalance between light and heavy chain synthesis is common in such disorders. In myeloma, the most common abnormality is production of an excess of light over heavy chains. The excess light chains are secreted into the extracellular fluid, but pass readily through the glomerulus and are thus not retained in the circulation of intact immunoglobulin molecules. Light chains are catabolized by the renal tubular cells, but when present in excess pass into the urine as Bence-Jones protein. In about 25% of myelomas, only light chains are secreted by the neoplastic plasma cells, and this disorder is referred to as Bence-Jones myeloma. In heavy chain disease, fragments or intact molecules of the heavy chain are secreted by the neoplastic cells.</p>

                        <p>Multiple myeloma (can be solitary myeloma called plasmacytoma in extramedullary sites) is a neoplastic proliferation of plasma cells, characterized by lytic bone lesions, plasma cell (myeloma cell) accumulation in the bone marrow and the presence of monoclonal protein in serum and in about half the cases in urine also. It is a disease of middle and old age (50-70 years) and is uncommon below 40 years of age.</p>

                        </figure>
                        <h3>CLINICAL PRESENTATION</h3>
                        <p>The majority of patients present with bone pain, symptoms of anemia, skeletal deformity, tumor formation, spontaneous fractures, or nervous system manifestations, either singly or in combination. Less common presenting manifestations are a bleeding tendency, renal insufficiency, and pulmonary infections.</p>
                        <h4>Bone Pain</h4>
                        <p>Bone pain is the presenting manifestation in about 70% of patients, and is usually the outstanding symptom. Nevertheless it may be absent, occasionally, throughout the whole course of the disease. Pain is most frequent in the lumbar, sacral, and thoracic spine, then in the rib cage, but it also occurs in the lips, legs, shoulders, and arms. It is common, and these problems are basically due to pathological fracture, lysis or compression.</p>
                        <h4>Tumor Formation</h4>
                        <p>Tumor formation is not uncommon and may occur on any bone, but especially on the ribs. Tumors vary in size, sometimes being quite large. They are generally firm and often tender. Occasionally, when the cortex is very thin, characteristic 'egg shell' cracking is felt and the tumors are fluctuant. The disorder sometimes presents with a single prominent tumor of bone, and occasionally the appearance of this apparently solitary growth precedes overt involvement of other bones by months or even years. In rare cases, there is a large single destructive tumor of bone, with the histological appearance of a plasmacytoma, which is cured by amputation or irradiation and is not followed by involvement of the skeleton elsewhere-solitary plasmacytoma of bone. Rarely, isolated extra-osseous plasmacytomas occur, and are more likely to be cured by excision or intensive irradiation than plasmacytomas involving bone.</p>
                        <h4>Nervous System Involvement</h4>
                        <p>Nervous system involvement is common. Most frequently it is due to compression by collapsed vertebrae or myeloma tissue. Compression of the spinal cord and nerve roots is the most frequent neurological complication, and may result in paraplegia or quadraplegia. Isolated peripheral neuropathy is a rare complication and its cause is unknown. Blunting of mental function occurs in the hyperviscosity syndrome. Disturbance of brain function ranging from drowsiness to seizures can be produced by hypercalcemia, and the development of hypercalcaemia must be suspected under such circumstances.</p>
                        <h4>Anemia</h4>
                        <p>Almost invariably occurs at some stage in the illness, and in advanced cases is frequently severe. It is relatively common at presentation, and an important contributing factor is the dilutional effect of large amounts of paraprotein in the circulation.</p>
                        <h4>Renal Insufficiency</h4>
                        <p>Chronic renal insufficiency frequently develops during the course of the disease, and occasionally is the initial manifestation. Retinal abnormalities are uncommon, and unless there is coexistent essential hypertension the blood pressure is normal. For this reason, myeloma should be considered as a possible cause in any patient with chronic renal insufficiency and a normal blood pressure.</p>
                        <p>The most important pathological changes in the kidney take the form of atrophy and dilatation of the tubules with cast formation in the tubular lumen. These are the characteristic of 'myeloma' kidney. The casts are composed of a mixture of normal plasma proteins and precipitated Bence-Jones protein. Multinucleate epithelial cells are often found adjacent to the casts. Bence-Jones protein is also believed to damage renal failure include deposition of myeloma proteins, dehydration, local infection, hyperuricemia, hypercalcemia, and plasma cell infiltration of the kidney. Acute renal failure in the absence of previous renal impairment is less frequent, but may follow the hypovolemia and dehydration associated with some forms of intravenous pyelography. The Fanconi syndrome of renal tubular malabsorption can be associated with Bence-Jones proteinuria, and may precede the development of overt myeloma by several years.</p>
                        <h4>Bleeding Manifestations</h4>
                        <p>Bleeding manifestations occasionally bring the disorder to notice. Epistaxis and bleeding from the gums or into the skin are the most common bleeding manifestations, but melena, hematuria, retinal and other hemorrhages may occur. Several factors contribute to the pathogenesis of the bleeding, the most important being the presence of the abnormal protein. An effect on platelets by the paraprotein often leads to abnormal platelet function, with prolongation of the bleeding time and defective adhesion, aggregation, and platelet factor 3 availability. Thrombocytopenia may also contribute as it can occur in advanced disease.</p>
                        <p>The paraprotein may also act as an anticoagulant and inhibit some steps in the coagulation pathway. The most common abnormality is inhibition of fibrin monomer polymerization, which results in prolongation of the thrombin clotting time and defective clot retraction. Rare cases of interference with factor VIII activity have been described. Hyperviscosity also contributes to abnormal bleeding and bruising, but occurs more commonly in macroglobulinemia.</p>
                        <h4>Infections</h4>
                        <p>Infections are common in myeloma. They may be the presenting feature, and are an important cause of morbidity and mortality in myeloma. Chest infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae does occur, but infections with a wide variety of other gram-positive and gram-negative organisms are more common and involve virtually any part of the body. This predisposition to infection is multifactorial in nature. There are usually subnormal levels of normal immunoglobulins, and suppression of the normal antibody response, in particular the primary response. Neutrophils may function suboptimally, and their concentration in the blood is frequently depressed by interference with hemopoiesis due to marrow infiltration by myeloma, by cytotoxic chemotherapy, and even by the occasional development of myelodysplastic disorders later in the course of the illness.</p>
                        <h4>Amyloidosis</h4>
                        <p>Amyloidosis develops in up to 10% of patients. The distribution of the amyloid follows that of primary amyloid disease, in skin, heart, skeletal muscle, tongue, and gastrointestinal tract. Kidneys, liver, and spleen may also be involved. Renal involvement may lead to the nephrotic syndrome. The carpal tunnel syndrome is an occasional complication. The evidence that immunoglobulin light chains are the major protein component of amyloid fibrils in myeloma has been proven.</p>
                        <h4>Visceral Involvement</h4>
                        <p>Infiltration of the liver, spleen, lymph nodes, and other organs is commonly found at post-mortem, but rarely causes major clinical problems. The spleen and lymph nodes are occasionally palpable, especially in cases of plasma cell leukemia. Moderate enlargement of the liver is more common.</p>
                        <h4>Cryoglobulinemia</h4>
                        <p>Five percent of myeloma proteins are cryoglobulins which reversibly gel in the cold and cause symptoms of cold intolerance. Cryoglobulinemia may precede the development of overt myeloma by several years.</p>
                        <h4>Clinical Features in Relation to Immunoglobulin Class</h4>
                        <p>The different immunochemical classes of myeloma have a tendency to have certain characteristic clinical features. IgG myeloma is associated with a higher level of paraprotein, a greater reduction of normal immunoglobulin levels, and more frequent infections than other types. Amyloidosis and hypercalcemia are less frequent. IgA myeloma is often complicated by hypercalcemia, and heavy Bence-Jones proteinuria is usual. Amyloidosis is not uncommon, but infection is less frequent. IgD myeloma is reputed to occur more commonly in younger patients, and hypercalcemia and renal failure are frequent. Heavy Bence-Jones proteinuria is usual. Amyloidosis and extraosseous tumor may occur. Bence-Jones myeloma also occurs in a slightly younger age group, and is particularly characterized by osteolytic lesions, hypercalcemia, renal failure, and amyloidosis.</p>

                        <h3>BLOOD PICTURE</h3>
                        <p>The blood picture in myeloma is not diagnostic. Nevertheless, the diagnosis is often suggested by the presence of certain features-marked red-cell rouleaux formation. The presence of atypical plasma cells, an abnormally blue-stained background in the blood film, and a greatly increased ESR.</p>
                        <p>Anemia is often present at diagnosis, or it develops during the course of the disease. The anemia is usually normochromic and normocytic in nature. A dilutional effect of the expanded plasma volume in patients with high concentrations of paraprotein contributes to the lowering of the hemoglobin concentration. Depression of erythropoiesis due to infiltration of the bone marrow, and the effects of cytotoxic chemotherapy are additional important factors. Other factors that can cause or contribute to anemia are renal failure, chronic infection, bleeding, and development of myelodysplastic or leukemic disorders.</p>
                        <p>The white cell count may be normal, raised, or moderately reduced, but moderate leukopenia is the most common, especially in advanced disease and in association with cytotoxic therapy. A leukoerythroblastic picture with the appearance of immature red cells and granulocytes develops in about 10% of patients. Small numbers of myeloma cells appear in the blood in about 20% of patients. Rarely, they appear in large numbers, when the condition is referred to as plasma cell leukemia. The platelet count is often reduced in myeloma.</p>
                        <p>The ESR is very often raised. Values frequently exceed 100 mm/hour and sometimes 150 mm/hour. However, the ESR can be normal or raised by only a moderate degree in those patients with Bence-Jones myeloma, in whom a paraprotein is absent from the blood. Blood grouping and cross-matching may be difficult because of red-cell rouleaux formation.</p>

                        <h3>BONE MARROW (Fig. 13.3)</h3>
                        <p>Bone marrow aspiration and trephine biopsy establish the diagnosis in most cases. Usually, infiltration with myeloma cells is diffuse, so that aspiration at any of the usual sites yields typical cells, but occasionally the lesions are focal, with areas of normal marrow between the tumor masses. In such cases, if the needle enters normal marrow the myeloma cells will be missed. Sometimes, diagnostic foci of myeloma cells are present in a trephine biopsy of bone marrow adjacent to a region from which the aspirate is not diagnostic. Biopsy of a radiologically abnormal or tender site is usually diagnostic, although sometimes a dry or blood tap is obtained when the aspiration needle enters a mass of myeloma tissue. If the overall features are suggestive of myeloma, a biopsy should be performed at an alternative site if the initial biopsy appearance is within normal limits.</p>
                        <p>The bone marrow fragments are usually hypercellular, and the cell trails usually contain myeloma cells. These cells commonly constitute 15-30% of the differential count, but higher percentages may occur. Myeloma cells vary in appearance from small, mature, differentiated cells resembling typical plasma cells, to large, immature, undifferentiated cells of 20-30 $\mu$m diameter. Many cells have intermediate characteristics. The cytoplasm of the mature cells is basophilic, sometimes with a perinuclear halo. The nucleus is commonly eccentric, and the chromatin is arranged in coarse strands, although it seldom shows the typical cartwheel arrangements which may be seen in the classical plasma cell. The cytoplasm of the more immature cells is abundant, light blue, and may show a perinuclear halo, vacuolation, and Russell bodies; the nucleus is more vesicular, with finer and evenly distributed chromatin. Nucleoli are common in the immature cells. Multinucleated cells are common, and mitoses are sometimes seen.</p>
                        <p>At postmortem in advanced disease, the marrow commonly has a grey gelatinous appearance, often with hemorrhage, and there is erosion and destruction of cortical bone.</p>

                        <p>Increased proportions of plasma cell are present in the bone marrow in some other disorders. These include aplastic anemia, rheumatoid arthritis, hepatic cirrhosis, sarcoidosis, secondary carcinoma, systemic lupus erythematosus, and chronic inflammation. However, the plasma cells are usually mature and are seldom present in excess of 10%. In most cases, the diagnosis is obvious from the clinical and laboratory features. Occasionally, differentiation is more difficult, and diagnosis based on the appearance of individual plasma cells present in small numbers may not be reliable.</p>
                        <h3>BLOOD CHEMISTRY</h3>
                        <p>Total serum protein concentration is often increased due to the presence of paraprotein. However, a reduction in albumin concentration is common and tends to offset the effect of the increased amount of paraprotein. Total serum protein commonly ranges from 70-120 g/L, but may be higher.</p>
                        <p>The paraprotein usually appears as a single narrow homogeneous M-band on the serum electrophoretogram. Very rarely, there are two bands. Commonly, the concentration of normal $\gamma$-globulin is moderately to profoundly reduced. The position of the band on the strip varies from case to case. It is usually in the $\gamma$-globulin region, but occasionally is in the $\beta$-globulin region. An obvious paraprotein band is not evident in Bence-Jones myeloma or non-secretory myeloma, which make up 20-30% of all myelomas. In these instances, the serum protein electrophoretogram is normal or shows a reduction in $\gamma$-globulin.</p>
                        <p>Immunoelectrophoresis shows that the paraprotein is IgG in about 50% of cases, IgA in 25%, and IgD in 1%. From 50 to 70% of these patients have Bence-Jones proteinuria when tested for by sensitive techiques.</p>
                        <p>In the patients in whom there is no obvious M-band on the serum protein electrophoretic strip, Bence-Jones proteinuria is nearly always present, and free light chains can usually be identified in the serum by immunoelectrophoresis. These cases are referred to as Bence-Jones myeloma. In rare instances, in spite of clear-cut clinical and morphological evidence of myeloma, paraproteins or paraprotein fragments are not found in either serum or urine in the so-called nonsecretory myelomas. Other very rare types of myeloma are those associated with IgM and IgE paraproteins.</p>
                        <p>The serum calcium concentration is often raised. The concentration of phosphate is normal but rises when renal insufficiency develops. Serum alkaline phosphatase is normal or slightly raised, a point of importance in differentiation from hyperparathyroidism and secondary carcinoma of bone, in which significant elevation is usual. The serum uric acid concentration is often raised, even in the absence of renal insufficiency.</p>
                        <p>The plasma volume and serum viscosity are elevated in about 80% of patients. Viscosity does not usually reach a level sufficient to cause symptoms of the hyperviscosity syndrome, but hyperviscosity can occur in occasional cases of IgA myeloma and IgG myeloma of IgG1 and IgG3 subclasses.</p>
                        <h3>URINE</h3>
                        <p>Free monoclonal $\kappa$ or $\lambda$ light chains appear in the urine as Bence-Jones protein, and their detection is one of the bases of the diagnosis of myeloma. Bence-Jones protein was originally described in terms of its unique behavior on heating. Urine containing Bence-Jones protein flocculates when heated slowly to 50-60°C. The flocculated protein dissolves on boiling, and reappears on cooling below 60°C. Unfortunately, heat test is unreliable, especially with low concentrations of Bence-Jones protein. The most reliable means for the detection of Bence-Jones protein is electrophoresis of a concentrated urine specimen on cellulose acetate. The monoclonal light chains usually migrate as a narrow band in the globulin region.</p>
                        <p>Electrophoretic methods detect Bence-Jones protein in the concentrated urine of 50-70% of myeloma patients with a serum paraprotein, and in nearly all patients who do not have a serum paraprotein.</p>
                        <p>More sensitive immunological techniques detect small amounts of free light chains in most normal urines, but these are polyclonal rather than monoclonal, and show broad electrophoretic mobility on electrophoresis. True Bence-Jones proteinuria is practically pathognomonic of myeloma, although it may occasionally occur in macroglobulinemia, amyloidosis, lymphoma, and leukemia.</p>
                        <h3>BONE X-RAY</h3>
                        <p>Bone X-ray changes occur in about 90% of patients at some stage in the course of the illness. Thus absence of bone change does not exclude myeloma. Bone changes consist of either diffuse decalcification or localized areas of bone destruction, or a combination of the two. The localized osteolytic lesions usually appear as multiple, rounded, discrete, punched-out areas with no sclerosis at the margin. They occur most frequently in bones normally containing red marrow, and are especially common in the skull. Diffuse osteoporosis is especially common in the spine, where wedge-shaped compression fractures are frequent.</p>

                        <ol type="a">
                            <li>In about 28% cases monoclonal protein occurs in serum and/or urine. Incidence of serum paraprotein IgG 66%, IgA 33%, IgM or IgD 1%<br>The normal serum immunoglobulins are depressed. The Bence-Jones proteins found in urine are free light chains, either kappa or lambda, of the same type as serum paraprotein.</li>
                            <li>The bone marrow shows more than 10% plasma cells and often with abnormal'myeloma' cells. A 60% of patients have osteolytic areas. A 20% show generalized bone rarefaction or osteoporosis which may cause pathological fractures. A 20% patients show no such lesions.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Most often two of the three diagnostic features stated above are present. Given below are definitive diagnostic criteria.</p>
                        <h4>Criteria for the Diagnosis of Multiple Myeloma</h4>
                        <p>In order to qualify for the diagnosis of multiple myeloma a patient must satisfy one of the following combinations of criteria: la, and lb, la or lb and either 2a, 2b, 2c, or 2d.</p>
                        <p><strong>1. Cytologic criteria</strong></p>

                        </ol>
                        <h4>Other Laboratory Findings</h4>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Normochromic, normocytic anemia is usual. Marked rouleaux formation is seen. Neutropenia, thrombocytopenia seen in advanced cases. There may be myeloma cell spillover in the peripheral blood or there may be (very rare) plasma cell leukemia. Leukoerythroblastic changes (immature cells of both myeloid and erythroid series in the peripheral blood) are occasionally found.</li>
                            <li>About half the cases have raised serum calcium levels. Serum alkaline phosphatase rises secondarily to pathologic fractures.</li>
                            <li>ESR is markedly raised.</li>
                            <li>Renal damage leads to raised blood urea and serum creatinine levels.</li>

                                    <li>Hemoglobin value >10 mg/dL</li>

                            <li><strong>Stage III:</strong> One or more of the following:
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Hemoglobin value <8.5 mg/dL</li>

                        </ul>
                        <h4>Subclassification</h4>
                        <p><strong>A</strong> = Relatively normal renal function (Serum creatinine <2.0 mg%)<br>
                        <strong>B</strong> = Abnormal renal function (Serum creatinine value >2.0 mg%).</p>
                        <p><strong>Example:</strong> Stage I A = low cell mass with normal renal function; Stage II B = high cell mass with abnormal renal function.</p>
                        <h3>Management</h3>
                        <p>Active therapeutic measures are warranted in progressive disease, and although treatment almost invariably does not eradicate myeloma, it can often suppress disease activity for many years and result in meaningful prolongation of life and relief of symptoms.</p>
                        <h4>Symptomatic Measures</h4>
                        <p>Some patients become very ill at some stage during the course of the illness because of hypercalcemia. Treatment by rehydration with intravenous fluids is particularly important, and often results in improvement of the reversible element of renal impairment produced by the hypercalcemia. Depression of the excessive plasma calcium concentration can be promoted by increasing the urinary excretion of calcium with certain diuretics such as frusemide, although other diuretics such as thiazides can have the opposite effect. Corticosteroids are particularly useful in suppressing the underlying osteolytic process, and doses of 50-100 mg prednisone or prednisolone daily often produce normal plasma calcium concentrations. The most important measure in obtaining sustained control of the hypercalcemia is suppression of the myelomatous process by chemotherapy.</p>
                        <p>Anemia may require correction by transfusion with packed red cells. Administration of oxymetholone has been shown in some studies to increase the level of hemoglobin.</p>
                        <p>Hyperviscosity can be corrected by plasmapheresis if this complication is causing clinical problems. Because circulating red blood cells contribute to blood viscosity, it is especially important to consider correction of hyperviscosity before blood transfusion, or to perform plasmapheresis during the transfusion.</p>
                        <p>Local pain, especially in bone, is a very common and serious problem in myeloma. Myeloma tissue is generally sensitive to radiotherapy, and as localized areas of bone pain are usually due to local infiltration, radiotherapy is often very helpful in producing a gradual reduction in pain and arresting the progression of the disorder in the irradiated area.</p>
                        <p>Nervous system compression is a relatively common problem, and localized compression effects by myeloma tissue may be reversed by radiotherapy, or by laminectomy where there is an urgent need to reduce pressure on the spinal cord.</p>
                        <h4>Chemotherapy</h4>
                        <p>Three agents have been used extensively in view of their ability to reverse the progression of myeloma when administered by the oral route, either singly or in combination. The most commonly employed drug is the alkylating agent melphalan (L-phenylalanine mustard). It can be administered continuously in a dose of 1-3 mg/day, but is more commonly given intermittently in a dose of 9 mg/m²/day for 4 days every 4-6 weeks. Melphalan is myelotoxic, and as its absorption is variable the dosage must be adjusted either up or down according to the degree of myelosuppression indicated by serial monitoring of the blood count. Evidence that the proportion of patients who undergo an objective response is almost doubled by concurrent administration of corticosteroid (e.g. prednisone 100 mg/m²/day for 4 days).</p>
                        <p>Cyclophosphamide is about as effective in producing an objective response as melphalan. It does, however, tend to produce alopecia and chemical cystitis, but it can be effective in myeloma that is unresponsive to melphalan. It can be administered continuously in a dose of 1-3 mg/kg/day or intermittently in doses of 1000 mg/m² every 3 weeks.</p>
                        <p>High doses of corticosteroids such as prednisone or prednisolone 60 mg/m²/day for 5 days, administered every 8th day for 3 courses, can produce objective responses as single-agent therapy, even in myeloma refractory to other drug treatment. Combinations including other agents are also employed. Additional drugs that are effective against myeloma include vincristine, Adriamycin, BCNU, CCNU and procarbazine. Most combinations include one or more of these drugs with corticosteroids plus melphalan and/or cyclophosphamide, and while they represent a more intensive chemotherapeutic attack on the disease they have yet to be unequivocally proven to produce a substantial increase in median survival over that obtained with melphalan and prednisolone. Interferon shows some promise in the treatment of myeloma.</p>
                        <h4>Radiotherapy</h4>
                        <p>Intensive radiotherapy may eradicate localized extraosseous plasmacytomas, but the usual wide-spread infiltration of the bone marrow in myeloma makes it difficult to utilize radiotherapy for treatment of the overall disease process.</p>
                        <h4>Response and Prognosis</h4>
                        <p>The eventual outcome in an individual patient with myeloma is profoundly influenced by a number of factors. There is an overall longer median survival in patients with stage I than stage III disease from the time of institution of chemotherapy. This, however, may reflect the earlier stage of progression of the disease process and the lack of osseous, hematological, and renal complications in stage I patients. Significant irreversible renal impairment is in particular associated with a poor prognosis. A dominant prognostic factor is the nature of the response to chemotherapy. Patients who obtain a very good response have a substantially longer median survival than those who are refractory to treatment. Objective responses to current treatment regimens occur in 50-70% of patients, and a considerable proportion of the responders live for many years longer than the median survival of about 18 months in untreated disease.</p>
                        <p>Although the extent of the tumor burden bears an inverse relation to survival, the outcome is nonetheless influenced by the rate of progression of the myelomatous process. In some untreated subjects in whom the parameters of the disease satisfy the diagnostic criteria of myeloma, the disorder may progress very slowly and exhibit a plateau-like phase of activity. Under such conditions, chemotherapy offers no significant benefit. Plateau-phase behavior is commonly observed after an objective response is achieved with chemotherapy, where the condition remains basically in a static, non-progressive state in the absence of further chemotherapy for up to many years.</p>
                        <p>The plateau phase of the disease is almost always terminated by recommencement of actively progressive myeloma. Such a development is associated with a poor prognosis when the patient is currently receiving chemotherapy, but further objective responses, even with the initially successful chemotherapeutic regimen, are relatively frequently attained when the patient has not been receiving chemotherapy during the plateau-phase. It has been argued that median survival is not increased by continuation of chemotherapy during the established plateau phase in myeloma. The generally accepted approach is that administration of chemotherapy is required in either previously untreated or previously responsive disease when the disorder is undergoing active progression.</p>
                        <p>Progressive disease may be obvious from clinical manifestations such as worsening, osteolysis or marrow depression, but useful laboratory indices of progressive disease are progressive elevation of serum $\beta$₂ microglobulin and increasing levels of paraprotein in serum or urine.</p>
                        <p>Currently available chemotherapeutic regimes tend to reduce the bulk myeloma tissue and may substantially prolong life, but virtually never eliminate the disorder. Death from myeloma usually occurs from complications of progressive disease unresponsive to treatment, either at presentation or after recurrence of activity following an initial objective response. Common terminal events include complications of pancytopenia and immunosuppression, such as infection or hemorrhage, and complication of renal failure. An emerging, but less common, cause of death is the sequelae of myelodysplastic or acute leukemic disorder, which appear to be largely secondary to exposure to the alkylating agents used in the treatment of myeloma.</p>

                        </ul>
                        <h3>HEAVY CHAIN DISEASES (HCD)</h3>
                        <p>Malignant immunocytomas are characterized by excess amounts of heavy chains of a single class unattached to light chains. Three types corresponding to the three major immunoglobulins have been recognized:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Ig G ($\gamma$-HCD)</li>
                            <li>Ig A ($\alpha$-HCD)</li>
                            <li>Ig M ($\mu$-HCD)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>These are very rarely seen and diagnosed with difficulty.</p>
                        <h3>BENIGN MONOCLONAL GAMMOPATHY (BENIGN PARAPROTEINEMIA)</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>No malignant disorders are associated with them</li>
                            <li>Prevalence rate is about 1% at the age of 50 years, increasing with advancing age.</li>
                            <li>The majority of paraproteins are IgG, but there may be Ig A or Ig M. (with time the benign or malignant nature of the disorder can be ascertained, however, Bence-Jones proteinuria, subnormal levels of normal serum immunoglobulins, a paraprotein level in excess of 10 g/L and a progressive rise in its level point towards the diagnosis of malignant monoclonal gammopathy).</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3>AMYLOIDOSIS</h3>
                        <p>Paraproteins are found in urine and/or serum in nearly 90% of patients of primary amyloidosis. Such patients have no evidences of myeloma or macroglobulinemia. although organ distribution of amyloid resembles that of myeloma associated amyloidosis.</p>
                        <h3>MALIGNANT LYMPHOMA AND CHRONIC LYMPHOCYTIC LEUKEMIA</h3>
                        <p>The incidence varies from 5 to 10% of cases. This increased incidence is confined to diffuse lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, the paraprotein being Ig M more frequently than IgG or IgA. Bence-Jones proteinuria may be detected in some patients. The incidence of paraproteins is not increased in Hodgkin's disease or nodular lymphoma.</p>
                        <h3>MISCELLANEOUS DISORDERS</h3>
                        <p>Paraproteins are occasionally identified in the sera of patients with:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Hepatic cirrhosis</li>
                            <li>Chronic infective illness</li>

                            <li>Perform immunoelectrophoresis to document the nature of the paraprotein.</li>
                        </ol>

                            <li>A bone marrow aspirate and biopsy will determine whether increased levels of lymphocytes, or plasma cells are present.</li>
                            <li>Perform a skeletal survey to determine whether the proliferating cells are focally aggregated or whether their activity is associated with bone lysis.

                        </ol>
                        <h4>Establish the Presence of an Entire or Partial Protein (Immunoglobulin) and the Activity of the Protein</h4>

                            <li>Tests for Bence-Jones proteinuria (urine light chains)</li>
                            <li>Perform quantitative analysis of total immunoglobulins by radial immunodiffusion as well as quantitative analysis by immunoelectrophoresis.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <h4>Establish the Degree of Organ Involvement</h4>
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li>Assess renal function (BUN, creatinine)</li>
