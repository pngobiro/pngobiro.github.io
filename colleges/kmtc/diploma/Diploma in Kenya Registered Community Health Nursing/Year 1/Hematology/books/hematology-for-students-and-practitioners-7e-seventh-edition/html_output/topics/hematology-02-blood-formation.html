                        <p>Blood is a mesenchymal tissue and its components are:</p>

                        <p>In a normal healthy person there is a constant breakdown and fresh formation of various blood elements. However, minor daily physiological fluctuations do occur.</p>
                        <p>The erythrocytes transport the respiratory gases, oxygen and carbon dioxide, granulocytes and monocytes (leukocytes) are cells that can get out of the blood vessels and migrate among the cells of many tissues. These cells are important in inflammation and phagocytosis. Platelets are tiny, anucleate cells that contain molecules required for hemostasis, they also provide hemostasis through their ability to adhere, aggregate and provide a surface for coagulation reactions. Lymphocytes mediate highly specific immunity against microorganisms and other foreign particles/molecules. B lymphocytes confer immunity through production of specific soluble antibodies, whereas T lymphocytes direct a large variety of immunity functions, including killing of cells that bear foreign molecules on their surface membranes. Inspite of such vast structural and functional differences, these cells are thought to be originating from a single type of cell. The process is termed as hematopoiesis. These processes of hematopoiesis include self renewal of stem cells, commitment of most progeny of stem cells to differentiate ultimately into a particular cell type, proliferation of the progenitor cells, and their differentiation along a pathway leading to a particular kind of mature blood cell. Absolutely essential for the process to continue, is the maintenance of a local environment conducive to survival of at least same portion of the cell lineage, production of necessary protein survival factors or growth factors.</p>

                        <p>During embryogenesis blood production sites change several times. Nucleated RBCs first appear in "blood islands" in the yolk sac (yolk sac hematopoiesis is dominant till 8 weeks of gestation). The yolk sac-derived RBCs do not lose their nuclei during maturation and they contain hemoglobin molecules of α and β chains. As soon as liver is organized, it becomes the major hematopoietic organ of the fetus during mid-gestation; the spleen also to a minor extent participates in the process. The RBCs produced by these organs are anucleate and the hemoglobin consists of α and fetal type β chains. Eventually, the bone marrow takes over the process (and, it stays the exclusive post-natal site of hematopoiesis). During late fetal development RBCs begin to be produced that contain the adult type β chains.</p>

                        <h3>Normal Sites</h3>

                            <li><strong>After 3 months</strong>—hematopoiesis starts in bone marrow.</li>
                            <li><strong>Full term infant:</strong> Bone marrow is the only site for production of granulocytes, red blood cells and platelets. Production of lymphocytes and monocytes occurs mainly in the spleen. Lymph nodes and other lymphoid tissue, though liver and bone marrow produce these in much lesser number.</li>
                            <li><strong>After birth:</strong> Same as above except that the monocytes are provided by, the bone marrow; spleen and lymphoid tissues contribute minimally.</li>

                        <p>With increasing age, peripheral skeleton produces less blood cells and the function is taken over by axial skeleton mainly. After the age of 4 years fat cells begin to appear in the long bones. Around age of 18 years, hematopoietic marrow is found in the sternum, ribs, pelvis, vertebrae and skull.</p>

                        <h3>Abnormal Sites</h3>
                        <p>Extramedullary hematopoiesis (myeloid metaplasia): In certain disorders the fetal hemopoietic organs revert to their old function supported by the reticulum cell which retains its potential hemopoietic activity. This occurs when bone marrow cannot fulfil the requirements or demand imposed upon it any further.</p>
                        <p>The spleen and liver are the most commonly encountered sites, but hematopoiesis in lymph nodes, and less commonly, adrenal glands, cartilage, broad ligament, thrombi, adipose tissue, intrathoracic areas, kidneys and endosteum also has been recorded. The presence of megakaryocytes in these areas differentiates the process from leukemic infiltrates.</p>

                        <h3>IN AN ADULT</h3>
                        <p>Hematopoiesis occurs in the extravascular part of the red marrow. A single layer of epithelial cells separates the extravascular marrow compartment from the intravascular compartment (venous sinuses). When blood cells produced in the marrow are almost mature and ready to circulate in the peripheral blood, the cells leave the marrow parenchyma by passing through the fenestrations in endothelial cells and emerge into the venous sinuses.</p>
                        <p>The various cell lineages in bone marrow originate from the pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells. The pluripotential stem cell provides a cellular reserve for the stem cells committed to the lymphoid stem cell line for lymphopoiesis and to the nonlymphoid stem cell line for producing the other hematopoietic cells. The nonlymphoid (or myeloid) committed stem cell produces the erythrocytic, granulocytic (neutrophilic, eosinophilic, basophilic), monocytic macrophage, and megakaryocytic-platelet lines. The lymphoid committed stem cell produces lymphocytic and plasmocytic cells. The pluripotential stem cells are not as such identifiable in bone marrow smears, but when isolated in cell culture systems they have been observed to be small round cells with fine chromatin, nucleoli, and blue nongranular cytoplasm (akin to an early lymphoid cell).</p>
                        <p>Most of the knowledge gained as regards hematopoiesis has been derived from nonhuman mammalian experimental models, e.g. mice. The hematopoietic stem cell has been defined as a colony forming unit (CFU). In a classic experiment, Till and McCullock irradiated mice and then injected suspensions of marrow cells intravenously. About 10 days later, nodules of injected marrow could be observed on the surface of the spleen and in microscopic study of the splenic tissue. These nodules were named "spleen colonies," and the progenitor cells that formed these colonies were called colony-forming unit-spleen (CFU-S).</p>
                        <p>Under the influence of the splenic microenvironment, an injected stem cell from a suspension of marrow cells proliferates and differentiates into a larger colony. Enumeration of the colonies allows for an indirect method of quantitation of the number of injected CFU-S. Each colony is derived from a single stem cell. Proof of the clonality of the nodules is substantiated by using cells with chromosome markers induced by radiation when 95% or more of the metaphases in the colonies are observed. In addition, if a colony is removed cautiously from the spleen two weeks after injection and a suspension of cells is made and injected into irradiated mice, numerous colonies are observed. Such evidence demonstrates the self-renewing capacity of CFU-S in the colonies.</p>
                        <p>Spleen colonies observed at first were primarily composed of erythroid cells with a few megakaryocytes and granulocytes, but later the colonies were noted to be mixtures of these cell times. Thus, the committed myeloid (pertaining to marrow) stem cell (CFU-S) is considered to be multipotent and to give rise to granulocytes, erythrocytes, monocytes, and megakaryocytes. Hence, the term CFU GEMM (granulocytic, erythrocytic, myelocytic, monocytic) has been suggested and may be substituted for "CFU-S" (Fig. 2.2).</p>
                        <p>In vitro culture methods now provide another assay system for hematopoietic stem cells. Progenitor stem cells (CFU-S) have been identified by their activity to form large in vitro colonies on semisolid culture media which contains growth factor or colony stimulating factor (CSF) for sustained grwoth. CSF consists of cell extracts from monocytes, macrophages, endothelial cells, fat cells, and other cellular elements. In the presence of CSF, colonies of granulocytes and monocytes are formed in 7-10 days. These colonies of granulocytes and monocytes have been named CFU-C (C for culture) or CFU<sub>GM</sub> (GM for granulocytes and monocytes), indicating that they are committed to the production of granulocytic and monocytic cells. Other more mature and specialized precursors include CFU<sub>Eo</sub> (eosinophils), CFU<sub>Ba</sub> (basophils). CFU<sub>E</sub> (erythroid), and CFU<sub>Meg</sub> (megakaryocytes). BFU<sub>E</sub> (burst-forming unit, erythroid) refers to an earlier erythroid progenitor than the CFU<sub>E</sub>.</p>

                        <p>Mature RBCs are derived from committed erythroid progenitor cells through a series of mitotic divisions and maturation phases. Erythropoietin, a humoral agent produced mainly by the kidney, stimulates erythropoiesis by acting on stem cells to induce proliferation and differentiation of erythrocytes. Tissue hypoxia is the main stimulus for the production of erythropoietin by the kidneys.</p>
                        <p>The in vitro systems devised for assay of CFU-S defined two classes of erythroid stem cells. The committed myeloid stem cell CFU<sub>GEMM</sub> differentiates into a primitive erythroid cell called burst-forming unit erythroid (BFU<sub>E</sub>) which requires large amounts of erythropoietin and long culture times to form large erythroid colonies (or "bursts"). The BFU<sub>E</sub> differentiates into an erythroid stem cell called colony-forming unit-erythroid (CFU<sub>E</sub>) which gives rise to tiny erythroid colonies and needs low levels of erythropoietin and short culture times.</p>

                        <h3>Erythron Concept</h3>
                        <p>Blood cells markedly differ from rest of the body cells both in structure and function. With respect to erythrocytes, it is useful to conceive of the precursors and mature cells as components of a single, though discontinuous organ known as the erythron. This concept emphasizes the functional unity of the red blood corpuscles and their precursors. The insterstitial tissue of the erythron comprise the plasma and the fat and reticulum of the bone marrow.</p>
                        <p>Erythropoiesis occurs in the marrow over a period of four to five days through successive morphologic alterations in the nucleated cells from pronormoblast to the anucleate mature RBC.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Erythroblast is a nucleated red cell.</li>
                            <li>Normoblast implies normal (reaction) erythropoiesis.</li>
                            <li>Megaloblast implies megaloblastic (reaction) erythropoiesis.</li>
                            <li>Normoblastic maturation involves:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Reduction in cell size</li>
                                    <li>Ripening of cytoplasm, i.e. hemoglobinization.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>Maturation time from pronormoblast to RBC is 7 days.</li>
                            <li>Mitotic division occurs till the intermediate normoblast stage. 14-16 erythrocytes are produced from one pronormoblast. 10-15% of nucleated red cells die in marrow maturation.</li>
                            <li>The basophilic (bluish) cytoplasm in erythrocytic precursors is due to presence of ribosomes joined together (2-8) by a strand of messenger RNA called ribosomal RNA.</li>
                            <li>Ultrastructural (electron microscopy) differentiation from other early precursors is made by the presence of ferritin in the normoblasts.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The amount of "reticulum" decreases as the cells mature. Reticulocytes are more adhesive than adult RBCs and move about in currents at much slower rate than do mature cells. They appear to have a coating of globulin, at least part of which is transferrin. Their specific gravity is lower than that of adult RBCs, and they tend to collect in the upper portions of suspensions of corpuscles. They vary in resistance to hypotonic solutions. They have metabolic pathways that are lacking in mature red cells, including an intact tricarboxylic acid cycle.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Erythron: Proliferation and Maturation</h3>
                        <p>Within the erythron, cellular maturation and proliferation proceed simultaneously. All identifiable erythroid progenitors and morphologically identifiable erythroid precursors are functionally destined to mature; thus they are incapable of self-maintenance. Maintenance of erythron is the function of the stem cell compartment. It takes about 12-15 days for a cell at BFU<sub>E</sub> stage to mature into normoblasts, 6-8 days for BFU<sub>E</sub> to differentiate into CFU<sub>E</sub>, 5-7 days to reach the early normoblast stage. Probably three to five cell divisions occur along the maturation of erythroid precursors. Thus, 8-32 mature RBCs are derived from each pronormoblast cell division stops at intermediate normoblast stage, late normoblasts cannot synthesize DNA and, therefore, cannot divide. BFU<sub>E</sub> is totally interleukin 3 (IL-3) dependent and bears a small numbers of EPO (erythropoietin) receptors. Within 72 hours in culture, these cells become fully dependent on EPO (mature BFU<sub>E</sub>) and in their presence proliferate and differentiate into CFU<sub>E</sub>. At this stage EPO induces an increase in the synthesis of RNA, closely followed by the induction of β-globin gene transcription. Other biochemical events include increased uptake of calcium and glucose, synthesis of transferrin receptors, increased iron uptake hemoglobin synthesis, and appearance of erythrocyte membrane proteins. Hemoglobin synthesis continues as the cell matures further into the early normoblast stage, and at the intermediate normoblast stage enough hemoglobin has accumulated in the cytoplasm to give the cell the mild acidophilic reaction as detected by routine Romanowsky stains. Hemoglobin synthesis continues throughout the late normoblast stage and persists at a very low rate in the reticulocyte after denucleation. Mature red cells, lacking ribosomes; cannot synthesise hemoglobin.</p>
                        <p>One can observe morphologic evidence of nuclear degeneration as early as normoblast stage, by late normoblast stage nucleus becomes completely inactive, unable to synthesize either DNA or RNA. It is thought that intracellular hemoglobin brings about this cessation of nuclear activity, it gains access to the nucleus through pores in the nuclear membrane. After reaching a critical concentration, the nuclear hemoglobin may react with nucleohistones, thereby bringing about nuclear inactivation and condensation.</p>
                        <p>After the nucleus degenerates, it is extruded from the cell. The process takes about 5-60 minutes. The extruded nucleus carries with it a rim of cytoplasm, including ribosomes, hemoglobin and occasional mitochondria.</p>
                        <p>Enucleation is a process akin to cytokinesis and does not seem to depend upon either the presence of extracellular matrix proteins or accessory cells. It is also thought that the late normoblast cytoplasm and the organelles manage to squeeze through the endothelial cytoplasmic pores but the nucleus being more rigid gets caught and thus gets enucleated while rest of the cell now a reticulocyte passes through. Soon after denucleation, the nucleus is engulfed by a macrophage. This cell may remain in marrow for several days as a reticulocyte. After release the reticulocyte must be sequestered in the spleen for 1-2 days. Here additional maturation may occur, and the composition of the membrane lipids may be altered. As the reticulocyte matures to an adult erythrocyte, it loses its ability to synthesis hemoglobin. Both particulate and soluble RNA fractions are catabolised by a ribonuclease. Thus, a mature RBC is formed.</p>

                        <h3>Erythroid Precursors</h3>
                        <p>The least mature, recognisable erythrocyte precursor cell is known as pronormoblast or proerythroblast. The various stages of maturation in order of increasing maturity, are known as pronormoblast, early normoblast or basophilic normoblast, intermediate normoblast or orthochromatic normoblast. Ordinary Romanowsky dyes can differentiate each cell stage with light microscopy.</p>
                        <p>Cytoplasmic maturation can be assessed by the change in staining characteristics, as the deep blue color from the high RNA content of immature cells gives way to the red color characteristic of hemoglobin. Nuclear maturation is evaluated by disappearance of nucleoli and the condensation of chromatin as nuclear activity ceases.</p>
                        <p>The cytoplasm shows ribosomes which remain free in the cytoplasm as polyribosomes; these consist of eight individual ribosomes joined together by a strand of messenger RNA. Ribosomal RNA accounts for the deep blue staining that is characteristic to younger cells (pronormoblast to intermediate normoblast). Mitochondria are most numerous in earlier stages of maturation. Ferritin containing vesicles are found in the cytoplasm, these are thought to arise by pinocytosis, whereby macromolecular substances are brought into the cytoplasm. Other cytoplasmic structures include Golgi apparatus and randomly oriented occasional microtubules (Fig. 2.6).</p>
