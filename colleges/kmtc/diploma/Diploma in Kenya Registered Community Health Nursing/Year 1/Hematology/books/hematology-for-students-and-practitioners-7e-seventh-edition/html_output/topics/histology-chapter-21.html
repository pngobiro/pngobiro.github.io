                        <p>The main types are primary and secondary immunodeficiency diseases (Table 21.1). In severe combined immunodeficiency disease (SCID), the T- and B-lymphocyte systems fail to develop. There is severe lymphopenia and hypogammaglobulinemia. Affected infants fail to thrive and die early in life from recurrent infections, such as by Pneumocystis carinii cytomegalovirus, other viruses, fungi, and bacteria. There is atrophy of the thymus: the lymph nodes and spleen are small and devoid of lymphoid cells. The most common cause is deficiency of enzyme adenosine deaminase (ADA). Deficiency of another enzyme, purine nucleoside phosphorylase, causes a more selective lack of T cells. ADA deficiency has been treated successfully by bone marrow transplantation and, most recently by 'gene therapy'-in which the ADA gene has been introduced in vitro into the patient's lymphocytes which have been reinfused.</p>
                        <p>In the very rare syndrome of lymphoreticular dysgenesis, there is failure of development of both the reticuloendothelial and lymphoid systems. Affected infants die soon after birth from overwhelming infection. There is marked lymphopenia, and stigmata of splenic atrophy may be found in the peripheral blood which shows large numbers of Howell-Jolly bodies in RBCs.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>This syndrome is caused by infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), a retrovirus of the lentivirus subgroup.</p>
                        <p>HIV produces its predominant effects through infection of T-helper (CD4+) cells. Some CD4⁺ cells are lyzed directly by replicating HIV, but the virus remains latent in most host cells, unrecognized by the patient's immune system. When such latently infected T cells are activated, virus replicates and cell necrosis follows. The CD4 antigen appears to be the main receptor for HIV, and CD4 antigen-presenting cells are also an important site for viral replication. Direct infection by the virus of other cells, for example brain cells, also accounts for some of the pathology of the disease.</p>
                        <p>Transmission of the virus is usually by sexual contact, or by blood or blood products. AIDS is particularly common in homosexual men but is now widely seen in heterosexuals too. It is also seen in intravenous drug abusers, hemophiliacs and other patients requiring multiple blood transfusions, or people receiving other human blood derived products (made from HIV infected blood).</p>
                        <p>The clinical outcome of infection has been classified into four stages or groups. The factors which determine the progression from one stage to another remain uncertain. A prodromal period of about 6 weeks follows initial infection symptoms resembling infectious mononucleosis which may then occur. A proportion of patients pass through the asymptomatic and persistent lymphadenopathy stages to the AIDS related complex (ARC) and fully developed AIDS. The sequence of expression of HIV antigens and different antibodies following primary infection is given in Fig. 21.1.</p>
                        <p>Examination of involved lymph nodes reveals characteristic abnormalities. There is progressive depletion of CD4 cells, and the peripheral blood shows a lymphopenia and an alteration in the T -lymphocyte subsets, with a fall in the CD4⁺ (helper suppressor) ratio from the normal value of 1.5-2.5:1 to < 1: 1. A polyclonal rise in serum immunoglobulins is often found in some cases with a paraprotein present. The diagnosis is confirmed by detection of antibodies to one or other surface antigen, or by detection of the antigens themselves. Hematological abnormalities may include anaemia, neutropenia or thrombocytopenia; these are often autoimmune in origin but are sometimes due to direct infection of hemopoietic stem and progenitor cells in the bone marrow. The cytopenias may be due to dysplastic changes, marrow lymphoma, or fibrosis. A wide spectrum of opportunistic organisms cause infections in AIDS patients, including Pneumocystis carinii, cytomegalovirus, atypical mycobacteria, Cryptococcus, histoplasmosis, and leishmaniasis, often nonspecific granuloma are found. A proportion of patients develop Kaposi's sarcoma, a vascular skin tumor while others may develops non-Hodgkin's, lymphoma, which is likely to be high grade and with a 20% incidence of lymphoma in the central nervous system.</p>

                        <h3>HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS</h3>
                        <p>Since its recognition in 1981, the HIV pandemic has spread unabated across continents. The catastrophic potential of the pandemic may still not have been fully realized as it continues to exact enormous toll throughout the world in both human and economic terms.</p>
                        <p>The demographic characteristics of those affected by the epidemic has changed drastically since the first cases were reported in the year 1981 in the USA comprising overwhelmingly of gay population. Today new cases of HIV infection originate predominantly through heterosexual contacts and injecting drug users. The infection rates amongst women, adolescent girls and children have increased dramatically. It is estimated that a total of 40 million people worldwide are living with HIV / AIDS and at least 5 million people were infected with HIV and at least 3 million people perished due to the disease. Summary for the HIV / AIDS epidemic is shown in Fig. 21.2.</p>

                        <p>The epidemic has negated decades worth of work on controlling diseases, improving nutrition and in many African countries it has become an unprecedented emergency with approximately 25% of the most productive age group between 15 years to 49 years being infected.</p>
                        <p>It is estimated that in sub-Saharan Africa the life expectancy would reduce from average 64 years to 47 years. If the present warning of epidemiologists go unheeded, South Asia, South East Asia and China may follow the disastrous course of sub-Saharan Africa. The battle against AIDS has to be fought on multiple fronts such as education, counseling, prevention of infection, voluntary testing, treatment and vaccination programs.</p>
