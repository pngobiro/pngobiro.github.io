                        <h3>SITES OF PRODUCTION</h3>
                        <p>Development of granulocyte is normally restricted to the bone marrow after birth. The other important components of the myeloid series are the monocytes, which are also produced predominantly in the bone marrow. Monocytes are related to tissue histiocytes, or macrophages, which are present in particular in the spleen, bone marrow, lungs and liver. The process of development of tissue histiocytes is less clearly defined than that of granulocytes and monocytes. Lymphocytes are also produced in bone marrow, and some undergo subsequent modification in other organs, such as the thymus. The majority of lymphocytes are formed outside the bone marrow in lymph nodes, lymphoid collections lining the gastrointestinal tract, and the spleen.</p>
                        
                        <h3>PRODUCTION AND LIFE SPAN OF WHITE BLOOD CELLS</h3>
                        <p>Normally, mature forms of the white cell series overwhelmingly predominate in the blood, while precursors are located at extravascular sites. The period spent by the polymorphonuclear neutrophil in the bloodstream averages less than one day, and these cells do not re-enter the blood after they have passed out into the tissues. Lymphocytes and monocytes, on the other hand, do reenter the bloodstream, and consequently their traffic through the body is more complex than that of the neutrophil.</p>
                        <p>Precursors such as myeloblasts and their progeny, the promyelocytes and myelocytes, undergo cell division, and are accordingly classified as the proliferative compartment of the neutrophil series. Such cell replication increases the number of neutrophil precursors which, after reaching the stage of the metamyelocyte, cease proliferation and undergo a sequential series of changes leading to the formation of the mature segmented neutrophil. The latter events are said to take place in the maturation compartment of the neutrophil series.</p>
                        <p>Segmented and band neutrophils are the only forms which pass in significant numbers into the circulation under normal circumstances. Approximately one-half of these cells are associated sufficiently closely with vessel walls that they are not present in venous blood obtained by venepuncture. The blood neutrophil count therefore represents only about one-half of the total number of neutrophils in the vascular compartment. Intravenous administration of adrenaline causes many of the neutrophils attached to the endothelium to detach and reenter the circulating blood. The increase in neutrophil count under these circumstances is rapid, and provides an index of the extent to which neutrophil count under these circumstances is rapid, and provides an index of the extent to which neutrophils are present in the attached or 'marginated' state. Corticosteroid administration in amounts equivalent to about 50 mg prednisolone results in a more delayed, but more sustained, rise in the blood neutrophil count. This is due to promotion of the exit of neutrophils from the bone marrow, and accounts for the neutrophil leukocytosis, associated with some immature forms in the blood of patients receiving relatively high doses of corticosteroids.</p>
                        <p>It is difficult to be certain of the period encompassed by the process of development of the neutrophil from the myeloblast to the time of its entry into the blood, but a currently accepted approximation is about 12 days. The exit of neutrophils from the circulation occurs randomly, and their half-life in the circulation is only of the order of seven hours. The subsequent period spent in the tissues is also considered to be relatively brief. Neutrophils may degenerate following the interaction with microbes, which have invaded tissue, and can also be lost from the body by migration into the respiratory or gastrointestinal tracts. Migration of eosinophils into the respiratory tract may assume significant proportions in allergic states affecting the bronchial mucosa.</p>
                        <p>The lifespan of lymphocytes is extremely variable, as it is very brief in some lymphocyte subsets, while in other subjects the same cell may recirculate for many years.</p>
                        
                        <h3>METABOLIC AND ENZYMATIC CHARACTERISTICS OF WHITE BLOOD CELLS</h3>
                        <p>Specific biochemical features account for the specialized functions of the various types of leukocytes.</p>
                        <p>The granules in the neutrophil represent packages of enzymes which are involved in the killing of ingested microbes and the digestion of phagocytosed material. There are at least two separate types of granules on the basis of differences in enzyme content. The so-called primary lightly basophilic staining granules contain, for example, peroxidase and acid hydrolytic enzymes while secondary granules contain alkaline phosphatase and certain other enzymes. Peroxidase is a major neutrophil protein which catalyzes the reaction between the hydrogen peroxide generated in the phagocytosing neutrophil and chloride or iodide ions to chlorinate or iodinate ingested microbes. This process is believed to contribute to the microbicidal function of neutrophils, and deficiency of neutrophil peroxidase has been shown to lessen resistance to mycotic and bacterial infection.</p>
                        <p>A profuse rapid uptake of oxygen occurs when neutrophils ingest microbes. The oxygen is reduced by NADPH to generate superoxide radicles (O₂⁻), which are weakly microbicidal in their own right. Superoxide undergoes enzymatic 'dismutation' to hydrogen peroxide, which alone, or in the presence of peroxidase as described above, exerts powerful microbicidal activity. The ingested microbes are enveloped in vacuoles into which microbicidal agents are discharged (Fig. 11.1).</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_09_20_6dc34e0338b37aad296bg-327-1.jpg" alt="A diagram showing the biochemical steps linking the hexose monophosphate shunt and oxygen to the microbicidal activity in neutrophils." class="content-image">
                            <figcaption>Fig. 11.1: Basic biochemical steps linking the hexose monophosphate shunt and molecular oxygen to oxygen-dependent microbicidal activity in the neutrophil</figcaption>
                        </figure>
                        <p>Alkaline phosphatase can be demonstrated by cytochemical staining of neutrophils in blood smears. Neutrophil alkaline phosphatase activity is derived from the intensity of the microscopically identifiable reaction product of the enzyme within neutrophils, and bears no relation to the activity of alkaline phosphatase in serum. The usual procedure is to examine enzyme activity in 100 consecutive neutrophils, employing a score of 0 for absence of reaction product, 1 for pale diffuse coloration or small areas of granular reaction product, 2 for unevenly distributed granules, 3 for uniformly distributed granules, and 4 where the cytoplasm is entirely filled with dark reaction product. There is an element of subjectivity in assessment, and some variation with technique, so reference must always be made to the normal range of the laboratory. A typical normal range is 10-100 per 100 neutrophils.</p>
                        <p>Elevated values occur as responses to infection, inflammation, and tissue necrosis due to infarction or trauma. Administration of corticosteriods and oral contraceptive preparations can cause elevated values, and the level also rises during pregnancy to reach a maximum at the time of labor. Abnormally high values can also be present in myeloproliferative disorders such as polycythemia vera and myelofibrosis. High values may also be seen in aplastic anemia and Down syndrome.</p>
                        <p>Subnormal values are so commonly encountered in chronic myeloid leukemia and paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria that an abnormally low level is of diagnostic significance. Values are occasionally low in other conditions such as infectious mononucleosis, refractory anemias, hypophosphatemia, and autoimmune states, including autoimmune thrombocytopenia.</p>
                        <p>Lysozyme is a hydrolytic enzyme in the granules of neutrophils and monocytes. It splits the muramic acid of bacterial cell walls, and is consequently also referred to as muramidase. Lysozyme does lyse certain gram-positive cocci, but it fails to make a material contribution to bactericidal activity, and evidently is restricted to aiding the digestion of killed organisms, along with other hydrolytic enzymes packaged in cytoplasmic granules. Lysozyme is released into the plasma, where its concentration reflects the mass of lysozyme containing cells of the body. It is catabolized by the kidney, and is consequently retained in the body in renal failure. In subjects with normal renal function, the serum lysozyme level is of diagnostic value. Conditions associated with increased turnover of cells of the myeloid series, such as infection, are normally associated with moderately elevated levels, although granulomatous states presumably involving large numbers of macrophages, such as sarcoidosis, have been associated in the active phase with very high levels. Very high levels, however, most commonly reflect neoplastic involvement of the myeloid series, and are frequently observed in untreated chronic granulocytic leukemia and acute or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. The level falls when the neoplastic tissue mass decreases in response to therapy. The opposite extreme of a subnormal level is seen in states associated with depressed numbers of normal myeloid elements in the body.</p>
                        <p>Enzymes of particular importance to lymphocyte function are also recognized proliferating lymphocytes are endowed with relatively high levels of terminal deoxyribonucleic acid transferase, and this characteristic can be employed as an aid in the classification of lympoid neoplastic processes. Adenosine deaminase is present in relatively large amounts in T lymphocytes, and is presumably necessary for effective function of a significant subpopulation of cells involved in the immune response, as an inherited deficiency of this enzyme causes as its major clinical consequence a severe combined immunodeficiency state.</p>
                        
                        <h3>FUNCTION OF WHITE BLOOD CELLS</h3>
                        <p>Neutrophils are migratory phagocytic cells. They are attracted by chemotactic factors to sites of microbial invasion and tissue necrosis, where they congregate by passing out of the blood-stream between the endothelial cells of body vessels. Neutrophils are the most important cells involved in the body's defences against micro-organisms, and lack of adequate numbers of neutrophils predisposes to infection, particularly by bacteria. Their ability to locate and ingest microbes is enhanced by attachment of antibody and complement to the microorganism, illustrating the manner in which the various constituents of the body's defences against infection function in a cooperative fashion.</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_09_20_6dc34e0338b37aad296bg-328-1.jpg" alt="A diagram illustrating the sequence of microbial killing by a neutrophil, from ingestion to enzymatic destruction." class="content-image">

                        </figure>
                        <p>Killing of ingested microbes is mediated by a number of mechanisms, of which the process responsible for the generation of activated oxidative molecules from oxygen is particularly important. Measurement of this mechanism can be performed in the laboratory, using the bonding of radioactive iodide to microbes by neutrophils as an index of their ability to ingest bacteria or yeast, and perform the enzymatic steps culminating in the attachment of iodine to the microbe. Such activity is severely compromised in the potential fatal disorder of neutrophil microbicidal function, chronic granulomatous disease. This is usually an inherited defect in the reaction of molecular oxygen with reduced pyridine nucleotides, and the neutrophils which accumulate at the site of infection ingest but do not readily kill microorganisms (Fig. 11.2).</p>
                        <p>Microbial killing is also carried out independently by cationic granule proteins, which presumably react with ingested organisms following the secretion of granule contents into the phagocytic vacuole. A more comprehensive measure of microbicidal function is therefore provided by determination of the effectiveness with which neutrophils kill bacteria or yeast.</p>
                        <p>Eosinophils also possess phagocytic capacity, but do not normally make a significant contribution to the body's defences against invading bacteria. They congregate in tissues affected by allergic reactions, although their role in the allergic process is not fully understood. Production of eosinophils tends to correlate inversely with corticosteroid levels.</p>
                        <p>Monocytes are also motile phagocytic cells endowed with microbicidal mechanisms similar to those of neuthrophils, although monocyte phagocytic and microbicidal activity is considerably less effective than that of the neutrophil. Monocytes and macrophages are predominantly located in the extravascular space, and are particularly involved in the phagocytosis and catabolism of necrotic material.</p>
                        <p>Lymphocytes are motile nonphagocytic cells. There are many subpopulations of lymphocytes which interact with each other and with cells of the monocyte-macrophage series in the maintenance of humoral and cell-mediated immunity.</p>
                        
                        <h3>LEUKOCYTE SURFACE ANTIGENS</h3>
                        <p>Granulocytes and lymphocytes share surface antigens with many tissues, but they also have their own specific surface antigens.</p>
                        <p>Neutrophil specific antigens promote antibody production following transplacental or transfusion induced immunization of individuals lacking the particular antigen. The major relevance of transplacental immunization is that antibody produced by the mother can cross the placenta and produce neutropenia in the fetus.</p>
                        <p>HLA antigens on leukocytes are present on other cell types, and represent the major but not sole determinants of histocompatibility of tissues. HLA antigens are grouped into four basic systems, HLAA, HLAB, HLAC, and HLADR (D related). Each system is represented on the cell surface by an antigen which is the product of an allele of the gene for each system. These genes are located in the major histocompatibility complex on chromosome number 6, and each chromosome therefore directs the formation of one antigen of each system. Recognition by the body of cells bearing a foreign HLA pattern underlies the immune-mediated destruction of transplanted or transfused cells that are not histocompatible with those of the recipient.</p>
                        <p>The HLA genes of each major histocompatibility complex are closely located on the chromosome and are consequently almost always inherited as a single unit. Inheritance follows an autosomal dominant pattern, and this means there is one in four chance that any two siblings will share the same maternal and paternal number 6 chromosomes and consequently be HLA identical, a one in two chance that they will share one parental number 6 chromosome in common, and a one in four chance that they will have no parental number 6 chromosome in common.</p>
                        <p>The HLA type of an individual is usually determined by studies on peripheral blood lymphocytes. HLA antigens are strongly expressed on these cells, which serve as a conveniently obtainable source of tissue for tissue typing. The degree of incompatibility between individuals is also reflected in the degree to which their lymphocytes undergo a proliferative response when exposed to each other in the mixed lymphocyte reaction. This reaction is largely dictated by differences at the HLADR (D related) gene locus, and serves as a guide to the extent of histocompatibility reactions in transplantation.</p>
                        
                        <h3>NORMAL WHITE CELL VALUES</h3>
                        <p>Table 11.1 illustrates the range in the absolute count of leukocytes encompassed by two standard deviations from the mean, which includes about 95% of normal individuals. White cell counts in infancy and childhood tend to be greater than in adults, with values as high as 25 x 10⁹/L at birth. The count drops over the first seven days of life to about 14 x 10⁹/L. After this time, the absolute neutrophil count falls to approximately he same value as in the adult, although the absolute lymphocyte count remains above adult levels until about 12 years of age.</p>
                        <p>The leukocyte count normally undergoes a minor degree of diurnal variation because of a slight increase in the afternoon. A number of factors, such as the ingestion of food, physical exercise, and emotional stress, can cause an increase in the count.</p>
                        <p>Values up to 15 x 10⁹/L are common during pregnancy, and following parturition the count may rise to 20 x 10⁹/L, although it usually returns to normal within a week.</p>
