                        <p>Thrombosis and atherosclerotic vascular disease are major causes of morbidity and mortality, and they increase in incidence with advancing years. There are many contributing factors and predisposing conditions, and the mechanism of thrombus formation itself is complex and only partially understood. Continued investigation is required to provide a rational basis for prevention and treatment. This section examines some of the mechanisms involved, the clinical syndromes resulting from thrombosis, and to outline current approaches to their management.</p>

                        <h3>DEFINITION OF THROMBOSIS</h3>
                        <p>A thrombus may be defined as a mass of aggregated platelets, adherent to the vessel wall and immobilized with fibrin. There is a variable content of red cells and entrapped leukocytes, and the proportions and arrangement of the various components depend on local and general conditions.</p>
                        <h3>TYPES OF THROMBUS</h3>
                        <p>The size and constitution of a thrombus depend on general factors (components of the blood), local factors (the blood flow and vessel wall) and the site where thrombus formation occurs, i.e. whether it is within the arterial or venous circulation.</p>
                        <h4>VENOUS THROMBOSIS</h4>
                        <p>It is more common when there is sluggish flow or stasis, and endothelial changes are rarely the main causative factor. Such a thrombus is usually composed of abundant fibrin and many red cells. It generally resembles the appearance of clots formed in glass tubes, although the leading, or most proximal, portion often contains prominent platelet masses and is paler than the distal coagulum of red cells and fibrin.</p>
                        <h4>ARTERIAL THROMBOSIS</h4>
                        <p>It frequently occurs around the orifices of branches and at bifurcations. It is in these areas, where turbulence and sheer stresses are greatest, that endothelial injury and atheromatous changes are most marked, and platelet aggregates are readily formed. Such platelet aggregates may adhere locally and may progressively increase in size as more platelets adhere to the surface. Some coagulation and fibrin formation may occur, and limited red cell entrapment follows. An arterial thrombus thus formed has a pale appearance due to the predominance of platelets.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h3>EFFECTS OF THROMBOSIS</h3>
                        <p>Thrombosis may produce both local and distant effects. The local effects depend on the site and the degree of vascular occlusion, and the remote effects are due to embolic phenomena or to the release of vasoactive substances from the evolving thrombus into the passing stream of blood.</p>
                        <p>Venous thrombosis may result in complete obstruction of major channels such as the popliteal, femoral, or iliac veins with distal edema, and in exceptional circumstances (such as the mesenteric circulation) may cause tissue infarction. Detachment and embolization of various thrombi may produce obstruction within the pulmonary arterial system (pulmonary emboli).</p>
                        <p>Local occlusion at the site of initial thrombus formation in arteries is nearly always associated with intimal disease or microscopic damage. Such occlusion usually produces marked ischemic damage and organ dysfunction. The platelet aggregates within an arterial thrombus are often unstable and readily break up, releasing platelet masses into the circulation. Many such aggregates may disperse spontaneously, with return of the platelets to the general circulation. Other platelet masses may produce transient or permanent obstruction in distant small vessels, as is well recognized in the retinal and cerebral circulations.</p>
                        <p>There is a strong possibility that vascular spasm (for example, of the coronary arteries) may be caused by thromboxane A₂, serotonin, or other vasoactive substances released as a consequence of platelet activation. Such spasm may cause ischemic symptoms, particularly if the circulation is already compromised by proximal atheroma.</p>
                        <h3>ETIOLOGY OF THROMBOSIS</h3>
                        <p>The etiology of thrombosis is a complex subject, and in most cases is multifactorial. Many associations of clinical thrombosis have, as yet, ill-defined etiological relationships. Although there are differences between the factors predisposing to arterial and venous thrombosis, considerable areas of overlap exist. Arterial thrombosis and vascular disease are considered first, then the factors predisposing to venous thrombosis, and, finally, the condition of disseminated intravascular coagulation and fibrinolysis.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>There is a close relationship between thrombosis and the development of atherosclerotic vascular disease. There are at least three ways in which blood components may contribute to the development of atherosclerosis and its complications:</p>
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li>By hemodynamic factors and platelet-leukocyte interaction with the vessel wall which may lead to endothelial injury and consequent smooth muscle migration and proliferation.</li>
                            <li>By the formation of persistent mural thrombi which are organized and incorporated into the subendothelium, potentiating vessel wall damage.</li>
                            <li>By formation of thrombi in association with advanced atherosclerosis. Vessel wall disease develops through the phases of intimal thickening, medial muscle hypertrophy, lipid accumulation, and later calcification. These result in rigidity, lumen reduction, and disturbed flow, and provide the setting for platelet adherence and thrombus formation.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>The early lesions of atherosclerosis, particularly the migration and proliferation of smooth muscle cells, are probably mediated by growth factors released either by platelets or by macrophages attracted to sites of vascular injury. Related mitogens may be released by the vessel wall cells themselves, endothelium and smooth muscle, also as a response to injury.</p>
                        <p>A number of clinical and laboratory parameters have been identified associated with the development of atherosclerotic vascular disease. Modification of many of these factors may reduce the likelihood of progression of vascular disease and the development of its complications, although it has been surprisingly difficult to prove the value of alterations in dietary habits. Mortality statistics, despite their acknowledged deficiencies, suggest a substantial reduction in deaths from ischemic heart disease over the past 20 years in a number of western countries. This is likely to be due, in part, to modifications of the presumed risk factors, particularly reduction in weight, dietary saturated fats, and cigarette smoking, and the earlier treatment of moderate hypertension. Some of the more important 'risk' factors are now briefly mentioned in Fig. 18.1.</p>

                        <h4>Hyperlipidemia</h4>
                        <p>A high level of plasma cholesterol and triglycerides have both been shown to lead to atherosclerotic change in arteries in both experimental animals and humans. Platelets are also susceptible to lipids in their environment and are aggregated by fatty acids, and it is possible that platelet aggregates may form more readily when the lipid pattern of plasma is altered. Hyperlipidemia and obesity are also associated with decreased plasma fibrinolytic activity, possibly with enhanced coagulation, both of which might aggravate the thrombotic tendency. A high incidence of premature peripheral vascular disease and myocardial infarction is found in persons with hyperlipoproteinemia. More recently, it has been suggested that the detrimental effect is associated with the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol fraction. An increased proportion of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol is protective against the development of coronary disease in epidemiological studies.</p>
                        <h4>Diabetes Mellitus</h4>
                        <p>Hyperlipidemia is not uncommon in diabetes, and there is some evidence to suggest enhanced coagulation and increased platelet responsiveness. More striking, however, are functional abnormalities of endothelium that may result in increased tendency to platelet overreactivity.</p>
                        <h4>Smoking</h4>
                        <p>The increased mortality from ischemic heart disease, and morbidity from peripheral vascular disease and cerebrovascular disease, associated with cigarette smoking is well-documented. The mechanisms underlying the toxicity of tobacco smoke are poorly understood. There is some evidence for increased platelet aggregability due to smoking. Both animal experiments and in vitro studies point to toxicity of tobacco products on vascular endothelium. Carbon monoxide and nicotine have been implicated, but the evidence is not overwhelming.</p>
                        <h4>Exercise and Body Build</h4>
                        <p>The role of exercise and leanness of body as factors that might reduce the incidence of thrombosis have been widely debated. There have been retrospective studies suggesting that myocardial ischemia is less common in those who exercise regularly, but the relationship remains to be confirmed by properly conducted prospective studies.</p>
                        <h4>Hypertension</h4>
                        <p>Hypertension may produce endothelial injury, and focal increases in endothelial cell replication have been shown in hypertensive animals. At the clinical level, both prospective studies and the benefit of treatment of mild to moderate hypertension suggest that hypertension is not important risk factor.</p>
                        <h4>Hypercoagulability</h4>
                        <p>Research has shown that hemostatic variables, studied prospectively, are important in the risk of subsequent cardiovascular death, principally from ischemic heart disease. High levels of factor VIIc and fibrinogen are associated with a high incidence of coronary artery disease. Other measurable hemostatic components important in the development of cardiovascular events are platelet aggregability and antithrombin III. Lowered antithrombin III levels are associated with estrogen administration and an increase in cardiovascular events.</p>
                        <h4>Inherited, Racial, and Dietary Factors</h4>
                        <p>These factors must also contribute as the incidence of thrombotic disease is not uniform in different countries. Changes in dietary habits in immigrant racial groups have also been associated with development of thrombotic disorders, suggesting the importance of dietary and environmental factors. Molecular techniques may in the future enable screening for specific genetic characteristics associated with vascular disease, e.g. identifying the genes for apolipoproteins which particularly predispose to lipid accumulation.</p>

                        <p>This is a rare disorder in which there is reduced activity of the natural anticoagulant (inhibitor) against activated factor X (factor Xa) and thrombin. Deficiency is inherited as an autosomal dominant and is associated with a high incidence of venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, usually presenting in the second or third decade. Plasma concentrations of 50% of normal are sufficient to predispose to thrombosis. In most cases, the plasma antithrombin III concentration is reduced, but families with dysfunctional and pathological antithrombin III molecules have been described.</p>

                        <p>Occasional cases of increased thrombotic tendency have been attributed to functionally abnormal fibrinogen.</p>
                        <h3>Acquired</h3>
                        <p>Surgery and trauma and prolonged recumbency for any reason are associated with a high incidence of venous thrombosis. Surgery and trauma are characterized by a state of relative hypercoagulability of the blood. When sensitive techniques such as venegraphy and ¹²⁵I fibrinogen scanning are used, many small areas of thrombosis are found; as many as 50% may not be noticed clinically. For the same reason (immobilization), long haul flights also predispose to thromboembolic phenomena. The diagnosis has been simplified with the advent of color Doppler studies.</p>
                        <p>During pregnancy, and particularly in the puerperium, there is also a state of relative hypercoagulability, which may result from increased estrogen levels in the blood. The activity levels of factors VII, VIII, and X are increased, and there is also a tendency for other clotting factors, particularly fibrinogen, to be elevated and for fibrinolytic activity to be decreased. During labor, tissue damage leads to activation of coagulation and readily detectable alterations in a number of factor activities, platelet count, and fibrinolysis, consistent with a state of compensated intravascular coagulation. In multiple pregnancies, or when labour is prolonged, these changes are more marked and may lead to over thrombosis in the puerperium. Amniotic fluid embolism, associated with dissemination of fetal material, may also lead to intravascular coagulation.</p>
                        <p>Usage of oral contraceptive medication is established as a significant association with thromboembolic disease. The incidence of thromboembolism in women taking oral contraceptives has been shown to be nine times as compared to normal population. This includes calf vein thrombosis, cerebral and mesenteric thrombosis, and, in older women, myocardial infarction, although the evidence for the latter is suggestive rather than conclusive. Increased levels of coagulation factors VII and X, and decreased antithrombin III, as well as altered platelet activity, occur during medication with oral contraceptives. Some changes have also been found in factor VIII levels and fibrinolytic activity. The incidence of thrombosis is reduced by the use of preparations containing low dosage of estrogens. It is generally recommended that the oral contraceptives should be discontinued 2-3 months before elective surgery to diminish the risk of postoperative venous thrombosis.</p>
