                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The bleeding disorders are a group of disorders of widely varying etiology, which have in common an abnormal tendency to bleed due to a defect in the mechanism of hemostasis.</p>
                        <h3>CLINICAL PICTURE</h3>
                        <p>Clinically, the hemorrhagic disorders are characterized by:</p>
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li>Spontaneous bleeding into the skin, mucous membranes and internal tissues</li>
                            <li>Excessive or prolonged bleeding following trauma or surgery; and</li>
                            <li>Bleeding from more than one site.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>The bleeding varies in severity. In some disorders, it is mild and limited to the skin and is therefore of nuisance value only; in other disorders, uncontrollable bleeding from mucous membranes or bleeding into internal organs may threaten life.</p>
                        <h3>PATHOGENESIS</h3>
                        <p>There are three major components of the normal hemostatic mechanism-the vascular, platelet, and coagulation components-which act together in a coordinated fashion to arrest bleeding. A breakdown in the normal hemostatic mechanism, and thus an abnormal tendency to bleed, may result from a defect in any one of these three components. Bleeding is especially liable to occur when more than one component is defective. It should be noted that bleeding may arise from either quantitative (deficiency) or qualitative (functional) defects.</p>
                        <p>In this section, hemorrhagic disorders due to vascular and platelet abnormalities are discussed. Coagulation defects are discussed in Chapter 17: Coagulation Disorders.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The functions of the normal hemostatic process are to prevent blood loss from intact vessels and to arrest bleeding from injured vessels. Relatively little is known about the mechanism by which blood loss is prevented from intact vessels; however, both the structural integrity of the vessels and the presence of adequate numbers of normal viable platelets are necessary for this function. The precise nature of the functional support of the endothelium provided by platelets is not known, but there is evidence for structural changes in the vessel wall as a consequence of thrombocytopenia both in experimental animals and in humans. Although there has been controversy surrounding the question, there appear to be growth factors within platelets which may be involved in stimulating endothelial repair process.</p>

                            <figcaption>Fig. 16.1: Normal hemostasis</figcaption>
                        </figure>
                        <p>Immediately after injury the damaged blood vessel undergoes a temporary reflex nervous vasoconstriction, resulting in slowing of blood flow. Blood escapes into the tissues and so increases the tissue tension, with further narrowing of the vessels (see extravascular factors below). The escaping blood comes in contact with the damaged vessel wall and the extravascular tissues, and the processes of platelet adhesion, platelet aggregation, and blood coagulation are initiated. The response to an endothelial breach is extremely rapid; the time available for a platelet to leave the blood flow and react to the subendothelium may be measured in milliseconds.</p>
                        <p>Platelet adhesion to subendothelium has two definable components, each with its own functional determinants. The initial contact adhesion is to types I and III collagen fibrils and to the elastin-associated collagenous microfibrils in subendothelium. At high shear flow (>800 sec⁻¹) in the capillary bed, platelet adhesion to these subendothelial components depends on the plasma protein, von Willebrand factor (factor VIII-related antigen) which forms a bridge to the platelet membrane receptor, glycoprotein Ib complex. In larger vessels, e.g. the aorta, platelet adhesion is independent of von Willebrand factor and probably involves the direct adhesion of platelets to collagen fibrils. This may be via the platelet membrane glycoprotein IIb/IIIa complex and glycoprotein Ia (Fig. 16.2).</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_09_20_6dc34e0338b37aad296bg-455-2.jpg" alt="A diagram representing the structures of human platelet glycoproteins Ib, Ia, and IIb/IIIa complexes, which are crucial for platelet adhesion and aggregation." class="content-image">

                        </figure>
                        <p>Platelet contact is closely followed by a process of spreading adhesion dependent on at least three components:</p>
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li>Adhesive proteins such as von Willebrand factor and/or fibronectin incorporated in the subendothelial matrix</li>
                            <li>Divalent cations, calcium or magnesium, and</li>
                            <li>The glycoprotein IIb/IIIa complex in the platelet membrane.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Release of platelet components and the recruitment of further platelets occur simultaneously, but can be conveniently considered as two distinct events. Both are stimulated by the adhesion process to collagen and by a number of other agonists made available in the vicinity of tissue injury, particularly adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and thrombin, and, in some situations, platelet activating factor (PAF) derived from inflammatory cells. There are also common internal pathways within the platelet, which initiate the processes of release and aggregation. The signal transduction of receptor occupation involves the hydrolysis of phospho-inositol by phospholipase C; hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine by phospholipase A, with release of arachidonic acid; the activation of protein kinase C; and the ultimate increase of cytosol [Ca⁺⁺] released from the dense tubular system and by influx from the outside.</p>
                        <h4>Aggregation is dependent (Fig. 16.3)</h4>
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li>Firstly, on shape change involving the loss of the platelet discoid configuration, and</li>
                            <li>The formation of pseudopods to increase the surface area and the likelihood of contact.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Shape change and the later release process depend on contraction of actinmyosin in the periphery of the platelet. Associated conformational changes to the membrane glycoprotein IIb/IIIa complex expose fibrinogen receptors on the platelet surface, enabling platelet bridging to take place via fibrinogen molecules, probably being enchanced by von Willebrand factor and fibronectin. The release of dense granule components, ADP, calcium, and serotonin, combined with the synthesis and release of thromboxane A₂ (TXA₂) from arachidonic acid, provides a powerful amplification feedback to aggregate platelets in the vicinity. The release is achieved by a combination of fusion and extrusion of granules.</p>

                        </figure>
                        <p>Alpha granule proteins, factor V, fibrinogen, von Willebrand factor, and thrombospondin, released simultaneously, may contribute further to the process by raising their local concentration. Other alpha granule proteins and arachidonate products produced simultaneously are involved in repair processes following injury. Many alpha granule components are well characterized and include polypeptides such as the betathromboglobulin family (chemotaxis and possibly mitogenesis), platelet factor IV (antiheparin, chemotaxis) and platelet derived growth factor (chemotaxis, mitogenesis, and vasoactivity). Lipid-derived mediators such as 12-hydroxyeicosatetranoic acid (12-HETE), a lipoxygenase product of released membrane arachidonic acid have powerful chemotactic activity for neutrophils. Lyzosomal enzymes, released separately, include glucuronidase, n-acetyl glucosaminidase, elastase, heparinitase, and collagenase. These enzymes may reach local concentrations high enough to disrupt subendothelial basement membrane and internal elastic lamina (Fig 16.4).</p>

                        </figure>
                        <p>Also in the process of aggregation, the platelet membrane exposes a number of receptor sites for coagulation components making a 'solid phase' system for coagulation components mechanism, in part protected from inhibitors. The negatively charged phospholipid component that enhances coagulation enzyme systems, previously termed 'platelet factor 3', lies on the inner aspect of the platelet membrane but is exposed during activation, providing a surface for calcium and activated coagulation factor complexes. Factor V is released from alpha granules, activated by protease, and binds to specific sites on the platelet membrane. Membrane-bound factor Va becomes a receptor for activated factor X, accelerating the activation of prothrombin to thrombin some 300,000-fold.</p>
                        <p>Importance of various factors concerned with hemostasis varies with the size of the vessel involved. In small arterioles and venules, hemostasis depends mainly on vessel constriction and on a platelet plug. In larger vessels, although constriction is important in limiting the initial loss of blood, the formation of the hemostatic plug to seal the defect in the vessel plays an important major role.</p>
                        <p>Lastly limitation of the processes of platelet adhesion and activation is obviously of importance in maintaining blood fluidity and vascular patency.</p>
                        <p>The aggregating compounds have extremely short survival times due to hydrolysis (TXA2), enzymatic degradation (ATP and ADP), cellular uptake (serotonin), and specific inhibitors (antithrombin). Also, vascular endothelial responses to local platelet activation include the release of specific platelet inhibitory substances, in particular prostacyclin, a cyclooxygenase product of arachidonic acid (Fig. 16.5).</p>

                        <h3>HEMOSTATIC PLUG-EVENTUAL FATE</h3>
                        <p>The platelets in the hemostatic plug gradually undergo autolysis and are replaced by fibrin, so that after 24-48 hours a hemostatic plug has been transformed into a dense fibrin mass. This is then gradually digested by the fibrinolytic enzyme system and the defect in the vessel wall then becomes covered with endothelial cells.</p>
                        <h3>EXTRAVASCULAR FACTORS</h3>
                        <p>Extravascular factors also influence hemostasis by, namely tissue tension and the support of the vessels, which play an important subsidiary role, particularly in venous bleeding. In tissues with a relatively high tissue tension, the natural tension, together with the increased tension caused by the mass of escaped blood, compresses these damaged vessels and lessens blood loss. When vessels are contained in loose tissue and are poorly supported, bleeding tends to continue. Thus, vessels in the nasal septum, which have a rigid unyielding septum on one side and no support on the other, are particularly liable to bleed. Vessels in the gastrointestinal mucosa, in the bladder, and in the pelvis of the kidney are not well supported; bleeding from these sites occurs relatively easily after slight trauma and in disorders of the hemostatic mechanism, and can be difficult to control. In other areas where the tissue tension is low, e.g. in the subcutaneous tissues of the scrotum and about the orbit, mild trauma may result in extensive hematoma formation.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Defects of blood vessels are a common cause of bleeding disorders seen in clinical practice. However, it is now understood that in a number of the acquired vascular hemorrhagic disorders qualitative platelet defects may coexist and contribute.</p>
                        <p>Usually cases of bleeding due to a vascular defect alone are not severe, and frequently the bleeding is mainly or wholly into the skin, causing petechiae or ecchymoses, or both. Petechiae may be rather pale and tend to be confluent; ecchymoses are usually small. In some disorders there is bleeding from mucous membranes, but only rarely is there bleeding into muscles and internal organs. Excess bleeding from wounds tends to occur at once, usually persists for less than 48 hours, and rarely recurs.</p>
                        <p>In many of these conditions, the standard screening tests used in the investigation of patients with a bleeding disorder show little or no abnormality. The bleeding time is sometimes prolonged, and the tourniquet test may be positive. However, in many cases either one or both are normal. When they are abnormal, and especially when the bleeding time is prolonged, bleeding is likely to be more severe, particularly following trauma and with surgery. The platelet count, the one-stage prothrombin time, and the activiated partial thromboplastin time are typically normal. However, in certain disorder, e.g. infection and uremia, associated thrombocytopenia may contribute to bleeding. In addition, in those disorders with platelet functional defects, especially uremia and dysproteinemia, there are abnormalities in the tests of platelet adhesion or aggregation.</p>

                        <h3>Simple Easy Bruising (Purpura Simplex)</h3>
                        <p>Simple easy bruising is a benign disorder, which occurs predominantly in otherwise healthy women. Onset is often during adolescence or early adult life.</p>
                        <p>The disorder is relatively common. It is characterized by the occurrence of circumscribed bruises, either on minor trauma or without obvious cause ('devil's pinches'). They are most often seen on the legs and trunk. The bruises are occasionally preceded by pain due to the rupture of a small blood vessel. Although abnormalities are not found in tests of blood coagulation and the bleeding time is usually normal, the tourniquet test occasionally gives a weakly positive result. Some investigators found a high incidence of impaired platelet aggregation with adrenaline and some impairment with ADP and connective tissue. They also detected platelet antibodies in a proportion of the patients and suggested that the 'easy bruising' syndrome may include a proportion of patients with abnormal platelet function on an immune basis.</p>
                        <p>Simple easy bruising is of importance mainly because of its cosmetic significance and because it may give rise to suspicion of a serious blood disorder. It is probably the most common cause of referral of patients for diagnosis and assessment of unexplained skin bruising. Diagnosis is made on the clinical features and by the exclusion of other causes of purpura. A history of aspirin ingestion should be sought, as it may cause similar bruising. There is no effective treatment; in particular, corticosteriods and other hormones are of no benefit and should be avoided. The patient should be reassured and advised to avoid aspirin when possible. The disorder does not cause excessive bleeding at operation.</p>
                        <h3>Senile Purpura (Involutional Purpura)</h3>
                        <p>Senile (involutional) purpura is a form of purpura that occurs commonly in elderly subjects, mainly on the extensor aspect of the forearms and hands. It occurs equally in males and females over the age of 60 years. An incidence of 2% in the seventh decade, increasing progressively to 25% in the tenth decade. The lesions occur on the extensor surface and radial border of the forearm and on the back of the hand, but they do not extend onto the fingers. They do not occur on any other parts of the body, although they are occasionally seen on the face in relation to spectacle frames, either across the bridge of the nose or along the side pieces. The purpuric areas are large (1-4 cm in diameter), irregular, dark purple, and have a clear-cut-margin. The skin in the affected areas is inelastic, thin, smooth, pigmented, and may show nonpigmented scars; hair is scanty or absent. The purpuric lesions last for varying periods, ranging from a few days to many weeks. The tourniquet test is negative. The lesions are commonly due to minor trauma. There is no effective treatment; in particular, corticosteroids are of no value and indeed may aggravate the disorder and retard resolution of the lesions.</p>
                        <p><strong>Pathogenesis:</strong> Biopsy section of the skin in affected areas shows marked atrophy of collagen; this results in the skin being freely moveable over the deeper tissues. The purpuric lesions are easily induced by a shearing strain to the skin, which tears the vessels passing to the skin because of the excessive mobility of the skin on the subcutaneous tissues. Once the vessels are ruptured, abnormal spread of the blood is permitted by the atrophied collagen fibres. The long persistence of the lesion is due to slow resorption of the blood because of impairment of the normal phagocytic response to extravasated blood.</p>
                        <p>Purpura similar in distribution and type to that of involutional purpura may occur in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. The association may be related to the duration of rheumatoid disease. Corticosteroid therapy, however, is likely to contribute in some patients.</p>
