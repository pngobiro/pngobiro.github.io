                        <p>The hereditary disorders of hemoglobin may be classified into two broad groups, the hemoglobinopathies and the thalassemias. The hemoglobinopathies are characterized by the production of structurally defective hemoglobin due to abnormalities in the formation of the globin moiety of the molecule. The thalassemias are characterized by a reduced rate of production of normal hemoglobin due to absent or decreased synthesis of one or more types of globin polypeptide chains.</p>
                        <p>Thalassemias are widespread, with maximum prevalence around the Mediterranean littoral and in Southeast Asia. The common abnormal hemoglobins, HbS and HbC are prevalent in tropical Africa and among Black populations in the New World. HbE is common in Southeast Asia, HbD-Punjab in the Indian continent. Hereditary disorders of hemoglobin are less common among people of Northern European origin, but no ethnic group is totally spared.</p>

                        <p>Hemoglobin is a conjugated protein of molecular weight 64000, consisting of two pairs of polypeptide chains to each of which a heme is attached. Human hemoglobin exists in a number of types, which differ slightly in the structure of their globin moiety. However, the heme is identical in all types.</p>
                        <h3>HEMOGLOBIN TYPES</h3>
                        <p><strong>Hemoglobin A (HbA)</strong> comprises about 97% of the hemoglobin of adult red cells. It consists of two alpha ($\alpha$) and two beta ($\beta$) chains with the structural formula $\alpha_{2}\beta_{2}$. The $\alpha$ chain contains 141 amino acids, and the $\beta$ chain, 146. Small amounts of HbA are detected in the fetus as early as the eighth week of life. During the first two months of postnatal life, HbA almost completely replaces HbF, and the adult pattern is fully established by six months.</p>
                        <p><strong>Hemoglobin A₂ (HbA₂)</strong> is the minor hemoglobin in the adult red cell. It has the structural formula of $\alpha_{2}\delta_{2}$, the delta ($\delta$) chain containing 146 amino acids. The $\alpha$ chain is identical to that of HbA. HbA₂ is present in very small amounts at birth and reaches the adult level of 1.5-3.2% during the first year of life. Elevation of HbA₂ is a feature of some types of thalassemia and occasionally occurs in megaloblastic anemia and unstable hemoglobin disease. HbA₂ may be reduced in iron deficiency (Table 9.1).</p>
                        <p><strong>Hemoglobin F (HbF)</strong> is the major respiratory pigment from early intrauterine life up to term. It has the structural formula $\alpha_{2}\gamma_{2}$, each gamma ($\gamma$) chain consisting of 146 amino acids. The $\gamma$ chains are designated <sup>G</sup>$\gamma$ or <sup>A</sup>$\gamma$ depending on whether they have glycine or alanine at position 136. At term, HbF accounts for 70-90% of the total hemoglobin. It then falls rapidly to 25% at 1 month, and 5% at 6 months.</p>

                        <p>The adult level of about 1% is not reached in some children until puberty. HbF is elevated in some hemoglobinopathies and thalassemia syndromes. It may be elevated in occasional cases of congenital and acquired aplastic anemia, megaloblastic anemia, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, sideroblastic anemia, and in some forms of leukemia. It is also occasionally raised in early pregnancy. The acid elution test indicates that HbF is unevenly distributed in the red cells in these conditions. HbF is measured by the alkali denaturation technique.</p>
                        <p><strong>Hb -Gower 1 and Hb -Gower 2</strong> are confined to the embryonic stage of development. They contain epsilon ($\varepsilon$) and zeta ($\zeta$) chains, Hb -Gower 1 being $\zeta_{2}\varepsilon_{2}$ and Hb -Gower 2 being $\alpha_{2}\varepsilon_{2}$. <strong>Hb -Portland</strong> is found in trace amounts throughout intrauterine life and in neonates. It has the structural formula $\zeta_{2}\gamma_{2}$. <strong>Hb -Bart</strong> is also found in small amounts in cord blood if sensitive techniques are used. Both Hb -Portland and Hb -Bart are increased in the cord blood of neonates with $\alpha$-thalassemia.</p>
                        <h3>HEMOGLOBIN STRUCTURE</h3>
                        <p>The structure of the hemoglobin molecule may be viewed at four levels of organizational complexity. The basic arrangement of linked amino acids forming four polypeptide chains, each attached to a heme molecule, is the primary structure. Each chain is arranged in a series of eight helical segments joined by short non-helical segments, 8% of the total length of each chain is in helical conformation, and this is referred to as the secondary structure.</p>
                        <p>The folding of each coiled chain into a specific three-dimensional configuration is the tertiary structure. The four-folded chains fit closely together to form a compact tetrameric molecule known as the quaternary structure. Each heme molecule is enclosed in a pocket by the folds of the chain. The integrity of the chains and their spatial relationships to each other and to the heme molecules are critical in the maintenance of stability of the molecule and its ability to transport oxygen.</p>
                        <h3>GENETIC REGULATION</h3>
                        <p>Every person receives one or more genes from each parent for each of the four major hemoglobin chains. $\beta$- and $\delta$- chain syntheses are each under the control of single genes, but the gene loci of $\alpha$ and $\gamma$ chains are duplicated.</p>
                        <p>Recent advances in molecular biology have greatly increased our knowledge of the fine structure of the human globin gene complex. The chromosomal organization of the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ gene complexes is depicted in Fig. 9.1. The $\alpha$ gene complex is situated on the short arm of chromosome 16 and includes the duplicated $\alpha$ genes ($\alpha_{1}$ and $\alpha_{2}$), a non-functional pseudo-$\alpha$ gene ($\psi\alpha_{1}$) and two $\zeta$ genes, one of which is probably non-functional. The non-$\alpha$ gene complex is situated on the short arm of chromosome 11 and includes the $\beta$ and $\delta$ genes, the duplicated $\gamma$ genes (<sup>G</sup>$\gamma$ and <sup>A</sup>$\gamma$), the e gene and a non-functional pseudo-$\beta$ gene ($\psi\beta_{1}$).</p>
                        <p><strong>Synthesis:</strong> The genetic information that directs the synthesis of individual globin chains in erythroblasts is encoded in the nucleotide base sequence of the corresponding gene DNA, each triplet codon of three nucleotide bases specifying a single amino acid. Each gene consists of regions (referred to as exons) that code for globin messenger RNA (mRNA) and other non-coding 'intervening sequences' (introns). Within the nucleus, the gene is transcribed into a large mRNA precursor from which the transcripts of the 'intervening sequences' are then removed by an enzymatic process called splicing. The modified mRNA moves to the cytoplasm where it combines with ribosomes and is translated into the globin chain.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Most of the abnormal hemoglobins have been described. Each arises from a mutation affecting the gene directing the structure of a particular pair of polypeptide chains, and they are classified as $\alpha$-, $\beta$-, $\gamma$- or $\delta$-chain variants depending on the chains involved. The mutant gene is situated at the same chromosomal locus as (i.e. is an allele of) the normal gene controlling production of the corresponding normal chain.</p>
                        <p>When the possession of a hemoglobin variant gives rise to a clearly defined disease state, the affected person is said to have a hemoglobinopathy. It is important to appreciate, however, that the great majority of abnormal hemoglobins confer no harmful effect, and the individual remains asymptomatic and unaware of the abnormality within the red cell.</p>
                        <h3>GENETIC REGULATION</h3>
                        <p>Abnormal hemoglobins are inherited as autosomal co-dominants. Thus, subjects who inherit one normal and one abnormal gene are heterozygotes, and those who have two identical abnormal genes are homozygotes. Double heterozygotes are subjects who have inherited two different abnormal genes. The homozygous state is usually referred to as the 'disease' (e.g. the homozygous state for HbC is 'HbC disease'), and the heterozygous state as the 'trait' (e.g. 'HbC trait'). This rule has some exceptions, however, e.g. unstable hemoglobin 'disease' is a reflection of a heterozygous state.</p>
                        <p>Each group of chain variants and the disorders associated with them have some common characteristics.</p>
                        <p><strong>Beta-chain variant hemoglobins:</strong> Beta chains take part in the formation of HbA only, and thus $\beta$-chain variants are all variants of HbA. Heterozygous subjects synthesize both normal and abnormal $\beta$ chains, and the abnormal hemoglobin is usually about 30-40% of the total. Homozygous subjects synthesize the abnormal hemoglobin and the normal small amounts of HbA₂, but no normal $\beta$ chains and thus no normal HbA. Heterozygotes for two $\beta$-chain variants have equal amounts of the two abnormal hemoglobins and a small amount of HbA₂ in their red cells. As $\beta$-chain synthesis commences in intrauterine life, $\beta$-chain variants may be detected in the fetus. Clinical effects from the abnormal hemoglobin do not occur until after birth when $\gamma$-chain synthesis falls to a low level. The majority of abnormal hemoglobins are $\beta$-chain substitutions, and about 200 such variants have been described.</p>
                        <p><strong>Alpha-chain variant hemoglobins:</strong> Alpha chains are involved in the formulation of HbA, HbA₂, and HbF, and thus $\alpha$-chain substitutions affect all these hemoglobins. Adult heterozygotes for $\alpha$-chain variants produce both normal and abnormal HbA, HbF and HbA₂, the abnormal types having abnormal $\alpha$ chains in addition to the normal $\alpha_{1} \gamma$ and $\delta$ chains. The major hemoglobin variant (the HbA variant) ranges from 15 to 45% of the total hemoglobin in the red cell. About 100 $\alpha$-chain variants have been described.</p>

                        <p>Although exact identification of an abnormal hemoglobin usually requires an array of special biochemical methodologies, the initial investigation of the hemoglobinopathies is well within the scope of most routine clinical laboratories. The clinical findings, the patient's ethnic origin and family history, and preliminary hematological studies suggest the diagnosis, and hemoglobin electrophoresis demonstrates the presence of an abnormal hemoglobin. Other simple laboratory tests based on physicochemical properties of some abnormal hemoglobins, e.g. the sickle test, may permit a presumptive diagnosis at this point. Final definitive identification of the abnormal hemoglobin usually requires the assistance of a reference laboratory.</p>
                        <h3>Routine Hematological and Biochemical Tests</h3>
                        <p>Essential initial diagnostic tests are determination of the hemoglobin level, packed cell volume, red cell count and red cell indices, preferably by means of an electronic cell counter, together with a reticulocyte count and examination of a stained blood film by an experienced observer. Bilirubin estimation and other biochemical tests for the presence of hemolysis should also be performed.</p>
                        <h3>Investigations Depending on Physicochemical Properties of Abnormal Hemoglobins</h3>
                        <p>Tests of this type include the sickle test, the hemoglobin solubility (HbS) test, the demonstration of intracellular hemoglobin crystals (HbC), HbH inclusions ($\alpha$-thalassemia) and Heinz bodies, the heat instability test and isopropanol precipitation test (the unstable hemoglobins), and oxygen dissociation studies (the high oxygen-affinity hemoglobins).</p>
                        <h3>Hemoglobin Electrophoresis</h3>
                        <p>This is the most useful method for the demonstration of abnormal hemoglobins. The hemoglobins are separated on a variety of supporting media on the basis of electric charge differences. Cellulose acetate electrophoresis at pH 8.6 is the method of choice in most clinical laboratories. Agar gel electrophoresis using a citrate buffer at pH 6.0 is useful in supplementing (but not replacing) the information gained from other methods, as the mobility of some abnormal hemoglobins on agar gel differs from that on other supporting media. The electrophoretic mobility of the commonly encountered normal and abnormal hemoglobins on cellulose acetate and agar gel is schematically depicted in Fig. 9.2.</p>

                        <p>HbF is resistant to denaturation by alkali, and in clinical practice is estimated by the alkali denaturation technique. This test measures the percentage of alkali-resistant pigment remaining after exposure to alkali under standard conditions. Values over 2.5% in adult subjects are regarded as elevated.</p>
                        <h3>The Acid Elution Test</h3>
                        <p>Red cells containing HbF resist elution at an acid pH to a greater extent than do normal cells containing HbA. The acid elution makes us of this phenomenon to permit the cytochemical assessment of the HbF content of individual cells.</p>
                        <h3>Hemoglobin Electrophoresis</h3>
                        <p>Even though the sickle and hemoglobin solubility tests detect the presence of HbS, hemoglobin electrophoresis is mandatory for precise diagnosis of the sickle hemoglobinopathies. HbS may be demonstrated by electrophoresis on cellulose acetate at pH 8.6 in a position between HbA and HbA₂. Although nearly 50 hemoglobin variants have a similar mobility to HbS, the only practical problem of any frequency caused by identical mobilities is the differentiation of homozygous sickle-cell disease from sickle-cell HbD disease. Red cells from patients with both conditions sickle, and as HbS and HbD migrate in the same position on cellulose acetate, the two diseases appear to be identical. The problem may be resolved by electrophoresis in agar gel at pH 6.0. On this medium, HbS and HbD separate widely; thus, homozygous sickle-cell disease.</p>
                        <p>A two-band pattern on agar gel would confirm sickle-cell HbD disease, and a one-band pattern homozygous sickle cell disease.</p>
                        <p>Antenatal diagnosis of the sickle hemoglobinopathies is now possible.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>These are hereditary disorders in which the red cells contain HbS. They include the heterozygous (sickle-cell trait) and the homozygous (SS disease) states for HbS, and conditions in which HbS is combined with other hemoglobin structural variants or thalassemia. In the deoxygenated state, the solubility of HbS is 10% of that of HbA. The conformational changes in HbS induced by deoxygenation cause the cells containing the abnormal hemoglobin to become rigid and deformed, assuming a sickle or crescent shape.</p>
                        <p>The red cell sickling in the circulating blood has two major pathological effects:</p>
                        <ol type="i">
                            <li>The distorted and rigid cells block small blood vessels, impairing flow and causing ischemia and infarction; and</li>
                            <li>Repeated 'sickle-unsickle' cycles lead to loss of fragments of red cell membrane, and the cells become spherocytic and fragile. They are removed prematurely by the reticuloendothelial system, and to a lesser extent destroyed in the circulation resulting in both extravascular and intravascular hemolysis.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>HbS differs from HbA in the substitution of valine for glutamic acid in the sixth position from the N-terminal end of the $\beta$ chain. The precise mechanism by which this seemingly minor change in amino acid sequence leads to such an important rearrangement of the molecule on deoxygenation is not known with certainty. Electron microscopy of sickle cells has shown bundles of long tubular fibrse parallel to the long axis of the cell which are presumed to be of sufficient rigidity to distort the cell membrane. Each fiber consists of 14 or possibly 16 spirally-wound filaments, the filaments being composed of HbS molecules like beads on a string.</p>
                        <p>Red cells containing large amounts of HbS begin to sickle at an oxygen tension of 50-60 mmHg. This tension is experienced by the cells in parts of the microcirculation, and thus sickling occurs in vivo. If the flow rate is rapid, sickling does not become fully established and the cells resume normal shape when they are swept back to areas of circulation where the oxygen tension is higher. If the flow rate is slow, and the cells are delayed in areas where the oxygen tension is low, the cells sickle and there is further slowing of the circulation. Oxygen tension is further reduced, additional sickle cells accumulate, and finally complete blockage of the vessel occurs. Tissue ischemia resulting from such vessel blockage is the basis of the painful crises that are a major clinical feature of the sickling disorders.</p>
                        <p>Several factors influence the degree of deoxygenation required to produce sickling of red cells containing HbS.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The amount of HbS in the red cell is clearly of importance as the cells of a patient with sickle-cell trait which contain less than 50% HbS are less likely to sickle at a particular level of deoxygenation than the cells of a patient with homozygous sickle cell disease which contain nearly 100% HbS.</li>
                            <li>The physical properties of the hemoglobin with which HbS is associated in the red cell may increase or decrease the liability of the HbS to sickle. HbC and HbD potentiate sickling, and patients heterozygous for these hemoglobins and HbS have moderately severe sickling disorder. HbF has the opposite effect and tends to diminish sickling.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Red cells of patients with homozygous sickle cell disease have a reduced oxygen affinity, and the oxygen dissociation curve of the blood is shifted to the right. Although this phenomenon assists the release of oxygen at the tissue level, it also results in the occurrence of sickling at a higher oxygen tension than would be the case if the dissociation curve was normal. Acidosis shifts the curve further to the right and similarly enhances the sickling process.</p>
                        <p>The packed cell volume and proportion of red cells containing HbS are also important in determining the increase in blood viscosity resulting from a fall in oxygen tension.</p>
                        <p>The sickle gene is the result of a point mutation in the codon for the sixth amino acid of the $\beta$ globin chain, and is inherited as a mendelian co-dominant. It occurs mainly in blacks or persons with an admixture of black blood, and is thus seen frequently in Africa and amongst black populations in north and south America and the West Indies. It is also found in certain regions in Greece, southern Italy, Turkey, the middle East, and India. The sickle gene is believed to confer some protection against Plasmodium falciparum malaria, and its geographical distribution is in accordance with this concept. The following sickle hemoglobinopathies are prevalent in communities where the sickle gene is found-sicklecell trait, homozygous sickle-cell disease, sickle-cell thalassemia, and sickle-cell HbC disease.</p>

                        <h3>SICKLE CELL TRAIT (AS)</h3>
                        <p>Sickle cell trait, the asymptomatic carrier state for HbS, occurs in about eight percent of American blacks. In Africa, its prevalence rate in many populations is over 20%, and reaches 50% in some tribes. Sickle cell trait is the heterozygous state for the HbS gene. HbS comprises 38-45% of the total hemoglobin, the rest being HbA, HbA₂ and HbF. The cells do not contain sufficient HbS to undergo sickling at the lowest oxygen tension normally occurring in the body, and the red cell lifespan is normal.</p>
                        <p>In the stained blood film, no sickle cells are present and the red cells appear normal. The MCV and MCH are also normal. However, sickling can readily be demonstrated by the sickle test, and the hemoglobin solubility test is positive. If the patient has concurrent $\alpha$-thalassemia, the red cells are microcytic with a mild reduction in MCV and a Hb-S concentration of <38%.</p>
                        <p>Sickle cell trait does not cause anemia, and in general is asymptomatic. If anemia is present, other causes, e.g. iron deficiency, should be sought. A high proportion of affected subjects show defects in urine concentrating ability, and hematuria is an occasional complication. Rare episodes of splenic infarction during flight at high altitude in nonpressurized aircraft have been described, and severe hypoxia resulting from administration of anesthetic agents and other respiratory depressants may in exceptional cases be associated with in vivo sickling and serious thromboembolic sequelae. There are some evidences that sickle cell trait is a risk factor for sudden death during unaccustomed exercise, but most epidemiological studies suggest that no selective morbidity or mortality is attributable to the condition.</p>

                        <h4>Sickle Cell Crises</h4>
                        <p>Incidence reduces with increasing age.</p>
                        
                        <h5>1. Vaso-occlusive Crises</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Are typically recurrent and potentially catastrophic</li>
                            <li>Clinical manifestations are sudden in onset and directly attributable to obstruction of the microcirculation by intravascular sickling</li>
                            <li>There is little or no change in hematologic values</li>

                                    <li>in children: fever, dehydration and acidosis.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Sometimes a history of recent exposure to cold may be obtained. Sudden changes in the altitude and travel in nonpressurized aircraft are less common antecedents.</p>
                        
                        <h6>Hand and Foot Syndrome</h6>
                        <p>The initial episode in young children often involves the small bones of hand and feet. The dorsa of hands and feet are swollen, nonerythematous, and very painful. Fever and leukocytosis are common. X-ray changes are limited to soft tissue swelling: Cortical thinning and marked destruction of metacarpals, metatarsals, and phalanges appear 2-3 weeks after the onset of symptoms. It may recur till the patient is about 3 years of age.</p>
                        
                        <h6>Bone and Joint Crises</h6>
                        <p>After about 3 years of age sludging of blood occurs in the larger bones of the extremities, the spine, rib cage and periarticular structures, producing bone and joint crises. Pain results from ischemia of bone, bone marrow, periosteum, or periarticular tissues. It is of gnawing character and progress in severity.</p>
                        
                        <h6>Abdominal Crises</h6>
                        <p>These are attributable to small infarcts of mesentery and abdominal viscera and are characterized by severe abdominal pain and signs of peritoneal irritation.</p>
                        
                        <h6>CNS Crises</h6>
                        <p>Occur in children and young adults. There is sudden occlusion of cerebral vessels. Hemiparesis, aphasia, seizures, sensory deficits and altered sensorium occur single or together. Intracerebral or subarachnoid hemorrhage may result from hypoxic necrosis of vessels. Cerebral angiography demonstrates stenosis and thrombotic involvement of medium and large vessels (in larger vessels the involvement initially is of vasa vasorum).</p>
                        
                        <h6>Pulmonary Crises</h6>
                        <p>Characterized by fever, tachypnea, chest pain, increased leukocytosis, pulmonary infiltrates and pulmonary crises are the single most common expressions of sickle cell anemia requiring hospitalization. These crises may occur alone or with pulmonary infections.</p>
                        
                        <h5>2. Hematologic Crises</h5>
                        <p>Hematologic crises, characterized by sudden exaggeration of anemia, are unrelated to vaso-occlusive crises. If unrecognized, the hemoglobin fall may be so acute as to cause heart failure and death within hours.</p>
                        
                        <h6>Aplastic Crises</h6>
                        <p>Temporary arrest of erythropoiesis usually is associated with or follows a febrile illness. In the early phase of a crisis, peripheral reticulocytes and bone marrow normoblasts disappear or are greatly reduced. The process is self-limited and erythropoiesis usually starts within 5 to 10 days with appearance of reticulocytes and normoblasts in the peripheral blood.</p>
                        
                        <h6>Splenic Sequestration Crises</h6>
                        <p>Characterized by sudden trapping of blood in the spleen. It occurs almost exclusively in infants and young children whose spleens are usually enlarged. The already enlarged spleen rapidly increases in size at the expense of blood volume. Hypovolemic shock and death may occur within hours.</p>
                        
                        <h6>Hemolytic Crises (Hyperhemolytic Crises)</h6>
                        <p>There is sudden acceleration of the hemolytic process. They have been described in association with G6PD deficiency and with hereditary spherocytosis. These crises also occur following challenge by oxidant drugs and infections.</p>
                        
                        <h6>Megaloblastic Crises</h6>
                        <p>These crises result from the sudden arrest of erythropoiesis by folate depletion. Chronic erythroid hyperplasia imposes a drain on folate reserves. Megaloblastic crises are likely to occur when food consumption is interrupted by illness or alcoholism or when folate requirement is further augmented by rapid growth or pregnancy.</p>
                        
                        <h5>3. Infectious Crises</h5>
                        <p>Infection is the major presenting manifestation of sickle cell anemia in early childhood. During the first 5 years of life, Str. pneumoniae is the major offending organism and the blood and spinal fluid (meningitis) are major sites of infection. Incidence of H. influenzae infection is also higher in these children. After 5 years of age. Gram-negative bacteria replace Str. pneumoniae as the major offenders. Osteomyelitis especially due to Salmonella is common in these patients. The pathophysiologic basis for increased susceptibility to aggressive infection is due in large part of the loss of spleen function.</p>
                        
                        <p>In addition, there are a number of other signs and symptoms:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Dorsal kyphosis, lumbar lordosis</li>
