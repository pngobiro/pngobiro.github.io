                        <p>The principal features differentiating Hodgkin's disease from non-Hodgkin's lymphoma are the presence of Reed-Sternberg giant-cells with their characteristic prominent nucleoli and the presence of variable numbers of lymphoid cells which are considered to be reactive to the disease rather than themselves being neoplastic. Hodgkin's tissue is also characterized by variable amounts of tissue necrosis and scarring and a tendency to spread to contiguous lymphoid tissue groups before distant hematogenous spread occurs. Non-Hodgkin's lymphomas are classified according to the primary cell type in the tumor, and also by whether the tumor is nodular or diffuse. There is little evidence of reaction by normal lymphocytes to the neoplastic process as judged by classical histological methods.</p>

                        <h3>NON-HODGKIN'S LYMPHOMA (NHL)</h3>
                        <p>Like Hodgkin's disease these tumors may arise at any age but show 2 peaks-(1) at childhood, and (2) from 50 years and onwards. Like Hodgkin's, males are affected twice more frequently than females. Broadly speaking the clinical presentation is more or less similar to Hodgkin's except for sites commonly involved. It shows less tendency to be confined to the axial lymph node structures than Hodgkin's at first presentation, and involvement of nasopharynx, tonsil and mesenteric structures is very much more common, as is involvement of the blood.</p>
                        <h4>Lymph Node Involvement</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Enlargement may be gradual or tender, developing in weeks and may cause obstruction and pressure symptoms</li>
                            <li>Extension outside the capsule induces pain</li>
                            <li>The poorly differentiated NHL cause more local invasion and tissue destruction</li>
                            <li>Involvement of epitrochlear lymph nodes is relatively common in nodular lymphocytic lymphomas.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Nasopharynx, Tonsil and GIT Involvement</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>These sites are involved much more commonly as compared to Hodgkin's disease.</li>
                            <li>In NHL (at autopsy) GI tract involvement is seen in 50-70% of cases. The most common sites being mesenteric lymph nodes, peritoneal deposits, hepatic involvement and involvement of small bowel.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h5>Nasopharyngeal/Tonsillar Involvement Causes</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Soreness/pain in the throat</li>
                            <li>Nasal obstruction or bleeding</li>
                            <li>Lump in throat, dysphagia</li>
                            <li>Regional nodal enlargement</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h5>GIT Involvement Causes</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>GI bleeding</li>
                            <li>Abdominal pain</li>
                            <li>Vomiting or weight loss</li>
                            <li>Steatorrhea (rarely)</li>
                            <li>Intestinal obstruction</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Massive enlargement of spleen is not uncommon and is frequently associated with coincident involvement of the liver. Extensive peritoneal deposits may cause ascites (usually chylous).</p>
                        <h4>Systemic Features</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Are less common than Hodgkin's disease except in the presence of local skin involvement</li>
                            <li>Pyrexia usually indicates secondary infection consequent on poor immune function. (These patients commonly have hypogammaglobulinemia, cell mediated immunity may also be impaired.)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Autoimmune Disorders</h4>
                        <p>These are more common in NHL and may give rise to acquired hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia.</p>

Once these causes have been excluded, either on history or with relevant tests, or where doubt remains as to the cause, the next step is to establish a tissue diagnosis by means of biopsy.

                        <h3>PRINCIPLES OF TREATMENT IN LYMPHOMA</h3>
                        <h4>General Considerations in Treatment</h4>
                        <h5>Advice to the Patient and Relatives</h5>
                        <p>One must explain to the patient in clear terms, and the temptation to shrink from explaining the nature of the disease should be resisted other than under exceptional circumstances. If patients are to undertake a prolonged course of treatment requiring tolerance of side-effects and cooperation with drug therapy, they must be able to comprehend the reasons for the discomfort, and be motivated to seek recovery from the disease. Anxieties on the part of the patient with respect to family responsibilities and personal and financial worries may present real problems in management, and should be explored as far as possible in the early stages of the illness. Explanation to the patient and relatives should cover both the nature of the disease and the grounds for optimism based on the known results of therapy. The nature of sideeffects that are likely to be experienced should be discussed to allay anxiety when they arise, and to ensure the fullest cooperation when supportive measures are necessary. The patient should be encouraged to lead a normal active life within the limitations of treatment, and every attempt should be made to keep hospitalization to a minimum.</p>
                        <h5>Therapy-its Objects</h5>
                        <p>The fact that a significant proportion of patients with lymphoma may be cured means that careful assessment must be made in every patient, both with respect to histological diagnosis and extent of disease, so that the most appropriate therapy is undertaken. The basic choice falls between radiotherapy and chemotherapeutic approaches, but within the second of these alternatives a choice must be made between aggressive combination chemotherapy, with its promise of long-term remission and cure, and simple palliative approaches. The decision between radical treatment, palliative therapy, or observation with no active therapy in each case is one of the considerable importance and is influenced by assessment of the patient's capacity to tolerate radical treatment, given all appropriate supportive assistance.</p>
                        <p>Radical radiotherapy is the treatment of choice in localized Hodgkin's disease. It is very often curative in nonbulky disease which is localized to regions to which appropriately high doses of radiation can be delivered. Chemotherapy is, on the other hand, the treatment of choice for widespread or recurrent disease (Table 14.3).</p>
                        <p>In non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, chemotherapy is the mainstay of management, and radiotherapy has a limited curative role.</p>

                        <p>The tremendously improved prognosis that follows radical radiation or chemotherapeutic management in responsive instances of this group of diseases has been described. Prognosis in Hodgkin's disease depends to an extent on the stage of disease when it presents. Patients with stage IA and IIA disease established by staging laparotomy, and who subsequently receive a full course of radiotherapy, have a survival at 5 years in excess of 85%, and although some relapses may occur for up to 10 years, the majority of these patients may be regarded as cured. Poor responses are commoner with lymphocyte depleted but no essential difference has been noted in remission rates between the other histological subtypes of the disorder. Adverse prognostic factors are disease in relapse after prior chemotherapy, the presence of a large mediastinal mass, advanced stage, and the presence of B symptoms.</p>
                        <p>Patients presenting with extensive Hodgkin's disease not amenable to radiation therapy, but treated with intensive combination chemotherapy, have complete remission rates of 75-85% after 6 months of MOPP treatment. Persistence of remission with values for reported, but most centres obtain values for disease-free survival of 50-60% in patients with extensive disease.</p>
                        <p>Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma has a much more variable outcome, and this is related to histological type.</p>
                        <p>Nodular and diffuse well-differentiated lymphocytic lymphomas have a relatively indolent course even in the untreated state, and in nodular lymphoma amenable to radiation treatment, median survival uncorrected for age is reported to be approximately 7.5 years.</p>
                        <p>Stage I and IE diffuse large-cell lymphoma treated by intensive radiotherapy also has a comparatively good prognosis, and approximately 75% of cases may be cured. More extensive disease may be cured by chemotherapy, but the overall prognosis is worse, the median survival ranging from 23 to 50 months with current regimens. More extensive and bulky disease, and increasing age are adverse prognostic factors, with stage IV large-cell lymphoma having a median survival of less than 12 months.</p>
