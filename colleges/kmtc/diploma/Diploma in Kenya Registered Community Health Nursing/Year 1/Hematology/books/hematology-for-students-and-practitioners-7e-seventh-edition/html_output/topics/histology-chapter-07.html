                        <p>Considered in this chapter are anemias occurring in association with other well-defined systemic disorders. Since anemia constitutes symptom of these disorders and its severity is proportional to the severity of the underlying disease-they are referred to as symtopmatic anemias. The disorders that can be mentioned here are infection, renal failure, malignancy, liver disease, endocrine disorders, collagen disease protein malnutrition and scurvy. The anemia of acute hemorrhage is also discussed here as no primary hemotological abnormality causes it.</p>
                        <p>Most of the anemias occurring in conjunction with disorders mentioned are normocytic, normochromic; however, macrocytic or microcytic anemias also can sometimes occur. These anemias are not a consequence of iron, vitamin B₁₂ or folic acid deficiency and, therefore, treatment with the same is useless. These anemias respond only to rectification of the causative disorder. Iron, however, is indicated in acute hemorrhagic anemia.</p>

                            <li>Hemoglobin and PCV values vary with the duration between hemorrhage and their estimation.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Immediately afterward-</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>No change</li>
                        </ul>

                            <li>Hemoglobin and PCV, both are reduced.</li>
                            <li>24-48 hours after the episode, first signs of regeneration are seen in the form of reticulocytosis, polychromatophilia, slight macrocytosis (younger RBCs are released).</li>
                            <li>With severe hemorrhage, sometimes even normoblasts may appear in peripheral circulation.</li>
                            <li>There is leukocytosis with neutrophilia (slight shift to the left may also occur, i.e. band forms or metamyelocytes may be seen on peripheral smear)</li>
                            <li>In addition, there is mild thrombocytosis too.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h3>HEMATOLOGIC FINDINGS</h3>
                        <p>Immediately following a hemorrhage, the plasma volume and red cell mass are reduced in proportional amounts; therefore, no decrease is observed in the volume of packed red cells (VPRC). Because of the time required to effect restoration of the blood volume, the amount of blood loss tends to be underestimated by the degree of anemia, especially early in the disease course. The VPRC may not reach the minimum value until 3 day or more after the hemorrhage ceases.</p>
                        <p>On first detection, the anemia is normocytic, normochormic with few signs of erythrocytic regeneration. Some increase in reticulocytes is usually perceptible within 3-5 days, and maximal values are reached at 6-11 days. Reticulocytosis is proportionate to degree of hemorrhage but rarely exceeds 15%. Other signs of erythrocyte regeneration include polychromatophilia and macrocytosis, and the MCV may transiently increase. If first seen at this stage, the finding may be confused with hemolytic anemia: however, signs of hyperbilirubinemia are conspicuously absent, unless the bleeding has occurred into a body cavity or tissue space.</p>
                        <p>During or immediately following hemorrhage, the platelet count, whole blood coagulation time, and plasma fibrinogen levels may be reduced. These abnormalities are usually transient and tend to disappear within 15 minutes after cessation of bleeding. Thereafter there is thrombocytosis within one hour, values as high as 10 lakh/mm³ are observed. If severe shock develops, disseminated intravascular coagulation may complicate the picture.</p>
                        <p>Neutrophilic leukocytosis often follows hemorrhage, reaching maximal levels at 2-5 hours. Typically TLC is between 10,000 and 20,000 cells/mm³ but may reach as high as 35,000 cells/mm³.</p>
                        
                        <h3>CLINICAL ASPECTS</h3>

                            <li>These depend upon rate and amount of blood lost</li>
                            <li>Blood volume reduction may lead to:

                        <h3>CLINICAL DESCRIPTION</h3>
                        <p>Most young, healthy subjects can tolerate the rapid loss of 500-1000 mL of blood (10-20% of the blood volume) with few if any symptoms. About 5% of the patients, however, experience a vasovagal syncope to blood loss of this magnitude. The reaction consists of weakness, sweating, nausea, and a fall in heartrate and blood pressure, often followed by light-headedness and loss of consciousness. Whether these individuals react as they do because of physiologic or psychic differences in their makeup is unknown. However, they show two dominant personality traits: hypochondriasis and a tendency to react to stress with hopelessness, depression and despair.</p>
                        <p>With loss of 1000-1500 mL of blood (20-30% of blood volume), previously healthy subjects remain asymptomatic while at rest in a recumbent position, but they may experience light-headedness and hypotension when upright. They also respond to exertion with an unusual degree of tachycardia.</p>
                        <p>After losing 1500-2000 mL (30-40% of the blood volume), symptoms develop even when the subject is recumbent. Thirst, shortness of breath, clouding or loss of consciousness, and sweating appear. The blood pressure, cardiac output and central venous pressure decrease. The pulse usually becomes rapid and feeble; however, the vasovagal reaction develop bradycardia.</p>
                        <p>A redistribution of blood flow occurs as the result of adrenergic stimulation; flow to the heart, lungs, liver and brain is favored at the expense of the skin, muscles, kidneys and GI tract. Consequently, the skin, especially that of the extremities, becomes cold, clammy and pale. Urine volume decreases, and salt and water are conserved because of decreased renal blood flow and the actions of aldosterone and antidiuretic hormone.</p>
                        <p>With rapid blood loss exceeding 2000-2500 mL (40-50% of the blood volume), a severe state of shock ensues. Lactate acidosis resulting from inadequate tissue perfusion may be found. At this stage, their is significant risk that the shock will become irreversible, leading to fatality.</p>
                        <p>After sufficient time has elapsed and blood volume is restored toward normal, either by physiologic mechanisms or with appropriate fluid replacement therapy. The manifestations of anemia appear now.</p>
                        
                        <h3>PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</h3>
                        <p>After acute hemorrhage, physiologic mechanisms come into play to restore blood volume by an influx of fluid containing protein and electrolytes. This restoration occurs in 2 phases. The first is a partial restitution brought about in response to a fall in capillary pressure. This phase is followed by a slower restoration of both volume and protein that may take several days. This second phase results from a shift of intracellular fluid to the interstitium and from there to the intravascular compartment. In recumbent subjects, most of the expansion of plasma volume occurs within 24 hours, chiefly by movements of water and electrolytes. In ambulatory patients, the plasma volume expansion is accomplished more slowly and is related primarily to mobilisation of the extravascular albumin pool. With large hemorrhages (>30% of blood volume), the second phase is impaired by forces tending to drive fluid into cells, countering the outflow.</p>
                        <p>As restoration of volume occurs and anemia manifests, erythropoietin secretion increases. Under its influence erythropoiesis is augmented. Erythroid hyperplasia is usually perceptible 3-5 days after hemorrhage. With hemorrhagic anemia, in contrast to hemolytic anemia, the rate of red cell production may be restricted by the availability of iron, even in the absence of iron deficiency.</p>
                        <p>Iron must be drawn from ferritin and hemosiderin stored in macrophages, a relatively slow process compared to mobilization of iron newly extracted from destroyed red cells. Marrow turnover after hemorrhage may be limited to about three times the normal level, compared with five or even eight times normal in chronic hemolytic anemia states. Also iron supply may be restricted by the effects of concurrent inflammation. Surgery and trauma often trigger the mechanisms leading to the anemia of chronic disorders and the disturbance in iron metabolism that accompanies it.</p>
                        
                        <h3>MANAGEMENT</h3>
                        <p>Most important is to restrict further blood loss. Simultaneously, efforts should be aimed at restoring blood volume. This procedure is more important than providing red cells. Whole blood was formerly recommended for volume expansion on the grounds that it constituted a direct replacement for what was lost. However, without losing time for typing and cross-matching one must immediately start at least normal saline or Ringer's lactate (these are less expensive and usually satisfactory). Colloids, such as albumin, dextran or hydroxyethyl starch, are more effective in restoring blood volume and can do so with smaller infusion volumes. However, they are considerably more expensive and their clinical superiority has not been clearly established.</p>
                        <p>Once blood volume has been restored, the question of red blood cell transfusion can now be addressed. This decision rests more on a careful assessment of clinical signs and symptoms than on laboratory values. The important symptoms are syncope, dyspnea, postural hypotension, tachycardia, angina, and transient ischemic attacks. If any of these are present, transfusion of red blood cells is indicated. Administration of red cells to establish or maintain a certain blood hemoglobin level is much less important, but values below 7 g/dL normally require transfusion even in asymptomatic individuals.</p>
                        <p>Anemia following hemorrhage rarely requires specific therapy. If iron stores are adequate, the marrow is capable of regenerating the lost red cells, and the rate of regeneration is not accelerated by the administration of hematinics. As a rule, no matter how great the blood loss, the RBC count reaches 4.5 million/mm³ by about 33 days. Hemoglobin values reach normal levels by about 2 months. Morphologic evidence of active red cell regeneration should disappear after 10-14 days, if hemorrhage does not recur. The leuocyte count should be normal after 3-4 days. Sustained reticulocytosis is suggestive of continued bleeding. Persistent leukocytosis may result from the same cause, from hemorrhage into body cavities, or from complications. The latter, particularly infections, tend to delay the hematopoietic response.</p>
                        
                        <h3>TREATMENT</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Arrest of blood loss when possible, and</li>
                            <li>Restoration of blood volume to normal.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>On priority basis immediately give plasma expanders like dextran to maintain cardiac output. Blood transfusion may be given. As blood loss leads to iron loss, hence iron supplimentation for 1-2 months if body iron stores are inadequate.</p>

                            <li>Severe anemia may occur in septicemia and massive infections, otherwise severe anemia should make one think in terms of blood loss or renal failure.</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Serum iron decreased (average values noted = about 40 $\mu$g%)</li>
                            <li>Serum transferrin decreased (average values noted = 200 $\mu$g%).</li>
                            <li>Free erythrocyte protoporphyrin is increased</li>
                            <li>Plasma copper also increases.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Blood loss and acute hemolysis are occasional contributing factors. For instance, blood loss may occur from a lung abscess or a chronic discharging sinus. The acute severe anemia which may develop with septicemia and virulent acute infections is due to both toxic depression of erythropoiesis and hemolysis. The anemia of Clostridium welchii is usually frankly hemolytic. Rarely, viral infections cause an autoimmune acquired hemolytic anemia. In G6PD deficiency, transient acute hemolysis may be precipitated either by the infection or by drugs given.</p>

                            <li>Iron, vitamin B₁₂ and folic acid are useless</li>

                        <p>If tuberculosis is restricted to one lung or organ, there may not be any anemia, with acute miliary spread a moderate normochromic or slightly hypochromic anemia is the rule. Rare hematological complications of tuberculosis are myelosclerosis, tuberculous splenomegaly, pancytopenia and leukemoid reaction.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Anemia is an almost invariable manifestation of chronic renal failure, often contributing substantially to the morbidity of the condition. It may be considered as typical of the disease as azotemia. Ther term anemia of chronic renal insufficiency refers to that anemia resulting directly from failure of the endocrine and excretory functions of the kidney. Kidney is the major sourse of erythropoietin, and the ability to secrete this hormone is lost as the kidney fails. In addition, renal failure is associated with retention of a variety of potentially toxic substances, including some that inhibit erythropoiesis and others that shorten RBC survival.</p>
                        <p>Lack of sufficient erythropoietin is by far the most important feature of these anemia-causing factors; consequently, the hypoproliferative features of the anemia tend to predominate. Other complicating factors also contribute. If the kidneys are infected or inflammed, the anemia of chronic disorders is likely to be observed. Iron-deficiency anemia may develop because of blood loss from the genitourinary or gastrointestinal tract or into the hemodialysis apparatus. The megaloblastic anemia of folate deficiency also may occur in patients receiving periodic dialysis, but otherwise only rarely, unless dietary intake is poor or the patient is vomiting. Certain types of renal disease, including the hemolytic-uremic syndrome and malignant hypertension, are associated with microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. Finally, aluminium intoxication can cause microcytic anemia in dialysis patients.</p>
                        <p>Anemia may sometimes be the first presentation for a patient to seek medical assistance in chronic renal failure.</p>
                        
                        <h3>ETIOLOGY</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Anemia tends to be severe in renal disease with infection, as in
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Chronic pyelonephritis</li>
                                    <li>Chronic nephritis</li>
                                    <li>Cystic disease of the kidney</li>
                                    <li>Urinary tract obstruction and</li>
                                    <li>Renal tuberculosis</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>It also occurs in systemic disease with renal involvement, as in
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Disseminated lupus erythematosus</li>
                                    <li>Polyarteritis</li>
                                    <li>Amyloid diease</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>Anemia is usual in malignant hypertension (in malignant hypertension and other forms of progressive renal failure, the hematological picture of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia develops due to intravascular thrombosis or fibrin deposition).</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Chronic renal failure occurs during the final stages of severe renal disease. As a rule, the nature of the underlying disease bears little relation to the degree of anemia, although anemia may be less severe in patients with hypertensive renal disease and considerably less severe in patients with polycystic disease. Apparently, the erythropoietin-secreting function of the kidney is preserved in polycystic disease, even when excretory function is lost. In most cases, the patient seeks medical attention because of symptoms related to the underlying renal disease and anemia is an incidental finding. The severity of anemia bears a rough relationship to the degree of renal insufficiency. Anemia is not apparent until the creatinine clearance falls below 40 mL/minute/1.73 m². Between 2 and 40 mL/minute/1.73 m², a statistically significant correlation between creatinine clearance and VPRC has been observed. Similar relationship has been reported between glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and blood hemoglobin concentration and between the blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and the degree of anemia. Oliguria is another predictor of anemia.</p>
                        
                        <h3>MECHANISMS INVOLVED IN ANEMIA OF RENAL DISEASE</h3>
                        <h4>Hypoproliferative Anemia</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Diminished erythropoietin-diminished erythroid committed precursors</li>
                            <li>Suppressive effects of uraemic toxins on erythroid precursors</li>
                            <li>Folate deficiency (hemodialysis)</li>

                        <h4>Blood Loss Anemia</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Gastrointestinal bleeding</li>

                        <h3>BLOOD PICTURE (Fig. 7.1)</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Anemia is unusual when the blood urea is less than 7 mmol/L (40 mg%).</li>
                            <li>Anemia is almost invariable with any significant degree of nitrogen retention. As the blood urea rises from 8 to 40 mmol/L (250 mg%) the hemoglobin progressively falls at the rate of about 2 g% for every rise of 8 mmol (50 mg%) in blood urea. A progressive severe anemia is more likely to be associated with a microangiopathic hemolytic anemia.</li>
                            <li>The anemia is characteristically normochromic and normocytic but slight macrocytosis is usually abserved. Polychromatophilia is unusual. Moderate anisocytosis is common. In later stages large numbers of 'burr' cells are seen. The appearance of schistocytes, helmet cells and microspherocytes heralds development of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. The reticulocyte count is usually normal. TLC may be raised in association with infection. Platelet count is normal but their function is found to be abnormal in about 33% of the cases. ESR is nearly always raised.</li>

                        </figure>

                        <h3>OTHER LABORATORY FINDINGS</h3>
                        <p>Anemia may progress as renal failure worsens but in most cases VPRC usually stabilizes between 15 and 30%. Because regulation of body water and electrolyte balance is impaired in renal disease, both hydremia and dehydration are common. Consequently, the apparent degree of anemia may be exaggerated or minimised by alterations in plasma volume.</p>
                        <p>At very high BUN values, reticulocytosis may reach 6%. TLC is often normal, but sometimes slight neutrophilic leukocytosis may be observed. The bone marrow tends to be moderately hypercellular and slight erythroid hyperplasia may be observed, average M:E ratio being 2.5:1. When renal failure is relatively acute, hypoplasia of erythroid elements is found. Values for serum iron vary considerably in renal disease. As a rule, the value is normal when renal impairment is mild. The amount of free erythrocyte protoporphyrin (also called erythrocyte zinc protoporphyrin, EZP) may be normal or moderately increased. The erythrocyte LDH is within normal limits. The hemoglobin A1 fraction tends to be higher in uremic patients. The magnitude of the increase usually correlates with the average value of BUN over the preceding 2-3 months.</p>
                        <p>The increase is thought to result from carbamylation of the hemoglobin molecule by urea-derived cyanate; it can be detected by column chromatography but not by using certain chemical methods designed for detecting glycosylated hemoglobin in diabetic patients. The increase in A₁ fraction may continue even after successful renal transplantation has brought the azotemia under control; under such circumstances, the increase might reflect disturbed carbohydrate metabolism.</p>
                        
                        <h3>PATHOGENESIS</h3>
                        <p>Three factors are involved in the pathogenesis of anemia associated with chronic renal failure:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Most important being impaired secretion of erythropoietin</li>
                            <li>Marrow depressive effect of retained toxic substances</li>
                            <li>Shortened erythrocyte life.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>As excretory function of the kidney decreases, so does its ability to secrete erythropoietin. Radioimmunoassay studies have shown an increase in erythropoietin levels. Immunologically active, this erythropoietin is biologically inactive. Furthermore, the usual negative correlation between serum levels of erythropoietin and hemoglobin is lost. Extrarenal sources of erythropoietin exist in our body but production by these sources cannot offset the anemia as is possible by the renal origin erythropoietin.</p>
                        <p>Retained uremic toxins may depress erythropoiesis. Erythropoiesis improves in dialysed patients. Uremic plasma can depress heme synthesis and/or inhibit growth of erythroid colonies in vitro. Secondary hyperparathyroidism may also contribute to marrow depression in patients with renal failure. The VPRC increases modestly in about 40-50% of patients with renal failure who undergo parathyroidectomy.</p>
                        <p>Administration of erythropoietin relieves anemia to an extent. The occasional failure to respond to erythropoietin generally can be attributed to the coexisting iron deficiency or other complications.</p>
                        <p>A third pathogenetic factor is hemolysis. Erythrocyte survival often within normal limits, may be slightly to moderately reduced. Red cell life reduces as azotemia increases.</p>
                        
                        <h3>DIAGNOSIS</h3>
                        <p>Chronic renal failure should be considered as a possible cause for any normochromic anemia in which the etiology is not obvious; seek a detailed history, especially pertaining to urinary system.</p>
                        
                        <h3>TREATMENT</h3>
                        <p>Anemia is refractory to all measures except those that reduce blood urea. The availability of recombinant human erythropoietin has made considerable difference in the well-being of these patients.</p>
                        <p>Recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) has been used for treatment of the anemia of renal disease. It is safe and effective and it substantially improves the quality of life and cognitive functions. Although costly, it is often the treatment of choice. It can be given intravenously or subcutaneously. Iron supplementation is also necessary. Lesser therapeutic roles are ascribed to folate administration, blood transfusions and other rarer forms of therapy.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Early Treatment</h4>
                        <p>In some patients, anemia develops before specific treatment of the renal failure is necessary. rHuEPO helps with good results. 50 IU/kg subcutaneously three times weekly, suffices, physical and intellectual abilities improve.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Homotransplantation</h4>
                        <p>In many ways, renal transplantation is the most complete and satisfactory treatment for renal insufficiency. When a renal homograft is successful, both the endocrinologic and excretory functions of the kidney are restored. With a successful graft, the hematologic response is gratifying. Anemia is usually corrected in 2-3 months, this occurs on account of erythropoietin secretion by the grafted kidney. About 20% of these patients do not behave in this way. Failure to respond usually can be explained on the basis of hemorrhage, vigorous immunosuppression or graft rejection.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Hemodialysis</h4>
                        <p>About 60% of the patients (more so in India) with end stage renal disease are treated with maintenance hemodialysis. It controls most of the symptoms and biochemical manifestation of renal failure, but erythropoietin secretion does not improve and anemia continues to be a major source of morbidity. PCV usually stabilizes at 15%. After 1-10 months or more of treatment, modest improvement in degree of anemia or in transfusion requirements has been observed. The improvement results chiefly from an increase in red cell production, even though erythropoietin levels do not increase. The use of rHuEPO has revolutionized the care of hemodialysis patients. It is a safe but an expensive mode of treatment. Initial dose is 50-100 IU/kg three times weekly, given IV or SC. Further dose is adjusted depending upon the response. An additional increment of 12.5-50 IU/kg is added to each dose. Once the target range of 9-11 g/dL of hemoglobin is achieved, the maintenance dose required is often less than 150 IU/kg. Over 97% of cases respond and PCV rises from 22-35% within 3 months. The need for erythrocyte transfusion is eliminated in all patients within 2 months.</p>
                        <p>Other treatments include blood transfusions and androgens, but their use is rendered obsolete with the advent of rHuEPO. In some patients where splenic sequestration of erythrocytes occurs, splenectomy is known to help.</p>
                        
                        <h3>ERYTHROPOIETIN RESISTANCE</h3>
                        <p>Causes of resistance to erythropoietin therapy</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Iron deficiency</li>
                            <li>Insufficient dialysis</li>
                            <li>Aluminium intoxication</li>
                            <li>Hyperparathyroidism</li>
                            <li>Vitamin B₁₂ or folate deficiency</li>
                            <li>Blood loss</li>
                            <li>Inhibitor cytokines
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Infections</li>
                                    <li>Inflammation</li>
                                    <li>Neoplasms</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors</li>
                            <li>After failed homograft</li>
                            <li>Hemoglobinopathies</li>
                            <li>Unknown factors.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Loss of iron occurs with repeated dialysis. Patients with serum ferritin levels below 100-200 $\mu$g/L or with transferrin saturation values less then 20-25%, require iron supplementation. Some therapists recommend iron supplementation for all patients. Iron can be given IV if compliance is poor to oral iron administation.</p>
                        <p>Secondary hyperparathyroidism often accompanies renal failure, and the associated marrow fibrosis may contribute to the anemia and to erythropoietin resistance. Treatment with vitamin D₃ can decrease rHuEPO requirements and improve hemoglobin values. Many patients require vitamin B₁₂ and folate administration as well.</p>
                        <p><strong>Side effects of rHuEPO:</strong> No important side effects have been associated with rHuEPO administration in diseases other than renal failure. When it is used for anemia in renal disease, however, increased blood pressure is an important complication (seen in up to 35% of cases). Occasionally, the hypertension is abrupt and severe with encephalopathy and seizures. The pathogenesis of hypertension is incompletely understood and probably multifactorial.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Peritoneal Dialysis</h4>
                        <p>Fair number of end-stage renal disease patients are treated with peritoneal dialysis and the severity of anemia is less marked in these patients as compared to those on hemodialysis peritoneal dialysed patients can also be given rHuEPO. Administration of 20 IU/kg three times weekly or 10 IU/kg daily by SC route helps a great deal.</p>

                        <h3>TYPE OF ANEMIA</h3>
                        <p>The anemia is usually normocytic but hypochromic microcytic anemia of iron deficiency occurs in patients with chronic blood loss. Occasionally a slight to moderate macrocytosis is present, e.g. with the leukoerythroblastic anemia of secondary bone metastases, or when reticulocytes are increased either as a result of hemorrhage or hemolysis.</p>
                        <p>Other blood changes include leukocytosis because of a necrotic and infected tumor, raised ESR, changes in iron metabolism, coagulation disorders (DIC). Eosinophilia is also relatively common.</p>
                        
                        <h3>ANEMIA ASSOCIATED WITH SECONDARY CARCINOMA OF THE BONE MARROW</h3>
                        <p>After lungs, liver, the bone marrow is the third most important site for blood-borne metastases. Breast and prostate (quite commonly) and carcinomas of lung, thyroid, kidney, stomach and malignant melanomas also commonly metastasise to bone marrow. Metastatic growths most frequently occur in the site normally occupied by the red bone marrow namely, the vertebrae, ribs, sternum, pelvis, skull and upper ends of the femora and humeri. When secondary growths occur in yellow-marrow sites, they evoke red marrow transformation and are ringed by it. Extent of bone marrow involvement does not necessarily correspond to degree of anemia evoked.</p>
                        
                        <h4>BLOOD PICTURE</h4>
                        <p>The blood picture is usually a normochromic normocytic anemia or pancytopenia or that of a leukoerythroblastic anemia, i.e. characterized by the presence of immature red and white cells. Anemia is often only moderate but with progression of disease it becomes severe.</p>
                        <p>Slight hypochromia may be present; moderate to marked anisopoikilocytosis are common. Macrocytes are often present in moderate numbers. Moderate polychromasia and basophilic stippling are common. Reticulocyte count may be raised. Normoblastemia may be 10 normoblasts per 100 WBCs (normoblasts are usually late and intermediate but sometimes early normoblasts can also be seen). This picture brings in the differential diagnosis of microangiopathic hemolysis, often associated with mucin secreting adenocarcinomas and usually associated with red cell fragmentation, thrombocytopenia and sometimes with a coagulation disturbance. Megakaryocytes may be rarely seen and be confused with circulating tumor cells.</p>
                        <p>The TLC is variable, the DLC shows a shift to left (irrespective of the total count). Moderate to marked thrombocytopenia is usual. ESR is usually raised. Occasionally, the red cell osmotic fragility is raised and rarely the Coombs' test is positive.</p>
                        
                        <h4>BONE MARROW</h4>
                        <p>Tumor cells may be seen in the aspirated marrow but trephine biopsy yields better results. Aspiration may sometimes yield a dry or blood tap. A dry tap may result if the site of puncture has been replaced by fibrous tissue or bony tissue. A negative biopsy does not necessarily rule out marrow infiltration. Tumor cells are characteristically large cells which appear in clumps. It is sometimes necessary to examine six or more films before tumour cells can be seen.</p>
                        
                        <h4>CLINICAL ASPECTS</h4>
                        <p>The clinical features are those of:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>The anemia (weakness, lassitude, pallor, dyspnea, etc.)</li>
                            <li>The manifestations of bone involvement (fractures, spontaneous bleeding)</li>
                            <li>The primary tumor (weight loss, fever), and</li>
                            <li>Metastatic involvement of other organs (hepato- and/or splenomegaly, jaundice).</li>
                        </ol>
                        
                        <h4>DIAGNOSIS</h4>
                        <p>When primary site is obvious and radiological changes are present, the diagnosis of metastatic bone carcinoma is simple. The raised serum alkaline phosphatase provides ample evidence.</p>
                        <p>Diagnostic problem may arise when (i) anemia or bleeding is the presenting manifestation, and (ii) when radiological bony changes are absent.</p>
                        
                        <h4>PROGNOSIS</h4>
                        <p>Leukoerythroblastic anemia occurs late in the disease and is a poor prognostic sign. In untreated patients death usually occurs in less than a year, often within 1 or 2 months.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Anemia is a common feature of liver disease, especially with cirrhosis (occurs in 66% of cirrhotics).</p>
                        <p>Anemia is particularly characteristic of Laennec cirrhosis. Changes in the morphologic characteristics of red cells, reduced red cell survival, and even mild anemia, however, have been reported in association with certain other liver diseases, including biliary cirrhosis, hemochromatosis, postnecrotic cirrhosis, and acute hepatitis. Anemia is also associated with Wilson's disease.</p>
                        <p>Many complicating factors contribute to the development of anemia in patients with alcoholic liver disease. Of particular importance is suppression of bone marrow by alcohol. Chronic alcoholics can develop a characteristic sideroblastic anemia, often accompanied by impaired folate metabolism or overt folate deficiency. Also common in cirrhosis is hemorrhage especially from the upper gastrointestinal tract, but loss of blood from the nose, hemorrhoids, and the uterus often occurs in association with a common disturbance of hemostasis. Mild-to-moderate anemia may be associated with liver disease in the absence of the aforementioned complicating factors. It is referred to as the "uncomplicated" anemia of liver disease. To a greater extent-hypervolemia, shortened red cell survival, and impaired ability of the marrow to respond optimally to anemia-are held responsible for this.</p>
                        <p>About 75% of patients with chronic liver disease develop anemia as defined by VPRC or hemoglobin. The whole blood volume averages about 15% higher than normal and this hemodilution tends to exaggerate the prevalence and degree of anemia. The magnitude of hypervolemia in Laennec's cirrhosis appears to be related to the degree of portal hypertension, but not to the presence or absence of ascites.</p>
                        <p>The anemia is usually mild to moderate. Hemoglobin rarely falls below 9 g/dL in the absence of complications. About 5% of cases of relatively severe hepatocellular disease develop spur cell hemolytic anemia and hemoglobin may reach up to 5 g/dL. Spur cell anemia may be chronic accompaniment of alcoholic cirrhosis, or it may develop as liver function deteriorates within weeks to months of death. If liver function improves, remission may occur. Spur cell anemia also affects infants with cholestatic liver disease. Episodes of hemolytic anemia may also develop in alcohol abusers with relatively mild liver disease. These episodes, mild to moderate in severity, tend to be self-limited and resolve in 2-4 weeks if alcohol is withdrawn. If accompanied by jaundice and hyperlipidemia, the condition sometimes known as Zieve's syndrome; however, hyperbilirubinemia and hyperlipidemia are not implicated in the hemolysis. Liver at this stage shows fatty infiltration.</p>

                        <p>The blood picture varies with the causative factors. Anemia does not parallel the severity of altered liver function tests. Hemoglobin is usually about 9 g%. Lower values should arouse suspicion of some complicating factor, e.g. blood loss or nutritional megalobastic anemia. The anemia is macrocytic or normocytic and normochromic. Three types of macrocytes are described:</p>
                        
                        <h4>Thin Macrocyte</h4>
                        <p>Thin macrocyte occurs in response to nonspecific liver damage, bone marrow shows macronormoblastic reaction, it may occur in all types of liver damage and obstructive jaundice.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Thick Macrocyte</h4>
                        <p>Thick macrocyte (MCV increased) occurs only in patients with hepatic disease with protein malnutrition, bone marrow shows atypical megaloblastosis.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Target Macrocyte</h4>
                        <p>Target macrocyte target cells are commonly present in moderate numbers especially in jaundiced patients.</p>
                        <p>Moderate reticulocytosis (up to 5%), together with moderate polychromasia and basophilic stippling is seen.</p>
                        <p>When spur cell anemia supervenes, characteristic acanthocytes - erythrocytes covered with 5-10 spikelike projections are evident. The acanthocytes are morphologically indistinguishable from the distorted erythrocytes found in patients with abetalipoproteinemia. Stomatocytes are sometimes observed in association with the transient hemolytic episodes associated with acute fatty liver disease, but they are noted in alcoholics who display no evidence of hemolysis.</p>
                        <p>About 50% of patients with cirrhosis have mild thrombocytopenia (averaging above 50,000/mm³), platelet function too may be impaired.</p>
                        <p>TLC is normal in the absence of complications. Leukopenia may result from hypersplenism or megaloblastic anemia and leukocytosis from acute bleeding infection, etc. There is often a mild absolute lymphopenia irrespective of TLC, ESR is often raised.</p>
                        <p>Bone marrow cellularity varies, reaction is normo- or macronormoblastic. Leukopoiesis is normal as are the megakaryocytes. Plasma cells may be increased. The iron content is normal.</p>
                        
                        <h3>ERYTHROKINETICS AND PATHOGENESIS</h3>
                        <p>Red cell survival tends to be moderately shortened in patients with alcoholic liver disease. The rate of red cell destruction or disappearance correlates well with anemia. Erythrocyte survival is particularly likely to be reduced in patients with predominant indirect bilirubinemia, that is, when the indirect fraction is greater than 2.5 mg/dL and constitutes more than 70% of the total. Erythrocyte survival is significantly shortened in patients with biliary cirrhosis, obstructive jaundice, and infectious hepatitis, even in the absence of anemia. Hemolytic factor when present in chronic liver disease is thought to be of extracorpuscular origin. Congestive splenomegaly with augmented splenic sequestration as well as excessive splenic conditioning and destruction of red cells, is probably the most important extracorpuscular factor. Sometimes, splenectomy may help a few patients. Abnormal erythrocyte metabolism is another possible factor leading to reduced erythrocyte survival in liver disease. The possible reasons are NADP deficiency, hypophosphatemia with reduced erythrocyte ATP levels and consequent hemolysis.</p>
                        <p>Characteristic red cell membrane lipids are found in patients with hepatits, cirrhosis, and obstructive jaundice. In the usual uncomplicated case, a 25-50% increase in both cholesterol and lecithin is noted in the membrane. These changes result in an increased cell surface area associated with the target cells or thin microcytes that are so characteristic of liver disease. No good evidence exists that such abnormalities shorten the erythrocyte life span.</p>
                        <p>The loss of sialic acid from the red cell surface may contribute to impaired viability of the cell. Bile duct obstruction leads to an increase in the activity of neuraminadases, enzymes that remove sialic acid.</p>
                        <p>In spur cell hemolytic anemia, the erythrocyte membrane accumulates excess cholesterol, without a corresponding increase in lecithin. This change is accompanied by pronounced reduction in erythrocyte survival, probably because the distorted cells are less deformable than normal and thus become trapped by splenic macrophages. Splenic conditioning aggravates the abnormality by causing loss of cell surface with transformation of echinocytes to acanthocytes. Splenectomy may bring about reduction in hemolysis, but an intact spleen is not required for the development of spur cell anemia. The mechanism whereby the red cell lipid pattern becomes altered is ill understood. One possible factor is an alteration in the cholesterol-phospholipid ratio in high density plasma lipoproteins. Mature erythrocytes are unable to synthesize lipids and depend largely on plasma lipoproteins for renewal and replacement. In addition, red cells normally are actively involved in phospholipid repair, and the repair process appears to be defective in spur cell anemia. Phospholipid biosynthesis is inhibited and therefore cannot compensate for the increased membrane cholesterol characteristic of liver disease. Other possible factors in the development of altered membrane lipids are changes in plasma lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) activity, retention of lytic bile acids, and an increase in the intrinsic proteolytic activity of the membrane.</p>

                        <h3>RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS</h3>
                        <p>Anemia in these patients is usually mild to moderate. Two types of anemias may be seen.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>The normocytic normochromic one (more common) that parallels the severity of disease, and</li>
                            <li>Microcytic hypochromic anemia, due to concomitant iron deficiency as a result of blood loss arising because of chronic aspirin ingestion.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Leukocytosis may occur in acute phases. Eosinophilia occurs occasionally. ESR is raised. The reticulocyte count and serum bilirubin are normal. Bone marrow is essentially normal.</p>
                        <h4>Pathogenesis</h4>
                        <p>The mechanism of anemia of rheumatoid arthritis is more or less similar to that of the anemia of chronic infection. Treatment is to combat the disease itself, remission of the disease is spontaneously followed by a rise in the hemoglobin. Iron may be given in cases showing microcytic hypochromic anemia.</p>
                        
                        <h3>SYSTEMIC LUPUS ERYTHEMATOSUS (SLE)</h3>
                        <p>Hematological changes almost invariably occur at some stage of the disorder. Occasionally, ITP and acquired hemolytic anemia may be the first manifestations.</p>
                        <h4>Anemia</h4>
                        <p>Anemia occurs in about 75% of the cases. It is usually normocytic normochromic or slightly hypochromic and of mild to moderate severity, lower values may occur in patients with acquired hemolytic anemia or renal insufficiency. Autoimmune acquired hemolytic anemia with a positive Coombs' test develops in about 5% of the cases.</p>
                        <h4>White Cell Count</h4>
                        <p>It is often low (may be variable). The DLC shows greater reduction in lymphocytes than neutrophils.</p>
                        <h4>Thrombocytopenia</h4>
                        <p>Moderate symptomless thrombocytopenia is common. The ESR is raised in most of the patients. Values over 100 mm/hour (Westergren's) are not uncommon. A false-positive Wassermann reaction occurs in about 20% of cases and the serum complement is lowered in the presence of active renal involvement. A raised serum globulin is common and antibodies to DNA are usually detectable by a number of methods. Bone marrow is normal except for a moderate increase in plasma cells.</p>
                        
                        <h4>LE Cell Phenomenon</h4>
                        <p>LE cell was first described in 1948 in bone marrow of the DLE patients. It can be shown in peripheral blood also. It is positive in about 82% of established SLE cases. A positive test is pathognomic of lupus, especially in patients with typical clinical features. Positive LE cells can also be found in other collagen disorder, chronic lupoid hepatitis, drug induced lupus syndromes (especially with procainamide) (Fig. 7.2).</p>

                        </figure>
                        <p>The LE cell consists of a leukocyte, almost invariably a neutrophil, whose cytoplasm contains a large, spherical, opaque, structureless homogenous body, which stains pale purple with Romanowsky stains. The nucleus of the cell is usually displaced to one side and may appear to be wrapped around the ingested material. The LE cell must be distinguished from the "Tart cell", which is often found in LE cell preparations and may cause confusion. The 'Tart cell' is a monocyte or neutrophil which has phagocytosed another cell or the nucleus of another cell. It differs from LE cell in that the phagocytosed nuclear material either has a definite nuclear structure or is pyknotic and stains much more deeply than an LE body. The significance of 'Tart' cell is as yet not known (Fig. 7.3).</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_09_20_6dc34e0338b37aad296bg-158-2.jpg" alt="A micrograph of a Tart cell, a monocyte or neutrophil that has phagocytosed nuclear material, which must be distinguished from an LE cell." class="content-image">

                        </figure>
                        <p>The LE cell phenomenon depends on the presence in plasma of an immunologically distinct gamma globulin, the LE factor, which has the characteristics of an antibody of the IgG type. This factor has the property of causing in vitro lysis of the nuclei of neutrophils; as it reacts with autologous nuclei it can be regarded as an autoantibody. The neutrophil whose nucleus has undergone lysis ruptures liberating the lysed nuclear mass, which is then phagocytosed by other neutrophils. The exact mechanism for this is ill-understood. It is thought that the LE factor is an autoantibody to deoxyribonucleohistone, and that the formation of the LE cell is initiated by its actions on the nucleoprotein nucleus of the cell. Antibodies to other nuclear consitutents may be present but they do not appear to be capable of initiating LE cell formation; however, they may contribute to the final morphological appearance of the altered nucleus.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h3>ANEMIA ASSOCIATED WITH ENDOCRINE DISORDERS</h3>
                        <p>Anemia commonly accompanies disorders affecting the thyroid gland, adrenal glands, parathyroid glands, gonads, or pituitary gland. Generally, the anemia produced in mild to moderate and produces no symptoms. In fact, the amount of circulating hemaoglobin may be entirely appropriate to the needs of the organism, because the metabolic disturbance often results in reduced oxygen requirements. In most patients, these endocrine disorders begin insidiously. The early symptoms are nonspecific and include fatigue. Consequently, when the blood hemoglobin level is subnormal, the symptoms may be ascribed to the anemia, and the diagnostic efforts may be directed toward the hematopoietic system. Few morphologic abnormalities are observed, and none is specific. Unless the clinician suspects and searches for endocrine disease, the diagnosis may be overlooked.</p>
                        
                        <h3>MYXEDEMA</h3>
                        <p>Anemia has been observed in 20-60% of patients with hypothyroidism. Although hypothyroidism is more common in women than in men, anemia is more common in hypothyroid men than hypothyroid women. Three morphologic types of anemia have been described in adult patients.</p>
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li>When hypochromic, microcytic anemia is found in association with myxedema, it almost always is attributable to iron deficiency. Serum iron values are subnormal and the anemia responds to iron therapy, even if thyroid hormone is not administered; it is not relieved by hormone treatment if iron is withheld. Often iron deficiency in myxedema produces normocytic anemia. Iron deficiency occurs in association with myxedema in part because menorrhagia is common manifestation of the illness, in part because the achlorhydria found in myxedema subjects may lead to impaired absorption of food iron, and in part because thyroid hormone itself may be essential for normal iron absorption.</li>
                            <li>Distinctly, macrocytic anemia usually results from complicating deficiency of vitamin B₁₂ or folate. The increased incidence of pernicious anemia in thyroid disease possibly is the result of an autoimmune mechanism. Folate deficiency may be diet-related.</li>
                            <li>If folate, vitamin B₁₂ and iron deficiencies are eliminated, a significant population of hypothyroid patients with anemia remain called uncomplicated anemia of hypothyroidism, and in a manifestation of the hormone deficiency itself. All or nearly all children with anemia and hypothyroidism have the uncomplicated form of the disease. The anemia is usually mild with PCV rarely falling 35%. The degree of anemia is related to both the severity and the duration of the hypothyroidism the PCV (VPRC) continues to fall for as long as 6 months after thyroidectomy in previously euthroid individuals, even though the basal metabolic rate remains at a stable, reduced level.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>The MCV may be increased in hypothyroid patients, even in the absence of anemia. Anisocytosis, poikilocytosis, or other red cell morphologic abnormalities are not impressive, but acanthocytes are apparent in about 20% of patients. Usually the leukocyte and platelet counts are within the normal range, although both may be slightly reduced. The bone marrow may be mildly hypoplastic, but the M:E ratio is not significantly altered. Hemoglobin A₂ levels are mildly diminished.</p>
                        <p>The response of the anemia of hypothyroidism to thyroid hormone is sluggish. Characteristically no distinct reticulocytosis occurs and the VPRC (PCV) returns to a normal value only gradually over a 6-months period. The MCV alsmot invariably falls, even if anemia is not present or if the MCV is in the normal range when therapy is instituted. The MCV tends to reach stable levels after about 4 months or more.</p>
                        
                        <h3>HYPERTHYROIDISM</h3>
                        <p>About 10-25% of these patients suffer from an unexplained mild anemia. In patients who are anemic, the hyperthyroidism tends to be of unusual severity or prolonged duration. In a larger number of patients the hemoglobin value falls a little but remains within normal limits. MCV is either normal or modestly decreased, even though iron metabolism is not disturbed (MCV may be decreased in non-anemic patients of hyperthyroidism). HbA₂ levels are slightly increased but not to the same degree as noted in patients with $\beta$-thalassemia minor. Both the anemia and the microcytosis are corrected when the hyperthyroidism is successfully treated; the pathogenesis of the anemia and microcytosis is not well understood.</p>
                        
                        <h3>HYPOGONADISM</h3>
                        <p>Post-puberty, values for VPRC, blood hemoglobin concentration, and red cell count average about 10-13% higher in men than in women. In eunuchoid or castrated men, these values fall to within the normal female range. Urinary erythropoietin levels in normal men are about three times than found in women.</p>
                        <p>The differences between the sexes are accounted for chiefly by the stimulating effect of androgens on erythropoiesis. The administration of androgens to castrated males restores male values for hemoglobin concentration. Androgens act by increasing renal synthesis of erythropoietin. Estrogens are supposed to exert a suppressive effect, possibly by suppressing hepatic synthesis of erythropoietin.</p>
                        
                        <h3>HYPOPITUITARISM</h3>
                        <p>Moderately severe, non-progressive anemia is a well-recognized feature of pituitary insufficiency, regardless of cause. Average values being 10 g/dL in previously healthy subjects. Anemia is also evident in prepubertal dwarfs; however, the degree of anemia may be obscured by contraction of the plasma volume. The anemia is usually normocytic, normochromic, and the red cells are morphologically normal. Results of kinetic studies demonstrate reduced red cell production. The anemia of hypopituitarism results chiefly from deficiences of the hormones of target glands controlled by the pituitary, especially the thyroid and adrenal hormones, but also androgens. In addition, lack of other pituitary factors, such as growth hormone, prolactin, or other poorly characterized pituitary principles, may be of importance. In experimental animals, hypophysectomy results in moderately severe, slightly hypochromic and microcytic anemia associated with a pronounced decrease in erythroid elements in the bone marow. No hemolysis occurs; in fact, the red cell survival is prolonged.</p>
                        <p>As suggested for the anemia of hypothyroidism, panhypopituitarism probably produces its effects on erythropoiesis chiefly by reducing tissue oxygen consumption. The organism reacts to this decreased need for oxygen by secreting less erythropoietin, and the red cell mass diminishes until a new equilibrium between oxygen supply and demand is established. Treatment with a combination of thyroxine, cortisone and growth hormone corrects both the anemia and the marrow hypoplasia, and is more effective than any single hormone given by itself.</p>
                        
                        <h3>HYPERPARATHYROIDISM</h3>
                        <p>Anemia is a rare complication of primary hyperparathyroidism. Anemia is normocytic normochromic without reticulocytosis. Leukopenia or thrombocytopenia do not occur. The cause for anemia in these patients remains obscure. Although renal failure and gastrointestinal bleeding occur in association with hyperparathyroidism. It is also thought parathormone in excess hampers the growth of erythroid precursors, and additionally it also caused marrow fibrosis. When hyperparathyroidism is secondary to renal disease; it is difficult to ascertain the relative importance of the hormone excess versus the erythropoietin deficit characteristic of renal failure.</p>
                        
                        <h3>ADDISON'S DISEASE</h3>
                        <p>The total red cell volume is slightly diminished and a mild normochromic normocytic anemia is common. However, the decrease in plasma volume associated with untreated Addison's disease results in hemoconcentration and thus tends to mask the anemia. Correction of hemoconcentration by adequate therapy is often followed by an initial fall in hemoglobin and hematocrit values, serial determination of which assist in evaluating the effect of therapy. The TLC and neutrophil counts are normal. Occurrence of infections is not accompanied by neutrophil leukocytosis; this is of practical importance as a crisis is often precipitated by infection, the presence of which cannot be ruled out by a normal white cell count.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h3>PROTEIN MALNUTRITION</h3>
                        <p>The protein globin, which constitutes 96% of the hemoglobin molecule, contains a number of essential amino acids, i. e. amino acids which the body itself cannot synthesize. Therefore, adequate dietary supply of proteins is essential for hemoglobin and other body proteins production. Hemoglobin has a high priority for available protein and it has been shown that in states of protein deficiency hemoglobin formation takes precedence over serum protein and tissue protein breakdown. In man, therefore, because of high priority of hemoglobin for the available protein, protein deficiency alone does not often act as a limiting factor in hemoglobin synthesis and cause anemia.</p>
                        <p>Anemia due to protein deficiency is seen most commonly in pregnant women in association with kwashiorkor. Pure protein deficiency would lead to a mild-to-moderate normocytic anemia. In the clinical situations where protein malnutrition exists, there are often associated deficiencies especially of iron and folate. So really, the cell size may vary as would the hypochromia. Supplementation and dietary improvement would help combat the condition.</p>
                        
                        <h3>SCURVY</h3>
                        <p>Anemia is usual but not invariable in vitamin C deficiency. In adults it is normocytic normochromic but in infants and children it is often microcytic hypochromic because of associated iron deficiency. The anemia of scurvy is typically moderate in degree and it parallels the degree of deficiency. The anemia appears to be primarily due to impairment of erythropoiesis, but hemolytic element is also said to be present. TLC, DLC and platelet counts are usually normal.</p>
                        
                        <h3>PHYSIOLOGICAL ANEMIA OF PREGNANCY</h3>
                        <p>The anemia in pregnancy commences about the eighth week, progresses steadily until the thirtysecond week, following which there is a progressive rise until term. There is individual variation in the degree of hemoglobin fall. In India less than 10 g% is considered significant. The PCV too, proportionately, falls with hemoglobin. Following delivery, hemoglobin and PCV values increase and return to normal by about the third month of puerperium.</p>
                        <p>The red cells are normocytic but mild anisocytosis is not uncommon with an increased percentage of slightly microcytic cells. On the stained peripheral smear the red cells appear to be normochromic, although the MCHC is often at the lower limit of normal.</p>
                        
                        <h4>PATHOGENESIS</h4>
                        <p>Physiological anemia of pregnancy has been attributed to hemodilution which occurs in pregnancy. The blood volume rises during pregnancy, due to an increase in both the total red cell and the plasma volume. But plasma volume rise is by about 35-40% whereas RBC volumes rise only by about 17%. This disproportionate increase in plasma volume results in hemodilution and thus in a fall in hemoglobin value.</p>
                        <p>In addition, the demands of the growing fetus place the expectant mother at greater risk for nutritional anemias, especially deficiencies of iron and folate. Pregnant patients are, of course, also susceptible to the same diseases that afflict other women. A hemolytic anemia may be detected in preeclamptic and eclamptic patients. The syndrome is called HELLP (for hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes and low platelets).</p>
                        <p>In addition it has been found that in most patients the fall in hemoglobin can be wholly or largely prevented by the routine administration of iron. Depletion of bone marrow iron stores is common in pregnancy. Thus, it appears that the physiological anemia of pregnancy is due to a combination of hydremia and relative iron deficiency. Treatment is iron supplementation (preparations with minimal gastrointestinal irritative effects should be given). Should complications arise, pre- or postpartum, they should be adequatly treated.</p>
                        
                        <h3>NUTRITIONAL ANEMIA OF PREGNANCY</h3>
                        <p>Iron deficiency is a common complication of pregnancy and the most common cause of true anemia. This is more common in the lower socioeconomic group. Limited iron reserves even before pregnancy are common, and the additional iron requirements of pregnancy impose a negative iron balance unless supplementation is provided. Pregnant women may experience certain manifestations of iron deficiency in addition to those typical of iron deficiency anemia in other. There is evidence that the risks of prematurity, low birth weight babies, and even infant death are inceased in severe iron deficiency. The placenta becomes hypertrophied, a possible cause for maternal hypertension. A special type of pica, namely, ingestion of baking powder, can lead to symptoms suggesting eclampsia dietary supplementation is essential.</p>
                        <p>Macrocytic anemia of pregnancy is often megaloblastic and in most cases result from deficiency of folic acid. When it occurs, it often begins in the third trimester, or shortly after delivery. Folate requirements increase during pregnancy, and the diets of many pregnant patients are insufficient to meet the increased need. Folate deficiency occurs regardless of economic status of the patient, especially if they are adolescents. In uncomplicated pregnancies the gastrointestinal absorption of dietary folate (polyglutamate) and of folic acid (monoglutamate) is normal. Folate deficiency is clearly associated with fetal neural tube defects and cleft palate, but these defects are established very early in fetal development, long before frank megaloblastic anemia is detected. Women must take folate supplements even before pregnancy can be accurately diagnosed if these complications are to be avoided. Prematurity may also be a consequence of folate deficiency. Other complications of pregnancy, such as an increased incidence of abruptio placentae, uterine bleeding and reduced birth weight have also been attributed to folate deficiency by some specialists. A positive association has been noted, between bacteriuria and folate deficiency, in pregnant patients. Very rarely, the folate deficient pregnant patient may have erythroblastopenia and bone-marrow changes so closely stimulate acute leukemia, because of the predmonince of granulocyte precursors, that the best of hematologists may also diagnose it as such. Such a misinterpretation should be avoided and folate be administered with a repeat study of bone marrow to observe changes which will revert towards normalcy in a folate deficient subject.</p>
                        <p>Diagnosis depends on, first, identifying megaloblastic anemia. An increased MCV with oval macrocytes and hypersegmented granulocytes on peripheral smear may be adequate for this purpose but bone marrow examination can also be done to confirm. Next folate deficiency must be distinguished from vitamin B₁₂ deficiency. The latter is rare in pregnancy, and the distinction can be made on clinical gounds, especially on the basis of a careful nutritional history. If in doubt, folate and vitamin B₁₂ levels can be conducted.</p>
                        <p>Dietary supplementation with about 0.3 mg of folic acid daily during pregnancy reduces the occurrence megaloblastic anemia significantly. A supplement of 0.45 mg daily result in supranormal values for serum folate, but, even with this amount of supplementation, megaloblastic anemia may occur in a pregnant patient in whom the course is complicated by urinary tract infection or by hemorrhage. A supplementation by 0.4 mg of folic acid is supposed to be enough, wherever necessary, the same can be increased to 1 mg/day. Vitamin B₁₂ deficiency in pregnant pernicious anemia patients has to be tackled by giving vitamin B₁₂ injections accordingly.</p>

                        <p>The mild-to-moderate anemia that is often found in patients with infections, inflammatory, or neoplastic diseases that persist for more than 1 or 2 months is called the anemia of chronic disorders, or the anemia of chronic disease. The characteristic feature of this syndrome is the occurrence of hypoferremia in the presence of ample reticuloendothelial iron stores. As so defined, the syndrome does not include anemia caused by marrow replacement, blood loss, hemolysis, renal insufficiency, hepatic disease, or endocrinopathy, even when these disorders are present. The anemia of chronic disorders is extremely common, and overall is probably more common than any anemia syndrome other than blood loss with consequent iron deficieny.</p>

                        <h3>CLINICAL AND LABORATORY OBSERVATIONS</h3>
                        <p>As associated diseases are variable, so are the clinical manifestations. Usually the signs and symptoms of the underlying disorder overshadow those of the anemia, but on rare occasions, reduction of the hemoglobin level provides the first evidence of the existence of the primary condition (e.g. in temporal arteritis, etc).</p>
                        
                        <h4>ANEMIA: DEVELOPMENT AND SEVERITY</h4>
                        <p>Typically, anemia develops during the first 1-2 months of illness and thereafter does not progress. The hematocrit is usually maintained between 25 and 40, but significantly lower values may be found in 20-30% of cases. The hemoglobin concentration and PCV generally provide an accurate reflection of the extent to which the circulating red cell mass is reduced, although in certain cases expansion of the total blood volume would mean that the reduction of red cell mass is less than the hemoglobin or PCV indicated. This is particularly likely in syndromes associated with increased levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6). IL-6 produces a dilutional anemia: expansion of the plasma volume results in a reduced hematocrit or hemoglobin concentration without changes in the circulating red cell mass.</p>
                        <p>Usually, a general correlation exists between the degree of anemia and the severity of the underlying disease. For instance, infections accompanied by pronounced fever, chills, and suppuration are associated with more severe anemia than those with fewer systemic manifestations. In infected wounds, the degree of anemia is proportional to the number of organisms present. Correlation has also been observed between the severity of the anemia and the activity of rheumatoid arthritis, judged by fever, severity of joint swelling and inflammation, and the ESR. In malignancies, anemia is more severe in patients with metastases as compared to these with localized malignancies; however, the development of anemia does not require neoplastic invasion of the bone marrow. Typically, the reticulocytes are normal or reduced in number although, rarely, they may be mildly increased.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Morphologic Features</h4>
                        <p>The RBCs are usually normocytic and normochromic; however, rarely microcytosis with hypochromia may be observed (in 20-40% of cases). Hypochromia is more common than microcytosis. Hypochromia may be observed inspite of PCV remaining normal. Microcytosis when seen in these conditions is not as pronounced as seen in iron deficiency cases. Mild poilkilocytosis too may also be observed. Routine examination of the blood smear rarely reveals specific morphologic abnormalities.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Iron Metabolism</h4>
                        <p>Characteristically, serum iron concentration, total iron binding capacity and transferrin saturation-all are reduced. In patients with infection, hypoferremia develops early in the course of the illness, often within 24 hours, and is observed even in acute, self-limited febrile diseases (e.g. viral fevers). When the infection is of short duration, the serum iron returns to normal and anemia does not develop in prolonged illness, the serum iron level remains low as long as the disease is active. When the disorder subsides, anemia often is relieved before the serum iron level returns to normal. The degree of hypoferremia is related to the severity of underlying disease.</p>
                        <p>In bone marrow aspirates stained for iron; the number of sideroblasts is reduced to 5-20% of the total quantity of normoblasts (normal being 30-50%). In contrast, the amount of hemosiderin within macrophages usually is increased; exceptions probably represent cases complicated by iron deficieny.</p>
                        <p>Serum ferritin levels are useful indicators of iron status in patients without underlying chronic disorder. In patients with the anemia of chronic disease, however, the serum ferritin level indicative of adequate reticuloendothelial iron stores requires upward adjustment. Serum ferritin values usually increase in patients with inflammatory diseases and extreme elevations of serum ferritin may be nonspecific indicator of significant underlying disease. When iron deficieny coexists, the serum ferritin level falls, but may not reach values as low as those found in uncomplicated iron deficiency. A patient with chronic inflammatory disease and a serum ferritin less than 30 $\mu$g/L is certainly iron deficient, and a patient with a serum ferritin greater than 200 $\mu$g/L is certainly not iron deficient; in other circumstances. Certainty can be provided by examination of marrow by prussian blue reaction.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Other Biochemial Findings</h4>
                        <p>The concentration of free erythrocytic protoporphyrin (FEP) tends to be elevated in patietns with anemia of chronic disorder (but is not as much as seen in iron deficiency). The concentrations of certain plasma proteins, such as fibrinogen, ceruloplasmin, haptoglobin, CRP, orosomucoid, C3, and amyloid A protein increase, whereas the concentrations of albumin and transferrin characteristically decrease. The increase in ceruloplasmin accounts for the increase in serum copper levels often noted in association with chronic disorders. An elevated fibrinogen level is probably the most important factor in the increased ESR. Patients with chronic illness develop accelerated protein catabolism and negative nitrogen balance associated with muscle proteolysis. Over time, this phenomenon can result in muscle wasting, increased urea excretion, weight loss, and growth impairment in children. However, protein catabolism generates amino acids that can be used by the patient as alternative energy sources or to supply substrates for biosynthetic processes related to host response. In this context, it is perhaps relevant that elevated serum levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) a cytokine implicated in the pathogenesis of the anemia of chronic disorders, are noted in patients with significant malnutrition.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Kinetic Characteristics</h4>
                        <p>Erythrocyte survival is modestly but significantly reduced in patients with the anemia of chronic disorder. There is little evidence of a compensatory erythropoietic response to this reduction in red cell survival. The reticulocyte count is usually normal or reduced and little or no erythroid hyperplasia of the marrow is observed. Briefly said, the anemia develops because the bone marrow fails to increase red cell production sufficiently to compensate for a mild decrease in red cell life span.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Pathogenesis</h4>
                        <p>The pathogenesis of anemia here is based upon (a) shortened erythrocyte survival, (b) impaired marrow response, and (c) disturbance in iron metabolism. The modest shortening of the erythrocyte survival creates an increased demand for red cell production on the marrow. Normally, the marrow could easily accommodate this demand, but in the setting of anemia of chronic disorder, the marrow is unable to respond fully because of a combination of a blunted erythropoietin response, an inadequate progenitor response to erythropoietin, and limited iron availability.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Cytokines</h5>
                        <p>In chronic disorders there is activation of macrophages and the elaboration of macrophage cytokines. These cytokines, in turn, act on other cells, such as lymphocytes, endothelial cells, and fibroblasts, to produce mediators of erythropoietic suppression, or act directly on affector cells. The central role of these cytokines suggests that the anemia of chronic disorders may be best understood as a cytokine-mediated process. The cytokines most often implicated in the pathogenesis of the anemia of chronic disorders are TNF, IL-1, and interferons. Concentrations of these cytokines have been reported to be increased in the serum or plasma of patients with disorders associated with anemia of chronic disorders, and therapeutic administration of TNF and interferon may induce anemia. IL-6, another cytokine implicated in the inflammatory and immune response, is a special case. Although increased serum IL-6 is observed in anemic patients with rheumatoid arthritis, IL-6 does not suppress erythopoiesis but rather is associated with increased plasma volume; the anemia is therefore dilutional. The association of IL-6 with hepatocyte activation may therefore explain the dilutional component of the anemia observed in liver disease.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Shortened Red Cell Survival</h5>
                        <p>The rate of survival of cells from patients with arthritis, when transfused into the normal subjects, is normal, and the survival of red cell from normal individuals in the circulation of patients with arthritis is less than the normal rate. Therefore, shortened RBC survival in patients with chronic inflammatory disorders is attributed to an extracorpuscular mechanism. IL-1 and TNF are the probable causes for this. The precise mechanism by which this shortened RBC survival is produced remains unclear. Activated macrophages clear minimally damaged erythrocytes from the circulation more rapidly; this includes RBCs damaged by fever. Certain tumours may produce hemolysins, or vascular injury may permit leakage of blood into damaged tissues, leading to localized erythrocyte destruction.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Impaired Marrow Response</h5>
                        <p>The possible defects in erythropoiesis fall into three categories:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Inappropirately low erythropoietin secretion,</li>
                            <li>Diminshed marrow response, and</li>
                            <li>Iron-limited erythropoiesis.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>The erythropoietin concentration in chronic disorders is reduced when compared with proportionate anemia caused by other reasons, i.e. erythropoietin (EPO) response to anemia is blunted. It appears that this impaired EPO response is cytokine-mediated IL-1, TNF$\alpha$, and transforming growth factor-$\beta$ may inhibit EPO production. Another explanation is that the anemia is adaptive; that is, it reflects or reduced rate of oxygen use by tissues so that normal oxygenation is maintained despite reduced hemoglobin levels. A fancyful description is that "the hematologic factory operates at lesser capacity" possibly in order to allow diversion of substrates normally used in erythropoiesis to more immediately critical activities. A fact that supports this contention comes from the observation that certain chronic disorders are associated with decreased conversion of thyroxine (T₄) to triiodothyronine (T₃) in peripheral tissues. As a result, serum T₃ levels are reduced despite minimal evidence of clinical hypothyroidism (the sick euthyroid syndrome). These findings provide a basis for reduced oxygen consumption at the tissue level. However, changes that ordinarily signify erythrocyte adaptation to tissue hypoxia, such as increased erythrocyte 2,3-DPG levels and decreased hemoglobin oxygen affinity, are observed in the anemia of chronic disorders.</p>
                        <p>Although the EPO levels of patients with anemia of chronic disorders are lower than those observed in equally iron-deficient individuals, they are still higher than are observed in normal individuals who are not anemic. This implies that inhibition of EPO production cannot entirely account for the impaired erythropoiesis associated with anemia of chronic disorders, and that the erythroid progenitors themselves exhibit an abnormal response to erythropoietin. TNF, IL-1 and interferon have all been reported to inhibit erythropoiesis in vivo and in vitro. Treatment with recombinant human erythropoietin can correct the anemia of chronic disorders in many cases.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Abnormal Iron Metabolism</h5>
                        <p>It has been proposed that lack of iron for erythropoiesis contributes to the inadequate marrow response in the anemia of chronic disorders. Evidence of a functional iron deficieny in this syndrome includes erythrocyte microcytosis, increased FEP, reduced transferrin saturation, and decreased marrow sideroblasts.</p>
                        <p>The major contributor to hypoferremia in patients with the anemia of chronic disorders is probably a shift of iron from a transferrin-bound, available state to a ferritin-bound storage state. Iron absorption appears to be normal but iron tends to remain in the mucosal cells and in hepatocytes. Macrophages, the major site from which iron is obtained for erythropoiesis, also exhibit increased iron storage. Macrophage iron becomes available for erythropoiesis through two mobilization pathways: a rapid pathway associated with almost immediate return of the iron retrieved from senescent red cells, and a slower pathway, consisting of iron mobilized from storage. In the anemia of chronic disorders, the slower pathway predominates and iron tends to accumulate.</p>
                        <p>Apoferritin is normally synthesized in response to increased intracellular iron concentration. One possibility is that, like acute phase proteins, excess apoferritin is made in inflammatory and malignant conditions, and the surplus binds a larger than usual amount of iron entering the cells. In effect, such a mechanism would divert iron from the rapid to the slow pathway of iron release. Studies of cytokine effects on iron mobilization support this hypothesis.</p>
                        <p>The lactoferrin hypothesis is another approach to explaining iron abnormalities in the anemia of chronic disorders. Lactoferrin is a transferrin like protein found in neutrophil specific granules. It is released from the neutrophil during phagocytosis or stimulation by IL-1. At low pH, lactoferrin binds iron more avidly than does transferrin. Lactoferrin bound iron is not immediately available for erythropoiesis, but rather binds to specific receptors on macrophages (particularly in the liver and spleen) and is endocytosed and subsequently incorporated into ferritin. Thus lactoferrin transfers iron from its transferrin bound, circulating state to a storage state, from which it can be rapidly mobilized.</p>
                        <p>In addition to decreased availability of iron, erythroid progenitors may also be unable to fully use the iron available to them. Erythroblasts from anemic patients with rheumatoid arthritis; express fewer surface transferrin receptors (TfRs) than do erythroblasts from normal individuals. These TfRs also exhibit lower binding affinity for transferrin.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, acute phase reactants, such as $\alpha$-1-antitrypsin, impair transferrin binding to erythroblasts and also inhibit transferrin internalization.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Anemia in Patients with Cancer</h4>
                        <p>Besides factors of anemia of chronic disorders, other factors may be operative too. Erythroid precursors may be displaced from marrow by metastatic tumor, tumor-induced fibrosis, or tumor-associated marrow necrosis. The treatment of cancer can also produce or exacerbate anemia by a variety of mechanism, including impaired erythropoietin production and cytotoxic effects on erythroid precursors.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Diagnosis</h4>
                        <p>It has been noted that diagnosis of anemia of moderate degree, as is commonly observed in the anemia of chronic disorders is often missed. The anemia of chronic disorders should be considered in anemic patients with associated inflammatory, infections, or neoplastic states. The diagnosis is confirmed by demonstrating hypoferremia with adequate reticuloendothelial iron stores in a patient with an appropriate clinical syndrome classically, the serum transferrin is either low or low normal. The major differential diagnosis is iron deficiency anemia. This is important. The diagnosis of iron deficiency anemia mandate identification of a source of blood loss. Mislabeling the diagnosis can cost the patient heavily.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Treatment</h4>
                        <p>Most importantly, one has to treat the under lying disorder. The anemia itself is rarely an important clinical problem. Thus, direct approaches to correction of the anemia are rarely necessary. Where necessary, recombinant human erythropoietin is effective and safe, but expensive. Because most patients are not symptomatic from anemia, symptomatic benefit is rarely observed. Its use should probably be reserved for patients who actually require transfusion, or for those who wish to donate blood for autologous transfusion at a later date.</p>
                        <p>Despite reports that iron given parenterally may bring about some improvement, such therapy is not recommended on account of attendent risks when comapred with low likelyhood of benefits. Oral iron replacement is likely to be useful only in patients who have concurrent iron deficiency, and then only for the component of anemia caused by iron deficiency. Iron does not correct the anemia of chronic disorders per se.</p>
