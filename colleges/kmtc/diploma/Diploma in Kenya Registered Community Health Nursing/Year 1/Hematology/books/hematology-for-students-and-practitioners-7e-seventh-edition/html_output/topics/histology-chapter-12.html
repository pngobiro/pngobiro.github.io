                        <p>Leukemias are malignancies of hematogenous/hemopoietic cells or tissues. They are diseases in which abnormal proliferation of hemopoietic cells cause progressively increasing infiltration of the bone marrow, although in certain forms the lymphatic tissues are particularly affected. The process of differentiation in leukemic cells is often abnormal, and this commonly results in an immature morphological appearance. Leukemic cells are usually present in the peripheral blood, where the count ranges from very low to very high values. These cells very commonly have myeloid or lymphocytic characteristics, but occasionally cells with features of erythroid precursors or megakaryocytes are part of the disease process.</p>
                        <p>The rate of progression varies considerably in different types of leukemia, but death is the usual outcome in untreated disease as a result of compromised production of mature blood cells. A significant proportion of subjects with acute leukemia have remissions induced by treatment, and a substantial proportion appear to be cured in certain categories of acute leukemia, especially acute lymphoblastic. A majority of patients with leukemia still die as a result of the disease, although the extent to which survival is prolonged by treatment has increased considerably over the past two decades. Therapeutic measures can improve the quality of life in the presence of persisting disease, and significantly prolong life expectancy when remission of the disease is achieved.</p>
                        <p>Leukemia accounts for about 4% of all deaths from malignant disease, although the proportion is greater in childhood.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Leukemia is generally considered to be a neoplastic disorder originating in a hemopoietic cell which has undergone an intrinsic change, causing it to escape from the normal restraints imposed on proliferative activity. Leukemic cell populations can consist of cells of one or several different pathways of differentiation.</p>
                        <p>A critical step in leukemogenesis appears to be alteration of the structure of DNA in the nucleus of the cell in which the disease is initiated, but the precise nature of the underlying changes at the molecular level in the development of human leukemia remains to be established. Many contributory factors have been incriminated in the development of neoplastic change, and include inherited predisposition, effects of viruses, and effects of radiation and chemicals.</p>
                        <h3>MOLECULAR BIOLOGY OF LEUKEMOGENESIS</h3>
                        <p>There is evidence that leukemia in humans can be associated with inappropriate expression of certain genes which appear to be involved in regulating basic steps in cell proliferation.</p>
                        <p>The normal counterparts of these genes are referred to as proto-oncogenes, and in most instances the precise role played by the gene products in cell behavior remains to be clarified, although they can, for example, correspond to a receptor for a growth promoting factor, or enzymes involved in pathways that convey information to the nucleus that such receptors have been activated. The name for this group of genes is derived from their capacity to undergo constitutive change to oncogenes, characterized by inappropriate expression of the gene in conjunction with neoplastic behavior of the cell.</p>
                        <p>The genetic code for an oncogene is carried in the RNA sequence of certain RNA retroviruses, and is converted into a DNA copy by viral reverse transcriptase after the virus has infected a susceptible strain of animal or bird. The segment of DNA is incorporated permanently into the DNA of the nucleus, and can result in the development of neoplastic behavior. There is no evidence that retrovirus infection is a common cause of neoplasia in humans, although it does cause a relatively uncommon variant of T lymphocytic leukemia. There are, however, mechanisms that serve as means for activation of oncogenes, other than introduction of an oncogene into nuclear DNA as the reverse transcript of part of the genome of an infecting retrovirus. These mechanisms include changes as small as point mutations in the proto-oncogene, formation of multiple copies of the proto-oncogene, or gene amplification, and of particular relevance to human leukemia, rearrangement of DNA by translocations of chromosomal material.</p>
                        <p>An example of conversion of a protooncogene to an oncogene by chromosome translation is the activation of the Abelson cellular proto-oncogene (c-abl) by the translocation which results in the formation of the Philadelphia chromosome, recognized many years earlier as an association with chronic myeloid leukemia. In this reciprocal translocation between two chromosomes, the c-abl on part of chormosome 9 is transferred into the breakpoint cluster region (BCR) of chromosome 22, as shown in Fig. 12.1. At the same time, part of the long arm of chromosome 22 is transferred onto the long arm of chromosome 9. It appears that segments of c-abl DNA are joined to a DNA sequence in chromosome 22 which results in ongoing production of an Abelson protein with altered structure and function. It is uncertain how this is related to the specific features of chronic myeloid leukemia, and there appear to be other factors involved in the type of malignant change associated with inappropriate activation of the c-abl proto-oncogene. The Philadelphia chromosome may, for example, be the sole chromosomal abnormality in a form of acute lymphoblastic leukemia, indicating there are other influence affecting the characteristics of the neoplastic process. Tumors produced in animals by retroviral introduction of this oncogene are also usually different in character from chronic myeloid leukemia.</p>

                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_09_20_6dc34e0338b37aad296bg-347-1.jpg" alt="Diagram showing the formation of the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph) by reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22, leading to the activation of the Abelson (c-abl) oncogene." class="content-image">

The Ph chromosome and the abnormal chromosome 9q⁺ persist and are replicated along with the other chromosomes in proliferating chronic myeloid leukemia cells. The translocation shifts the Abelson gene into the BCR site on chromosome 22, and this alters the regulation of its expression</figcaption>
                        </figure>
                        <p>It is commonly believed that inappropriate activation of other genes involved in critical steps in cellular proliferation may be promoted by other types of chromosome translocation, and result in the genesis of other forms of leukemia. Another commonly held view is that permanent changes in nuclear DNA occur in a stepwise manner, and that the outcome of the accumulation of abnormalities is malignant behavior.</p>
                        <h3>ABNORMALITIES OF THE CHROMOSOMES</h3>
                        <p>These abnormalities are very common in leukemia, and occur in all major categories of the acute and chronic forms of the disorder. Usually, the abnormality is maintained in a consistent manner in a particular case, in keeping with a defect that is replicated with a high degree of fidelity in the clone of cells arising from the cell in which malignant behavior first developed. Sometimes, additional changes occur at the time the characteristics of the leukemia alter, suggesting the abnormalities of the chromosomes are directly involved in abnormal cellular behavior.</p>
                        <p>Not all cases of leukemia have chromosome abnormalities detectable at the microscopic level with currently available techniques. The introduction of banding and specialized staining methods markedly enhanced the precision with which abnormalities in chromosomes could be identified, and it is now possible to recognize translocations between chromosomes which would not have been previously possible. Other types of abnormalities involving chromosomes includes addition or deletion of chromosomes, deletion of parts of chromosomes, and formation of chromosomes that are not identifiable as originating from any particular normal chromosome. More than half of all cases of acute leukemia have chromosome abnormalities, and it is argued that improvement in techniques for delineating chromosome structure are likely to reveal an even high incidence of deletions, additions, and translocations.</p>
                        <p>A number of correlations exist between laboratory features or clinical behavior of leukemic processes and specific chromosome abnormalities, such as the translocation between the long arms of chromosomes 15 and 17 in acute promyelocytic leukemia. Other instances are the correlations between specific chromosome abnormalities and disorders with relatively good, or relatively bad, prognosis. Associations between particular types of chromosome abnormality and specific properties of neoplastic processes incriminate chromosome abnormalities as playing an important role in the genesis of specific characteristics of neoplastic activity although it remains to be clarified whether chromosome abnormalities could be secondary consequences of another event which is responsible for malignant behavior. One currently held hypothesis is that changes may occur in DNA which produce a clone of cells predisposed to undergo further change, which in turn results in emergence of an overtly leukemic cell clone containing particular chromosome abnormalities.</p>
                        <h3>RADIATION</h3>
                        <p>There is convincing evidence that ionizing radiation, especially X -irradiation, is leukemogenic, and that the incidence of leukemia increases with the cumulative dose received. An increase in the incidence of leukemia was first noted in irradiated survivors of the atom bomb blast three years after the event, and the incidence peaked after 6-7 years. Patients with ankylosing spondylitis treated with radiotherapy also experienced a dose-related increase in incidence of leukemia, reaching a maximum incidence of at least several times the average expectancy about six years after irradiation. Acute leukemia and chronic myeloid leukemia occurred in both irradiated groups. Patients treated with radiotherapy for lymphoma subsequently develop leukemic or myelodysplastic disorders, but more commonly when cytotoxic chemotherapy is also administered. The incidence of secondary hematological malignancy is relatively high in this group, affecting about 3% of long-term survivors. Concern is also expressed over an increased incidence of leukemia in children who are exposed to diagnostic X-ray in utero. The mechanism linking irradiation with development of leukemia upto many years later is unclear, but it is perhaps relevant that irradiation produces chromosome abnormalities, although these take the form of random breaks rather than specific abnormalities in chromosome structure.</p>
                        <h3>CHEMICALS</h3>
                        <p>Leukemia is more common in people who have been exposed for substantial periods to benzene vapor, and the risk of developing leukemia has been suggested to increase with the extent of cumulative exposure. Leukemia also occurs more commonly in subjects who have taken cytotoxic agents which in the case of radiotheraphy, produce an increase in the incidence of chromosome breakage. The drugs most commonly implicated are alkylating agents, such as chlorambucil, melphalan, procarbazine and nitrosoureas. This problem thus affects patients who have received these drugs for treatment, for example, of multiple myeloma, polycythemia vera, lymphoma, ovarian cancer, and breast cancer.</p>
                        <h3>VIRUSES</h3>
                        <p>Various forms of leukemia in animals and birds serve as models for the generation of leukemia as a result of infection by retroviruses. Leukemogenic viruses carry their genetic information in RNA, and after infecting a cell, produce a DNA copy by means of the enzyme reverse transcriptase, which they contain. The DNA copy, or provirus, is incorporated into the DNA of the nucleus, where it is replicated by the cell along with the host nuclear DNA. Malignant transformation is regularly induced when the viral genome contains an oncogene. Oncogenes are believed to be derived from vertebrate proto-oncogenes whose code has been incorporated into infecting retroviral RNA in such a way that it is not normally regulated when reintroduced into inappropriate sites in the DNA of the nucleus, thereby resulting in neoplastic behavior. Some leukemogenic retroviruses do not contain oncogenes. Multiple copies of the provirus are inserted into nuclear DNA, and leukemia develops only in some infected individuals. With this type of virus, development of neoplasia is apparently dependent on chance incorporation of the provirus at an appropriate site.</p>
                        <p>A retrovirus has been identified which can cause an uncommon form of leukemia in humans. It is designated HTLV-I, for human T cell lymphotrophic virus type I, as it in fects T lymphocytes and these cells may evolve into T lymphocytic leukemia-lymphoma. Infection with the virus is endemic in certain parts of the world, such as southern Japan, the Caribbean, South America, and Central Africa. The provirus is randomly incorporated into nuclear DNA, and this does not normally result in neoplastic activity. A second event, yet to be clarified, is responsible for development of malignant properties, and a monoclonal T-leukemic cell population emerges as a result.</p>
                        <h3>GENETIC FACTORS</h3>
                        <p>Occurrence of occasional clusters of cases of leukemia in families suggests genetic factors may be involved, but this is the exception as the disease does not normally occur in an inherited fashion. A number of disorders in which there are inherited abnormalities of nuclear DNA are, on the other hand, associated with an increased incidence of leukemia.</p>
                        <p>Children with Down syndrome, for example, have an increased incidence of leukemia associated with the presence of the additional chromosome 21 in the cells of the tissues. Inherited disorders such as Fanconi's anemia, Bloom's syndrome, and ataxia telangiectasia are associated with an increased incidence of leukemia, and have in common an increased tendency for chromosome breakage, as occurs in irradiated individuals.</p>
