                        <p>The mature human red blood cell is shaped like a flattened, bilaterally indented sphere, often referred to as a "biconcave disk". On fixed, stained blood smears, it appears circular, with an area of central pallor corresponding to the indented regions, on fixed smears.</p>
                        <p>The RBC has a diameter of about 7-8 μm. The disk shape is well suited to RBC function. The surface to volume ratio approaches the maximum value in such a shape:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Facilitates gas transfer</li>
                            <li>Biconcave disk is more deformable and can undergo the changes in shape necessary for optimal movement within the microvasculature.</li>
                            <li>The plane of the biconcave disk has been found to be oriented in the direction of blood flow. The leading edge becomes pointed and the following edge blunted. In this way, the RBC can negotiate a vessel of about 4 mm diameter.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>How does the RBC produce and maintain the resting biconcave shape?</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Elastic forces within the membrane</li>
                            <li>Surface tension</li>
                            <li>Electrical forces on membrane surface</li>
                            <li>Osmotic and hydrostatic pressures.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>The indented region can easily change its location. The RBC is remarkable for its ability to maintain membrane integrity while exhibiting extreme deformability under normal physiologic circumstances. The elasticity of membrane and low viscosity of RBC cytoplasm, permit its movement through very narrow channels within the human body.</p>
                        <p>Osmotic swelling occurs when the RBC is suspended in hypotonic solutions. First, it becomes cup-shaped and eventually becomes spherical. The cell volume increases but surface area more or less remains the same.</p>
                        <p>Discocyte to echinocyte (spiculated RBC) transformation takes place when</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Intracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is depleted</li>
                            <li>Intracellular calcium is increased</li>
                            <li>Cell is exposed to stored plasma, high pH, anionic detergents, lysolecithin or fatty acids</li>
                            <li>The cell is placed between a glass (not plastic) slide and coverslip.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Discocyte-stomatocyte transformation occurs when red cells are exposed to low pH, cationic detergents, or phenothiazines.</p>
                        <p>These cells on fixed smears show a mouth-like "stoma" instead of central pallor, therefore, these cells are called stomatocytes.</p>

                        <p>It is made of 3 layers.</p>
                        <h4>Outer Layer</h4>
                        <p>Hydrophilic layer made of glycoprotein molecules which carry the mucopolysaccharide blood group antigens and absorbed protein.</p>
                        <h4>Middle Layer</h4>
                        <p>It is a hydrophobic phospholipid bilayer stabilized by cholesterol.</p>
                        <h4>Inner Layer</h4>
                        <p>It is a hydrophilic layer containing protein molecules extending toward the cell interior.</p>
                        <p>The red cell surface bears a negatives charge.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>RBC membrane represents a semipermeable lipid bilayer supported by a protein mesh-like cytoskeleton structure. The fluid lipid matrix contains equal amounts of cholesterol and phospholipids with a mosaic of protein interspersed throughout at various intervals. The proteins that extend from the outer surface and traverse the entire membrane to the inner cytoplasmic side of the RBC are called "integral" membrane proteins. The "peripheral" proteins are limited to the cytoplasmic surface of the membrane, which is beneath the lipid bilayer and forms the RBC cytoskeleton.</li>
                            <li>The protein and lipid layers are organized asymmetrically.</li>
                            <li>Chemically, the membrane approximately constitutes 40% lipids, 50% proteins, and 10% carbohydrates.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>RED CELL MEMBRANE LIPIDS</h3>
                        <h4>Phospholipids</h4>
                        <p>The RBC membrane lipid consists of a bilayer of phospholipids interspersed with molecules of unesterified cholesterol and glycolipids. Two groups of phospholipids are known to possess a distinct asymmetry within the bilayer matrix of the RBC: Choline phospholipids and amino phospholipids.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Choline phospholipids, consisting of phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin, are primarily located on the outer half of the lipid bilayer readily accessible to the external environment. There is an energy dependent fatty acid exchange between plasma fatty acids and the RBC membrane. Therefore changes in body lipid transport and metabolism may cause abnormalities in the plasma phospholipid concentration, thereby, resulting in a decreased RBC survival in circulation.</li>
                            <li>Amino phospholipids, in contrast, consisting of phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylserine, are located almost exclusively on the inside half or cytoplasmic side of the RBC membrane along with phasphatidylinositol. This specific orientation of these phospholipids maintains a precise lipid pattern that is critical to normal RBC survival in circulation. Alteration of this arrangement leading to the abnormal appearance of these amino phospholipids on the outer surface of the lipid bilayer promotes activation of the clotting cascade and may result in extravascular hemolysis. Stabilization of this phospholipid asymmetry in the RBC membrane is maintained through the interaction of specific peripheral proteins.</li>
                        </ul>

                        </figure>

                        <h4>Glycolipids and Cholesterol</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The majority of the glycolipids are located in the outer half of the lipid bilayer and interact with glycoproteins to form many of the RBC antigens.</li>
                            <li>Cholesterol is approximately equally distributed, being located on both sides of the lipid bilayer inserted between the choline and amino phospholipids. Cholesterol comprises 25% of the RBC membrane lipids and is present in a 1:1 molar ratio with phospholipids. RBC cholesterol is in continual exchange with plasma cholesterol and is therefore affected by changes in body lipid transport.</li>
                            <li>Increased cholesterol accumulation in the RBC produces target cells, and may cause RBC membrane damage. Acanthocytes or spiny RBCs are also associated with excess cholesterol accumulation on RBC membrane (as may occur in lipid disorders, such as abetalipoproteinemia). Excess cholesterol makes the cell less deformable and reduces their life span. LCAT deficiency (lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase) leads to excessive free cholesterol in both plasma and RBC membrane, resulting in, among other problems, a chronic hemolytic anemia.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>RBC Membrane Proteins (Fig. 3.2)</h3>
                        <p>It is estimated that 10 major and 200 minor proteins are asymmetrically organized within the RBC membrane. After solubilization of the RBC membrane with the detergent sodium dodecyl sulfite (SDS), membrane proteins can be separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and stained. The separated RBC membrane proteins are numbered 1-8 when stained with Coomassie blue and 1-4 when stained with periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) stain, which is the basis of their nomenclature. The proteins range in molecular weight from 16,000 to 240,000 daltons. Two of the most important constituents include glycophorin an "integral" membrane protein and spectrin, a "peripheral" membrane protein.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Integral Membrane Proteins</h4>
                        <p>Glycophorin, the major integral membrane protein, is the principal RBC glycoprotein, representing 10% of the total membrane protein. The molecule contains approximately 60% carbohydrate and accounts for most of the membrane sialic acid, which gives the RBC and its negative charge. Glycophorin spans the entire thickness of the lipid bilayer and appears on the external surface of the RBC membrane, accounting for the location of RBC antigens.</p>
                        
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_09_20_6dc34e0338b37aad296bg-052-1.jpg" alt="Schematic illustration of SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis patterns of red cell membrane proteins stained with Coomassie blue (CB) and sialoglycoproteins stained with PAS stain." class="content-image">

GPA, GPB and GPC refer to glycophorins A, B, and C respectively. (GPA)2 and (GPB)2 are the dimers and GPA-GPB is the heterodimer of GPA-GPB</figcaption>
                        </figure>
                        
                        <p>The majority of these proteins, as mentioned previously, carry RBC antigens and are receptors (such as glycophorins) or are transport proteins (such as band 3, the anion exchange channel glycoprotein). It is thought that band 3 and glycophorins play a major role in anchoring the RBC membrane cytoskeleton to the lipid bilayer. As a result, lateral motility of these integral proteins within the lipid bilayer is relatively restricted.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Peripheral Proteins</h4>
                        <p>Spectrin, the principal "Peripheral" protein, is a large molecule that represents approximately 75% of the peripheral protein and 25% of the total membrane protein. Spectrin is intimately related to RBC membrane integrity as it binds with other peripheral proteins such as actin (band 5), ankyrin (band 2.1), and band 4.1 to form a "skeleton" of microfilaments on the inner surface of RBC membrane. These microfilaments strengthen the membrane, protecting the cell from being broken by circulatory shear forces, and also control the biconcave shape and deformability of the cell.</p>
                        <p>The normal chemical composition as well as structural arrangement and molecular interactions of the RBC membrane are crucial to the normal red cell survival in circulation of 120 days. In addition, they play a critical role in two important RBC characteristics: Deformability and permeability.</p>

                        <h3>Deformability</h3>
                        <p>Loss of ATP (energy) levels leads to a decrease in the phosphorylation spectrin and in turn, a loss of membrane deformability. An accumulation or increase in deposition of membrane calcium also increases the membrane rigidity and loss of pliability. These cells are at a marked disadvantage when they pass through the small (3-5 μm diameter) orifices of the spleen, one of whose functions is extravascular sequestration and removal of aged, damaged, or less deformable RBCs or fragments of their membrane. The loss of RBC membrane is exemplified by the formation of spherocytes, cells with a reduced surface-to-volume ratio, and "bite cells" in which the removal of a portion of membrane has left a permanent indentation in the remaining cell membrane. The survival of these forms is also shortened.</p>

                        <h3>Permeability</h3>
                        <p>The RBC membrane is freely permeable to water and anions, chloride (Cl<sup>-</sup>) and bicarbonate (HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>) traverse the membrane in less than a second. It is thought that the massive exchange of HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> and Cl<sup>-</sup> ions occurs through a large numbers of exchange channels formed by the integral protein, band 3, a glycoprotein described earlier. In contrast the RBC membrane is relatively impermeable to cations with a half-time exchange of sodium (Na<sup>+</sup>) and potassium (K<sup>+</sup>) of over 30 hours. It is primarily through the control of the sodium and potassium intracellular levels that the RBC maintains its volume and water homeostasis. The erythrocyte intracellular:extracellular ratios of sodium and potassium are 1:12 and 25:1, respectively. The passive influx of sodium and potassium is controlled by as many as 300 cationic pumps, which actively transport sodium out of the cell and potassium into the cell. These pumps are energy dependent requiring ATP, and membrane enzyme sodium-potassium ATPase. The full activation of the sodium-potassium ATPase pumps requires the presence of RBC membrane aminophospholipid, phosphatidylserine. Similarly, calcium (Ca<sup>++</sup>) is also actively pumped from the interior of the RBC through the energy-dependent calcium ATPase cationic pump. Calmodulin, a cytoplasmic calcium-binding protein, is speculated to control these calcium-ATPase pumps, preventing excessive intracellular calcium buildup, which is harmful to the RBC, resulting in shape changes and loss of deformability. The permeability properties of the RBC membrane, as well as active cation transport, are crucial to preventing colloid osmotic hemolysis and controlling the volume of the red cell. In addition, ATP-depleted cells allow the accumulation of excess intracellular calcium and sodium, followed by potassium and water loss, resulting in dehydrated, rigid cell later sequestered by spleen. The energy required by all those pumps is provided by ATP.</p>
