                        <p>A hemolytic anemia is one that ensues from an increase in the rate of red cell destruction. The normal lifespan of red cells (100-200 days) is shortened by various degrees in this group of anemias. To put it in other words-RBCs die in their childhood or adolescence or middle age without reaching the age of senescence.</p>
                        <p>In the broadest sense, such a definition includes a number of common but kinetically complex anemias, such as the anemias of chronic disorders and of renal disease, anemia associated with vitamin B₁₂ and folate deficiency and even iron-deficiency anemias. The rate of red cell destruction associated with these disorders is modestly increased, but not to a degree that would by itself lead to anemia. The anemia develops because of a more fundamental pathogenetic factor namely inability of the marrow to increase red cell production sufficiently to compensate for the shortened survival of the red cells (relative marrow failure). These illnesses have a hemolytic component, but it would be misleading to include them with the hemolytic anemias. As commonly understood, the term hemolytic anemia or better still hemolytic disorders, is limited to conditions in which the rate of red cell destruction is accelerated and the ability of bone marrow to respond to the stimulus of anemia is unimpaired.</p>
                        <p>The distinction between frankly hemolytic anemias and those associated with relative marrow failure is better understood quantitatively. Under maximal stimulation, the normal marrow is capable of undergoing hyperplasia until its production rate increases about 6-8 times. With optimal marrow compensation, the survival of red cells in the circulation can theoretically decrease from the normal 120 days to as low as 15-20 days without anemia developing. Such an increase in both destruction and production of erythrocytes can result in a compensated hemolytic state without anemia being present, the so-called compensated hemolytic anemia. When red cell survival is so short that anemia develops despite a vigorous erythropoietic response, however, the term hemolytic anemia is appropriate.</p>
                        <p>The premature destruction of the red cells may result from two basic defects: (1) an intracorpuscular (intrinsic) abnormality of the red cells which renders them more susceptible to the normal mechanisms of cell destruction. The fault lies in the cells themselves. Can this be proved experimentally? Yes-Normal compatible red cells when transfused to such a patient survive for a normal time, but the patient's cells when transfused into a normal recipient die early; (2) an extracorpuscular (extrinsic) abnormality due to development of an abnormal hemolytic mechanism. The fault lies in the patient's plasma or tissues; the red cells are primarily normal. Normal compatible red cells transfused into a patient with an extracorpuscular abnormality are prematurely destroyed, but the patient's cells transfused into a normal recipient survive for more or less a normal time. Hemolytic anemias can, therefore, be grouped under two broad headings:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Hemolytic anemias due to corpuscular defect (intracorpuscular or intrinsic abnormality): These are mainly congenital. The basic defect may be in any of the three main components of the cell, i.e. the membrane, the hemoglobin molecule and the enzymes concerned with cell metabolism.</li>
                            <li>Hemolytic anemias due to an abnormal hemolytic mechanism (extracorpuscular or extrinsic abnormality): These are acquired. The hemolysis may result from either an immune or nonimmune mechanism.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Another way of classifying these anemias is based upon the site of hemolysis that is whether the destruction is within the circulation (intravascular) or within tissue macrophags (extravascular). The manifestation such as hemoglobinuria, hemoglobinemia and hemosiderinuria; it is recognized easily, thereby limiting the diagnostic possibilities. However, most hemolytic diseases are characterized by extravascular red cell destruction, detection of the mode of hemolysis still leaves a large number of diagnostic possibilities (Table 8.1).</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The clinical manifestations of hemolytic disorders depend upon their duration and severity. Thus, chronic congenital hemolytic anemia can usually be distinguished from acute acquired hemolytic anemia on clinical grounds. When the onset of acquired hemolytic anemia is insiduous, however, the distinction may be more difficult.</p>
                        <h3>CHRONIC CONGENITAL HEMOLYTIC ANEMIA</h3>
                        <p>The significant clinical features of congenital hemolytic anemia are related to anemia, jaundice, the occurrence of crises, splenomegaly, and the development of gallstones. Less common features include chronic leg ulcers and bony abnormalities.</p>
                        <h4>Degree of Anemia</h4>
                        <p>Severity of disease varies from one patient to another and even among patients with the same illness. Severe disease is ordinarily detected shortly after birth or within the first year of life. Severe pallor and the cardiovascular manifestations of anemia are the usual findings; the latter may be serious enough to require blood replenishment by way of blood transfusions.</p>
                        <p>Quite often bone marrow compensates to a greater or lesser extent the loss of red cells. Often the patients accommodate remarkably well to the anemia, and may exhibit few symptoms. A moderately pallid/sallow complexion may be the only feature under such circumstances, detection often is delayed until later in childhood.</p>
                        <p>Lastly, some patients may have no anemia at all. The disease may then remain undiagnosed until later in adult life unless jaundice, a crises, or complications of cholelithiasis draw attention to the condition. Often, such cases are discovered only in the course of a family study.</p>
                        <h4>Jaundice</h4>
                        <p>Sometimes intense jaundice with impending kernicterus may be observed in neonatal period, it may simulate immunohemolytic anemia necessitating exchange transfusion. In older children or adults with congenital hemolytic anemia, icterus is absent or mild enough to pass unnoticed. History, if taken carefully, may elicit episodes of jaundice associated with trivial infections or unusual exertion. Often slight scleral icterus is the only sign of hemolytic disease and the description is more yellow than sick has been appropriately applied to such patients. The jaundice of hemolytic disease is acholuric; the bilirubin, being unconjugated is not excreted in the urine. Also pruritus is absent. These features help in differentiating it from hepatobiliary system disease.</p>
                        <h4>Crises</h4>
                        <p>In chronic congenital hemolytic anemia, there is a delicate balance between the rates of destruction and production. Disruption of this balance can lead to rapid and dramatic falls in blood hemoglobin level, producing a crises. The most common type of crises results from transient failure of red cell production, and is called an aplastic crises. Most of these (if not all) are caused by infection with type B₁₉ human parvovirus (HPV). The same virus also causes erythema infectiosum, a common childhood exanthem, and may cause an acute polyarthropathy syndrome in adults as well as aseptic meningitis and fetal death with hydrops fetalis. HPV infection may occur sporadically or in an epidemic form. Modes of infection are thought to be fecooral, oral-oral and respiratory, with an incubation period lasting 6-12 days. The most susceptible age group is 5-10 years old school-going children. Most reports of aplastic crises involve patients with sickle cell anemia, but they also occur in patients with $\beta$-thalassemia, pyruvate kinase deficiency, and hereditary deficiency.</p>
                        <p>Aplastic crises resulting from HPV infection begins with nonspecific manifestations of infectious disease such as fever, chills, lethargy and malaise. Sore throat, cough, abdominal pain, diarrhea and vomiting are common. About 25% of these develop a faint, maculopapular rash. Hematologic abnormalities follow about 4 days later (range being 2-17 days). Blood hemoglobin concentration falls to about 2-6 g/dL sometimes to life-threatening levels and the reticulocyte count falls abruptly, usually to less than 1%. The severity of crises depends upon severity of hemolytic process.</p>
                        <p>In most cases, leucocytes and platelets are unaffected, but neutropenia and thrombocytopenia can occur and, rarely, may be severe. The bone marrow is cellular but erythroid hypoplasia is the chief finding, the more mature erythrocyte precursors tend to disappear, giant pronormoblasts may be observed. The crises lasts about 6-8 days. Recovery is heralded by reticulocytosis, the disappearance of fever and, sometimes by leukocytosis and thrombocytosis. This entire episode from onset of symptoms to reappearance of reticulocytes, lasts about 10-12 days in subjects with normal immunologic responses, but may persist much longer in patients with defective or suppressed immune systems. HPV infection also induces erythroid aplasia in normal subject but the hemoglobin concentration falls only 1-2 g/dL, when erythrocyte survival is normal, such changes go unnoticed.</p>
                        <p>HPV infection can cause anemia in conjunction with other nonhemolytic disorders, such as AIDS, iron deficiency and often bone marrow or renal transplantation. It may also cause a congenital anemia often with transplacental passage. A single infection with HPV confers life-long immunity. The virus probably Acts by infecting replicating cells in erythroid line. It inhibits growth of CFU-Es (colony-forming units-erythroid) and to a lesser extent, BFU-Es (burst-forming units-erythroid), but apparently does not attack other hematologic stem cells. In aplastic crisis blood transfusions are often required.</p>
                        <p>In some cases, an abrupt increase in the rate of red cell destruction may occur, possibly because of increased splenic activity (hemolytic crises). In such episodes, the degree of jaundice and the reticulocyte count increase and spleen may enlarge. A third type of crises comes about because of complicating folate deficiency (megaloblastic crises) to which patients with chronic hemolysis appear to be particularly prone. The onset of megaloblastic crises tends to be more gradual than that of aplastic or hemolytic crises and is unrelated to complicated infections.</p>
                        <h4>Splenomegaly</h4>
                        <p>The spleen typically is enlarged (usually mild to moderate) with congenital hemolytic anemia. At times splenomegaly may be the first finding on a routine physical examination. Spleen may also attract attention because of a sense of heaviness in the region or because of pain.</p>
                        <h4>Cholelithiasis</h4>
                        <p>Sometimes symptoms of gallbladder disease may be the first manifestations of hemolytic process. Gallstones typical of a hemolytic anemia are so-called black pigment stones. They differ from brown pigment stones and cholesterol stones, neither of which is associated with hemolysis. The color of the stone is explained by its content of an insoluble black pigment that probably is a cross-linked network polymer of bilirubinate. It constitutes 40% of the stone by weight. Variable amount of other calcium salts are also present black pigment stones usually are amorphous, brittle, and less than 10 mm in diameter. About 40-80% of them are radiopaque. Oral cholecystography demonstrates their features; multiple, nonfloating, irregularly-shaped, and often radiopaque. The prevalence of cholelithiasis in patients with hemolytic anemia increases with age and with the intensity of hemolytic process.</p>
                        <p>Cholelithiasis is slightly more common in women with hemolytic disease than in men. The increase in bilirubin and calcium in bile of these patients favor supersaturation of the bile with calcium bilirubinate. Stone formation may begin in the glandular crypts of the gallbladder mucosa; where microscopic precipitates of calcium bilirubinate are deposited. The mucin glycoprotein at these sites provides a framework on which the stone can grow. Polymerization occurs later in the solid state.</p>
                        <h4>Leg Ulcers</h4>
                        <p>Chronic leg ulcers are particularly characteristic of hereditary spherocytosis and sickle cell anemia. They are also seen in other chronic hemolytic anemias. About 5-10% of sickle cell anemia cases suffer from leg ulcers. Lower rates are observed with sickle cell-thalassemia combinations and in sickle-hemoglobin-C disease. Ulcers are observed most often in males over the age of 20 years. The ulcers are often bilateral and tend to involve the areas overlying or proximal to the medial or lateral malleoli. When severe, they may extend a considerable distance up the leg and may completely surround it. They tend to be chronic or recurrent and, upon healing, leave the skin indurated and pigmented. Interruption of the hemolytic process, as by splenectomy in hereditary spherocytosis, induces healing of ulcers.</p>
                        <h4>Skeletal Abnormalities</h4>
                        <p>In severe hemolytic anemia during active phases of growth and development, the expansion of the erythroid bone marrow may lead to a tower-shaped skull, thickening and striation of frontal and parietal bones, maxillary and dental abnormalities, and other distortions of bony structures. Such abnormalities are particularly characteristic of severe thalassemia major and may also be seen in patients with sickle cell anemia and in exceptional patients with other forms of congenital hemolytic anemia.</p>
                        <h3>ACQUIRED HEMOLYTIC ANEMIA</h3>
                        <p>In case hemolytic anemia develops acutely, as often the transfusion incompatibility reaction, ingestion of an oxidant drug by patients with G6PD deficiency, the symptoms may suggest an acute febrile illness. Some cases of autoimmune hemolytic anemia, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, and other hemolytic disorders may also begin abruptly. Aching pains in the back, abdomen or limbs are common, as are headaches malaise, vomiting, shaking chills and fever. Abdominal pain and accompanying muscular spasm and rigidity may simulate the signs of an acute abdomen requiring surgical intervention. Profound prostration and shock may develop, followed by oliguria and anuria. Pallor, jaundice, tachycardia and other symptoms of severe anemia may be prominent.</p>
                        <p>More often, acquired hemolytic anemia begins insiduously, developing gradually over a period of weeks or months. Cardiovascular adjustments to the anemia may be enough and patients may have few symptoms. The clinical picture may then be similar to that described for congenital hemolytic disease. Pallor, scleral icterus, or a jaundiced complexion may be the first evidence of illness, and often first noticed by friends or relatives when anemia is more severe, the patient typically complains of weakness, fatigability, dyspnea, or other cardiovascular symptoms. As in congenital hemolytic anemia, the course may be interrupted by aplastic crises.</p>
                        <p>In other cases, the clinical features may be dominated by the manifestations of an underlying disease of which the hemolytic anemia is one manifestation. For instance, signs and symptoms of lymphoma, lupus erythematosus, or mycoplasma pneumonia may overshadow those of the associated hemolytic process.</p>

                        <h3>Signs of Excessive Red Cell Destruction</h3>
                        <h4>Erythrocyte Survival</h4>
                        <p>Ideal method for testing this is based on random labelling with ⁵¹Chromium. As measured with this labelling technique, the half disappearance time (t1/2 Cr) is usually reduced in hemolytic disease, but the degree of reduction varies from one patient to another, even among those with the same disease. On the average, t1/2 Cr is reduced to about one-half the normal value; however, because of the nonlinear relationship between t1/2 Cr and erythrocyte life span, the reduction in the latter is greater than might be supposed. Thus, for example, a 50% reduction in t1/2 Cr corresponds to an erythrocyte life span of about 30 days, or 25% of the normal. The t1/2 Cr tends to be lowest in patients with the greatest degree of anemia, but the correlation is not close. This investigation is expensive and time-consuming and therefore should be used in evaluating patients with especially difficult diagnostic problems.</p>
                        <h4>Catabolism of Heme</h4>
                        <p>In hemolytic disease, the heme moiety of hemoglobin is catabolized at a much accelerated rate, and excretion of the main heme catabolites-bile pigments and carbon monoxide-is proportionately increased. These changes provide clinically useful signs of hemolysis.</p>
                        <h5>Serum Bilirubin</h5>
                        <p>The amount of circulating bilirubin depends upon (a) the rate of its production, and (b) the rate of its excretion by the liver. So, it is not a reliable index of the rate of red cell destruction. Occasionally, it falls within normal range despite brisk hemolysis.</p>
                        <p>The increased serum bilirubin level in hemolysis almost always consists of unconjugated pigment. The conjugated fraction remains within normal limits and no bilirubin is evident in the urine.</p>

                        </ul>
                        <h5>Rate of Heme Catabolism</h5>
                        <p>Determinations of the rate of endogenous carbon monoxide production or bilirubin turnover provide accurate assessments of the rate of heme catabolism. As on date, however, these methods are far too complex for use by routine clinical laboratory. Quantitation of fecal urobilinogen excretion provides a more sensitive index of hemolysis than does the serum bilirubin level; however, they necessitate the accurate collection and processing of timed fecal specimens. The hemolytic index is a ratio of urobilinogen excretion to the estimated circulating hemoglobin (Hb) mass. The normal value being 11-21 mg/day/100 g Hb. In hemolytic anemia average value being 255 mg/day/100 g Hb. Because the formation of urobilinogen depends on the presence of intestinal bacteria, falsely low values are to be expected in patients receiving broad spectrum antibiotics.</p>
                        <h5>Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH)</h5>
                        <p>Serum LDH activity markedly increases in hemolytic anemia. In hemolytic anemia the isoenzyme LDH-2 predominates, whereas in megaloblastic anemia (LDH activity is higher than hemolytic anemia) LDH 1 predominates. The increase in LDH probably results from liberation of the erythrocyte enzyme into plasma during hemolysis.</p>
                        <p>Other causes of raised LDH activity are: (1) myocardial infarction, (2) pulmonary infarcion, (3) shock, (4) chest-wall trauma, (5) acute pancreatitis, 6) visceral infarction, (7) carcinomatosis, (8) acute and chronic renal disease, (9) muscle disorders, (10) lymphomas, and (11) acute leukemia. The utility of LDH evaluation is limited by this lack of specificity.</p>
                        <h5>Disappearance of Haptoglobin</h5>
                        <p>Hemoglobin, on entering the plasma, binds to haptoglobin and hepatocyte removes the complex. Consequently haptoglobin values fall to low levels in individuals with hemolytic disease. However, utility of haptoglobin estimation is limited by the fact that haptoglobin is an acute phase reactant, the synthesis of which increases in response to inflammatory, infections, or malignant disease.</p>
                        <p>The quantity of plasma haptoglobin is measured by using methods based on the peroxidase activity of hemoglobin-haptoglobin complex, by electrophoresis, chromatography or by immunonephalometry, which is the most sensitive and least arduous of the methods.</p>
                        <p>Despite the intravascular site of haptoglobin function, this protein becomes depleted not only in association with intravascular hemolytic anemias, but also in association with conditions characterized by predominantly extravascular hemolysis, such as sickle cell anemia, hereditary spherocytosis, hereditary elliptocytosis, and pyruvate kinase deficiency. In hereditary spherocytosis, the characteristically reduced haptoglobin levels are restored after splenectomy. Haptoglobin also disappears in megaloblastic anemia and other conditions in which the hemolysis is intramedullary (ineffective erythropoiesis). The sensitivity of low haptoglobin (in relation to hemolysis) is 83% and specificity is 96%. A low haptoglobin level indicates an 87% probablity of hemolytic disease. Despite these facts, the utility of haptoglobin measurement for the purpose of detecting hemolysis is not widely accepted. Values also may fall in association with liver disease because of impaired synthesis, and in hereditary deficiency of the protein. Furthermore, complicating infections as well as inflammatory or malignant conditions can normalize the haptoglobin value in patients with hemolytic disease.</p>
                        <h5>Glycosylated Hemoglobin (Hb A1)</h5>
                        <p>Hb A1 values are regularly reduced in people with hemolytic disease. The glycosylated hemoglobin level perhaps is related to the magnitude of the hemolytic process over the previous 4-8 weeks. The evaluation of Hb A1 is a useful measure of hemolysis, provided that diabetes mellitus and posthemorrhagic anemia can be excluded.</p>
                        <h3>Signs of Intravascular Hemolysis</h3>
                        <p>When RBCs are destroyed within the circulation, and also when extravascular destruction is so rapid that it exceeds the capacity of the macrophage system, hemoglobin is released into the plasma. The disposal of hemoglobin and its heme group occurs by several mechanisms, and characteristic laboratory abnormalities are observed.</p>
                        <h4>Hemoglobinemia</h4>
                        <p>Normal value of plasma hemoglobin is less than 1 mg/dL. Plasma usually appears visibly red when hemoglobin exceeds 50 mg/dL. For lower plasma hemoglobin levels detectionthe benzedine reaction is useful, however, for values above 100 mg/dL the hemoglobin can be directly measured by the cyanmethemoglobin method. In intravascular hemolysis values of 1000 mg/dL or more are common.</p>
                        <h4>Hemoglobinuria</h4>
                        <p>When plasma hemoglobin exceeds the haptoglobin binding capacity, hemoglobin dimers are excreted in the urine, resulting in hemoglobinuria. Urine that contains hemoglobin ranges from faint pink to deeper red, or even to almost black, similar to a cola beverage. The colour depends upon the concentration of hemoglobin as well as on the oxidation state and degree of dissociation of the heme group.</p>
                        <p>Hemoglobinuria can be differentiated from hematuria (whole RBCs in urine) by microscopic examination of a freshly voided urine specimen.</p>
                        <p>Other causes of red colored urine are ingestion of certain drugs (pyridium, antipyrine) or food (beets), or because of porphyrinuria or myoglobinuria. Of these various red urinary pigments, only hemoglobin and myoglobin produce a positive reaction in the commonly available tests for occult blood, which are based on benzidine or orthotolidine reactions.</p>
                        <p>Hemoglobinuria must be differentiated from myoglobinuria which occurs as a result of massive muscle injury by trauma, electric shock, arterial thrombosis, certain toxins ("haff" disease), Malayan sea-snake bite, idiopathic myoglobinuria, myophosphorylase deficiency (McArdle disease), drug induced-statins used for lowering cholesterol, and other causes. Myoglobin is a heme pigment of low molecular weight (17,000 Da); it is not bound by haptoglobin and therefore does not accumulate to an appreciable extent in the plasma. Thus inspection of plasma can help to distinguish myoglobinuria from hemoglobinuria, the presence of red color favoring the latter. More precise identification is obtained by electrophoresis on paper, starch, or acrylamide gels or by spectrophotometry. Spectrophotometry is facilitated by treatment with carbon monoxide because a greater divergence exists between the bands of caraboxyhemoglobin and carboxymyoglobin than between oxygenated forms. Unlike hemoglobin myoglobin remains in solution after 80% saturation of the urine with ammonium sulphate.</p>
                        <h4>Urine Iron Excretion</h4>
                        <p>Hemoglobin in the glomerular filtrate is partially reabsorbed by the proximal tubular cells and the hemoglobin iron is incorporated into ferritin and hemosiderin. Subsequently, the iron containing tubular cells are sloughed into the urine. Hemosiderinuria and increased urinary iron excretion, therfore, constitute reliable evidence that hemoglobinemia has occurred in recent past. After an acute episode several days may go before increased iron excretion can be detected. Moreover, the abnormality may persist much longer, after the acute episode has terminated. In most chronic intravascular hemolysis conditions, increased iron excretion is a constant finding, whereas hemoglobinuria occurs only intermittently. The only nonhemolytic causes in which increased iron excretion is found are hemochromatosis and the nephrotic syndrome.</p>
                        <p>Hemosiderinuria may be detected by means of a qualitative test based on the Prussian blue reaction. Alternatively, urinary iron content may be determined spectrophotometrically after wet digestion of a measured urine specimen: the normal value for urinary iron excretion is less than 0.1 mg/day. In a variety of disorders associated with intravascular hemolysis, urinary iron values increase to between 3 and 11 mg/day. Normal or nearly normal values are found in patients with pernicious anemia and in hereditary spherocytosis. Thus, urinary iron determination is a useful and consistent sign of intravascular hemolysis. It may not reflect the current ongoing clinical situation, however, because of its persistence after termination of the process.</p>
                        <h4>Methemalbumin and Hemopexin</h4>
                        <p>Hemoglobin in plasma is readily oxidized to methemoglobin, from which the heme group easily detaches. The liberated heme binds to hemopexin and also to albumin, forming methemalbumin. Hemopexinheme and methemalbumin impart a coffee-brown color to plasma. With either combination, spectral absorption band is observed at 620-630 nm, which, unlike a similar band in methemalbumin, does not disappear if hydrogen peroxide is added. With the addition of ammonium sulfide, at 620-630 nm, band disappears and a band at 558 nm forms (Schumm test).</p>
                        <p>The presence of these pigments strongly suggests intravascular hemolysis, but they have also been observed in association with hemorrhagic pancreatitis. Although hemopexin can be depleted in the course of serving its function, depletion occurs less regularly than as occurs with haptoglobin. Low hemopexin values usually indicate that the hemolytic anemia is severe; values are often near normal if illness is mild. Hemopexin tends to be absent or scant in mildly affected patients with unstable hemoglobins that lose heme as they denature intracellularly. Low hempexin values are also characteristic of thalassemia major, sickle cell anemia, and the hemolytic anemia that follows cardiac surgical procedures.</p>

                            <li>Increased erythrocyte turnover</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Biochemical</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Increased erythrocyte creatine</li>
                            <li>Increased activity of certain erythrocyte enzymes; uroporphyrin -1-synthetase, hexokinase, glutamate oxalate transaminase</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3>Reticulocytosis</h3>
                        <p>An increased number of circulating reticulocytes continues to be the most readily and most widely used index of accelerated erythropoiesis, even though the statistical errors in enumerating them are common. The erythrocyte production rate is likely to be greatly increased when hemolysis is severe enough to produce anemia. Therefore, the reticulocyte count will probably be substantially, not minimally, increased, phenomenon that minimises the importance of the technical limitations involved in the determination.</p>
                        <p>As on date, the normal range of percentage of reticulocytes (vis-a-vis number of erythrocytes in the sample evaluated) is taken to be 0.5-1.5%, but a more accurate and realistic range is considered to be 0.8-2.5% in men and 0.8-4.1% in women.</p>
                        <p>In most varieties of hemolytic anemias the reticulocyte count consistently increases to levels that correlate fairly well with the severity of the process. Exceptions occur mainly during aplastic crisis.</p>
                        <h3>Chemical Markers of Cell Age</h3>
                        <p>The most promising of these difficult to ascertain chemical markers is erythrocyte creatine. Creatine levels in young cells is 6-9 times higher than those in older cells and the elevation persists for as long as 20 days of RBC lifespan, compared to the reticulocyte maturation time of 1-3 days. As a result, the erythrocyte creatine values noted after therapy of iron deficiency anemia peak later and last longer than the reticulocyte count. Erythrocyte creatine level correlates with the reticulocyte count but the relationship is not linear. The former appears to be a more sensitive indicator of red cell age than is the latter, so it may be increased in people with mild hemolytic processes when the reticulocyte count remains equivocal. Erythrocyte creatine determinations appear to be more reproducible and less affected by technician variability than in the reticulocyte count. It may provide a more accurate assessment of the intensity of the hemolytic process; however, more studies are necessary to correctly evaluate its utility.</p>
                        <h3>Other Morphologic Findings in the Blood</h3>
                        <p>With reticulocytosis, polychromatophilia and fine stippling are apparent on routinely stained smears of peripheral blood. Macrocytosis is found in association with most hemolytic disorders because of erythropoietin-mediated stimulation of hemoglobin synthesis and because prematurely released (shift) reticulocytes are larger than normal erythrocytes. Exceptions occur in hereditary spherocytosis and sickle cell anemia, diseases in which the intrinsic defect of the cell tends to decrease its size.</p>
                        <p>With brisk hemolysis, nucleated RBCs are released in the circulation (erythroblastosis), usually in numbers below 1% of all the nucleated cells. In infant, however, erythro-blastosis may be more striking, especially in hemolytic disease of the newborn.</p>
                        <p>Concomitantly, there may be neutrophilic leukocytosis and thrombocytosis in hemolytic anemia. These findings tend to be most common and most pronounced in patients with acute hemolytic anemias. Platelets are increased in number and also in size (giant platelets). The changes are less pronounced in chronic hemolytic processes. Leukopenia and thrombocytopenia are unusual findings in people with hemolytic disease. Their presence suggests such diagnosis as paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), hemolysis accompanying SLE, or, in a few cases of idiopathic autoimmune hemolytic anemia.</p>
                        <h3>Bone Marrow</h3>
                        <p>Erythroid hyperplasia is the hallmark in hemolytic anemia. The simplest way is to examine marrow aspirates or biopsy specimens. This way is a qualitative or semiquantitative technique, and is not suitable for precise calculation of production rates. An important fact to remember is that marrow specimens represent only a tiny miniscule sample of whole marrow and may not always accurately reflect the degree of change.</p>
                        <p>In smears of aspirated specimens, erythroid hyperplasia is manifest by a reduction in the myeloid to erythroid (M/E) precursor ratio. In hemolytic disease, the ratio is less than 1.5 and may be as low as 0.5 . Because this ratio also may decrease as the result of reduction in granulocyte precursors, the meaning of the ratio must be evaluated in the light of the total clinical scenario.</p>
                        <p>Judging marrow cellularity from an aspirate is less appropriate than judging it from a marrow biopsy.</p>
                        <h3>FERROKINETIC STUDIES</h3>
                        <p>The plasma iron transport rate (PITR) is considered a measure of total erythropoiesis and correlates well with the degree of erythroid hyperplasia. The erythrocyte iron turnover rate (EITR) is a measure of effective erythropoiesis and correlates well with the reticulocyte production index. In hemolytic anemia, the PITR reaches 2-8 times the normal rate and EITR increases 2-4 times. Ferrokinetic measures of ineffective erythropoiesis may also increase. These determinations provide accurate information regarding rates of erythropoiesis. Nevertheless, they are unnecessary for most patients because the reticulocyte count and other easily obtained determinations are simpler, faster, much less expensive, and nearly as accurate.</p>

                        <h3>SPECIFIC MORPHOLOGIC ABNORMALITIES (TABLE 8.2)</h3>
                        <p>A competent, careful examination of well-prepared and stained blood smear is the single most valuable tool in defining the underlying cause leading to hemolytic anemia. Detection of certain distortions of red cell shape is of particular diagnostic utility because there presence suggests only one or a few entities.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Spherocytes</h4>
                        <p>Spherocytes or spherical erythrocytes are the hallmark of hereditary spherocytosis. They are also found in most cases with acquired immunohemolytic anemias, thermal injury, hypophosphatemia, or certain kinds of chemical poisoning.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Elliptocytes</h4>
                        <p>Elliptocytes or oval cells are characteristic of hereditary elliptocytosis.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Stomatocytes</h4>
                        <p>Stomatocytes, suggest a disturbance in red cell cation content, are found in association with a rare inherited hemolytic disease and also occurs as a transient abnormality in acute alcoholics.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Acanthocytes</h4>
                        <p>Acanthocytes indicate disturbed erythrocyte lipid composition; they occur in association with abetalipoproteinemia and the spur cell anemia that usually accompanies hepatic cirrhosis.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Echinocytes</h4>
                        <p>Echinocytes (sea urchin cells) are found in hereditary deficiencies of certain enzymes such as pyruvate kinase and phosphoglycerate kinase. They are a nonspecific morphologic abnormality and are also found in uremia.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Sickle Cells</h4>
                        <p>Sickle cells are named after the unmistakable sickle-shaped poikilocytes that characterize sickle all anemia.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Target Cells</h4>
                        <p>Target cells are characteristic of thalassemia, the homozygous abnormal hemoglobin states, and lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) deficiency; they also occur in nonhemolytic states such as obstructive jaundice and after splenectomy.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Schistocytes</h4>
                        <p>Schistocytes helmet cells or other fragmented cells suggest hemolysis associated with physical trauma to the erythrocyte or with diseases affecting small blood vessels.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Erythrophagocytosis</h4>
                        <p>Erythrophagocytosis, or the presence in blood of phagocytic cells containing recognizable whole red cells, is an uncommon finding. When observed, it suggests damage to the red cell surface, especially that induced by complement-fixing antibodies, but also by protozoan and bacterial infectious agents and certain chemical poisons.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Autoagglutination</h4>
                        <p>Autoagglutination may be apparent in blood smears or may even be visible to the naked eye when the blood is allowed to flow along the side of a glass container. The phenomenon is particularly observed in immunohemolytic disease caused by cold agglutinins. Autoagglutination must be differentiated from rouleaux formation, a finding observed in multiple myeloma and related diseases and the phenomenon responsible for accelerated rates of erythrocyte sedimentation.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Coombs' Test (Antiglobulin Test)</h3>
                        <p>The direct Coombs test is most widely used for detection of immunohemolytic anemia. Positive tests indicate that the red cells are coated with IgG or complement components especially C3. The test is usually sufficient, but up to 5% of cases with immunohemolytic disease may have negative test results because the amount of globulin on the cell surface is below the detection limits. Rarely, patients have weakly positive test results and clinical evidence of hemolysis. Positive tests are found in up to about 35% of patients with AIDS without other evidence of immunohemolytic disease.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Osmotic Fragility Test</h3>
                        <p>This test is a measure of the resistance of erythrocytes to hemolysis by osmotic stress. The test consists of exposing red cells to decreasing strengths of hypotonic saline solutions and measuring the degree of hemolysis. To construct the conventional osmotic fragility curve, percent hemolysis is plotted on the vertical axis against decreasing saline concentration on the horizontal axis. A symmetric sigmoidal curve is obtained in most individuals. Other ways of plotting curves are there. Osmotic fragility can also be described in terms of the saline concentration at which hemolysis begins (normally 0.45-0.50 g/dL) and at which it is complete (normally 0.30-0.33 g/dL). Especially useful is the median corpuscular fragility (MCF), the saline concentration at which 50% of the red cells hemolyse (normally 0.40-0.455 g/dL). Increased fragility is indicated by a shift of the curve to the left or an increased value for MCF. Osmotic resistance (reduced fragility) is signified by a rightward shift and a reduced MCF value.</p>
                        <p>Increased osmotic fragility is observed in conditions associated with spherocytosis. Hemolysis occurs in part because scant quantities of fluid need be absorbed by spherical cells to stretch their membranes to the bursting point, but other factors such as leakiness of the membrane (increased permeability to cations) and the intracellular osmotic pressure, may also be important. With prior incubation of sterile blood for 24 hours, the increased osmotic fragility of spherocytes is greatly accentuated, whereas normal cells become only slightly more fragile. The osmotic fragility of unincubated blood may be normal in some patients with hereditary spherocytosis, and incubation of the red cells may be necessary to distinguish then from normal cells. The changes in osmotic fragility with incubation time are actually quite complex but 24 hours is an optimal time for differentiating normal blood from spherocytic blood.</p>
                        <p>Increased resistance to breakdown in hypotonic saline solutions is observed in thalassemia, sickle cell anemia, and other disorders in which many leptocytes, including target cells, are found. Sometimes, a few very fragile cells may also be detectable in these cases. With prior incubation, target cells and leptocytes may even become more resistant to hemolysis, causing a further rightward shift to the curve.</p>
                        <p>Estimating osmotic fragility therefore appears to be importance mainly in confirming important morphologic finding, especially the presence of spherocytes but also that of leptocytes. A well-observed smear studied by a well-trained hematologist often provides significant information usually.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Autohemolysis</h3>
                        <p>The autohemolysis test is a measure of the amount of spontaneous hemolysis that occurs after the incubation of sterile, defibrinated blood at 37°C for 48 hours. Comparison is made with values obtained when glucose or ATP is added before incubation with normal blood, minimal hemolysis (mean 2%) takes place in 48 hours and even less (0.3%) with the addition of glucose or ATP. Based on this, two types have been described: Type I-pattern is characterized by autohemolysis that is only slightly or moderately increased and is incompletely corrected by either ATP or glucose. The type II pattern is characterized by autohemolysis that is greatly increased (mean 13%) and corrected by ATP but not by glucose. A third pattern occurs in hereditary spherocytosis, namely greatly increased autohemolysis with complete or nearly complete correction with either ATP or glucose. Type I hemolysis is seen in G6PD deficiency and type II in pyruvate kinase deficiency. However, the patterns are neither sensitive nor specific. The investigation is only of historical relevance today.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Tests for Hemolytic Disorders Associated with Heinz Body Formation</h3>
                        <p>In certain disorders, the hemolytic process depends on precipitation of hemoglobin, with the formation of inclusions known as Heinz bodies. These inclusions are rapidly eleminated by spleen. Heinz body formation is the principal mechanism of hemolysis in G6PD deficiency and related disorders, in unstable hemoglobin disease, in the thalassemias, and in certain kinds of chemical injury. These bodies are observed only with supravital staining techniques. Cells containing these inclusions may be found in the blood during an acute drug reaction in G6PD deficient individuals and also in splenectomized patients with unstable hemoglobin disease. With an intact spleen they are hardly ever seen.</p>
                        <p>Inducing Heinz body formation in vitro is possible by incubating RBCs with acetylphenylhydrazine. The number, size and rate of formation of the inclusions tend to be greater in cells from patients with the disorders mentioned previously than in other individuals, however, the frequency of occurrence of false-positive result in association with many anemias has limited the utility of this procedure.</p>
                        <p>The glutathione stability test depends on the observation that when sensitized cells are exposed to acetylphenylhydrazine, the glutathione level falls rapidly to low levels; the rate and amount of decrease exceed those of normal cells. Investigation is technically difficult and hardly ever used.</p>
                        <p>The ascorbate-cyanide test is a sensitive measure of abnormal susceptibility of hemoglobin to peroxidative denaturation. It depends on the coupled oxidation of ascorbate with oxyhemoglobin to produce hydrogen peroxide. When catalase in inhibited with cyanide, the glutathione-dependent system is required to protect against peroxidative damage to hemoglobin. The test is easy and fast to perform and results are strongly positive in patients with deficiencies of G6PD or glutathione peroxidase and with some unstable hemoglobin disorders. Lesser degrees of positivity have been reported in association with deficiences of glutathione reductase or pyruvate kinase and in individuals heterozygous for G6PD deficiency.</p>
                        <p>For simplicity, only the ascorbate-cyanide test is preferable for routine use. More specific tests, such as enzyme spot tests or the heat stability test for unstable hemoglobins, also are useful in differential diagnosis of these disorders.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Diagnosis here is a double-step process: first, demonstrating that a hemolytic anemia exists and, second determining the specific cause of the condition. A usual error made in practice is the pursuit of the second objective before the first is established. Reversal of this process can wasteful and unproductive.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Does Hemolytic Anemia Exist?</h3>
                        <p>Hemolytic anemia is usually suspected when anemia exists in conjunction with signs of increased RBC destruction and/or signs of accelerated RBC production. However, no single test for hemolytic anemia exists that is absolutely reliable. Therefore, the diagnosis necessitates very careful analysis of erythrokinetic information along with due consideration of situation that might be misleading signs of accelerated erythropoiesis characteristically appear after hemorrhage, the intentional or inadvertent treatment of certain nutritional deficiencies, or the recovery from marrow failure. Apparent evidence of an increased rate of RBCs destruction is often noted in conditions associated with ineffective erythropoiesis, disorders of bilirubin catabolism and loss of blood into a tissue space. If these situations can be excluded, the signs become reliable indicators of hemolytic disease.</p>
                        <p>The findings characteristic of hemolytic anemia of recent onset differ considerably from those typically noted in association with established chronic disease. In the latter, the compensatory increases in the rate of RBC production have been implemented, and signs thereof are prominent. Thus, the most common manifestation of chronic hemolytic anemia and reticulocytosis, is often associated with various signs of excessive blood destruction. In contrast, the onset of acute hemolytic anemia is not accompanied by signs of accelerated red cell production. Clinicians may suspect such a diagnosis because of the abrupt onset of hemoglobinuria or other signs of intravascular hemolysis or because of a rapid fall in blood hemoglobin concentration from previously stable levels. As a rule, a decrease of more than 1.1 g/dL/week is indicative of hemolysis, hemorrhage, or hemodilution. If hemorrhage and hemodilution can be excluded, the presence of hemolytic anemia is established.</p>
                        
                        <h3>CONDITIONS THAT CAN SOMETIMES BE MISTAKEN FOR HEMOLYTIC ANEMIA</h3>
                        <h4>Associated with anemia and reticulocytosis</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Hemorrhage</li>
                            <li>Recovery from iron, folate or vitamin B₁₂ deficiency</li>
                            <li>Recovery from marrow failure, as by cessation of alcohol consumption or stoppage of cytotoxic druges</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Associated with anemia and acholuric jaundice</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Ineffective erythropoiesis (intramedullary hemolysis)</li>
                            <li>Loss of blood into a body cavity.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Acholuric jaundice without anemia</h4>
                        <p>Marrow invasion (myelofibrosis, metastatic disease) myoglobinuria.</p>
                        <p>The anemias associated with acute hemorrhage and those with partially treated deficiency states are characterized by transient anemia and reticulocytosis. They can usually be distinguished from hemolytic disease by the absence of icterus and by a rising VPRC on subsequent determinations.</p>
                        <p>Anemias caused by ineffective eythropoiesis often are accompanied by acholuric jaundice and by erythroid hyperplasia of the marrow; however, the reticulocyte count is often not raised. In equivocal situations, a necessary step may be to measure RBC survival which is distinctly shortened in hemolytic disease and normal or nearly normal in association with ineffective erythropoiesis. The two conditions can also be differentiated on the basis of results obtained from ferrokinetic studies.</p>
                        <p>An especially confusing situation may arise after occult hemorrhage into the retroperitoneal space or other tissue compartments; anemia develops rapidly and reticulocytosis follows. Furthermore, indirect hyperbilirubinemia may occur as the result of reabsorption of the products of hemoglobin breakdown at the site of hemorrhage. Thus, the picture of hemolytic anemia is simulated in several ways. Diagnosis depends on detecting signs of the hemorrhage itself or of the disease process leading to it. If occult hemorrhage is suspected, serial observations usually clarify the situation; once the hemorrhage stops, the VPRC, reticulocyte count, and bilirubin values return to normal.</p>
                        <p>In patients with acholuric jaundice but without anemia, the differential diagnosis lies between a compensated hemolytic state and Gilbert's syndrome or other disorders of bilirubin metabolism. Reticulocytosis or morphologic erythrocytic abnormalities are typical findings in the former. In mild compensated hemolytic disease, however, one cannot always be certain that the hematologic values will be abnormal. Fasting induces an exaggerated increase in bilirubin in patients with Gilbert's syndrome, and this plenomenon may be useful in distinguishing Gilbert's syndrome from hemolytic anemia. Measurement of RBC survival provides more assurance; however, if the patient is asymptomatic, little may be gained from precise diagnosis.</p>
                        <p>Anemia associated with marrow invasion may be accompanied by erythroblastosis and bizzare abnormalities of RBC morphology. Mild reticulocytosis may develop because of premature release (shift to the left). Usually, patients do not have jaundice, however, and evidence of invasive disease may be detected by examination of the bone marrow.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Specific Cause Determination</h3>
                        <p>The diagnostic analysis should begin with information form the history taking and the results of blood smear examination and an antiglobulin test. From data so obtained, five groups of patients can be distinguished.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Those in whom the diagnosis is clear because of obvious exposure to infections, chemical, or physical agents.</li>
                            <li>Those with antiglobulin-positive hemolytic anemia, such individuals may be presumed to have immunohemolytic anemia. The underlying disease as well as a serologic study of the nature of the antibody must be undertaken.</li>
                            <li>Those with antiglobulin-negative, spherocytic hemolytic anemia. Such patients are probably cases of hemolytic anemia. Confirm this by osmotic fragility test and also study the familial involvement. Some unusual causes of spherocytosis without any familial involvement may warrant consideration, immunohemolytic anemia may be associated with spherocytosis and is occasionally associated with negative antiglobulin test. Procedures more sensitive than the routine Coombs' test may be useful in such circumstances. Exposure to chemical or infectious agents producing spherocytosis may not always be easy to establish.</li>
                            <li>Those with other specific morphological abnormalities of erythrocytes. The significance of various types of poikilocytes has been discussed earlier. Some poikilocytes, such as elliptocytes and sickle cells, are virtually pathognomonic findings.</li>
                            <li>Those with no specific erythrocytic morphological anomalies and a negative reaction to antiglobulin test. These patients warrant a battery of screening tests, including hemoglobin electrophoresis, the heat denaturation test for unstable hemoglobin disease, the ascorbate-cyanide test, spot test for deficiencies of pyruvate kinase and G6PD, and a screening test for paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria.</li>

                        <p>If all of these procedures yield normal results, making the diagnosis is likely to be difficult. One of the rarer erythrocyte enzyme deficiencies is possible, but these entities can only be established only by employing specific assays.</p>

                        <p>Precise management is dependent upon the diagnosis. Ascertain the cause of anemia and treat it if possible. Further exposure to any chemical, drug, or any other etiologic agent must stop, or if a bacterial agent is responsible, a specific antibacterial therapy must be instituted. Appropriate treatment of patients with symptomatic hemolytic anemias is determined with consideration of the underlying disease.</p>
                        <p>A patient with an acute attack of hemolysis should be treated by appropriate measures to relieve shock, if present, to maintain fluid balance, and to allow renal repair if the kidneys have been damaged. Blood transfusions, so useful in acute anemia of other types, must be used with caution in the treatment of patients with acquired hemolytic because even with careful blood matching, destruction of the transfused blood with an increase in the burden on the excretory organs and sometimes with ensuing thrombosis that may occur. Nevertheless, when blood destruction is rapid, the dangerous consequences of shock can be met only by administration of adequate amounts of blood. The presence of antibodies makes the blood matching that much more difficult. Whenever possible, the patients, blood should be genotyped before the first transfusion, with determination of the specific antibodies. Blood homologous as to ABO and Rh blood groups should be matched with that of the patient and the best match should be used. Samples of the recipient's serum and prospective donor's cells should be incubated together in a test tube at 37°C for 1 hour to ascertain whether the cell will undergo hemolysis by the hemolysins contained in the serum. Despite all such precautions, transfusion may nevertheless accelerate hemolysis. Such patients may require exchange transfusion.</p>
                        <p>Mildy damaged red cells are removed by spleen and severely damaged red cells are destroyed by macrophages in many organs, especially the liver. Therefore, patients with diseases associated with mild red cell defects are most likely to respond to splenectomy. The best case to respond is hereditary spherocytosis. Hereditary elliptocytosis also responds well. Anemia associated with certain of the red cell enzymatic deficiencies may lessen after splenectomy, but the response is only partial, and continuing signs of hemolysis are to be expected; such responses have been observed in patients with Deficiencies of pyruvate kinase, hexokinase or glucose-phosphate isomerase. In mild-to-moderate case of unstable hemoglobin disease, splenectomy helps.</p>
                        <p>In individuals with immunohemolytic anemia, splenectomy may be effective not only because the spleen is a site of RBC destruction, but also because it may be a source of antibody production. In general, patients with warm antibodies are more likely to respond than those with cold antibodies, patients with splenomegaly respond better, and those with incomplete antibodies, especially if present in small amounts, are more likely to respond favorably to splenectomy than those with complete agglutinins or complement-fixing antibodies. In spite of these generalizations, the results, of splenectomy are still quite unpredictable, which has led to efforts to develop methods for assessing the erythroclastic function of the spleen in the individual patient. Such methods are based upon the injection of ⁵¹Cr-labeled erythrocytes and subsequent monitoring of the radioactivity over the spleen and liver with a unidirectional scintillation counter. Excessive splenic sequestration suggests that the spleen is playing a major role in hemolysis, and that its removal may be beneficial.</p>
                        <p>Steroid hormones are of tremendous value in the therapy of patients with certain forms of immunohemolytic anemia. For patients not responding to steroids, immunosuppression may be considered.</p>
                        <p>For some patients with chronic hemolytic disorders, folic acid is helpful in preventing megaloblastic crisis. A dose of 0.15-0.3 mg/day is ample for this purpose. Such therapy is particularly valuable for patients with severe continuing hemolysis; for people subsisting on marginal diets; and for pregnant patients.</p>
