                        <p>Pernicious anemia is seen worldwide and occurs due to deficiency of Castle's "intrinsic factor" in gastric secretions. Lack of this factor (binding protein) impairs absorption of vitamin B₁₂ leading to its deficiency and eventually anemia.</p>
                        <p>Pernicious anemia is seen commonly in persons in late adult life. It rarely affects individuals younger than 30 years and increases in frequency as age advances. A rare congenital form is also identified (appears before the age of 2 years) and there is total lack of intrinsic factor molecule, but the structure and function of gastric mucosa are otherwise normal, and no antibodies against gastric parietal cells are recognised another form known as juvenile pernicious anemia is also known where the disease manifests itself in the second decade of life. Gastric atrophy is noted and it is identical to the adult form. These conditions must be differentiated from megaloblastic anemia occurring in neonates as the result of congenital deficiency of transcobalamin II or other inborn errors of metabolism.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Etiology and Pathogenesis</h3>
                        <p>The fundamental abnormality is severe atrophic gastritis, leading to extreme deficiency of all gastric secretions including intrinsic factor, essential for the absorption of vitamin B₁₂. The gastric lesion probably develops as a result of an autoimmune attack on gastric cells. The basis of this may be genetic or gastritis secondary to other causes.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Genetic Factors</h4>
                        <p>Congenital form of pernicious anemia is inherited, probably as an autosomal recessive trait. The adult form of disease is not found to be familial. Genetic factors, however, do play a role in the etiology of adult pernicious anemia, the same is not discretely understood. A weak association has been made between the histocompatibility locus antigen HLA-B7 in some cases. The association of HLA-D antigens, especially Dw₂, Dw₅ and DR₂ is stronger and statistically significant.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Gastritis</h4>
                        <p>The indicence and severity of gastritis rises with advancing age. As the disease progresses, hydrochloric acid, pepsin, and intrinsic factor are lost, in that order. Patients with these forms are usually asymptomatic. Patients with severe atrophic gastritis or with gastric atrophy may develop vitamin B₁₂ malabsorption. Causes of simple gastritis include:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Chemical, thermal and mechanical injury to the mucosa or caused by Helicobacter pylori.</li>
                            <li>Nutritional deficiency-iron, folate, and ascorbate</li>
                            <li>Endocrinologic insufficiency-thyroid, adrenal, and pancreatic</li>
                            <li>Genetic abnormalities, and</li>
                            <li>Autoimmune disorders.</li>
                        </ol>
                        
                        <h4>Immunologic Mechanism</h4>
                        <p>About 85% cases of pernicious anemia have parietal cell antibody, 50% cases of gastritis also have this antibody and about 10-15% of normal subjects may also possess this antibody (many of these may, have asymptomatic gastritis). Two types of parietal cell antibodies exist: 1. Directed against a cytoplasmic antigen and 2. React with cell surfaces; the latter is cytotoxic to gastric mucosal cells in the presence of complement. Intrinsic factor antibodies occur in the serum of approximately 55% of patients with pernicious anemia (these antibodies are more specific to pernicious anemia). The most common type includes the so-called blocking antibodies, which prevent vitamin B₁₂ from complexing with intrinsic factor and are therefore presumed to combine with the intrinsic factor molecule at or near the B₁₂ binding site. Binding antibodies have also been detected. All of these antibodies belong to the IgG class. Intrinsic factor antibodies also can be detected in the gastric juice of 75% of subjects with pernicious anemia. They may be found even in the absence of a corresponding serum antibody. They may be either of IgG or the secretory IgA type (i.e. produced by gastric mucosal plasma cells). Thyroid antibodies frequently are found in patients with pernicious anemia and their relatives. Similar antibodies can be found in autoimmume connective tissue disorders, allergies, infections and pregnancy.</p>
                        <p>Cell mediated immunity in the form of cytotoxic lymphocytes has been observed in up to a third of pernicious anemia patients.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Clinical Manifestations</h3>
                        <h4>Mode of Onset and Initial Symptoms</h4>
                        <p>By the time the patient seeks medical advice, the anemia is usually moderate in severity. Sometimes, the initial symptoms may be referable to the neurologic system and subsequently symptoms of anemia also supervene.</p>
                        <p>The triad of weakness, sore tongue and paresthesias is the classic symptoms complex at presentation but the initial symptoms actually vary. Often, they are suggestive of some digestive disorders; cardiac, renal, or genitourinary disease; or even mental aberration or an obscure infection.</p>
                        
                        <h4>General Appearance</h4>
                        <p>When the anemia is severe, the patient's skin has a delicate lemon-yellow tint resulting from the combination of pallor and mild icterus. The sclerae may be yellowish, but often the increased bilirubin concentration detectable in the blood is rarely manifested clinically. Diffuse or blotchy, brownish pigmentation may be interspersed with patches of vitiligo. Skin hyperpigmentation has been noticed in blacks. The skin may be dry, but often is peculiarly velvety and smooth, yet inelastic. Petechiae are unusual. Rarely, a change in hair color, reversible by vitamin B₁₂ treatment, has been found. Weight loss can be from slight to considerable (explainable on account of anorexia).</p>
                        
                        <h4>Fever</h4>
                        <p>Hyperthermia of several degrees is common when anemia is severe. It disappears promptly following treatment.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Gastrointestinal System</h4>
                        <p>Glossitis is common and painful. The tongue appears beefy red. Its entire dorsum may be involved, or red patches may be evident at the margins or on the dorsum. Rarely the entire mouth may be involved, causing burning and pain on swallowing. More frequently, patients experience only burning or soreness, particularly of the anterior half of the tongue. The intensity of glossitis often subsides but the soreness recurs at variable intervals. Between attacks, the epithelium of the tongue is left devoid of papillae, thus producing the smooth, glazed tongue that is characteristic of pernicious anemia. Partial loss of taste may follow. With adequate therapy, some restoration of the papillae often occurs. Loss of appetite is a frequent complaint. Diarrhea may be found in some patients. Patients may have anorexia, nausea, flatulence, a sense of fullness and epigastric discomfort, heartburn, vomiting and irregular abdominal pain of varying intensity. Attacks of paroxysmal pain resembling the gastric crisis of tabes dorsalis sometimes occur. Such attacks may be associated with vomiting and some abdominal rigidity. The pain may be symptomatic of changes in the spinal cord.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Cardiovascular and Genitourinary Systems</h4>
                        <p>Cardiovascular symptoms of anemia have been discussed elsewhere (see under Red Blood Cells: Pathophysiology of Anemia, Cardiovascular Adjustments and Cardiorespiratory System in Chapter 3). In patients with severe neurological disease, impaired micturition and urinary retention may occur, predisposing them to infectious complications such as cystitis. Infertility has been ascribed occasionally to pernicious anemia.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Nervous System</h4>
                        <p>With present day better diagnostic tools, severe symptoms referrable to neurologic system are not so frequently seen. The degree of nervous system involvement does not correlate well with the degree of anemia. Nor is neurologic disease a "late stage" of deficiency. Up to 25% cases of cobalamin deficiency present with neurologic symptoms rather than anemia. In such cases the only hematologic abnormality found is hypersegmentation of nuclei of neutrophils. If treatment is delayed the neurologic symptoms may progress while hematocrit may not change. The neurologic illness chiefly affects the white matter of the dorsal and lateral columns of the spinal cord and the cerebral cortex. Myelin degeneration and loss of nerve fibers in the dorsal root ganglia are found on histologic examination. Peripheral nerve degeneration also occurs, but whether this represents a distinct lesion or process secondary to spinal cord disease is not sure. Degeneration of the celiac ganglia and of Auerbach's and Meissner's plexuses, as well as lesions in the lateral horns of the spinal cord, have been noticed. Because multiple nerve pathways are involved, the terms subacute combined degeneration and combined system disease have been employed.</p>
                        <p>Subjective sensory complaints constitute the earliest and most frequent evidence of nervous system involvement. Most commonly, the patient experiences symmetric tingling or "pins and needles" sensation, first in the tips of the toes and later in a stocking-and-glove distribution in all four limbs. Less often, the abnormal sensations may be described as numbness, coldness, or tightness. When paresthesias are the only symptom, little or no objective evidence of neurologic disease may be apparent.</p>
                        <p>In a more advanced stage, evidence of dorsal column involvement is clearer. The patient may complain of clumsiness, and his or her gait may be uncoordinated and ataxic. Reduced vibration sense, especially at higher frequencies is one of the earliest and most common objective signs (e.g. 256 cycles/sec). This abnormality often extends to the knees and, in severe cases, may go up to the iliac crest. Position sense may be impaired. The reaction to Romberg test may become abnormal.</p>
                        <p>The lateral columns (pyramidal tracts) become involved in the later and more severe stages of the disease. Weakness and a spastic or "scissors" gait may develop. The Babinski sign in the earliest and most reliable objective evidence of lateral column disease. Most commonly, tendon reflexes are substantially reduced, presumably because of peripheral nerve involvement, but hyperreflexia and clonus also may be observed as manifestations of pyramidal tract involvement.</p>
                        <p>Depression and impaired memory are among the most common mental symptoms but only the latter seem clearly related to vitamin B₁₂ deficiency. With severe anemia, there may be a clinically demonstrable reduction in the level of consciousness, for which the most valuable single test is the serial subtraction of numbers such as 9 from 90 (81). Uncommonly, serious mental changes, as indicated by delusions, hallucinations, maniacal outburst, and paranoid and schizophrenia, may occur. Other less common neurological manifestations of pernicious anemia include ophthalmoplegia, atony of the bladder, impotence, orthostatic hypotension related to autonomic neuropathy, perversion or loss of the senses of taste and smell and retrobulbar neuritis (this may be aggravated or precipitated by the use of tobacco).</p>

                        </div>
                        <ul>
                            <li>As a result of increased production of bile pigment, slight unconjugated (indirect) hyperbilirubinemia may be observed, but normal values of serum bilirubin are common and values exceeding 2.0 mg/dL are unusual.</li>
                            <li><strong>Cytogenetics:</strong> A wide variety of chromosomal anomalies have been described in marrow cells from patients with megaloblastic anemia. Individual chromosomes may be elongated, and the frequency of randomly distributed gaps and breaks is increased. Separation or spreading of centromere has been noticed. The chromosomal abnormalities disappear promptly with effective treatment.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h3>Epithelial Changes</h3>
                        <p>Resemble changes as observed in marrow and red cell precursors. The cells and their nuclei are abnormally large, nuclear chromatin is less coarse than normal and multiple nuclei may be found. Such abnormalities can be seen in cells from the buccal mucosa and vaginal mucosa; the later shows atypical changes as observed in neoplasia. Gastric lavage cells show creased or folded nuclear membranes, and small aggregates of chromatin stand out on the relatively empty background of the nucleus. The cytoplasm, as well as the nucleus, is enlarged and has a more vacuolated and granular appearance than is normal.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Gastrointestinal Secretion</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The total volume of gastric secretion is reduced to an average of 15 mL (about 10%) of normal. Absence of hydrogen ion secretion (achlorhydria) with maximal histamine stimulation (40 $\mu$g/kg body weight) is an almost universal finding. Hydrogen ion secretion may be said to have occurred when the pH falls by at least one unit and to a value below 6.0 with such stimulation.</li>
                            <li>The hallmark of pernicious anemia is the extreme deficiency of intrinsic factor in the gastric secretion. Gastric juice pepsin and pepsinogen levels in urine or serum tend to be reduced. Serum gastrin levels are increased in over 60 percent of cases with pernicious anemia, probably because gastrin secretion in normal subjects is inhibited by gastric acidity. The atrophic gastritis in patients with high gastrin levels tend to be limited to the body of the stomach and to spare the antrum. Excess plasma gastrin tends to induce hyperglycemia and to potentiate insulin secretion.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h3>Serum LDH and Other Enzymes</h3>
                        <p>Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity is increased in most patients with megaloblastic anemia. The magnitude of the increase is related to the degree of anemia.</p>
                        <p>Serum LDH also may be increased in association with hemolytic anemia, but usually to a lesser degree than with megaloblastic anemia. LDH1 and LDH2 are increased most (from among the five isoenzymes). In pernicious anemia, LDH1 activity exceeds that of LDH2, whereas the converse is true of other hemolytic anemias. In megaloblastic anemia, the source of the serum enzyme is thought to be the cells destroyed by ineffective erythropoiesis in the marrow. With specific therapy, serum LDH levels return to normal within 1-2 weeks. Other enzymes increased are-malate dehydrogenase, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, and $\alpha$-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase are increased to about the same extent as LDH; those for aldolase, phosphohexose isomerase, and isocitrate dehydrogenase are increased less consistently and to a lesser degree. Serum alkaline phosphatase activity is decreased in patients with pernicious anemia, as is that of serum and red cell cholinesterase.</p>
                        
                        <h3>OTHER BIOCHEMICAL FINDINGS</h3>
                        <p>Serum potassium concentration may be mildly diminished in pernicious anemia. Negative nitrogen balance usually is observed during relapse. Slightly excessive urinary excretion of taurine and other amino acids may be noted, an increase in urinary hydroxyphenyl compounds, probably derived from tyrosine has been found. Conversion of formate to serine by lymphocytes is inhibited. The skeletal fraction of alkaline phosphatase activity in serum falls with deficiency and rises again with treatment. Cholesterol and phospholipid values in plasma are reduced and return to normal with treatment.</p>
                        
                        <h3>COURSE, PROGNOSIS, AND COMPLICATIONS</h3>
                        <p>Present methods of treatment have completely changed the outlook in pernicious anemia. The most important present day cause of relapse is the patient's reluctance to continue treatment for life. Relapse is a common finding when the onset of some intercurrent disease or the need for some surgical measure distracted attention from antianemic therapy and caused it to be neglected at a time when it was most needed. Maintenance therapy should always be emphasised. The most serious long-term complication of pernicious anemia is carcinoma of stomach (incidence is about 3%). These patients also have higher incidence of colorectal carcinoma, especially during the 5-year period immediately following diagnosis. Upper intestinal carcinoid tumours also occur with increased frequency, possibly as a result of excessive gastrin secretion with consequent stimulation of enterochromaffin-like cells.</p>

                        <h3>Dietary Deficiency of Vitamin B₁₂</h3>
                        <p>This is unusual in nonvegetarians, as vitamin B₁₂ has widespread distribution in foods of animal origin and its extensive storage in liver. In strict vegetarians (as in India) vitamin B₁₂ deficiency can be found. Vegetarian diets are usually high in folic acid content. Mother's milk contains scanty amount of vitamin B₁₂. As dietary insufficiency is not so common, deficiency of vitamin B₁₂ usually is the result of defective absorption of the vitamin. This situation may arise because of lack of Castle's intrinsic factor or because of various disorders affective the small intestine.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Gastric Surgery</h3>
                        <p>During total gastrectomy, all intrinsic factor-secreting cells are removed, and vitamin B₁₂ deficiency inevitably supervenes if necessary supportive therapy is not given. Partial gastrectomy can also lead to megaloblastic anemia, though some IF-secreting cells remain intact. Such a situation arises usually, often surgical treatment (subtotal or partial gastrectomy) conducted for gastric ulcer (in gastric ulcer more gastric tissue is removed as compared to surgery conducted for duodenal ulcer). Achlorhydria associated may also produce iron deficiency anemia or when combined, produces dimorphic anemia. Iron deficiency anemia often complicates the picture and may obscure the megaloblastic changes. About a third of cases treated with gastric bypass operations for morbid obesity develop low serum vitamin B₁₂ levels within 2 years. Although gastric bypass does not interfere with IF secretion, it allows the IF to be exposed to pepsin and trypsin before binding of vitamin B₁₂ takes place (binding makes IF resistant to proteolysis). Destruction of gastric mucosa following ingestion of corrosive materials can also lead to IF deficiency on account of chemically induced ablation of gastric mucosa.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Intestinal Disorders</h3>
                        <h4>Small Bowel Bacterial Overgrowth</h4>
                        <p>Normally, bacterial overgrowth in the small intestine is prevented by gastric acid secretion and by the mechanical cleansing action of normal peristalsis. Any anatomical abnormality leading to stasis or recirculation of intestinal contents is likely to be accompanied by proliferation of microorganisms. Examples include diverticuli, anastomoses, fistulas, blind loops and pouches, strictures, scleroderma and amyloidosis. The bacterial population developing under such circum-stances resembles that of the colon (The promixal small bowel in healthy subjects may be sterile, or it may contain relatively low concentrations less than 10⁴ organisms/mL of contents, of gram-positive aerobes or facultative anerobes, such as lactobacilli and enterococci along with some coliforms). In conditions mentioned above, anerobic lactobacilli and bacteroides tend to predominate, and coliforms and clostridia may be found in high concentrations. The number of organisms may be as much as 10¹⁰/mL.</p>
                        <p>The main manifestations of the bacterial overgrowth syndrome are weight loss, megaloblastic anemia, steatorrhea and diarrhea. The steatorrhea probably results from bacterial hydrolysis of conjugated bile salts to form bile acids, which then are reabsorbed. By this mechanism, the concentration of intestinal bile salts becomes reduced below the critical level necessary for micelle formation, leading to malabsorption of fatty acids and monoglycerides. Vitamin B₁₂ absorption is uniformly reduced in the bacterial overgrowth syndromes; the defect is not corrected by administration of IF, but is corrected transiently by prior administration of certain antibiotics, especially tetracyclines.</p>
                        <p>Metronidazole, lincomycin and cotrimoxazole are also effective. The absorptive defect results from successful competition by the bacteria for dietary vitamin B₁₂, thus making it unavailable to the host. Surgical correction of the anatomic abnormality leads to normalization of the bowel flora and restoration of normal vitamin B₁₂ absorption.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Diseases Affecting the lleum</h4>
                        <p>As vitamin B₁₂ is absorbed chiefly in the ileum, ileal resection or bypass or diseases that may be localized to the ileum lead to malabsorption of the vitamin. Vitamin B₁₂ malabsorption has been observed in patients who have had as little as 1 foot of ileum resected and probably is always impaired if more than 6 feet are removed. The terminal ileum is affected in about 80 percent of patients with regional enteritis (Crohn's disease), and about 20-40% of these cases develop megaloblastic anemia. Both folate and vitamin B₁₂ deficiency may occur in Crohn's disease.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome</h4>
                        <p>Because of low pH of intestinal contents reaching the ileum, vitamin B₁₂ absorption may be impaired in this disorder, however, megaloblastic anemia is rarely seen.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Fish Tapeworm Disease</h4>
                        <p>Diphyllobothrium latum is a common parasite of freshwater fish and human infection results from ingestion of inadequately cooked fish. The deficiency of vitamin B₁₂ results from impaired absorption. As in the bacterial overgrowth syndromes, the malabsorption probably results from competition between the worm and the host for dietary vitamin B₁₂. The tapeworm is able to take up and bind the vitamin firmly. The parasite lodges in the ileum in carriers without anemia, whereas in those with anemia, the site of attachment tends to be in the jejunum. Apparently, the latter location enables the worm to bind the vitamin before it reaches the sites of absorption in the ileum. The anemia responds to expulsion of worms, but the response often is suboptimal if no vitamin B₁₂ is given.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Tropical Sprue and Celiac Disease</h4>
                        <p>These disorders lead to malabsorption of various nutrients. The most common cause of megaloblastic anemia in chronic malabsorption states is folic acid deficiency though.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Drug-induced Vitamin B₁₂ Malabsorption</h4>
                        <p>Para-aminosalicylic acid (PAS) if consumed for more than 6 weeks leads to moderate degree of vitamin B₁₂ malabsorption. The absorptive defect disappears about 2 weeks after use of the drug is discontinued. Reversible malabsorption of vitamin B₁₂ has also been observed in patients taking colchicine, neomycin, ethanol, omeprazole, or potassium chloride. Long-term usage of proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) with attendant atrophic gastritis can also lead to vitamin B₁₂ deficiency.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Familial Selective Vitamin B₁₂ Malabsorption (Imerslund Syndrome, Imerslund-Gräsbeck Syndrome)</h4>
                        <p>This inherited illness is characterized by the onset of megaloblastic anemia in childhood, usually during the first seven years of life, and by persistent proteinuria. It appears to be inherited as an autosomal recessive trait in most families. Patients with disorder are unable to absorb vitamin B₁₂ but the proteinuria persists, perhaps because of an associated renal tubular defect. In heterozygotes, defects in vitamin B₁₂ absorption lesser in severity than in homozygotes have been reported, but anemia does not develop. It is likely that the illness is caused by defective ileal receptors for the vitamin B₁₂ intrinsic factor complex, or their lack.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Functionally Abnormal Intrinsic Factor</h4>
                        <p>Abnormal intrinsic factor molecules have been found in some patients. These patients have an immunologically identifiable intrinsic factor in their gastric juice but the factor either cannot bind to B₁₂ normally or the complex cannot bind to the ileal receptor. Such patients resemble cases of pernicious anemia in many respects, but their gastric juice is normal and autoantibodies to parietal cells and intrinsic factor are lacking. It responds completely to parenteral administration of vitamin B₁₂.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Chronic Pancreatic Disease</h4>
                        <p>Cobalamin malabsorption appears to result from lack of pancreatic proteases and consequent inability to partially degrade the R proteins of saliva, gastric juice, and bile that compete with intrinsic factor. Nevertheless, fully developed megaloblastic anemia is rare in association with pancreatic disease.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Hemodialysis</h4>
                        <p>Serum vitamin B₁₂ concentrations fall progressively in patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis. Parenteral administration correct the defect.</p>
                        
                        <h4>HIV Infection</h4>
                        <p>Subnormal serum vitamin B₁₂ levels have been noted in 20-30% cases of AIDS and are especially more common in individuals receiving zidovudine therapy. Hematologically neutrophilic hypersegmentation is found. Cobalamin absorption appears to be impaired, but a clear explanation for the abnormality is not found.</p>

                        <p>Firstly identify the cause and type of deficiency. Replenish the deficient substance with adequate amounts and over a sufficiently long period. Avoid giving wrong vitamin or a mixture of agents. In addition to therapy with vitamin B₁₂ or folate, it is sometimes possible to treat the underlying disease, for example, by surgical correction of anatomic lesions leading to small bowel bacterial overgrowth, expulsion of the fish tapeworn, or discontinuation of drugs leading to vitamin malabsorption.</p>
                        <p>Blood transfusions are rarely required in association with megaloblastic anemia, except when the anemia is severe. Specific therapy usually brings about a dramatic response in 48-72 hours. The most important indications for transfusion are signs of circulatory collapse, high output cardiac failure with pulmonary congestion at rest, or even severe intractable angina.</p>
                        <p>When administering vitamin B₁₂, several objectives should be kept in mind: (a) to supply vitamin B₁₂ by a route whereby it will be absorbed, (b) to give amounts that will not only correct the deficiency of vitamin B₁₂ but also will provide the patient with ample stores of the vitamin, having due regard for its excretion, (c) to observe carefully the effects of administration, thereby confirm the diagnosis and to discover associated deficiencies, (d) to ensure administrtion of vitamin B₁₂, in pernicious anemia, for life. Cyanocobalamin and hydroxocobalamin are given most often and are capable of inducing and maintaining remissions in vitamin B₁₂ deficiency states, and both are nontoxic, except for the rare allergic reactions.</p>
                        <p>Parenteral injections of as little as 1 $\mu$g/day of vitamin B₁₂ induce a complete hematologic remission in patients with pernicious anemia. If stores are also to be replenished, considerably larger dosages are required. Various regimens are available for parenteral administration. One regimen involves giving 100 mg of cyanocobalamin intramuscularly daily for 6 or 7 days and following up with daily reticulocyte counts. If clinical improvement is noted within a week, the same amounts are given on alternate days for seven doses, then every 3-4 days for 2-3 weeks, thereby producing a total of 1.8-2.0 mg B₁₂ in 5 or 6 weeks. Alternatively, only 5 weekly injections of 1 mg each of hydroxocobalamin may be given, depending upon the desirability in the individual case for the patient to return for medical supervison. Under exceptional circumstances vitamin B₁₂ can be given orally. Injectable preparations, however, can be given orally in fruit juice. Vitamin B₁₂ can be given by the intranasal route but further studies are being awaited for recommending this route.</p>
                        <p>In patients with pernicious anemia, optimal maintenance therapy with cyanocobalamin consists of monthly injections of 100 mg for life. In other forms of megaloblastic anemia, this schedule may not be necessary, if the underlying cause can be corrected.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Response to Therapy</h3>
                        <p>Symptomatic improvement often is recognised before any change in the blood is noticed. The patient becomes more alert and more co-operative, and appetite improves.</p>
                        <p>An increase in number of reticulocytes is the earliest and most useful sign of hematologic response to therapy. Reticulocytes count is highest on days 5-8 post-therapy commencement. Nucleated red cells may appear in the blood when the reticulocyte response occurs. After a delay of 5-7 days a perceptible increase in the VPRC is observed. Normal values are reached within 4-8 weeks regardless of the initial degrees of anemia</p>
                        <p>Mean corpuscular volume (MCV), after an initial rise owing to increased numbers of reticulocytes, gradually decreases, often in a biphasic pattern. The neutrohilic leukocytes increase in number, usually reaching normal values within a week. During the increasing number phase, few myelocytes or very rarely myeloblasts may be seen.</p>
                        <p>Hypersegmentation is not observed two weeks after commencement of therapy. Platelet count returns to normal within a week.</p>
                        <p>In bone marrow, ineffective erythropoiesis is reversed within 24 hours. After commencement of correct therapy, within 6-10 hours, the number of megaloblasts may decrease greatly. Within 24-48 hours, normoblastic maturation is seen. Giant metamyelocytes take about a week to disappear from bone marrow after commencement of therapy.</p>
                        <p>Biochemically, the increased plasma iron concentration characteristic of megaloblastic anemia in relapse decreases over 24-48 hour period. The serum iron level may remain low for several weeks. The plasma bilirubin concentration falls at about the end of the first week and is usually normal at 3 or 4 weeks. Urinary urobilinogen values begin to decrease at the end of the recticulocyte response. Free erythrocyte protoporphyrin levels increase with therapy.</p>
                        <p>The serum urate level increases as reticulocytosis occurs, presumably because of accelerated turnover of DNA in rapidly proliferating erythrocyte precursors. Urinary phosphorus content decreases rapidly when the appropriate vitamin is given, increases during reticulocytosis, and then gradually returns to normal values. Serum potassium concentration falls an average of 0.9 mEq/L during the first 48 hours of therapy and then gradually returns to normal over the next several weeks serum LDH levels return to normal within 1-2 weeks.</p>
                        <p>Neurologically, an occasional patient may experience a transient increase in paresthesias during the first week of treatment but this subsides and progressive improvement follows. Depending upon the duration and intensity of neurologic symptoms, full recovery may or may not take place. As a thumb rule, manifestations persisting a year after commencement of treatment may be considered irreversible. Absence of anemia conveys a worse prognosis for neurologic response.</p>

                        <span class="heading-text">Folate Deficiency</span>
                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The hematologic manifestations of folate deficiency and vitamin B₁₂ deficiency are identical, namely megaloblastic anemia. No hematologic finding can reliably distinguish between the two deficiencies. They differ considerably, however, in their clinical settings. Folate deficiency occurs most often in individuals who are malnourished, usually because of their socioeconomic backgrounds. Traditionally, neurologic manifestations have been considered to be a major clinical difference between vitamin B₁₂ and folate deficiency. Few reports, have however, indicated that polyneuropathy and subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord, can occur in folate deficiency. In addition, certain neuropsychiatric symtpoms, e.g. depression, have also been reported. Folate deficiency has also been implicated in dementia. S-adenosylmethionine is essential to normal neurologic function and methionine synthesis requires both folate and vitamin B₁₂ cofactors.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Causes of Folate Deficiency</h3>
                        <h4>Dietary Deficiency</h4>
                        <p>A short period of dietary deprivation can lead to folate deficiency in an otherwise healthy individual. Normal folate stores remain adequate for only 2-4 months after the institution of a deficient diet, and in this respect folate differs markedly from vitamin B₁₂, the stores of which can last for several years.</p>
                        <p>Folate deficiency is seen more frequently in developing countries (main reason being poverty, but ignorance, customs, and religious tenets may also affect intake adversely). The diets associated with the development of folate deficiency are characterized by a predominance of starches and grains with relatively little animal protein or fresh, green vegetables. Nutritional folate deficiency has also been found in populations living in temperate areas. Major factors leading to folate deficiency in these regions are mental disturbances, chronic illness, alcoholism, food faddism, and poverty. Folate deficiency is often accompanied by other nutrient deficiencies as a part of a general picture of malnutrition. Particularly common is combined deficiency of vitamin C and folate because both vitamins are poorly stored and easily destroyed by heat used in food preparation. Often, treatment with both vitamins is necessary to completely correct megaloblastic anemia.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Alcoholism and Cirrhosis</h4>
                        <p>Megaloblastic anemia in alcoholic patients usually is the consequence of folate deficiency. Serum folate levels are reduced, FIGLU excretion is increased and vitamin B₁₂ levels are normal or increased. Dietary deficiency is the most important cause. Alcohol may also inhibit folate absorption, especially when folate stores are marginal, in part because chronic alcohol exposure inhibits an enzyme, pteroylglutamate hydrolase, that hydrolyses folate polyglutamates to the monoglutamate.</p>
                        <p>Alcohol also exerts direct toxic effects on bone marrow resulting in transient sideroblastic anemia. These two types of anemias often coexist after acute alcohol intoxication. Recovery from alcohol toxicity may lead to a reticulocytosis, which may suggest to the clinician that spontaneous recovery from anemia will occur, but if megaloblastosis persists, supplementation with folic acid will be required for full recovery.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Pregnancy</h4>
                        <p>Folic acid is routinely given to all pregnant women these days, still, few pregnancies are complicated by megaloblastic anemia of pregnancy. Multiparity, adolescent pregnancy and closely spaced, successive pregnancies are risk factors. Increased folate requirements combined with poor dietary intake is the usual cause.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Infants and Children</h4>
                        <p>Megaloblastic anemia in infants and children is widespread where malnutrition is common, for example, where kwashiorkor is endemic.</p>
                        <p>The normal requirement for folate in infancy is about 50 $\mu$g/day. Normal human milk and raw or pasteurized cow's milk contain about 50 $\mu$g of folate per liter. Thus with normal rates of milk intake, the infant requirements for folate can be met with milk alone. Boiling, however, leads to a 40-80% reduction in the folate content of milk, and folate is partially destroyed when preparing powdered milk. In general, serum folate levels are higher in breastfed than in bottle-fed infants. Nevertheless, megaloblastic anemia has been reported in breastfed infants, possibly because of decreased amounts of folate in the milk of mothers with marginal folate stores.</p>
                        <p>Goat's milk contains low amounts of folate (average, 6 $\mu$g/L). Goat's milk anemia is a form of megaloblastic anemia of infancy occurring in babies fed goat's milk exclusively.</p>
                        <p>Nutritional folate deficiency in infants has to be differentiated from congenital pernicious anemia, familial selective vitamin B₁₂ malabsorption, celiac disease, inborn errors of DNA synthesis, and vitamin B₁₂ deficiency in breastfed infants of mothers with subclinical vitamin B₁₂ deficiency.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Rapid Cellular Proliferation</h4>
                        <p>Folate deficiency with megaloblastosis has been observed as a complication of chronic hemolytic disorders (sickle cell anemia, thalassemia, hereditary spherocytosis, acquired autoimmune hemolytic anemia, drug-induced hemolytic anemia with G6PD deficiency, and paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria). Deficiency should be suspected when hemoglobin concentration and/or reticulocyte numbers fall from previously stable levels or when a new requirement for blood transfusion develops. Folate deficiency has also been observed in myelofibrosis, sideroblastic anemia, leukemia, multiple myeloma, and psoriasis. These disorders have in common a rapid proliferation of red cells, other marrow elements, or epithelial tissues. Presumably, the need for DNA synthesis, and therefore the need for folate, is increased under such circumstances. Often, however, other reasons for folate deficiency in the reported patients coexist, including pregnancy and deficient diet.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Congenital Folate Malabsorption</h4>
                        <p>A very rare disorder, becomes evident in the first few months of life. In addition to the absorptive disorder, defective transfer of folate to the central nervous system associated with mental retardation and ataxia has been seen.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Drug-induced Folate Deficiency</h4>
                        <p>Less than 1% of patients taking phenytoin (Dilantin), primidone (Mysoline), carbamazepine, and phenobarbital, alone or in combination, are reported to develop megaloblastic anemia. Although clinically important megaloblastic anemia is unusual, mild folate deficiency and macrocytosis without anemia are relatively common. Serum folate and RBC folate levels, both can be reduced. The exact mechanism of deficiency development is not very clearly understood. Theories to the effect that these drugs cause folate malabsorption or that they increase folate catabolism have been put forward. Megaloblastic anemia has also been reported in women taking oral contraceptives and patients receiving sulfasalazine for inflammatory bowel disease. Low folate levels have been associated with the long-term administration of cholestyramine in the management of hypercholesterolemia. Triamterine has also been implicated with folate deficiency, possibly due to an effect of the drug on folate absorption.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Tropical Sprue and Gluten-sensitive Enteropathy</h4>
                        <p>Both these disorders bring about a generalized state of intestinal malabsorption characterized by steatorrhea, weight loss, weakness and deficiency of a wide variety of nutrients. The morbid anatomy of both diseases is characterized by varying degrees of villous atrophy with loss of intestinal surface. The lesions of gluten-sensitive enteropathy are most severe in the proximal intestine, and the ileum is involved in only a few patients. The lesions of tropical sprue tend to be less severe but more extensive, the entire small intestine being affected. The diseases differ not only in their geographic distribution, but also in pathogenesis and response to specific modes of therapy.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Tropical Sprue</h5>
                        <p>It is endemic in many tropical areas (India included). For reasons unknown, it has been found more commonly in adults rather than children. Travelers to endemic areas may acquire the disease, but usually only after stay of 1 year or more. It is almost certainly infectious in origin, although a single etiologic agent has not been identified. Most likely, the disease represents the consequences of persistent small bowel infection by any of several enterotoxigenic strains of coliform bacteria, especially Klebsiella pneumoniae and, to a lesser extent E. coli and Enterobacter cloacae. Three clinical stages of tropical sprue have been recognised: Initial abrupt onset of diarrhea, anorexia, abdominal distension, and extreme asthenia, sometimes accompanied by fever. After an interval of weeks to months, the second, or deficiency phase supervenes as the result of prolonged malabsorption and depletion of nutrients, weight loss, glossitis, stomatitis, hyperkeratosis and continuing weakness are prominent in this stage. The third phase, megaloblastic anemia, develops after about 6 months. Because, the intestinal lesion is generalized, absorption of both folate and vitamin B₁₂ is impaired. In most individuals with tropical sprue, symptoms progress relentlessly unless specific therapy is initiated. Administration of folate (5 mg/day) not only induces hematologic remission, but also may bring about improvement in intestinal symptoms and pathologic lesions. About half the patients may require longterm administration of antibiotics. Complete recovery can be expected in patients who receive proper treatment.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Gluten-induced Enteropathy</h5>
                        <p>It includes both, coeliac disease of children and nontropical sprue (idiopathic steatorrhoea) in adults. The illness represents a possibly inherited, abnormal reaction to gluten a water insoluble, glutamine rich protein fraction of wheat and other grains-and to a related substance gliadin. The exact mechamism of disease induction is not clearly understood, but immune mechanism and environmental factors appear to be involved. Most glutensensitive patients carry IgG antigliadin antibodies.</p>
                        <p>In addition to weight loss, abdominal distention, and steatorrhea, patients with gluteninduced enteropathy may develop negative calcium balance with hypocalcemia, tetany, and demineralization of bones, with consequent bone pain and pathologic fractures. They may also become deficient in vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors. The most common cause of anemia in children with coeliac disease is iron deficiency, but folate deficiency also occurs in 10-40% of cases. About 90% of patients with adult form of the disease have folate deficiency, whereas only about 40% manifest vitamin B₁₂ malabsorption, presumably because the ileum is often spared. Iron absorption is diminished and iron stores often are low, but the anemia rarely appears hypochromic until the megaloblastic defect has been rectified. With a gluten free diet, the blood returns to normalcy over a period of several months. In "temperate sprue", the patients manifest with megaloblastic anemia without other clinical avidence of malabsorption. Other findings related to tropical sprue and gluten-induced enteropathy include; (1) increase in total fat in stool, (2) reduction in serum carotene and vitamin A levels. A malabsorption pattern is observed on radiographs of the intestine. The diagnosis of gluten-enteropathy requires demonstration of a response to a gluten-free diet. Alternatively, when the diagnosis is difficult to establish, the patient may be challenged with an oral dose of 3-5 g of gluten, which in sensitive subjects, promptly precipitates increase in diarrhea and fecal fat loss.</p>

                        <p>The form of folate used most commonly for therapy is pteroylmonoglutamic acid, also known as folic acid. Dosage depends upon severity of disease. Folinic acid is equally effective.</p>
                        <p>Normal body folate stores are estimated at 5-10 mg, an amount sufficient for 2-4 months of normal hematopoiesis stores of this magnitude can be maintained in normal subjects by a dietary intake of 50-100 $\mu$g/day. The folates normally found in foodstuffs are polyglutamates, which must be converted to the monoglutamate before absorption. This conversion may be defective in many folate deficiency states, especially those associated with certain drugs and malabsorptive disorder. On the other hand, the absorption of pteroylmonoglutamic acid in patients with these disorders may be normal or near normal. In normal subjects, approximately 80% (range 40-95%) of orally administered folic acid is absorbed. When folic acid is administered in daily doses of less than 200 $\mu$g, little or none is lost in the urine. At higher doses, urinary loss is considerable.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Doses and Routes</h3>
                        <p>Optimum hematologic response is elicited by 50-100 $\mu$g of folic acid given daily by the oral route. For replenishement of stores, however, larger amounts are required. A daily dose of 1 mg for 2-3 weeks should be enough. A patient who fails to respond to oral preparation will probably not respond to injections. Parenteral foms are required for patients who are unable to take medications by mouth.</p>
                        <p>Once stores are repleted, the need for maintenance therapy must be considered in the light of the underlying condition that produced the folate deficiency. If that condition can be corrected, normal dietary sources of folate should be enough. If this is not feasible, appropriate supplements in the range of 0-0.4 mg/day must be given. When the continued administration of diphenylhydantoin is necessary, a daily oral dose of 0.5-1 mg of folic acid may be needed. The usual dose of folinic acid is 3-15 mg, given intramuscularly. Folic acid is remarkably free of adverse reactions, except for a rare instance of allergic reaction. In some patients of epilepsy, seizures appear to have been aggravated by the administration of folate. By far the most important contraindication of folic acid therapy is the presence of an untreated deficiency of vitamin B₁₂. Here, a suboptimal hematologic response to folate may occur, but neurologic disease is not relieved. It is therefore advisable under such circumstances to perform vitamin B₁₂ and folic acid assays.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Conditions associated with megaloblastic anemia, but without deficiency of vitamin B₁₂ or folate, are considered here. These are discussed under two heading: inherited anomalies and disorders related to toxins and drugs.</p>
                        
                        <h3>INHERITED DISORDERS ALTERING DNA SYNTHESIS</h3>
                        <p>These are rare inherited disorders and are probably inherited as autosonal recessive traits.</p>
                        
                        <h4>HOMOCYSTINURIA AND METHYLMALONYL ACIDURIA</h4>
                        <p>There are at least 11 known different genetic disorders which are associated with methylmalonyl aciduria, homocystinuria, or both. They are often associated with pancytopenias. In some cases overt megaloblastic anemia has been observed. Some of these cases respond to large doses of vitamin B₁₂.</p>
                        <p>Intracellularly, cobalamin (Cbl) normally is converted to two coenzymes, methylcobalamin and adenosylcobalamin. Methylcobalamin is required for the conversion of homocystine to methionine, whereas adenosylcobalamin is a cofactor in the conversion of methylmalonyl coenzyme A to succinyl coenzyme A. The cobalt molecule in cobalamin that enters the cells is in the stable (3+) oxidation state and must be reduced to the labile (2+) state or (1+) state to be active as an enzyme cofactor. Of the 11 disorders (earlier written about), seven are disorders of mitochondrial cobalamin metabolism and are designated as Cbl-A to Cbl G respectively. In additon to these defects in cobalamin metabolism, methylmalonyl aciduria can result from complete (mut°) or partial deficiency (mut-) of the enzyme methylmalonyl coenzyme A mutase. Homocystinuria is also caused by cystathionine synthase deficiency and methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase deficiency (Neither is associated with any hematologic manifestations). Cbl A to Cbl G respond in varying degrees to large doses of vitamin B₁₂. Hydroxocobalamin is by and large more effective than cyanocobalamin and is given in a dose of 1 mg per day.</p>
                        
                        <h4>ABNORMAL VITAMIN B₁₂ TRANSPORT</h4>
                        <p>Transcobalamin II (TC II) is the physiologic transport protein for vitamin B₁₂. Absence of TC II or abnormal TC II molecules inherited as autosomal recessive traits can lead to megaloblastic anemia. Lack of the protein is associated with severe, potentially fatal disease, usually detected within the first 6-20 weeks of life. Signs include weakness, diarrhea, failure to thrive, megaloblastic anemia, pancytopenia, mucosal ulcers, and hypogammaglobulinemia. Neurological abnormalities may be present at onset or may develop later, a delay in treatment may make these abnormalities disabling. Several cellular and humoral immunologic deficiencies may be found.</p>
                        <p>Often, serum cobalamin levels are normal because most of the vitamin in plasma is bound to TC I and TC III. Homocystinuria or methyl malonic aciduria has occasionally been detected. The Schilling test for vitamin B₁₂ malabsorption may be abnormal. Diagnosis depends on the demonstration of a lack of TC II by means of chromatography or radioimmunoassay. Therapy with physiologic amounts of vitamin B₁₂ is ineffective, but large doses (1000 mg two to three times weekly) can reverse the clinical findings and bring about normal development.</p>
                        
                        <h4>OROTIC ACIDURIA</h4>
                        <p>Orotic aciduria is a disorder of pyrimidine metabolism inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. It represents a defect in the synthesis of uridine 5' monophosphate. Two enzymatic functions are defective in most patients: orotate phosphoribosyl transferase (OPRT) and orotidine 5' monophos-phate decarboxylase (ODC). Both appear to be properties of a single, structural protein, uridine 5' monophosphate synthase (UMPS). The gene for the enzyme is located on the long arm of chromosome 3. The onset of illness is noted in the first few months of life, but detection may be delayed for as long as 7 years. The patients have severe megaloblastic anemia and delayed physical and mental development.</p>
                        <p>They excrete large amounts of orotic acid in the urine. Orotic acid crystalluria may occur with associated hematuria and even urinary tract obstruction. Some patients may have associated cardiac malformations and/or defective immune function with increased susceptibility to infection. Deficient OPRT and ODC activities can be detected in erythrocytes and cultured fibroblasts. The condition does not respond to treatment with vitamin B₁₂ or folate, but hematologic remission and restoration of growth and development follow oral administration of uridine in doses of 100-200 mg/kg/day mental retardation and immune function may not be completely restored by uridine administration.</p>
                        
                        <h4>THIAMINE RESPONSIVE MEGALOBLASTIC ANEMIA</h4>
                        <p>TRMA is a triad consisting of megaloblastic anemia, diabetes mellitus, and sensorineural deafness. It shares some features with a more common disorder known DIDMOAD (diabetes insipidus diabetes mellitus optic atrophy and dilatation of the urinary tract), which may also be associated with TRMA. It is in all probability a genetic disorder. Consanguineous parents have been reported in a majority of the patients, and the mode of inheritance is almost certainly autosomal recessive. Patients have been treated with high doses of thiamine, either thiamine hydrochloride 50-100 mg per day or S-benzoyloxymethyl (BOM) thiamine, 50 mg per day. With treatment, a prompt reticulocytosis and relief of anemia occurs, with relapse of treatment. In most patients, hyperglycemia is moderated, and insulin requirements may be reduced and even eliminated. Cardiac arrhythmias also respond promptly to treatment. Deafness may improve, but is often resistant to treatment.</p>
                        
                        <h4>OTHER POSSIBLE DISORDERS</h4>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Methionine synthase (methyl tetrahydrofolate transferase) deficiency</li>
                            <li>Dihydrofolate reductase deficiency</li>
                            <li>Glutamate formiminotransferase deficiency</li>
                            <li>Lesch-Nyhan syndrome.</li>
                        </ol>
                        
                        <h3>DRUG-INDUCED DISORDERS OF DNA SYNTHESIS</h3>
                        <p>Megaloblastic anemia is a toxic side effect of a variety of drugs used for chemotherapy of leukemias and solid tumors and for immunosuppression. This effect has been reported with the use of 6-mercaptopurine, 5-fluorouracil, cyclophosphamide, cytosine arabinoside, azathioprine, and the folate antogonists. As these drugs exert their beneficial effects by interfering with DNA synthesis, the toxic effect may be considered an extension of their therapeutic actions. Megaloblastic changes are signaled by the development of pancytopenia and by the appearance of hypersegmented neutrophils and oval macrocytes in the blood.</p>
                        
                        <h4>FOLATE ANTAGONISTS</h4>
                        <p>Methotraxate and folate antagonists act by inhibiting dihydrofolate reductase. Less profound inhibition of this enzyme has been noticed as a side effect of drugs used for other purposes, including proguanil, pyrimethamine, triameterene, pentamidine and trimethoprim.</p>
                        <p>In combination with sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim is a widely used antibiotic and the preferred drug for use in the treatment of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. It exerts its antimicrobial effects by inhibiting bacterial dihydrofolate reductase. Human dihydrofolate reductase is less sensitive to trimethoprim than is the bacterial enzyme, and in the usually therapeutic doses, hematologic side effects are rare; however, in higher doses acute megaloblastic anemia may ensue. Folinic acid, a reduced form that bypasses the dihydrofolate reductase step, rapidly reverses the hematologic effects of folate antagonists. When used with trimethoprim, antimicrobial activity is not compromised because microorganisms are unable to utilize folinic acid. Doses of folinic acid 15 mg/day have been recommended for treatment.</p>
                        
                        <h4>NITROUS OXIDE</h4>
                        <p>The anesthetic gas nitrous oxide (N₂O) reacts with reduced cobalamins (Cbl-Co+1) to form inactive oxidised cobalamins (Cbl-Co+3). By this mechanisms, intracellular pathways that depend on cobalamin coenzymes are inhibited selectively. Folate metabolism is impaired secondarily. Megaloblastic anemia and/or neurologic abnormalities have been seen in patients exposed to nitrous oxide for treatment of tetanus, for analgesia related to open heart surgery or other surgical procedures, or as an adjunct to physiotherapy. Nitrous oxide anesthesia may precipitate neurologic disease in patients with subclinical vitamin B₁₂ deficiency.</p>
                        
                        <h4>OTHER DRUGS AND TOXINS</h4>
                        <p>Megaloblastic dysplasia has also been reported in association with arsenic intoxication and with chlordane exposure.</p>

                        <p>The anemia should be characterized. Pancytopenia and systemic impairment should be evaluated. The etiology of megaloblastosis should be identified.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Initial Studies</h3>
                        <p>Initial workup for megaloblastic anemia should include the following assays:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Complete blood count (CBC)</li>
                            <li>Red blood cell (RBC) indices</li>
                            <li>Peripheral blood smear</li>
                            <li>Reticulocyte count</li>
                            <li>Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)</li>
                            <li>Indirect bilirubin</li>
                            <li>Iron and ferritin</li>
                            <li>Serum cobalamin</li>
                            <li>Serum folate, and possibly RBC folate</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The LDH level is usually markedly increased in severe megaloblastic anemia. Reticulocyte counts are inappropriately low, representing lack of production of RBCs due to massive intramedullary hemolysis. These findings are characteristics of ineffective hematopoiesis that occurs in megaloblastic anemia as well as in other disorders such as thalassemia major.</p>
                        
                        <h3>PERIPHERAL SMEAR MORPHOLOGY</h3>
                        <p>A peripheral smear may reveal macro-ovalocytes, a characteristic of megaloblastosis (Fig. 6.7). They should be distinguished from macrocytes that are not oval, which can occur in liver disease and hypothyroidism. Polychromatophilic macrocytes, reticulocytes, and immature RBCs can be seen in hemolytic anemia and disorders associated with increased RBC production.</p>

                        </figure>
                        <p>Peripheral smear of blood from a patient with pernicious anemia. Macrocytes are observed, and some of the red blood cells show ovalocytosis. A 6-lobed polymorphonuclear leukocyte is present.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Single and multiple Howell-Jolly bodies, nuclear fragment, may be seen in RBCs. Cabot rings, remnants of mitotic spindles, may also be present in RBCs.</li>
                            <li>Nucleated RBCs and megaloblasts can be seen.</li>
                            <li>Smears may reveal hypersegmented neutrophils if at least 5% neutrophils have 5 or more lobes. Normal neutrophils contain 3-4 lobes.</li>
                            <li>Macrocytosis due to cobalamin or folate deficiencies may be masked in patients with iron deficiency. However, hypersegmented neutrophils can persist in iron deficiency.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h3>Bone Marrow Aspiration</h3>
                        <p>Bone marrow aspiration is usually not needed to make the diagnosis of vitamin B₁₂ deficiency. However, it can help rule out myelodysplasia and assess iron stores. The bone marrow is hypercellular with erythroid hyperplasia. Erythroid precursors have megaloblastic features being larger than normoblastic cells. In addition, nuclear maturation is immature relative to cytoplasmic maturation. Megaloblastic changes are most prominent in more mature RBC precursors. Giant bands, neutrophil precursers, can be present. Megakaryocytes may be large and hyperlobulated.</p>
                        <p>Bone marrow megaloblastic changes are reversed within 12 hours after treatment with cobalamin or folate, and bone marrow morphology appears to be normal within 2-3 days. Therefore, bone marrow aspiration, if necessary, should be performed as soon as possible and preferably before therapy.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Primary Tests for B₁₂ and Folate Deficiencies</h3>
                        <p><strong>Serum B₁₂ (cobalamin)</strong></p>
                        <p>Reference range: 200-900 pg/mL</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Borderline: 180-250 pg/mL</li>
                            <li>Associated with anemia and neuropathy: <180 mg/L</li>
                            <li>Diagnostic of B-12 deficiency: <150 mg/L</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The serum cobalamin level can be normal in the following circumstances:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>In some inborn areas of cobalamin deficiency</li>
                            <li>Transcobalamin II (TC II) deficiency</li>
                            <li>Cobalamin deficiency due to nitrous oxide</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Serum cobalamin levels may be low in the following circumstances:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Pregnancy</li>
                            <li>Oral contraceptives</li>
                            <li>Transcobalamin I (TC I) deficiency</li>
                            <li>Severe folic acid deficiency</li>
                            <li>Patients taking large doses of ascorbic acid</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <p><strong>Serum Folate</strong></p>
                        <p>Folate reference range in adults: 2-20 ng/mL</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Folate deficiency likely (overlap with normal): <2.5 ng/mL</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The following should be considered:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Effect of diet: A single meal may falsely elevate serum folate levels to normal. Hence, blood should be drawn prior to transfusions, meals, and therapy to achieve accurate results.</li>
                            <li>Hemolysis: Might cause false positive results</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <p><strong>RBC Folate</strong></p>
                        <p>Reference range for adults: >140 ng/mL</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Not affected by diet and reflects tissue stores (folate content is established early in RBC development)</li>
                            <li>Affected by hemolysis</li>
                            <li>Low in severe B₁₂ deficiency</li>
                            <li>Test is intricate and expensive</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Serum for folate and cobalamin should be frozen and stored prior to meals or therapy if the tests cannot be performed within a reasonable time frame.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Lab Tests to Confirm and Distinguish B₁₂ and Folate Deficiencies</h3>
                        <p>Serum homocysteine and methylmalonic acid (MMA) levels are helpful confirmatory tests for cobalamin and folate deficiencies. Both are increased in cobalamine deficiency. Homocysteine but not MMA is increased in folate deficiency. Homocysteine and MMA levels should be used if the clinical presentation and serum vitamin B₁₂ and folate levels are ambiguous.</p>
                        <p>The MMA level can be increased in the following circumstances:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>End-stage renal disease</li>
                            <li>Inborn error of methylmalonic acid metabolism</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Serum homocysteine can be increased in the following circumstances:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Homocystinuria</li>
                            <li>Hyperhomocysteinemia</li>
                            <li>MTHFR C677T</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Serum homocysteine can be decreased in the following circumstances:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>A high rate of conversion back to methionine</li>
                            <li>Low production</li>
                            <li>A high rate of conversion of into sulfite/sulfate, etc.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h3>Intrinsic Factor (IF) Blocking and Parietal Cell and Antibodies</h3>
                        <p>IF antibodies, type 1 and type 2, occur in 50% of patients with pernicious anemia and are specific for this disorder. Therefore, they can be used to confirm the diagnosis of pernicious anemia. Parietal cell antibody occurs in 90% of patients with pernicious anemia but can also occur in thyroid disease and other autoimmune disorders. Therefore, parietal cell antibodies are not specific for pernicious anemia.</p>
                        
                        <h3>A Valuable Test that is no Longer Available (Schilling Test)</h3>
                        <p>The value of a Schilling test (a radiometric test) is that it can confirm B₁₂ deficiency, can be done after patient has been given B₁₂ therapy, and can distinguish between pernicious anemia and failure in transport or ileal uptake. Unfortunately, the test is no longer available at most hospitals. The 3 parts to the Schilling test are as follows:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>First, radioactive cyanocobalamin is given orally and its urinary secretion is measured to estimate cobalamin uptake. Low urinary secretion suggests pernicious anemia, a failure in intestinal transport, defective uptake of cobalamin in the terminal ileum, or a blind loop syndrome.</li>
                            <li>The second part is performed in the same manner, except that IF is given orally along with radioactive cyanocobalamin. If IF restores cobalamin uptake, the patient most likely has pernicious anemia. If not, an abnormality in cobalamin intestinal transport, defective absorption in the terminal ileum, or a blind loop syndrome might be responsible for the deficiency.</li>
                            <li>In the third phase, the patient is treated with antibiotics before the administration of radioactive cyanocobalamin. If antibiotics restore cobalamin uptake, the patient most likely has a blind loop syndrome.</li>
                        </ol>
                        
                        <h3>Diagnostic Therapeutic Trial</h3>
                        <p>If the results of the evaluation are ambiguous, a clinical trial of the effects of cobalamin therapy may be indicated. However, a clinical trial of folate is contraindicated if cobalamin deficiency has not been ruled out. The administration of folate to patients with cobalamin deficiencies may precipitate or worsen neurologic impairment.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Other Studies</h3>
                        <p>Predict the need for iron therapy since iron stores can be consumed during cobalamin or folate therapy.</p>
                        <p>Radiographic imaging of the upper and lower gastrointestinal tract may be useful for detecting abnormalities that could cause a blind loop syndrome. These procedures also may detect defects in the terminal ileum that might interfere with cobalamin absorption. Other tests that may be considered include the following:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>With cobalamin deficiency, evaluate and rule out autoimmune disorders, Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, pancreatic insufficiency, fish tapeworm infestation, Imerslund-Grasbeck syndrome, Crohn disease, or ileal scarring.</li>
                            <li>With folate deficiency, evaluate evidence for malnutrition and alcoholism, sprue, chronic hemolysis, and exfoliative dermatitis.</li>
                        </ul>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h3>Approach Considerations</h3>
                        <p>Once drug-induced megaloblastic changes and myelodysplasia-related megaloblastosis have been ruled out, most patients are treated with cobalamin or folate. Since megaloblastic anemias usually develop gradually, many patients adjust to low hemoglobin levels and do not require transfusions. Transfusion therapy should be restricted to patients with severe, uncompensated, and life-threatening anemia.</p>
                        <p>Go to anemia, chronic anemia, myelophthisic anemia, hemolytic anemia, and sideroblastic anemias for complete information on these topics.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Cobalamin Therapy</h3>
                        <p>Cobalamin (1000 $\mu$g) should be given intramuscularly daily for 2 weeks, then weekly until the hematocrit value is normal, and then monthly for life. A dose of 1000 $\mu$g is large, but it may be required in some patients. The reader should be aware that several other protocols for cobalamin therapy have been recommended. It is important to emphasize that patients with mental and neurological impairment due to cobalamin deficiency should be treated more aggressively.</p>
                        <p>Oral cobalamin (1000-2000 $\mu$g) also can be administered. Oral cobalamin is less expensive and is better tolerated by patients. A wide range of doses and schedules have been recommended. For example, a randomized controlled trial in 40 vegans and vegetarians with marginal vitamin B₁₂ deficiency found that adequate vitamin B₁₂ levels could be achieved with cobalamin given in either a sublingual dosage of 50 $\mu$g/day (350 $\mu$g/week) or 2000 $\mu$g/week in a single oral dose.</p>
                        <p>Patients receiving oral dosages should be monitored for the desired response, since absorption can be variable and may be insufficient in some patients. Note the following:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Oral cobalamin is indicated in patients with hemophilia to avoid bleeding from intramuscular injections.</li>
                            <li>Intramuscular cobalamin and not oral cobalamin should be used to treat patients with cobalamin-related neurological disorders.</li>
                            <li>One advantage of parenteral over oral cobalamin is that all abnormalities in cobalamin absorption are bypassed.</li>
                            <li>It may be practical to administer parenteral cobalamin initially and then switch to oral cobalamin.</li>
                            <li>Proton pump inhibitors, H₂-receptor antagonists, and metformin may reduce serum vitamin B₁₂ concentrations by inhibiting the absorption of vitamin B₁₂.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Patients who have undergone either a total or partial gastrectomy should be started on replacement therapy after the surgery to prevent the development of megaloblastosis. Oral vitamin B₁₂ supplementation is effective and safe in patients who underwent total gastrectomy and should be considered the preferential form of supplementation.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Folate Therapy</h3>
                        <p>Folate should be administered orally. If this is difficult, comparable doses can be administered parenterally. In addition, the patient should consume a folate-enriched diet. The dosage range for folate is 1-5 mg daily; 1 mg/day is the usual dosage for adults with megaloblastic anemia, while a higher dosage is indicated in hemolysis, malabsorption, alcoholism, and exfoliative dermatitis. However, there is no harm in giving the higher dosage of folate.</p>
                        <p>Folate should be administered prophylactically during pregnancy, lactation, and the perinatal period. Folate is also indicated in patients with chronic hemolytic anemias, psoriasis and exfoliative dermatitis, and during extensive renal dialysis. Folate therapy has been recommended in patients with hyperhomocysteinemia who are at risk for thromboembolic complications.</p>
                        <p>Fortification of foods and folic acid supplements have been recommended to reduce the risk of pancreatic, cervical, and colon cancers. Folic acid supplements are indicated in patients with kidney failure. Folate supplementation is indicated in elderly persons. However, opponents of fortification and supplementation are concerned that giving folate-fortified foods to persons with unrecognized cobalamin deficiencies will increase the frequency of cobalamin-induced neuropsychiatric disorders.</p>
                        <p>The dosage and protocol for folic acid therapy and supplementation in the various disorders mentioned above are summarized in a communication from the Mayo Clinic.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Warning</h3>
                        <p>Folate therapy should not be instituted in a patient with megaloblastic anemia if cobalamin deficiency has not been definitively ruled out. The danger is that folic acid will improve the anemia but not the neurological complications of cobalamin deficiency, and the neurological disorder will worsen. Both cobalamin and folate should be given if cobalamin deficiency has not been ruled out.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Monitoring Response to Therapy</h3>
                        <p>Although patients may feel better as soon as therapy is started, improvements must be monitored. Laboratory tests to order include the following:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Complete blood cell count</li>
                            <li>Reticulocyte count</li>
                            <li>Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level</li>
                            <li>Indirect bilirubin</li>
                            <li>Hemoglobin level</li>
                            <li>Serum potassium level</li>
                            <li>Serum ferritin.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Elevated levels of LDH and indirect bilirubin should fall rapidly. A prolonged elevation of the LDH level indicates a failure of therapy, development of iron deficiency, or an error in diagnosis.</p>
                        <p>Reticulocytosis should be evident within 3-5 days and peaks in 4-10 days. Leukocyte and platelets counts are usually restored to normal within days after therapy has been started, but hypersegmented neutrophils may persist for 10-14 days.</p>
                        <p>The hemoglobin should rise approximately 1 g/dL each week. This rise is valuable for monitoring a complete response. If the hemoglobin does not rise appropriately and is not normal within 2 months, other causes of anemia, such as iron deficiency, should be considered.</p>
                        <p>Serum potassium levels can fall during therapy for severe cobalamin or folate deficiency, which can lead to sudden death. Therefore, potassium should be monitored and supplements may be indicated.</p>
                        <p>Iron deficiency can occur in the course of treatment due to the consumption of iron stores for red blood cell production. The development of iron deficiency can impede the response to cobalamin or folate therapy. Iron therapy may be indicated</p>
                        
                        <h3>Treatment of Other Related Conditions</h3>
                        <p>Other related conditions, if present, should be addressed as follows:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Blind loop syndrome should be treated with antibiotics.</li>
                            <li>Patients with transcobalamin II (TCII) deficiency may require higher doses of cobalamin.</li>
                            <li>Tropical sprue should be treated with both cobalamin and folate.</li>
                            <li>Acute megaloblastic anemias due to nitrous oxide exposure can be treated with folate and cobalamin.</li>
                            <li>Fish tapeworm infection, pancreatitis, Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, and inborn errors should be treated with appropriate measures.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h3>Dietary Measures</h3>
                        <p>Patients with folate or cobalamin deficiency should receive dietary education on the choice of foods and instructions on how to prepare foods.</p>
                        <p>Patients should have diets rich with folic acid. Examples of such foods include asparagus, broccoli, spinach, lettuce, lemons, bananas, melons, liver, and mushrooms. To prevent loss of folate, foods should not be cooked excessively and should not be diluted in large amounts of water. To prevent cobalamin deficiency, vegetarians should include dairy products and eggs in their meals. Patients should know that goat milk contains little folate.</p>
