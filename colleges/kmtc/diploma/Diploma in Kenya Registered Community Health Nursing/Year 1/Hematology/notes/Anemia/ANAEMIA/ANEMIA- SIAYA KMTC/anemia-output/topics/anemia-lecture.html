                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Causes of iron deficiency anemia</h3>
                        <p>Blood loss secondary to drug-induced GI bleeding (from anticoagulants, aspirin, or steroids) or due to heavy menses, hemorrhage from trauma, GI ulcers, or cancer</p>
                        <p>Inadequate dietary intake of iron (less than 1 to 2 $\mathrm{mg}/\mathrm{day}$), which may occur following prolonged un-supplemented breast-feeding or bottlefeeding of infants, or during periods of stress such as rapid growth in children and adolescents</p>

                        <p>Iron malabsorption, as in chronic diarrhea, partial or total gastrectomy, and malabsorption syndromes, such as celiac disease and pernicious anemia.</p>
                        <p>Intravascular hemolysis-induced hemoglobinuria or paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria</p>
                        <p>Mechanical erythrocyte trauma caused by a prosthetic heart valve or vena cava filters</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Pathophysiology of iron deficiency anemia</h3>
                        <p>In all children, iron is usually absorbed in the small intestines. Then it is passed to the blood stream, or, it is stored as ferritin in the intestinal epithelial cells.</p>
                        <p>The iron in the intestinal cells is lost through sloughing off of epithelial cells.</p>
                        <p>Iron in blood stream binds to iron transport molecule, transferrin.</p>

                        <p>When an adolescent does not consume enough dietary iron the normal process of obtaining iron for hemoglobin synthesis is impaired , since there isn't enough iron absorbed by small intestines</p>
                        <p>When blood loss occurs there are less RBCs to be catabolized.</p>
                        <p>Consequently the Fe in these cells cannot be recycled for future use</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Diagnostic Findings of Iron deficiency anemia</h3>
                        <p>Bone marrow studies reveal depleted or absent iron stores and normoblastic hyperplasia.</p>
                        <p>Hb , hematocrit, and serum ferritin levels are low.</p>
                        <p>Mean corpuscular Hb is decreased in severe anemia.</p>
                        <p>RBC count is low, with microcytic and hypochromic cells. (In early stages, RBC count may be normal, except in infants and children.)</p>
                        <p>Serum iron levels are low, with high binding capacity.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Treatment for iron deficiency anemia</h3>
                        <p>If the $\mathrm{Hb}<5 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dl}$ transfuse $20 \mathrm{mls}/\mathrm{kg}$ whole blood urgently, give over 4 hrs</p>
                        <p>Increased iron intake (for children and adolescents)by adding foods rich in iron to diet or (for infants) adding iron supplements</p>
                        <p>Treatment for any underlying condition</p>

                        <p>Oral preparation of iron or a combination of iron and ascorbic acid (which enhances iron absorption)</p>
                        <p>Cyanocobalamin (vitamin B12 ) if intrinsic factor is lacking give Folic acid 2.5 mg alternate days</p>
                        <p>Iron dextran (InFeD) if additional therapy is needed</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Nursing Interventions and Rationales</h3>
                        <p>Carefully collect data on the child's drug history. Certain drugs, such as pancreatic enzymes and vitamin E, may interfere with iron metabolism and absorption and other drugs, such as aspirin and steroids, may cause GI bleeding.</p>
                        <p>Provide passive stimulation; allow frequent rest periods; give small, frequent feedings; and elevate the head of the bed to decrease oxygen demands</p>

                        <p>Educate about proper hand washing to decrease risk of infection.</p>
                        <p>Provide foods high in iron (liver, dark leafy vegetables, and whole grains) to replenish iron stores.</p>
                        <p>Administer iron before meals with citrus juice. Iron is best absorbed in an acidic environment.</p>

                        <p>Give liquid iron through a straw to prevent staining the child's skin and teeth. For infants, administer by oral syringe toward the back of the mouth.</p>
                        <p>Don't give iron with milk products. Milk products may interfere with absorption of iron.</p>
                        <p>Be supportive of the family and keep them informed of the child's status to decrease anxiety</p>

                        <p>Educate the family to keep iron supplements safely stored out of the child's reach at home, brush the children's teeth after iron administration and report reactions to iron supplementation, such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, fever, or severe stomach pain, which may require a dosage adjustment</p>

                        <p>This is a type of anemia that occurs due to absence of intrinsic factor.</p>
                        <p>Intrinsic factor is normally secreted by cells with gastric mucosa</p>
                        <p>It then binds with dietary vitamin B12 and travels with it to the ileum, where the it is absorbed.</p>

                        <p>Without intrinsic factor, orally consumed vitamin B12 cannot be absorbed, and erythrocyte production is eventually diminished.</p>
                        <p>Even if adequate vitamin B12 and intrinsic factor are present, a deficiency may occur if disease involving the ileum or pancreas impairs absorption</p>

                        <p>The body normally has large stores of vitamin B12, so years may pass before the deficiency results in anemia.</p>
                        <p>Since the body compensates so well, the anemia can be severe before the patient becomes symptomatic.</p>
                        <p>Patients with pernicious anemia have a higher incidence of gastric cancer than the general population; these patients should have endoscopies at regular intervals (every 1 to 2 years) to screen for early gastric cancer</p>

                        <p>If the oral vitamin is absorbed, more than $8 \%$ is excreted in the urine within 24 hours; therefore, if no radioactivity is present in the urine (ie, the radioactive vitamin B12 stays within the GI tract), the cause is GI malabsorption of the vitamin B12.</p>
                        <p>Conversely, if radioactivity is detected in the urine, the cause of the deficiency is not ileal disease or pernicious anemia.</p>

                        <p>Vegetarians can prevent or treat deficiency with oral supplements with vitamins or fortified soy milk.</p>
                        <p>If deficiency is due to the more common defect in absorption or the absence of intrinsic factor, replacement is by monthly IM injections of vitamin B12.</p>
