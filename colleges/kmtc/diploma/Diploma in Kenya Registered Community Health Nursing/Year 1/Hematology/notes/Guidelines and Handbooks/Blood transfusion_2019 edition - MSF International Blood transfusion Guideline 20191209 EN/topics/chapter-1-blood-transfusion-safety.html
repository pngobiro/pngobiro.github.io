                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Transfusion is an essential component of the management of life-threatening conditions such
                            as decompensated anaemia or major haemorrhage.</p>
                        <p>Transfusion always carries risks for the recipient, related either to the transfused blood
                            itself or to the patient's underlying condition. In this chapter, these risks are classified
                            into 3 categories: immunological risks, infectious risks and other (non-immunological, non-
                            infectious) risks.</p>
                        <p>In order to reduce as far as possible the potential complications of transfusion, specific
                            precautions have to be taken when selecting donors and collecting, testing, processing and
                            administering blood:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Donor selection is essential to reduce infectious risks.</li>
                            <li>ABO Rhesus D grouping and compatibility testing are mandatory.</li>
                            <li>Blood must be systematically screened for transfusion transmissible infections (TTI).
                                Screening for HIV 1 and 2, hepatitis B, hepatitis C and syphilis is mandatory, even in
                                an emergency.</li>
                            <li>Donors and recipients information must be correctly recorded.</li>
                            <li>Blood donations and qualified blood units must be correctly labelled and recorded.</li>
                            <li>Patients must be closely monitored by trained staff during and after transfusion.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Despite these precautions, transfusion is never totally risk-free. However, it may be
                            detrimental to the patient to avoid transfusion when it is indicated. Thus, it is the
                            physician's responsibility to evaluate the potential risks and benefits of transfusion for
                            each patient. Following clear indications for transfusion helps prevent unnecessary
                            transfusions. Transfusion, when indicated, should be carried out without delay.</p>
                        <p>Transfusion safety is not limited to the above precautions. In addition, it must be ensured
                            that:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Transfusion is effective, i.e. the transfused blood has the required qualities to
                                restore the patient's oxygen carrying capacity.</li>
                            <li>All effective means to reduce or compensate blood loss (e.g. stop bleeding with
                                mechanical means such as compression, fluid resuscitation, tranexamic acid in trauma or
                                post-partum haemorrhage) are available at all times and used when indicated.</li>
                            <li>Blood is used rationally to ensure that it will be available when needed. Unnecessary
                                transfusions may cause a shortage of blood for patients in real need.</li>
                            <li>Medical and cold chain equipment, consumable items and quality laboratory reagents are
                                available to ensure that each step of the transfusion safety chain will be correctly
                                implemented.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>As transfusion of safe blood is a complex procedure, and blood a scarce resource, all
                            upstream measures to reduce blood needs should be implemented (e.g. early management of
                            anaemia, severe malaria, trauma and complicated pregnancies).</p>

                        <p>Acute intravascular haemolytic reaction occurs when transfused red cells encounter natural
                            regular IgM antibodies in the recipient's blood. The antigen-antibody reaction triggers the
                            intra-vascular lysis of transfused red cells. This is a severe potentially life-threatening
                            reaction. It may be associated with disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC). The
                            released haemoglobin can cause acute renal failure.</p>
                        <p>Ninety percent of immediate acute intravascular haemolytic reactions are caused by
                            transfusion of ABO incompatible blood resulting from human error. The remaining ten percent
                            are due to irregular natural antibodies from other blood group systems (e.g. Lewis, P).</p>

                            associated with plasma products such as fresh frozen plasma. However, it can occur in
                            recipients of whole blood and packed red blood cells (PRBC) due to the residual plasma
                            present in PRBC units.</p>

                        <p>Extravascular haemolysis occurs when red cells are trapped and lysed in the spleen. This
                            haemolysis is due to:</p>
                        <ul>

                                In this event, the recipient's red cells are haemolysed.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Extravascular haemolysis occurs 5 to 10 days after transfusion.</p>

                                haemolytic reaction after the transfusion of only one unit of ABO compatible,
                                non-identical blood (Chapter 1, Section 3.1).</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">2.2.2 Post-transfusion purpura</h4>
                        <p>Anti-platelet alloantibodies developed by multiparous recipients destroy both the transfused
                            platelets and the recipient's platelets.</p>
                        <p>Post-transfusion purpura develops within 5 to 12 days after transfusion. This condition is
                            rarely life-threatening.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">2.2.3 Graft-versus-host disease</h4>
                        <p>Graft-versus-host diseases (GVHD) can occur in neonates and in severely immune compromised
                            patients. The T-lymphocytes in the transfused blood reject the recipient's tissues. GVHD is
                            rare but fatal in half of all cases. The acute form (5 to 8 days post-transfusion) is always
                            serious. The chronic form ( 3 to 4 weeks post-transfusion) may be reversible over a 4 to 6
                            week period. The risk of GVHD is higher in intra-family donations, especially in
                            mother-to-child transfusions. In the event of direct blood donation, for neonates and
                            severely immune compromised patients, blood from a non-family donor or blood from a more
                            distant relative than the mother (e.g. aunt or uncle) is preferred whenever possible.</p>

                            <p>Irradiating the blood is the only way to effectively prevent GVHD. Leukofiltration, when
                                available, may reduce the severity of the reaction.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">2.2.4 Alloimmunisation</h4>
                        <p>As there are many different erythrocyte, leukocyte and platelet antigens, it is impossible to
                            transfuse immunologically identical blood. Transfused blood inevitably introduces antigens
                            that are foreign to the recipient. These antigens are called alloantigens. An alloantigen
                            prompts an immune response, including the production of specific antibodies to eliminate
                            this alloantigen. This phenomenon is alloimmunisation.</p>
                        <p>Alloimmunisation against red cells refers to the development of specific blood group
                            antibodies after the introduction of red cell antigens into a recipient who lacks these
                            antigens. In transfusion practice, the most important alloantigens are those of ABO, Rhesus,
                            Kell, Duffy and Kidd blood group systems, as they are the most immunogenic.</p>
                        <p>Alloimmunisation against leukocytes and platelets may also occur through the development of
                            anti-HLA antibodies or specific anti-platelet antibodies. This type of alloimmunisation is
                            relatively common in multi-transfused patients and multiparous women.</p>
                        <p>The clinical significance of alloimmunisation depends on the type and quantity of antigens
                            introduced, the rate of their introduction, and the recipient's profile: sex (higher risk in
                            women), immune status (higher risk in immune competent patients), and associated pathology
                            (e.g. autoimmune disease).</p>
                        <p>Alloimmunisation may complicate possible future transfusions and/or pregnancies in
                            recipients. Prescription of "phenotyped blood", terminology commonly used for full Rhesus
                            and Kell group determination, is the means to prevent most alloimmunisations in
                            multi-transfused patients.</p>

                        <p>Group O donors are often called "universal donors". The transfusion of group O blood to any
                            A, B or AB recipient is possible and will not induce acute ABO incompatibility accidents.
                            However, some donors may carry acquired anti A or anti B haemolysins of high titer, which
                            can induce delayed haemolysis when transfused to A, B or AB recipients. These donors are
                            called "dangerous O donors". In the absence of detection of haemolysins to identify these
                            dangerous O donors, it is preferable to transfuse the least possible amount of non-ABO
                            identical plasma when it is not possible to transfuse ABO identical blood.</p>
                        <p>Transfusing O blood to non-O recipients must not be routine practice and should be considered
                            only when ABO identical blood is not available. In this event, preferably transfuse packed
                            red blood cells or the least amount of plasma possible.</p>

                        <p>The Rhesus system (Rh) is the second most important system to consider when transfusing
                            patients. It is made up of 5 main antigens: RH1 (D), RH2 (C), RH3 (E), RH4 (c), RH5 (e).</p>
                        <p>Antigen D is the most immunogenic antigen of the Rhesus system. The presence of antigen D
                            defines Rhesus positive individuals. The absence of antigen D defines Rhesus negative
                            individuals.</p>
                        <p>There are no naturally occurring Rhesus antibodies. These antibodies are always acquired
                            through transfusion or during pregnancy and are developed by individuals who do not express
                            the corresponding antigen (i.e. an Rh D negative patient may develop anti-D antibodies).</p>
                        <p>Incompatibility reactions occur when the recipient's acquired anti-D antibodies destroy the
                            Rh D positive transfused red cells. Rhesus antibodies often cause mild or moderate delayed
                            haemolysis, but rarely severe acute haemolytic reactions.</p>

                            consequences, but only as second choice, since Rh D negative blood is rare and should be
                            kept for Rh D negative recipients.</p>

                        <h5>Rh D positive blood to Rh D negative recipients</h5>
                        <p>Under exceptional circumstances (absolute emergency), Rh D positive blood may be transfused

                        <ul>
                            <li>There will be no immediate transfusion reaction in Rh D negative men and nulliparous
                                women who have never been transfused.</li>
                            <li>Incompatibility reactions may occur if the recipient has developed acquired anti-D
                                antibodies through previous transfusion or pregnancy. Since the simple crossmatch method
                                cannot detect anti-D antibodies in the recipient, the risk of immediate transfusion
                                reaction and ineffective transfusion is unpredictable.</li>

                                positive blood may cause adverse events.</li>
                            <li>Rh D negative women are likely to experience obstetrical complications if they

                        <p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>It is pointless to administer anti-D immunoglobulin to prevent anti-D alloimmunisation
                                to an Rh D negative patient who has been transfused with Rh D positive blood. High doses
                                of anti-D immunoglobulin would be required to achieve effective prevention, and these
                                could even destroy the transfused Rh D positive red cells.</li>
                            <li>Respecting Rh D compatibility rules does not exclude incompatibility reactions due to
                                other Rhesus antigens. The four other main Rhesus antigens: C, c, E and e are
                                immunogenic, with c and E the most immunogenic. In the event of repeated transfusions it
                                may be important to respect compatibility with these antigens and provide phenotyped
                                Rhesus compatible blood. In this event blood typing of the donor and recipient must be
                                carried out for the 4 antisera (anti-C, anti-c, anti E and anti e). Like anti-Rh D
                                antibodies, anti-Rh C, anti-Rh c, anti-Rh E and anti-Rh e antibodies are acquired, and
                                undetectable by the simple crossmatch method. However, alloimmunisation caused by Rhesus
                                C, c, E and e antigens is usually not of clinical significance, except in
                                multi-transfused patients.</li>

                        <p>Kell, Duffy and Kidd systems may be associated with severe transfusion reactions but cannot
                            be tested in contexts with limited resources.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">3.3.1 Kell system</h4>
                        <p>The Kell system consists of 2 main antigens: KEL 1 (K), KEL 2 (Cellano). The antigen KEL 1 is
                            a rare, very immunogenic antigen. The presence of antigen KEL 1 defines Kell positive
                            individuals. The absence of antigen KEL 1 defines Kell negative individuals. Kell antibodies
                            are acquired and found among multi-transfused patients and multiparous women. Anti-KEL 1
                            antibodies are responsible for haemolytic reactions, often mild and delayed. Since simple
                            crossmatching cannot detect the recipient's anti-KEL 1 antibodies, the risk of transfusion
                            reaction is unpredictable.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">3.3.2 Duffy, Kidd and other systems</h4>
                        <p>The Duffy system consists of 2 main antigens: FY1 (Fya) and FY2 (Fyb). The Kidd system
                            consists of 2 antigens: JK1 (Jka) and JK2 (Jkb). Anti-Duffy and anti-Kidd are rare, acquired
                            antibodies found among multi-transfused patients and multiparous women.</p>
                        <p>Anti-Duffy and anti-Kidd antibodies may be responsible for very severe haemolytic reactions.
                            Since simple crossmatch procedures cannot detect these antibodies in the recipient, the risk
                            of severe, but rare, transfusion reaction is unpredictable.</p>

                            <li>Transfused red blood cells must be compatible with the child's and mother's ABO blood

                            <li>If an irregular antibody test has been carried out on the mother's blood (which is
                                unlikely in resource limited settings) and the result is positive, the transfused red

                            <li>If an irregular antibody test has not been carried out on the mother's blood, the
                                transfused red blood cells must be compatible with the mother's Rhesus phenotype, at

                        <p>Determination of ABO and Rh D groups (Appendix 16) is absolutely mandatory to ensure ABO and
                            Rh D compatibility, but does not exclude incompatibility reactions related to other

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">3.5.2 Crossmatching</h4>
                        <p>Crossmatching is a means to reduce immunological complications. It is a laboratory procedure
                            that predicts if antigen-antibody conflict will occur during transfusion of a given blood
                            unit. The technique consists in placing the recipient's plasma in contact with the red cells
                            to be transfused. A negative crossmatched blood unit means that there are no detectable
                            antibodies in the recipient's plasma that may immediately destroy the red cells to be
                            transfused.</p>
                        <h5>Simple crossmatch method - Tile method (Appendix 26)</h5>
                        <p>This aims to detect incompatibility between the patient's plasma and the red cells from the
                            blood unit, due to agglutinating antibodies such as naturally occurring antibodies (anti-A,
                            anti-B) and also from other systems antibodies (anti-Lewis a, anti-P).</p>
                        <h5>Other crossmatch methods</h5>
                        <p>Women who have been pregnant and/or previously transfused patients should be targeted for
                            more sensitive crossmatch procedures (at 37°C, in low ionic strength solutions, test with
                            antiglobulin, gel methods) to detect non-agglutinating antibodies including anti-Rhesus,
                            anti-K, anti-Duffy and anti-Kidd. These techniques may be available in some settings but, in
                            general, are complex to implement.</p>
                        <p>The rule is: <strong>Transfuse only negative crossmatched blood units</strong></p>

                        <p>Many pathogens present in donated blood can be transmitted to the recipient. In most cases,
                            the recipient is infected by receiving blood from an infected donor. These are transfusion
                            transmitted infections (TTI). The donor selection process (questionnaire and clinical
                            examination, see Chapter 2, Section 3.2 and Section 3.3) and the routine screening of blood
                            for infection markers can eliminate the vast majority of infected donations. The infections
                            which blood donors/donations should be systematically screened for are HIV, hepatitis B and
                            C and syphilis. However, despite these precautions, a residual risk of transfusing infected

                        </ul>
                        <p>The severity of transfusion-acquired bacterial infection depends on the recipient's

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">4.1.1 Septic complications</h4>
                        <p>Bacteria found in blood units may be Gram-positive (e.g. S. epidermidis) or Gram- negative
                            (e.g. Klebsiella, Acinetobacter, P. aeruginosa, Y. enterolitica: the two latter are capable
                            of multiplying between +2 °C and +8 °C). Gram negative bacteria are considered to cause the
                            most severe septic complications, including septic shock.</p>
                        <p>To prevent septic complications, take measures to avoid contamination of blood during
                            collection and to prevent bacterial proliferation in the blood unit:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Collect blood in a clean area, respecting hand hygiene and rigorous skin disinfection

                            <li>Collect blood using blood bags with a diversion pouch (the first 35 mL of blood
                                collected are not transfused as they are the most likely to contain skin bacteria).</li>
                            <li>Allow blood to sit for 2 to 4 hours between blood collection and refrigeration, if the
                                temperature can be kept between +18°C and +24°C. This enables white blood cells to carry
                                out their bactericidal effect (see Appendix 11).</li>
                            <li>Maintain and closely monitor the storage temperature of blood units.</li>
                            <li>Start transfusion within 30 minutes of removing the blood unit from the cold chain.</li>
                            <li>Administer each blood unit within 4 hours maximum.</li>

                            Therefore, screening blood for HIV is compulsory.</p>

                        <p>Donated blood may also be screened for Human T- cell lymphotropic virus 1/2 (HTLV 1/2) and
                            cytomegalovirus (CMV), depending on the context:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>In endemic areas, such as the Caribbean, blood is routinely screened for HTLV 1/2 by
                                national blood transfusion services, using ELISA tests.</li>
                            <li>While relatively harmless in immune competent patients, CMV is pathogenic in immune
                                compromised patients. Transmission rarely occurs if the blood has been stored
                                refrigerated over 72 hours. In settings where CMV testing is available, immune
                                compromised patients should receive CMV-negative blood.</li>
                            <li>The Ebola virus may remain detectable in semen, maternal milk, aqueous humour and other
                                fluids or tissues several months after clinical cure. The isolation of viable virus in
                                blood after initial recovery still remains a rare observation. In the absence of
                                internationally agreed recommendations, as a matter of precaution, it is safer to
                                exclude individuals clinically cured of Ebola infection as potential blood donors.</li>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">4.3 Parasitic infections</h3>
                        <p>In contrast to mandatory routine screening for HIV, hepatitis B and C and syphilis, screening
                            for parasitic infections is performed according to the epidemiological context.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">4.3.1 Malaria</h4>
                        <p>Plasmodia survive for at least 3 weeks in refrigerated blood. Therefore, the risk of
                            acquiring malaria through transfusion of infected blood is high. Clinical symptoms depend on
                            the malaria immunological status of the recipient.</p>
                        <p>When malaria is highly prevalent, screening will detect many positive donors. Routine
                            exclusion of positive malaria blood (by rapid diagnostic test (RDT) or microscopy) may lead
                            to blood shortage. Furthermore, carriers with low level parasitemia may not be detected by
                            microscopy or RDT. The decision to screen donors' blood or to give the recipient an
                            empirical antimalarial treatment depends on the epidemiological situation in the area (see
                            Chapter 2, Section 6.2.4).</p>

                        <p>In endemic areas (Central and South America), the prevalence of Chagas disease has decreased
                            significantly over the past few years. The possibility of transmission through transfusion
                            exists. Screening tests should be used in endemic countries.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">4.3.3 Human African trypanosomiasis</h4>
                        <p>This disease is endemic in certain parts of sub-Saharan Africa, often in specific localized
                            areas. Transmission by chronic asymptomatic carriers is possible, but rare.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">4.3.4 Visceral leishmaniasis</h4>
                        <p>Visceral leishmaniasisis is endemic in numerous countries worldwide. However, the majority of
                            cases occur in north-eastern India, Bangladesh, Sudan, South Sudan, Ethiopia, and Brazil. In
                            other countries, the disease is found in relatively small and localized foci.</p>
                        <p>The risk of infection through transfusion is low and only a few cases of transfusion-
                            acquired visceral lesihmaniasis have been reported. However since there is a risk, although
                            minimal, screening with a protein rK39 rapid test should be performed in endemic areas.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">4.3.5 Filarioses</h4>
                        <p>The accidental transmission by transfusion of live microfilariae has no direct pathogenic
                            power. However, the destruction of transfused microfilariae by anti-helminthic drugs (which
                            are also microfilaricides) can sometimes provoke severe allergic accidents.</p>

                        <p>Many other agents can be transmitted by transfusion but are not screened for, either because
                            their importance in blood safety is limited or unknown or because the necessary screening

                            <li>Or the transfusion of over 3 units of whole blood or 4 units of PRBC within the first
                                hour in adults.</li>

                        <p>Massive transfusion syndrome is a combination of:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Hypothermia (transfused refrigerated blood which has not been warmed before
                                administration).</li>
                            <li>Hypoxemia (transfused stored red cells do not have immediate optimal oxygen carrying
                                capacity).</li>
                            <li>Metabolic disorders: acidosis with hyperkalaemia due to potassium released by stored red
                                cells; hypocalcaemia due to citrate (i.e. the necessary anticoagulant present in blood
                                bags).</li>
                            <li>Bleeding disorders due to dilution of recipient's coagulation factors and platelets, and
                                lack of coagulation factors and platelets in stored, i.e. "non-fresh", blood.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>In settings where calcium/potassium/coagulation/platelets monitoring is not feasible and
                            specific blood components for treating massive transfusion syndrome (i.e. fresh frozen
                            plasma and platelet concentrates) are not available, the only option to minimize the risk of
                            massive transfusion syndrome is to use fresh whole blood (that has not been refrigerated),
                            or at least, blood which has been collected within the past 2 days.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">5.3 Ineffective transfusion</h3>
                        <p>Transfused red cells can be damaged during storage (storage lesions) or destroyed prematurely
                            by antibodies (which have not been detected at the time of transfusion or may appear a few
                            days after transfusion), or by hypersplenism. In such cases, the benefit of transfusion may
                            be less than or may not last as long as expected.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">5.4 Iron overload</h3>
                        <p>Red blood cells contain 3/4 of the body's iron. This is why repeated transfusions lead to an
                            accumulation of iron or secondary hemochromatosis in polytransfused patients. This may lead
                            to heart, liver and/or endocrine organs failure.</p>
                        <p>For symptoms and management of transfusion-related complications, see Chapter 3, Section 5.
