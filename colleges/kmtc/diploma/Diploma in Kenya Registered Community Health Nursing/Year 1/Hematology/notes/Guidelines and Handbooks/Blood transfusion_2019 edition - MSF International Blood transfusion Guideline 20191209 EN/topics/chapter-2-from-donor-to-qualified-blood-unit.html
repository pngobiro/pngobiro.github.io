                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">1.1 Protection of donor's health</h3>
                        <p>Donors' health should not be put at risk by donating blood. A questionnaire and clinical
                            examination before blood donation are essential steps as they authorize, or not, the blood
                            collection (Chapter 2, Section 3.2). The objective of the questionnaire and clinical
                            examination are to detect potential problems that may contra-indicate a blood donation,
                            either because of the donor's clinical status or medical history. Contra-indications should
                            be respected (Chapter 2, Section 3.4).</p>
                        <p>The frequency of blood donation should not exceed 3 donations per year for women and 4 for
                            men (to be checked with the national transfusion policy). If blood is donated more often,
                            the donor risks exhausting their iron reserves. The volume of blood collected at each
                            donation should not exceed 500 mL . An interval of at least 8 weeks must be respected
                            between 2 blood donations.</p>
                        <p>Hepatitis B vaccination should be offered to regular donors.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">1.2 Protection of recipient's health</h3>
                        <p>The safety of transfusion depends partly on the reliability of information provided by the
                            donor during the questionnaire. The donor should be informed that, in the interest of the
                            recipient, they may be excluded as a donor for reasons such as taking certain medications or
                            having an infection that can be transmitted through transfusion.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">1.3 Informed consent</h3>
                        <p>No one must be forced to donate blood.</p>
                        <p>Donors must be informed and agree that:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>They may be excluded at any stage of the selection process for various reasons, e.g.
                                medical history, high risk of exposure to transfusion-transmissible infections, positive
                                or doubtful screening tests, incompatibility with the recipient in the event of direct
                                donation.</li>
                            <li>Their blood will be screened to ensure that it is negative for at least HIV, hepatitis B
                                and C and syphilis (and other tests when indicated).</li>
                            <li>Their blood will not necessarily be used for their relative in the event of replacement
                                donation but for another patient, depending on needs.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Generally, verbal consent is sufficient. Written consent is required in certain countries
                            (Appendix 5).</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">1.4 Non-remunerated blood donation</h3>
                        <p>The International Society of Blood Transfusion, the International Federation of the Red Cross
                            and Red Crescent Societies, the World Health Organization (WHO) and other international
                            organizations recommend that blood services should be based on non-remunerated blood
                            donation, as remuneration carries the following risks:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Remuneration of blood favours excessive blood donation, especially in low-income
                                populations.</li>
                            <li>Remunerated donors may be tempted not to reply truthfully to the questionnaire in order
                                to avoid exclusion from donation.</li>
                            <li>Most studies show higher transfusion transmissible infection (TTI) prevalence rates
                                among remunerated donors compared to non-remunerated donors.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>However, in certain countries, the national policy for blood donation is to provide donors
                            with allowances or in kind compensation. In such contexts, it is essential to ensure that
                            the incentive system does not lead to abuse (e.g. excessive donation, collection from donors
                            that would normally be refused) and that recruited donors are identified as low risk donors
                            of TTI.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">1.5 Anonymous blood donation</h3>
                        <p>The identity of the donor should not be disclosed to the recipient or vice versa.</p>
                        <p>However, in the event of direct donation, the donor may be non-anonymous if the blood is
                            collected for the immediate needs of a patient in their entourage.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">1.6 Confidentiality</h3>
                        <p>Personal information disclosed by the donor and test results are confidential.</p>
                        <p>The donor's name, occupation, address or phone number may be recorded in a blood donor
                            register for tracing purposes if required. This register must be kept in a safe place, under
                            lock and key.</p>
                        <p>The donor's identifying information should neither be recorded in the blood donation register
                            nor in the blood stock/delivery register (Appendix 27 and Appendix 29). When feasible, in
                            order to improve confidentiality, the person who collects the blood donation should not be
                            the same as the person who tests it.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">1.7 Disclosure of results to the blood donor</h3>
                        <p>The main objective of routinely screening donor blood for TTI is to provide safe blood to the
                            recipient, not to diagnose infections in the donor.</p>
                        <p>Above all, the donor should be asked if they agree or not to receive their test results,
                            either during the questionnaire, or when signing the informed consent for blood donation
                            (Appendix 5). Test results cannot be forced on a donor who does not want to receive them.
                        </p>
                        <p>However, if donors are not informed of unexpected positive results, the opportunity to treat
                            a disease and/or prevent its transmission is lost.</p>
                        <p>Disclosure of results is a sensitive issue that must be considered when implementing blood
                            transfusion activities. Check national blood policy on results disclosure. Disclosure of
                            positive results poses different problems depending on the test:</p>
                        <p>Informing the donor of positive results for syphilis or malaria does not usually raise major
                            problems: a single positive test is sufficient to offer treatment, these diseases are
                            readily curable and treatment is usually widely available.</p>
                        <p>Regarding HIV however, the screening strategy for selecting HIV negative blood differs from
                            that used for diagnosing HIV infection in an individual:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>In blood transfusion, a single HIV positive or doubtful test result is sufficient to
                                exclude a donor or a donation. When the result of the first test is clearly negative, a
                                second test is performed on the donated blood on the blood bag tubing. The second test
                                is intended to confirm that the blood to be transfused is HIV-negative. The donor has
                                accepted that their blood will be screened for the safety of the recipient and has been
                                informed that HIV diagnosis is not available through this testing process, as a positive
                                test result that excludes the donor/donation cannot be interpreted as reliable evidence
                                of infection.</li>
                            <li>When diagnosing HIV infection in an individual, an HIV testing algorithm must be
                                applied: a first positive or doubtful HIV test is always followed by subsequent test(s)
                                to confirm the HIV serological status. The individual makes an informed choice to learn
                                their HIV status, is aware of potential consequences, and a positive diagnosis is
                                disclosed only when 2 or 3 different tests, depending on local HIV prevalence, are
                                clearly positive.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Thus, donors who donate blood in order to learn their HIV status should be referred to HIV
                            testing services intended to provide appropriate diagnosis, psychological support and
                            treatment, if needed.</p>
                        <p>For the diagnosis of hepatitis B or C infection, the donor should be referred to an
                            appropriate health facility to carry out further tests and, if needed, to provide clinical
                            management and follow-up of the patient. The donor may carry the virus in the acute,
                            elimination or chronic phase of the disease; or the initial positive test may not be
                            confirmed.</p>
                        <p>When national policy is to notify the donor of abnormal results, ensure that there is an
                            appropriate process for notification and follow-up, i.e. the donor consents to disclosure
                            before donation and understands that more tests may be necessary.</p>
                        <p>A reliable diagnosis using appropriate algorithm is provided; the diagnosis of an infection
                            is disclosed only when the outcome of the testing process is unequivocal; confidentiality is
                            ensured at all stages; pre- and post-test counselling, as well as adequate treatment (if
                            needed) are available.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The type of donation varies according to transfusion needs, capacity to store blood and the
                            willingness of the population to donate blood. Health facilities can be supplied by direct
                            donation and/or national blood services and/or replacement donors and/or locally recruited
                            voluntary donors.</p>
                        <p>A country is capable of supplying blood for all patients needing a transfusion when an
                            unpaid, voluntary system of blood donation exists and functions correctly in the whole
                            country. Countries which manage to set up a system exclusively made up of voluntary donors
                            have a higher proportion of regular donors. In countries where access to health care and
                            diagnostic and treatment are limited, the main indications for transfusion are for
                            pregnancies and complicated deliveries, severe anaemia in children (in particular in areas
                            with high prevalence of malaria), haemoglobinopathies (e.g. thalassemia, sickle cell
                            disease) and trauma. If there is a need for regular transfusion activity in these contexts,
                            but the supply of blood is not ensured at national level, the provision of transfusion
                            services directly at health facility level should be considered (Chapter 4).</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">2.1 Direct donation</h3>
                        <p>Direct donation is an option in health facilities where it is not possible to store blood,
                            either because the medical authorities do not allow it, or because a cold chain has not been
                            or cannot be set up. Blood from a voluntary donor is collected for a particular patient in
                            immediate need. Blood is collected only if the donor's group is compatible with the
                            recipient's group, the donor's blood screens negative for TTI and the crossmatch is
                            negative. Once the donor is approved, blood is collected and transfused immediately to the
                            patient.</p>
                        <p>Direct donation is typically used in small health facilities where blood transfusions are not
                            regularly performed. Direct donation is not recommended if a health facility that carries
                            out more than 2 to 3 transfusions a day.</p>
                        <p>Direct blood donation should be considered as a temporary type of blood donation until the
                            storage of the blood is possible.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">2.2 Replacement donation</h3>
                        <p>This is still the most frequent type of blood donation in peripheral health facilities in
                            resource limited countries. Relatives of patients transfused with blood are asked if they
                            themselves would like to donate blood.</p>
                        <p>Bear in mind that:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Replacement donation can only be envisaged in medical facilities where blood can be
                                stored.</li>
                            <li>No one must be forced to donate blood. People often feel obliged to donate when a family
                                member is concerned: family donors tend not to answer the questionnaire truthfully for
                                fear of not being eligible to donate blood. If families feel under pressure to donate
                                blood, they may seek "professional donors". This is strongly discouraged given the
                                higher risk of TTI in this type of donor.</li>

                            <li>Replacement donation should gradually evolve towards voluntary blood donation if

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">2.3 Voluntary donation</h3>
                        <p>Blood is collected from voluntary donors who go to donation centres or mobile collection
                            sites on their own initiative, and who may become regular donors. Collected blood is
                            grouped, screened for TTI and stored in a special refrigerator for blood. Blood units are
                            then supplied to wards or to external health facilities according to needs. The donor
                            receives no financial compensation or incentive. A blood donor card can be issued for
                            regular donors, with information concerning the blood group, donation dates and haemoglobin
                            levels.</p>
                        <p>This type of donation is usually implemented by blood transfusion services that supply blood
                            to central/peripheral health facilities.</p>
                        <p>Voluntary donation is to be preferred over other types of blood donation and should be set up
                            at health facility level as soon as the operational context allows. It is important to
                            understand the beliefs and attitudes of the population towards blood donation in order to
                            deliver the right messages. Simple surveys on knowledge, attitudes and practices can
                            indicate factors that may influence blood donation. The young educated age group is the most
                            susceptible to adhere to blood donation promotion messages. Voluntary blood donors receive
                            health information and, in turn, can be effective recruiters and promoters of blood
                            donation.</p>
                        <p>Regular donors are the safest source of blood. Recruitment and development of a pool of
                            regular donors require regular public blood donation promotion campaigns. Their influence is
                            one of the most effective strategies to enlist new donors. The recruitment and retention of
                            donors require specific strategies to target donors that are particularly available. Local
                            radio stations can play an important role in promoting blood donation messages. These donors
                            are the means of ensuring a constant blood supply.</p>
                        <p>Recruitment of donors among health staff is not recommended in their own health facility:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>It is particularly difficult to ensure the confidentiality of sensitive information,
                                e.g. reasons for exclusion or tests results.</li>
                            <li>The risk of stigmatization of those who do not want or are unable to donate blood is
                                high.</li>
                            <li>It is difficult to ensure that the staff member will not be over solicited.</li>
                            <li>Donation by a member of the health staff, since it is not anonymous, may be prejudicial
                                in the event of a complication/death after transfusion. The recipient's family may well
                                sue the donor, even if the complication is not attributable to transfused blood.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>If a member of staff wants to donate blood, they should be directed to another facility, with
                            no connections to the facility where they are employed, in order to guarantee
                            confidentiality of information and donor anonymity.</p>
                        <p>June 14th is world blood donor day. This is an opportunity to organize an event and
                            activities on blood donation, highlight messages, motivate blood donors and recruit new
                            ones.</p>

                        <h4>Mobile blood collection (mobile drives)</h4>
                        <p>Mobile blood collection is a way to reach out to potential donors who cannot travel for
                            various reasons (e.g. time, transport, social reasons, etc.) and to reach out to people who,
                            due to lack of adequate information, do not know why blood donation is useful or do not know
                            how to give blood in practice.</p>
                        <p>Mobile blood donation can be carried out in different types of places (e.g. heath centres,
                            high schools, markets, offices of a religious or secular organisation, etc.) as long as the
                            environment is suitable in terms of space and hygiene, can ensure confidentiality and is
                            welcoming. The mobile collection site must be evaluated before blood collection takes place.
                            It must have access to water and sufficient sanitation to guarantee hygiene and safety
                            standards for donors as well as for health staff. The opening hours of blood collection
                            sites should take into account when the largest number of people can attend.</p>
                        <p>Mobile blood collection sessions attract new donors if the place is well chosen. There will
                            be even more new donors if local partners or organizations, particularly high schools,
                            universities and community organizations, participate actively and promote the effort.
                            Mobile collections at regular intervals in the same place increase donor retention.</p>
                        <p>It is important to consider the cost/effectiveness of mobile blood collection. During the
                            planning of mobile blood collections, the locations chosen should be those where the
                            participation and number of blood donations were highest during previous sessions.</p>
                        <p>For a blood mobile collection session to be successful, the key points to consider are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Choice of place and date</li>
                            <li>Participation of partner organizations, especially during preparation of the event</li>
                            <li>Organization and rigorous planning of logistics, including cold chain</li>
                            <li>The preparation of premises</li>
                            <li>Availability of all necessary staff</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">2.4 "Walking blood bank"</h3>
                        <p>Blood is collected from a registered pool of pre-identified, low risk, voluntary donors.
                            Donors are called on demand, either because they have a rare blood group (e.g. O Rh D
                            negative) or when there is a sudden increase in the need for blood or because a recipient
                            needs fresh nonrefrigerated whole blood.</p>
                        <p>A "walking blood bank" can be a temporary solution until a transfusion service with blood
                            storage capacity is available instead of or in addition to direct donation. It can also
                            complement a conventional blood transfusion service.</p>

                        <p>The aims of donor selection are to provide blood that is as safe as possible for the
                            recipient and to ensure that blood donation does not harm the donor's health.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">3.1 Pre-selection process</h3>
                        <p>The pre-selection process aims to protect the donor. Pre-selection criteria include age,
                            weight, time since last donation, number of donations over the past year, haemoglobin (Hb)
                            level, and for women, pregnancy and lactation (Chapter 2, Section 3.4).</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">3.2 Pre-donation questionnaire</h3>
                        <p>The questionnaire may help identify high-risk donors, thus minimizing the risk of collecting
                            infected blood. Well conducted questionnaires can lead to excluding a quarter of potential
                            donors in certain contexts.</p>
                        <p>The interview should take place in an area where auditory and visual privacy is ensured. The
                            donor's name should not be recorded on the questionnaire. Answers are also confidential.
                            This must be clearly explained to the donor to encourage them to answer truthfully.</p>
                        <p>Staff must ensure that the donor understands the questions and why they are being asked. It
                            is important to mention to the donor that they can self-exclude themselves any time if they
                            do not wish to answer the questions.</p>
                        <p>The questionnaire should not be skipped in an emergency situation or due to concern that the
                            potential donor will change their mind if asked questions about their personal life.</p>
                        <p>Sensitive questions related to the risk of TTI must be asked and be formulated according to
                            the social and cultural context and local beliefs. Questions regarding high-risk exposure
                            (e.g. unprotected casual sex, multiple partners, men to men sex, IV drug use) must be asked
                            with a non-judgemental attitude.</p>
                        <p>If at the end of the questionnaire the donor is excluded, the reason for the exclusion must
                            be communicated to the donor if requested.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">3.3 Physical examination</h3>
                        <p>All donors should be in good physical condition.</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Measure temperature, pulse and blood pressure.</li>
                            <li>Look for:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Jaundice (conjunctiva)</li>

                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The physical examination can be performed by a health care worker other than a physician
                            provided that they have been specifically trained for this task, are supervised by a
                            physician and if the national policy allows it. The potential donor must be referred to the
                            physician in the event of abnormality during the clinical examination.</p>
                        <p>Note: mobile blood collection must use the same pre-selection criteria (including Hb level),
                            and the questionnaire is still required but can be simplified.</p>

                            <li>Provide a drink to rehydrate if necessary and even something to eat before they donate
                                blood.</li>
                            <li>Demonstrate professionalism: have equipment ready and organised, dress smartly, wear a

                                <ul>
                                    <li>Ensure the blood bag is lower than the venipuncture site.</li>
                                    <li>Ask the donor to pump their fist in order to increase the flow.</li>

                            <li><strong>The blood flow stops before the minimum volume is reached:</strong>
                                <p>The collected blood cannot be used for transfusion. Discard the bag. Each blood bag
                                    contains a specific amount of anticoagulant solution for a determined quantity of
                                    blood and should be filled appropriately to ensure the correct ratio blood/
                                    anticoagulant. If the donor agrees, attempt another collection on the other arm
                                    using a new bag. The blood bag size for the second collection should be chosen
                                    taking into account the volume already withdrawn from the donor, in order not to
                                    exceed the maximum amount per donation (e.g. if 150 mL were withdrawn during the
                                    first attempt, use a bag of 250 mL for a second blood collection when the donor is
                                    eligible for collection of 450 mL ).</p>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>In the event of vasovagal reaction:</strong>
                                <p>Vasovagal reaction occurs during or after collection in up to 5% of blood donors. It
                                    is frequently triggered by anxiety or can happen when the donor gets up too quickly.
                                    The donor feels unwell with symptoms such as light-headedness, profuse sweating,
                                    pallor, blurred vision, transient alteration of consciousness. In case of loss of
                                    consciousness, stop the blood collection. Position the donor on their back with
                                    their feet elevated. Once recovered, ensure that the donor is properly hydrated.</p>

                        <p>For safety reasons, blood grouping must be performed twice:</p>
                        <ul>

                        </ul>
                        <p>The tile method is recommended as it is less prone to handling errors than the tube method
                            (Appendix 16).</p>
                        <p>When blood units are supplied by an external source e.g. a regional/national blood
                            transfusion centre or another hospital, the unit's blood group must be checked and tested
                            again for all TTI using blood from the distal segment of the blood bag tubing, unless the
                            external source has been validated by a competent medical professional (Chapter 4, Section
                            1.1.2).</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">6.2 Transfusion transmissible infection (TTI) screening</h3>
                        <p>Donated blood must be routinely screened for HIV, hepatitis B, hepatitis C and syphilis.
                            Other screening tests (e.g. malaria, Chagas' disease) are performed according to the
                            epidemiological context (Chapter 1).</p>
                        <p>Screening tests have to combine:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>High sensitivity in order to correctly detect as soon as possible after contamination
                                infected blood and to avoid false negative test results.</li>
                            <li>High specificity to avoid rejecting blood with false positive test results.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Tests must be stable under field conditions (e.g. transport, temperature, humidity) and
                            results must be rapidly available.</p>
                        <p>Performing the full battery of tests is preferred as it provides more complete and accurate
                            information on the positivity rate of each infection among donors/donations. Sequential
                            testing (according to local epidemiology of infections) is more cost effective and less time
                            consuming, but the positivity rates are not representative of real TTI prevalence rates of
                            the donor population as they are based on different denominators.</p>
                        <p>See Appendices 19 to 25.3.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">6.2.1 HIV</h4>
                        <p>The objective of screening blood for HIV is to provide safe blood for the recipient, not to
                            diagnose HIV infection in the donor. Therefore, the blood safety testing strategy differs
                            from the individual testing algorithm used for HIV infection diagnosis.</p>
                        <p>The WHO considers the use of one single highly sensitive and specific HIV 1/2 test sufficient
                            to ensure transfusion safety regarding HIV transmission.</p>
                        <p>However, to improve screening reliability, it is prudent to perform 2 different tests on 2
                            different blood samples because rapid tests have inherent limitations and because human
                            error (e.g. in handling or storing tests, labelling tubes, bags and test devices) may result
                            in inaccurate results.</p>
                        <p>The two HIV tests results must be clearly negative. In the event of a doubtful or positive
                            result in the first test, the donor or the blood donation must be excluded.</p>
                        <p>Nevertheless, a negative HIV test does not prevent HIV transmission through transfusion if
                            the donor has been infected within the previous 3 to 4 weeks, which is the usual period for
                            detection of HIV antibodies using highly sensitive rapid tests in immune competent
                            individuals. The pre-donation questionnaire and physical examination are therefore essential
                            to select low risk donors and exclude those who may have been infected recently.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">6.2.2 Hepatitis B and C</h4>
                        <p>In the event of doubtful or positive results, the donor or the blood donation must be
                            excluded. The average period for hepatitis B surface antigen ( HBs Ag ) detection is 30 days
                            (7-63 days) and 82 days (54-192 days) for HCV antibody using rapid tests.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">6.2.3 Syphilis</h4>
                        <p>Screening should be performed using a rapid Treponema-specific test (e.g. Syphilis 3.0 SD
                            Bioline®). RPR is no longer recommended as it is neither sensitive nor specific enough.</p>
                        <p>Syphilis positive blood should not be transfused as it may be infected by Treponema pallidum.
                            Furthermore, syphilis positive donors are at higher risk of having acquired other STIs,
                            including HIV infection.</p>
                        <p>However, under exceptional circumstances (blood shortage, life-threatening emergency), the
                            use of syphilis positive blood can be justified after 5 days of storage at 4 °C, provided
                            the recipient is simultaneously treated for syphilis.</p>

                        <h5>In low endemic areas or areas of seasonal transmission</h5>
                        <p>Malaria screening should be performed, using an RDT. Despite a negative test, malaria can
                            still be transmitted when the donor's parasitaemia is too low to be detected. Thus, during
                            donor selection, donors with fever or history of recent fever or recent malaria infection
                            should be excluded.</p>
                        <p>Donors with a positive malaria test will receive a full, effective antimalarial treatment.
                        </p>
                        <p>Blood should not be collected, unless transfusion is needed urgently and no other donor is
                            available. In that case, treat all recipients of malaria positive blood with a full,
                            effective antimalarial treatment.</p>
                        <p>All neonates should receive a full course of anti-malarial treatment when they receive a
                            blood transfusion. This is regardless of the malaria RDT test result.</p>

                        <h5>In highly endemic areas with stable transmission</h5>
                        <p>The decision to screen for malaria or not should take into consideration the prevalence of
                            the disease, the laboratory capacity to perform the tests and national recommendations.</p>
                        <p>Depending on the context, 2 options are possible:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Option 1: donors are not screened for malaria and an effective antimalarial treatment is
                                routinely administered to all recipients.</li>
                            <li>Option 2: screening is routinely performed but positive blood is not necessarily
                                excluded. It can be drawn then labelled as malaria-positive and stored separately. When
                                the blood is transfused, the recipient receives concomitantly an effective antimalarial
                                treatment. Malaria RDT positive blood units must be transfused only to malaria positive
                                adult recipients while systematically giving them antimalarial treatment.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>All neonates should receive a full course of anti-malarial treatment when they receive a
