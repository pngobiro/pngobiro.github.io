                        <p>Transfusion of red blood cells improves oxygen transport in patients with clinical symptoms
                            of anaemia. Transfusion is indicated to relieve clinical symptoms of decompensation of
                            anaemia or prevent further decompensation in patients at risk. It is not indicated to
                            normalize the patient's Hb level.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">1.1 Severe anaemia</h3>
                        <p>Anaemia is defined by a Hb level below reference values for age, sex and for pregnant woman,
                            pregnancy state (see Appendix 1). It results in a decrease in blood oxygen-carrying
                            capacity. However, low Hb levels may be well tolerated. Clinical tolerance is related to the
                            rate at which it develops and the patient's underlying condition.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The more rapidly anaemia develops, the more likely compensatory mechanisms to maintain
                                the transport and transfer of oxygen to tissues will be overwhelmed, especially in
                                patients with impaired cardiopulmonary function.</li>
                            <li>Conversely, slow-onset chronic anaemia is usually well tolerated (except in patients
                                with pre-existing cardiopulmonary disorders) since long-term mechanisms will have
                                developed over weeks or months.</li>
                            <li>However, many factors such as fever, infection, haemorrhage or haemolysis can
                                precipitate the decompensation of well-tolerated anaemia.</li>
                            <li>Decompensation signs of anemia are: respiratory distress, tachycardia, altered mental
                                status, cardiac failure, coronary failure, shock.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Anaemia is considered severe when Hb level falls below critical values (or transfusion
                            thresholds), even if there are no signs of decompensation and/or clinical symptoms. In an
                            episode of severe malaria, Hb level can drop by 2 g/dL per day. In children, the risk of
                            death rapidly increases when Hb level drops below 4 g/dL. Therefore close monitoring of Hb
                            is essential in adults and children with severe malaria and transfusion should be considered
                            when the Hb is approaching transfusion trigger levels.</p>
                        <p>Note: transfusion thresholds are the Hb values at which transfusion is imperative (except in
                            the event of hereditary anaemia, see Chapter 3, Section 1.4.1).</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">1.2 Acute haemorrhage</h3>
                        <p>Acute haemorrhage is associated with hypovolaemia and reduced circulating haemoglobin. Acute
                            haemorrhage causes haemodynamic instability, with reduced tissue perfusion and oxygen
                            delivery. The priorities of management are to control bleeding and restore circulating
                            volume, while maintaining oxygenation. Patients with ongoing, massive bleeding may benefit
                            from limited fluid resuscitation and toleration of moderate hypotension until haemorrhage
                            has been controlled.</p>
                        <p>Crystalloid solutions should be used for initial correction of hypovolaemia (Ringer Lactate
                            or 0.9% sodium chloride). There is no evidence that colloids (Haemaccel®, Plasmion®,
                            Gelofusin®) are more effective than crystalloids for fluid resuscitation and may be
                            associated with increased adverse effects. Blood should not be used to correct hypovolaemia.
                        </p>
                        <p>Blood loss equivalent to 30% total blood volume (ACS Class I and II Acute Haemorrhage) can
                            normally be tolerated without blood transfusion, provided that volume replacement is
                            adequate.</p>
                        <aside class="callout note" role="note">
                            <p>ACS: American College of Surgeons</p>
                        </aside>
                        <p>The decision to transfuse is based on clinical criteria. Transfusion is indicated when
                            haemodynamic instability and tissue hypoxia persist despite adequate volume resuscitation.
                            It is usually necessary when blood loss exceeds 30-40% total blood volume (ACS Class III and
                            IV). However, earlier transfusion may be necessary if the patient's underlying condition
                            prevents effective compensation of acute anaemia.</p>
                        <p>At birth, an acute haemorrhage can present with pallor (without jaundice), tachypnea (or
                            gasping respiration), tachycardia and symptoms of hypovolaemia ranging from decreased
                            peripheral perfusion (10% loss of blood volume) to hypovolaemic shock (20-25% loss of blood
                            volume).</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">1.3 Coagulation disorders</h3>
                        <p>Stored (non-fresh) blood is not effective in correcting haemorrhage secondary to coagulation
                            disorders as it contains neither coagulation factors V and VIII nor functional platelets.
                        </p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">1.3.1 Acquired disorders</h4>
                        <p>Early trauma induced coagulopathy is due to release of inflammatory mediators from damaged
                            tissue, dilution of blood with crystalloids, acidosis associated with tissue hypoxia and
                            hypothermia.</p>
                        <p>Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is mainly seen in obstetric complications (e.g.
                            abruptio placentae, retained dead foetus), snake envenomation (viperids, crotalids) and
                            severe infections (e.g. meningococcal and other bacterial septicaemia, malaria). Management
                            consists essentially of treating the primary cause of early trauma induced coagulopathy and
                            DIC and restoring platelets and coagulation factors by the transfusion of fresh whole blood
                            (never refrigerated) or specific blood components, such as fresh frozen plasma and platelet
                            concentrates, if they are available.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">1.3.2 Congenital disorders</h4>
                        <p>Patients with congenital disorders of platelets or coagulation factors are at risk of severe
                            bleeding during trauma, delivery or surgery and need specific blood components (e.g.
                            cryoprecipitates, platelet concentrates) to correct their deficiency. They should be
                            referred to a centre where these components are available.</p>
                        <p>In the event of haemorrhage, if referral is not feasible, transfusion of fresh whole blood
                            may provide adequate clotting factors and platelets to control haemorrhage if the
                            coagulation disorder is mild to moderate.</p>

                        <h5>Sickle cell disease</h5>
                        <p>Transfusion is indicated in:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Acute severe haemolysis: if Hb ≤ 5 g/dL or drop of 2 g/dL below the patient's baseline.
                                Target a Hb level of 9 g/dL.</li>
                            <li>Splenic sequestration with Hb ≤ 5 g/dL (the objective is to reach 7-8 g/dL maximum).

                        <h5>Thalassaemia major</h5>
                        <p>Thalassaemia major is a severe, transfusion-dependent anaemia. The Hb target should be 10 to
                            12 g/dL. Administration of iron chelating agents is essential for the treatment of chronic
                            iron overload secondary to frequent transfusions. Patients with thalassaemia intermedia do
                            not usually require regular transfusions.</p>

                        <h5>Glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency</h5>
                        <p>G6PD deficiency can cause acute or chronic haemolysis during severe viral and bacterial
                            infections, or ingestion of certain foods (e.g. fava beans) or exposure to various drugs
                            (e.g. dapsone, nitrofurantoin, primaquine, sulfonamides, aspirin, chloroquine, quinine,
                            chloramphenicol). Transfusion is not required in most cases but is indicated in severe
                            haemolysis.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">1.4.2. Severely malnourished children</h4>
                        <p>In the absence of other explanations, a drop in Hb level within a few days following the
                            admission in nutritional centre suggests the correction of a pre-existing haemoconcentration
                            (increase in plasma volume following oral or IV rehydration) and in itself is not an
                            indication for transfusion.</p>
                        <p>According to the WHO, children with kwashiorkor may have redistribution of fluid leading to
                            low Hb (related to haemodilution) which does not necessarily require transfusion.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">1.4.3. Obstetrics</h4>
                        <p>During delivery, normal blood loss is approximately 500 mL (for vaginal delivery and for
                            caesarean section). If blood loss is not greater than normal and the Hb level was ≥ 8 g/dL
                            before delivery, blood transfusion is rarely necessary.</p>
                        <p>In the event of elective caesarean section, if the preoperative Hb level is &lt; 8 g/dL
                            prepare two compatible and cross-matched blood units and have them ready for immediate use
                            but do not perform preventive transfusion.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">1.4.4. Surgery</h4>
                        <p>In healthy patients, the pre-operative decision for a transfusion depends on the patient's
                            clinical tolerance of anaemia. However, be prepared for transfusion if Hb is &lt; 7 g/dL in
                            a healthy adult undergoing major surgery or surgery with significant blood loss. Have blood
                            units ready for immediate use (compatible and crossmatched), but do not perform preventive
                            transfusion. All patients who undergo elective surgery, even if minor, must have a blood
                            group determination performed.</p>
                        <p>In adults with low cardiopulmonary reserve (e.g. heart failure, coronary disease, chronic
                            respiratory disease) or in elderly patients, an Hb threshold of 8-9 g/dL is usually
                            recommended before surgery.</p>
                        <p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>When a patient is referred to a surgical facility for elective surgery, certain
                                facilities may organise that a compatible and negatively crossmatched donor selected
                                from the patient's entourage accompanies them in case the patient requires a
                                transfusion.</li>
                            <li>Blood recovered from a large, closed haemothorax via an intercostal drain may be
                                reinfused as an alternative to transfusion of donor blood. This must only be undertaken
                                by experienced staff using adequate sterile equipment.</li>

                        <p>Burns initially do not bleed. In the absence of comorbidity, such as trauma or profound
                            preexisting anaemia, burns alone do not call for a blood transfusion.</p>
                        <p>However, surgical interventions on burns, such as excision-grafting, may cause copious
                            bleeding and therefore require preparation for possible transfusion. Extensive burns cause
                            an inflammatory syndrome that prevents haematopoiesis. It is therefore essential to
                            constantly monitor the Hb level throughout the wound healing process. Furthermore, anaemia
                            delays wound healing.</p>

                            <p>Recommended equipment for Hb measurement includes point-of-care analysers (HemoCue Hb

                        <p>Once the decision to transfuse has been taken, the patient or legal representative must be
                            informed about the benefits/risks of transfusion.</p>
                        <p>The patient (or legal guardian) MUST give written consent for transfusion. (Appendix 6). If
                            it is not possible to obtain consent, the transfusion can be administered if the physician
                            considers it is in the best interest of the patient. In this event, the patient must be
                            informed later that they have received a transfusion.</p>
                        <p>An adult or a legal representative of a child, who is able to give informed consent, may
                            refuse transfusion. In such cases, it is important to understand the reason for the refusal
                            and to explain the benefits of the transfusion. In the event of continued refusal, inform
                            the patient of the consequences of this decision. Any refusal of transfusion must be
                            recorded in the patient's file.</p>

                        <p>The patient's blood group should be determined twice. The first determination can be done on
                            admission (on capillary blood if venous sampling fails) and the second determination when
                            blood is prescribed (Appendix 16 and Appendix 26).</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">2.5.1 Choice of blood component</h4>
                        <p>In most cases, the choice is limited to whole blood or packed red blood cells (PRBC).</p>
                        <h5>Stored whole blood</h5>
                        <p>The stored whole blood (i.e. kept refrigerated) is the most commonly transfused component and
                            mainly indicated in severe anaemia with hypovolaemia (e.g. trauma, haemorrhage) or in some
                            aetiologies of shock.</p>
                        <p>In stored blood, red blood cells keep their qualities (oxygen carrying capacity,
                            deformability) but platelets irreversibly self-aggregate at temperatures below 16 °C and
                            thermo-labile coagulation factors deteriorate within 72 hours when stored at 4 °C.</p>

                        <h5>Fresh whole blood</h5>
                        <p>When it is necessary to provide platelets and/or clotting factors, and if specific components
                            are not available:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Massive haemorrhages in surgical, obstetric and trauma patients: if the volume of blood
                                transfused within 12 hours reaches 50% of the total blood volume, stop transfusing
                                stored whole blood and administer fresh whole blood (blood collected less than 4 hours
                                before transfusion, that has never been refrigerated).</li>
                            <li>DIC: if possible transfuse fresh whole blood from the outset.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h5>PRBC</h5>
                        <p>PRBC are preferred:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>For patients with severe anaemia without hypovolaemia (e.g. haemolysis)</li>
                            <li>For patients at risk of circulatory overload, i.e. those with cardiac or respiratory
                                disease, elderly patients, and children.</li>
                            <li>In the event of transfusion with non-ABO identical blood (Chapter 1, Section 3).</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>PRBC are either:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Supplied by the national blood transfusion service.</li>
                            <li>Prepared from multiple bags after sedimentation and separation into satellite bags.</li>
                            <li>In the absence of multiple bags, whole blood units can be stored vertically with the
                                transfusion outlets pointing down, and then carefully transported to the ward so as to
                                not mix the red cells back into the plasma. Only the sedimented red blood cells must be
                                transfused (Appendix 12).</li>

                        <p>The volume to be administered is:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>For whole blood: 20 mL/kg</li>
                            <li>For PRBC: 15 mL/kg</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>See Appendix 7.</p>
                        <p>To reduce the risk of circulatory overload, preferably use PRBC to reduce the volume to be
                            transfused.</p>
                        <p>Close and regular monitoring during and after transfusion is critical as an increase in blood
                            volume can precipitate or aggravate heart failure. The physician must be immediately
                            informed of any anomaly.</p>
                        <p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Transfusion set tubing holds a dead volume of around 15-18 mL; the doctor must take this
                                volume into account when calculating the volume of blood to be ordered.</li>
                            <li>If PRBC are prescribed but whole blood is delivered, red cells will start spontaneously
                                sedimenting during the transfusion. Warn the staff and the care giver that this is
                                normal. Do not homogenise. Stop the transfusion when the prescribed volume has been
                                administered or when there is only plasma left in the bag.</li>

                            increases the Hb level by 1 to 2 g/dL.</p>

                                beginning of the transfusion, wait 15 minutes after the start of the transfusion.</li>
                            <li>Routine administration of furosemide prior to transfusion in order to prevent cardiac
                                failure or pulmonary oedema is not recommended. The decision to administer furosemide
                                (Child: 0.5 to 1 mg/kg/injection; Adult: 20 to 40 mg/injection, by slow IV injection)
                                should be made on a case-by-case basis, according to the patient's clinical condition.

                        </p>
                        <p>Fast infusion rates increase the risk of circulatory overload in patients with cardiac or

                        <p>In children without hypovolemia and/or shock, the recommended transfusion rate is 5
                            mL/kg/hour for PRBC and whole blood (Appendix 7).</p>
                        <p>In the event of haemorrhagic shock, insert the blood unit into an inflatable cuff or a
                            pressure cuff to increase the flow rate without exceeding a pressure of 300 mm Hg . Ensure
                            further venous access is available in case it is needed.</p>

                            <li>Compare the patient's identity with the prescription and the blood delivery form to

                            labelling errors on tubes/blood units.</p>
                        <p>The bedside verification of ABO compatibility is performed just before transfusion (i.e.
                            before connecting the transfusion set to the blood unit). It is intended to verify one last
                            time, at the patient's bedside, that the recipient's blood and the blood to be transfused
                            are ABO compatible. It is the responsibility of the health staff that carries the
                            transfusion to perform this verification. The interpretation of ABO card must be doubtless.
                        </p>
                        <p>In case of any doubt, repeat the ABO compatibility procedure and call the doctor. See
                            Appendix 18.1 and Appendix 18.2.</p>
                        <p>Keep the bedside testing card in the patient's file.</p>

                        <p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The blood and its components must imperatively be filtered by means of a blood
                                administration set fitted with a 170/200 micron filter.</li>
                            <li>If venous cannulation is impossible, the intraosseous route can be used (Appendix 3).
                            </li>
                            <li>The use of infusion/blood warmer is indicated ONLY in the event of rapid transfusion
                                (for an adult, rate of over 25-30 mL/kg/hour and for a child rate of over 15
                                mL/kg/hour).</li>
                            <li>Paediatric administration sets (blood burette) are used to ensure the transfusion of the
                                precise volume prescribed. For very small volumes of blood transfusion, the rate in
                                drops/ minutes is very low and impossible to adjust manually with precision. In the
                                absence of an infusion pump or electric syringe, blood boluses can be administered every
                                15, 20 or 30 minutes while injecting a saline solution between the boluses to keep the
                                vein open using a 3 way connector.</li>
                            <li>A drip assist is an electronic droplet counter which displays the infusion rate in
                                number of drops per minute and the total volume administered since the start of the
                                transfusion.</li>
                            <li>An infusion pump is another means to ensure the exact volume and rate of transfusion are
                                respected as prescribed (caution: a specific transfusion set compatible with the
                                infusion pump is required). Infusion pumps cannot be used to transfuse neonates.</li>
                            <li>An electric syringe may be used: the 50 mL syringe is filled with blood filtered through
                                a transfusion set using a 3 way-connector. If more 50 mL are to be administered, the
                                syringe will be filled several times through the transfusion set which is kept connected
                                to the 3 -way connector.</li>

                        <p><strong>During the first 15 minutes:</strong></p>
                        <p>Stay with the patient in order to detect warning signs: fever, chills, flushed feeling,
                            urticaria, pruritus, breathing difficulties, anxiety, and pain or haemodynamic instability.
                        </p>
                        <p>Re-assess the patient's condition and vital signs (RR, heart rate, BP) and oxygen saturation:

                        </ul>
                        <p>The patient or the care giver should be instructed to alert the nurse of any discomfort,

                        <p>Stop the transfusion and alert the physician in the event of warning signs, or if the

                            <li>If the patient improves but still requires blood, restart a transfusion with a new blood
                                unit from another donor. There is no increased risk of a second haemolytic reaction
                                provided that ABO compatible blood is transfused.</li>
                            <li>If the patient does not improve (i.e. hypotension and oliguria still present), start an
                                epinephrine infusion.</li>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">6.1 Sources and characteristics of fresh frozen plasma</h3>
                        <p>Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) is prepared by an authorized blood transfusion facility equipped
                            with a laboratory centrifuge for blood units. It contains all plasma proteins and in
                            particular fibrinogen and thermo-labile coagulation factors V and VIII.</p>
                        <p>FFP is prepared from centrifuged whole blood or from plasmapheresis that has been fast frozen
                            below -18°C within a maximum of 6 hours after collection.</p>
                        <p>FFP is usually available in units of 200 to 300 mL.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">6.2 Storage</h3>
                        <p>FFP units are immediately stored in a freezer at below -18°C and can be stored up to 3
                            months. If the storage temperature is below -25°C, FFP units can be kept for up to one year.
                        </p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">6.3 Transport</h3>
                        <p>FFP is dispatched to health facilities in negative cold chain containers (iceboxes filled
                            with the most frozen ice packs): the temperature of the cold chain must be constantly
                            monitored to check it remains below zero throughout transport.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">6.4 Indications</h3>
                        <p>Indications for the use of FFP are mainly therapeutic and sometimes preventive:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Massive haemorrhage associated with coagulopathy related to fluid resuscitation and/or
                                transfusion of stored blood products which lack thermo-labile coagulation factors.</li>
                            <li>Bleeding related to multiple coagulation factor deficiency associated with reduced
                                synthesis of clotting factors in liver disease or increased consumption of clotting
                                factors in DIC.</li>
                            <li>Severe bleeding associated with antivitamin K drugs overdose.</li>
                            <li>Bleeding associated with a coagulation factor deficiency when specific concentrated
                                products are not available.</li>
                            <li>Rare conditions such as thrombocytopenic thrombotic purpura and some specific plasma
                                proteins deficiencies.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The transfusion of FFP carries similar risks of TTI, allergic reactions and hypocalcaemia due
                            to citrate overload, as the transfusion of packed red blood cells or whole blood.</p>
                        <p>In no event is FFP to be used for fluid resuscitation or as a nutritional product.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">6.5 Prescription</h3>
                        <h5>Compatibility</h5>
                        <p>Prescribe FFP units that are ABO compatible, preferably identical. As FFP units have a long
                            storage life, it should always be possible to provide ABO identical FFP units.</p>
                        <p>However, ABO compatibility rules for the transfusion of plasma are the opposite of those for
                            the transfusion of red blood cells.</p>

                        <p>As FFP does not contain red blood cells, there is no need for cross matching.</p>

                        <h5>Volume to be prescribed</h5>
                        <p>The initial therapeutic dose is 15 mL/kg (10 to 20 mL/kg).</p>
                        <p>In the absence of coagulation tests, additional doses are administered if bleeding persists.
                            When bleeding stops, this indicates the FFP dose is sufficient.</p>
                        <p>When coagulation tests are available, haemostasis is considered efficient if the TT or ACT is
                            less than 1.5 times the reference value. Nevertheless a return to efficient haemostasis may
                            be transitory and must therefore be monitored. It may be related to underlying conditions
                            (fever in particular).</p>

                        <h5>Duration</h5>
                        <p>In adults, the recommended transfusion rate is one unit in 30 minutes maximum. In children up
                            to 20 kg, the prescribed dose is 15 mL/kg transfused in one hour.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">6.6 Preparation</h3>
                        <p>FFP is thawed between 30 and 37°C in a water bath under continuous agitation. As soon as it
                            has thawed, FFP must be transfused immediately, or stored, while waiting to be transfused,
                            at 4°C for a maximum of 6 hours.</p>
                        <p>FFP must always be transfused using a transfusion set with a 170-200 microns filter.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">6.7 Monitoring of FFP transfusion</h3>
                        <p>Allergic reactions are common. It is essential to look out for severe anaphylactic reactions
                            and to have basic resuscitation drugs and material ready to be used.</p>
