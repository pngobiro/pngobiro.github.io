The malignant cells are derived from precursor myeloid or lymphoid tissue cells.<br>The WBCs develop from stem cells in the bone marrow. Leukemia results when the process of maturation from stem cells to white blood cells go awry and produces a cancerous change, the change often involve a rearrangement of pieces of chromosomes: the cells complex genetic material. Because the chromosomal rearrangement disturbs the normal control of cell division the affected cell multiply without restraint becoming cancerous. They ultimately occupy the bone marrow, replacing the cells that produce normal blood cells. Thus there is;</p>

                        <p>These are cancers of the hematopoietic progenitor cells. They are rapidly growing tumors. They have a sudden onset with signs related to depressed bone function. Progress rapidly.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Pathophysiology of acute leukemia</h3>
                        <p>Although acute leukemia is rapidly growing tumors, normal bone marrow progenitors grow at an even more rapid rate. The principal pathogenesis problem in acute leukemia is a block in differentiation. This leads to the accumulation of immature leukemic blasts in the bone marrow, which suppress the function of normal hematopoietic stem cells by physical displacement and other poorly understood mechanisms, eventually bone marrow failure results, which accounts for the major clinical manifestations of acute leukemia. Thus, the therapeutic goal is to reduce the leukemic clone sufficiently to allow normal hematopoiesis to resume.</p>

                        <p>The acute leukaemias have the following characteristics:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Abrupt stormy onset:</strong> Most patients present within 3 months of the onset of symptoms.</li>
                            <li><strong>Symptoms related to depression of normal marrow function:</strong> These include fatigue, pallor, dyspnoea, weakness (mainly due to anaemia), fever (reflecting infections resulting from the absence of mature leukocytes), Bleeding disorders (petechiae, ecchymoses, epistaxis, gum bleeding, purpura, bruises, prolonged bleeding) secondary to thrombocytopenia (low platelets).</li>
                            <li><strong>Bone pain and tenderness:</strong> These result from marrow expansion and infiltration of the sub periosteum.</li>
                            <li><strong>Generalized lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, and hepatomegaly:</strong> These reflect dissemination of the leukemic cells, and are more pronounced in ALL than in AML due to infiltration.</li>
                            <li><strong>Central nervous system manifestations:</strong> These include headache, vomiting, irritability and nerve palsies resulting from meningeal spread of leukemic cells; (Leukemic meningitis. these features are more common in children than in adults and are more common in ALL than AML.</li>
                            <li><strong>Infection and fever</strong> resulting from too few normal white blood cells.</li>
                            <li><strong>Gum hypertrophy</strong> due to infiltration.</li>
                            <li><strong>Chloromas :</strong> soft tissue masses in the skin or orbit due to infiltration by tumors.</li>
                        </ol>

                            <li><strong>Remission induction</strong>
                                <p>-This is the initial phase, where destruction of the bulk of tumour occurs.<br>-Severe BM hypoplasia occurs, requiring intensive support with in-patient care.<br>-The aim is to reduce blast cells to less than $5\%$ in BM with normal peripheral film. The drugs used include Vincristine and Glucocorticoids (Predinsolone, Dexamethasone) with addition of one or two agents</p>

                            <li><strong>Remission consolidation/Intensification phase</strong>
                                <p>Since patients in remission induction phase still harbor leukemic cells, further systemic treatment is required to prevent or delay leukemic relapse. This is usually completed within the first 6-12 months after induction. It involves the introduction of new, non-cross-resistant drugs and drug combinations selected for different and often synergistic mechanisms of action to reduce the risk of emergence of drug resistance.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Remission maintenance</strong>
                                <p>- If the pt is still in remission after consolidation phase a period of maintenance therapy is given consisting of a repeating cycle of drug administration usually up to 3 years. During maintenance therapy the patient still remain at risk of infection. Fever in children who are receiving chemotherapy must be evaluated and treated aggressively, especially if the patient is either neutropenic or has a central venous access device.</p>

                        <p>Probable cure of AML has been achieved with BMT after successful remission in induction phase.<br>Bone marrow is a semi solid substance within the bones where blood cells such as WBCs, RBCs and platelets are manufactured from the hematopoietic stem cells (HSC). During BMT it's the HSCs which are transplanted to replace the damaged or the diseased cells in the bone marrow with the cells of a normal person. This is called an Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant (HSCT). Bone marrow transplant/ stem cell transplant is performed after a high dose of chemotherapy or radiation. The donor must have the same genetic makeup as the patient ie from the family member (brother or sister).</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">(i). Chronic Myeloid/myelocytic/myelogenous Leukemia</h3>
                        <p>This is a disease in which a cell in the bone marrow becomes cancerous and produces large number of abnormal granulocytes. The cells range from very immature to mature forms, it's a slowly progressing and uncommon type of blood-cell cancer that begins in the bone marrow but some may be produced in the spleen and liver. These cells range from very immature to mature forms whereas only immature forms are seen in acute myeloid leukemia. It's common in older adults and is caused by a chromosome mutation.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>i) This is a disorder that is characterized by restrained and excessive proliferation of myeloid series of WBC.</li>
                            <li>ii) It occurs mainly between 30-80 years of age</li>
                            <li>iii) Peak incidence - 55 years.</li>
                            <li>iv) $\sim 90\%$ of patients with CML have a chromosome abnormality disorder called Philadelphia chromosome.( abnormality of chromosome 22)</li>
                            <li>v) This is a shortened chromosome 22 and is the result a reciprocal translocation of material with chromosome 9. The break on chromosome 22 occurs in the break point cluster region (BCR). The fragment from chromosome 9 that joints the BCR carries the Abelson oncogenes, which form a chimeric gene with the remains of BCR. This chimeric gene codes for a 210 kDa protein with tyrosine kinase enzyme, which plays a causative role in the disease.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">The disease has three phases</h4>
                        <p>The phases are based mainly on the number of immature WBCs (blasts) in the bone marrow.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Chronic phase</strong> - a period of variable length.
                                <p>The patients may be generally be asymptomatic but without proper treatment then patient progress to accelerated phase within 4 years. Has slow onset with non- specific symptoms ie weakness and weight loss.<br>- This is responsive to treatment and is easily controlled.<br>- It is essentially a benign neoplasm.<br>- Fewer than $10\%$ of the cells in the blood and bone marrow are blast cells (immature blood cells). Patients have mild symptoms and usually respond well to treatment. Presents with leukocytosis.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Accelerated phase</strong> - short phase 6-12 months.
                                <p>During this phase more and more immature granulocytes enter the blood stream and bone marrow. Its characterized by enlarged spleen, anaemia and progressive abdominal fullness and discomfort. Signs and symptoms include: low grade fever, night sweats, bone pain and weight loss coz of rapid proliferation and hypermetabolism of the leukemic cells. Bleeding and easily Bruising may arise from the dysfunctional platelets.<br>Blood samples have $15\%$ or more but fewer than $30\%$ blasts, very low counts of Platelets, Basophils make upto $20\%$ or more of the blood.<br>- Patient not responsive to TREATMENT<br>- Not easily controlled</p>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Blast crisis phase (acute phase)</strong> the terminal phase characterized by increasing no. of myeloid cells.
                                <p>Symptoms become more pronounced and splenomegally may become more pronounced. There is infiltration in the skin, lymph nodes, bones and central nervous system.<br>Blood samples have $20\%$ or more blasts (high blast count) Large clusters of blasts are seen in the bone marrow and are spread to tissues and organs beyond the bone marrow. Patients presents with fever, poor appetite and weight loss.<br>- Refractory to TREATMENT relapse<br>- Main cause of death in majority of patients.<br>- Patients' survival is determined by detection timing of blast phase which cannot be predicted.<br>- The disease transforms into acute leukemia in either AML $70\%$ or ALL $30\%$.</p>
