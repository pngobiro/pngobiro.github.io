                        <p>Coagulation is a complex process, triggered by damage to tissue or the vessel wall. This exposes collagen or releases tissue thromboplastin, which activate the coagulation cascade, summarised in Figure 66. Platelet activation also triggers coagulation. The final result is conversion of fibrinogen to an insoluble fibrin plug. This is catalysed by thrombin formed from its precursor prothrombin. Within the cascade, there are the intrinsic and extrinsic systems. These converge on a common pathway that activates the final two steps of thrombin and fibrin formation. Calcium is essential to coagulation. The coagulation factors are synthesised in the liver; a number of them are dependent on vitamin K .</p>
                        <p>There are also mechanisms that restrain coagulation, notably the thrombin inhibitor antithrombin III. Protein C is another. This protein is activated by thrombin formation and feeds back to suppress the coagulation cascade. Protein $S$ is a cofactor for that inhibitory pathway.</p>
                        <p>Once formed, clots are lysed by plasmin with the release of fibrin degradation products (FDPs). The conversion of plasminogen to plasmin is promoted by tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). The dynamic</p>

                        <p>Only von Willebrand disease is common enough to be described here.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Von Willebrand disease</h4>
                        <p>Von Willebrand factor (vWF) is a large protein released by endothelium that plays an important role in platelet adhesion and aggregation; it is also necessary as a carrier for factor VIII in plasma. Von Willebrand disease is by far the commonest inherited disorder of coagulation and a variety of types have now been described. These differ in whether vWF is present in reduced quantity (type I, type III) or is functionally defective (type II, subtypes A, B, M, N). The commonest (type I) is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. Typically, there is a lifelong history of mild-to-moderate bleeding, usually from mucosal surfaces, but patients may not be aware that they have a bleeding disorder until they undergo surgery or have an accident, when bleeding may be excessive.</p>
                        <p>Diagnosis and classification of von Willebrand disease is not always easy, because results of laboratory investigations often vary day-to-day. Classically, patients have a prolonged bleeding time and APTT, but both may be normal. Generally, quantitative abnormalities are detected by measuring plasma vWF concentration; functional defects produce abnormal platelet aggregation in response to ristocetin (ristocetin cofactor activity). Treatment depends upon the situation and the type of von Willebrand disease but may involve tranexamic acid (an inhibitor of fibrinolysis), desmopressin (a synthetic analogue of antidiuretic hormone (arginine vasopressin; see p. 299), which causes release of vWF from endothelial stores), vWF concentrate or, occasionally (type IIB), platelet transfusions.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Acquired coagulation defects</h3>
                        <p>The causes of acquired coagulation disorders are listed under the coagulation tests above. You should remember that any GI disease that affects fat absorption may cause vitamin K deficiency. Hepatocellular dysfunction impairs coagulation factor synthesis to such an extent that the PT is a very sensitive test of hepatocellular failure. Clinical implications of this are considered under liver disease (p. 139).</p>
                        <p>The effects of warfarin and heparin are discussed in the next section and 'consumption coagulopathy' is discussed under DIC (p. 279). Vitamin K is given parenterally to treat malabsorption and to reverse the action of warfarin. It may also improve clotting factor synthesis in mild liver disease. Otherwise, the treatment for coagulation factor deficiencies is infusion of fresh frozen plasma.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Heparin</h3>
                        <p>Unfractioned heparin consists of natural polysaccharides of various molecular weights, which have an almost immediate anticoagulant effect. It markedly potentiates the action of antithrombin III and inhibits serine proteases such as activated Factor X (Xa). It has to be given parenterally, and either by continuous infusion or as several injections per day because it has a short half-life. It prevents the formation of new clot and shifts the balance of fibrin formation/lysis in the direction of lysis, but it is not primarily a fibrinolytic drug. It is indicated whenever an immediate anticoagulant effect is required. It may also be used to prevent thrombosis (usually venous). There are two common schedules:</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li>prophylaxis: heparin 5000 units subcutaneously 8- or 12-hourly</li>
                        <li>treatment: heparin 5000 units as an i.v. loading dose followed by 1000-2000 units hourly by continuous i.v. infusion.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Sensitivity to heparin varies from patient to patient. You should check the APTT every $6-12$ hours until it is prolonged approximately twofold (depending upon the indication) and stable. Warfarin can be introduced while the patient is on heparin. Heparin should be continued at least until the patient is stabilised on warfarin, and for a minimum of 5 days in venous thrombo-embolism. Prolonged heparin treatment ( $>5$ days) can cause thrombocytopenia. More prolonged treatment (as in pregnancy) can cause osteoporosis. Unfractionated heparin is now being superceded by the newer low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) preparations, which may eventually replace it entirely. These compounds act mainly by inhibition of factor Xa and have a much more predictable effect for a standard dose in different patients. This enables treatment to be given by once or twice daily subcutaneous injections, often without need for laboratory monitoring. It also allows outpatient treatment of venous thrombo-embolism in selected patients.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Warfarin</h3>
                        <p>Warfarin and other coumarins are used for long-term anticoagulation. They take about 48 hours to become effective, governed by the half-lives of the vitamin Kdependent factors. Warfarin is strongly protein bound. Anything that affects this binding will affect sensitivity to it. Liver function and levels of the vitamin Kdependent factors also affect sensitivity to warfarin to such an extent that patients may be 'autoanticoagulated'. For this reason, you must always check the PT before starting therapy. Warfarin is given as loading doses over 2 days and a maintenance dose adjusted to prolong the PT (reported as the INR, see p. 276) by a factor of 1.5-4 (depending upon the indication). The effect of warfarin is unpredictable in alcoholism and liver disease. Important drug interactions are:</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li>potentiation of warfarin by displacement from protein binding, e.g. salicylates, sulphonamides</li>
                        <li>potentiation of warfarin by inhibiting warfarin metabolism, e.g. metronidazole, amiodarone, cimetidine, isoniazid</li>
                        <li>potentiation of the effect of warfarin on the liver, e.g. tetracycline</li>
                        <li>reduced effect of warfarin by inducing warfarin metabolism, e.g. phenobarbitol, carbamazepine, rifampicin.</li>

                        <p>Even if the contraindications listed above are observed, over-anticoagulation may occur and directly cause haemorrhage from the mucosae, into the skin or into the tissues (e.g. cerebral haemorrhage). That should be rare provided the dosage schedule and degree of anticoagulation are appropriately chosen and monitored. Warfarin can be reversed within a few hours by giving i.v. vitamin K or immediately by infusion of fresh frozen plasma or clotting factor concentrate. Heparin action will wear off after about 4 hours but can be reversed rapidly by i.v. protamine.</p>
                        <p>Sometimes, a decision has to be taken to give anticoagulation therapy to a patient at risk of haemorrhage because the risk of not providing anticoagulation is even more unacceptable. Your responsibilities as a prescriber are to:</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li>vet all patients' suitability for anticoagulation in terms of compliance and understanding</li>
                        <li>screen for underlying diseases which may complicate treatment</li>
                        <li>advise patients about the risks and benefits of treatment and the need to abstain from alcohol and drugs (including over-the-counter drugs) which may complicate anticoagulation</li>
                        <li>ensure adequate monitoring of the INR.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>Thrombophilic states may be inherited or acquired.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Inherited thrombophilia</h3>
                        <p>The most common cause of inherited thrombophilia is a point mutation in the gene encoding factor $V$ (factor $V$ Leiden), which causes resistance to activated protein C and allows thrombosis to progress uninhibited. Antithrombin III deficiency is an autosomal dominant condition that is incompatible with life in its homozygous form. The prevalence of heterozygosity is about 1 per 2000. Protein C and protein S deficiency are similarly inherited but are less common. A prothrombotic variant of the prothrombin gene is also well documented.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Acquired thrombophilia</h3>
                        <p>Antiphospholipid syndrome is an uncommon autoimmune disorder in which an autoantibody triggers coagulation. It may be associated with lupus (lupus anticoagulant) and can cause recurrent fetal loss in young women. Anticardiolipin antibodies are often present. Lesser degrees of thrombophilia occur in any illness that increases fibrinogen levels, in pregnancy and in women taking the oral contraceptive, (which is particularly prone to cause thrombosis in women with the factor V Leiden mutation).</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Clinical presentation</h3>
                        <p>Inherited thrombophilia presents with thrombosis at an early age, recurrent thrombosis, thrombosis at unusual sites (e.g. mesenteric vein) and/or a positive family history. The thromboses are usually venous but may be arterial.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Screening for thrombophilia</h3>
                        <p>The following are indications to screen a patient for thrombophilia:</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li>venous or arterial thrombo-embolism in a young person (aged < 40 years)</li>
                        <li>recurrent venous thrombosis</li>
                        <li>family history of venous thrombo-embolism</li>
                        <li>recurrent fetal loss.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Investigation</h3>
                        <p>You should check a full blood count to exclude polycythaemia (p. 266) and thrombocytosis (p. 274): measure plasma fibrinogen and the PT and APTT. Other investigations include anticardiolipin antibodies and direct measurements of activated protein C resistance, protein C, protein $S$ and antithrombin III. These should be done before starting anticoagulants.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Management</h3>
                        <p>Significant thrombophilia requires anticoagulation to cover high-risk situations (e.g. pregnancy, surgery) and, sometimes, life long.</p>
