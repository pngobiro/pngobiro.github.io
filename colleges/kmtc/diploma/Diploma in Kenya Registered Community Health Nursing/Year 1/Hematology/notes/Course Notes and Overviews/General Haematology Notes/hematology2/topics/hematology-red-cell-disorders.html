                        <p>Think of anaemias in terms of:</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li>decreased red cell production</li>

                        <p>This classification is expanded in Table 61. Note that the commonest form, iron-deficiency anaemia, often results from a combination of both. The MCV is central to the diagnosis of anaemia. Remember that:</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li>iron deficiency causes microcytosis</li>
                        <li>vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ and folate deficiency cause macrocytosis (other causes are covered on p. 261)</li>
                        <li>the anaemia of marrow suppression is often normocytic.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Exceptions to these rules are discussed under individual diseases. Given the haemoglobin and MCV, white cell count, platelet and reticulocyte counts and a description of the blood film, you can make a working diagnosis in most cases.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Iron-deficiency anaemia</h3>
                        <p>Iron-deficiency anaemia is the most common and, to the generalist, most important anaemia because it:</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li>is a significant public health problem</li>
                        <li>may be the presentation of an occult gastrointestinal (GI) carcinoma at a curable stage</li>
                        <li>is eminently treatable whatever its cause.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Iron deficiency is caused by an imbalance between dietary availability and blood loss, so much of the population is iron deficient in areas of the developing world where GI parasites are endemic. Active growth, pregnancy and lactation increase the demand for iron and may unmask deficiency. The prevalance of depleted iron stores in women of menstrual age may be as high as $20 \%$ and that iron deficiency can persist into the postmenopausal years if they have a poor diet and do not replete their iron stores. Iron deficiency is much less prevalent in adult men and, therefore, more likely to be caused by an occult carcinoma or other underlying disease.</p>
                        <p>There are sizeable iron stores in the liver, reticuloendothelial system and marrow, as well as in the erythrocytes themselves, so negative iron balance must exist for some time before anaemia develops. For the same reason, replenishment of iron stores takes longer than the restoration of haemopoiesis, and iron treatment should be continued after the haemoglobin has returned to normal.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Causes</h4>
                        <p>These are:</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li>blood loss</li>
                        <li>dietary deficiency</li>
                        <li>malabsorption.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Iron may be malabsorbed as a result of small intestinal disease or after gastrectomy.</p>
                        <p>Sources of blood loss, in order of frequency, are:</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li>menstruation</li>
                        <li>the GI tract (Ch. 3)</li>
                        <li>the urinary tract.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>In practice, it may be difficult to decide whether menorrhagia is the sole cause of blood loss. If in doubt, suspect another disease.</p>
                        <p>Common causes of GI blood loss are:</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li>gastritis, peptic ulcer or oesophagitis, particularly in patients taking aspirin, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or steroids</li>
                        <li>diverticular disease</li>
                        <li>carcinoma of the stomach, caecum or colon</li>
                        <li>angiodysplasia of the colon, an increasingly recognised cause in elderly people</li>
                        <li>oesophageal varices.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>A less common cause is Meckel's diverticulum. Although only a small minority of iron-deficient patients have GI tumours, it is worthwhile identifying them because diagnosis at the stage of a predominantly mucosal lesion may allow curative surgery.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Clinical and haematological signs</h4>
                        <p>Symptoms and signs were covered earlier and in Figure 64. Early signs on the blood film are variability in size and shape of the red cells. In established iron deficiency, they are hypochromic and microcytic and 'pencil cells' may be seen.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Diagnosis and further investigation</h4>
                        <p>Iron deficiency is overwhelmingly the most common UK cause of microcytosis but it also occurs in thalassaemia trait and, sometimes, in the anaemia of chronic disease. If there is doubt, iron deficiency is diagnosed by measuring serum iron and total iron-binding capacity. These are measured together because binding protein deficiency may lower the serum iron concentration without signifying true iron deficiency; $<10 \%$ saturation of iron-binding capacity is diagnostic of iron deficiency. Measurement of serum ferritin is a better reflection of iron stores (particularly to detect iron overload, as in haemachromatosis). Absence of stainable marrow iron stores and a significant improvement in the blood count with iron replacement are definitive evidence of iron deficiency.</p>
                        <p>Stool samples are often tested for occult blood to confirm or exclude the GI tract as the site of blood loss, but they may be falsely positive or negative. Dietary assessment and tests for malabsorption (p. 127) may be indicated. The investigations are not complete until a patient with undiagnosed iron deficiency has had gastroscopy, colonoscopy (or barium studies) to look for a site of blood loss.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Management</h4>
                        <p>There is little to choose between the many formulations of oral iron. Ferrous sulphate is usually prescribed. It may cause nausea, abdominal pain, diarrhoea or constipation, in which case the dose should be reduced or a different iron salt given. A response should be seen within 1 week of starting treatment and a rise in haemoglobin of $10 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{l}$ each week is to be expected. Treatment is continued for 3 months after the haemoglobin has returned to normal to replenish iron stores.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Megaloblastic anaemias</h3>
                        <p>Vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ (cobalamin) and folic acid are coenzymes for cellular metabolism, particularly haemopoiesis. Deficiency affects DNA synthesis in all marrow cell lines and the red cell precursors develop 'megaloblastic' morphological changes. Ineffective erythropoiesis reduces the production of mature red cells and they are enlarged (macrocytic). Formation of platelets and granulocytes is also impaired.</p>
                        <p>Vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ and folate deficiency are not the only causes of macrocytosis; others, in approximate order of frequency, are:</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li><strong>common causes</strong>
                            <ul>
                            <li>alcohol abuse</li>
                            <li>liver disease</li>
                            <li>active haemopoiesis (immature red cells are large): haemolytic anaemias, blood loss</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>less common causes</strong>
                            <ul>
                            <li>myelodysplasia</li>
                            <li>aplastic anaemia</li>
                            <li>antifolate drugs: methotrexate, phenytoin.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>However, vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ and folate deficiency are the only common conditions to produce the typical megaloblastic bone marrow appearances. They have identical haematological features but differ in their causes and non-haematological manifestations. This section will first present the common features and then the differences between them.</p>

                        <h4>Clinical and haematological features</h4>
                        <p>Patients typically present with symptoms of anaemia and malaise. These develop insidiously and the anaemia may be very severe by the time the diagnosis is made. Elderly people, in particular, may tolerate it surprisingly well until they present with heart failure or angina resulting from tissue hypoxia. There may be</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li>mild jaundice caused by haemolysis of the defective red cells</li>
                        <li>fever</li>
                        <li>glossitis</li>
                        <li>splenomegaly (very unusually).</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Although moderate neutropenia and thrombocytopenia are common, they are not usually symptomatic. Vitamin $B_{12}$ deficiency may, uncommonly, present with its neurological complications (see Ch. 5). There may be features of an underlying GI disease in vitamin $B_{12}$, folate or a mixed deficiency anaemia.</p>
                        <p>Whatever the cause, the blood film shows:</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li>pancytopenia</li>
                        <li>macrocytosis: large oval red cells</li>
                        <li>hypersegmentation of the neutrophil nuclei (termed a 'right shift')</li>
                        <li>megaloblasts in peripheral blood in severe cases.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>This haematological picture is so characteristic that the diagnosis can generally be made without bone marrow examination, the definitive way of demonstrating megaloblastic change.</p>

                        <h4>Vitamin $B_{12}$ deficiency</h4>
                        <p>Vitamin $B_{12}$ is present in meat and dairy produce. It is absorbed as a complex with intrinsic factor (IF) produced by the gastric parietal cells. Pure dietary deficiency is exceptionally rare because there are large hepatic stores but can occur in alcoholics. More commonly, deficiency is caused by</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li>autoimmune damage to the gastric parietal cells: pernicious anaemia</li>
                        <li>destruction of vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ by bacterial overgrowth in diverticulae, blind loops or fistulae</li>
                        <li>disease of the terminal ileum where the $\mathrm{B}_{12}$-IF complex is absorbed: usually Crohn's disease</li>
                        <li>pancreatic exocrine deficiency</li>
                        <li>gastrectomy.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h5>Pernicious anaemia</h5>
                        <p>Pernicious anaemia is an organ-specific autoimmune disease caused by antibodies to gastric parietal cells and intrinsic factor. It</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li>is commoner in women than men</li>
                        <li>may develop from adolescence onwards but is most common in middle to old age.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>It is associated with:</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li>blood group A</li>
                        <li>failure of gastric acid secretion</li>
                        <li>an increased risk of gastric acid carcinoma</li>
                        <li>an increased incidence of the other organ-specific autoimmune diseases, including vitiligo, diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism and Addison's disease.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The diagnosis is made by demonstrating a reduced serum vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ concentration, and IF antibodies. It is confirmed by the Schilling test, in which radiolabelled $B_{12}$ is given on two occasions, first on its own and then with oral IF. Urinary excretion of the label is measured. In pernicious anaemia, there is malabsorption which is correctable by IF. Other causes of malabsorption are not correctable.</p>

                        <h5>Neurological effects of $\mathbf{B}_{\mathbf{12}}$ deficiency</h5>
                        <p>Full blood counts are now so widely available that $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ deficiency is usually recognised and treated before it has any significant neurological effects; however, some individuals may develop neurological effects with little or no anaemia. These include:</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li>optic atrophy</li>
                        <li>dementia</li>
                        <li>subacute combined degeneration of the cord (Ch. 5).</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h5>Treatment</h5>
                        <p>One simple rule is that folate and vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ should always be given together in megaloblastic anaemia, at least until the haematinic results are known, because folate treatment alone can increase haemopoiesis in patients with pure vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ deficiency and actually precipitate neurological complications. Patients with vitamin $B_{12}$ deficiency should be given injections of vita$\min B_{12}$ weekly for 6 weeks and then 3-monthly indefinitely thereafter. The reticulocyte response should be checked after 7 days. Potassium supplements are needed in some cases, as well as iron and folate, because cellular anabolism requires potassium. Whether or not patients with severe megaloblastic anaemia should be transfused is controversial because even careful transfusion can precipitate heart failure. If it is done, it should be slow and with diuretic cover and should not aim to restore haemoglobin immediately to normal.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Folate deficiency</h4>
                        <p>Folate is absorbed in the upper small intestine. The body stores are relatively small so folate deficiency develops earlier in malabsorption syndromes than does iron or vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ deficiency. For the same reason, folate deficiency is more likely to have a purely dietary cause, to develop during pregnancy or to be precipitated by active haemopoiesis in haemolytic states. Folate metabolism is vulnerable to a wide range of drugs and is actually the target of some chemotherapeutic agents, e.g. methotrexate. These are the main causes of folate deficiency:</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li>dietary, for example in:
                            <ul>
                            <li>alcoholism</li>
                            <li>elderly or neglected people</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>increased demand
                            <ul>
                            <li>pregnancy</li>
                            <li>active haemopoiesis, e.g. haemolytic anaemia</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>malabsorption
                            <ul>
                            <li>coeliac disease</li>
                            <li>pancreatic insufficiency</li>
                            <li>postgastrectomy</li>
                            <li>Crohn's disease</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>drugs which interfere with folate absorption: phenytoin</li>
                        <li>drugs which interfere with folate metabolism: methotrexate, phenytoin, trimethoprim.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Investigation of the cause of folate deficiency will depend on the context in which it is diagnosed. If there is a clear dietary or drug cause, no further investigation is needed. Otherwise, investigation for malabsorption is indicated.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Diagnosis</h5>
                        <p>A low serum or red cell folate concentration confirms the diagnosis. Of the two, red cell folate more accurately reflects total body folate stores.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Prevention and treatment</h5>
                        <p>Pregnant women are routinely given prophylactic oral folate. Alcoholic or poorly nourished patients should be given folate as part of their rehabilitation. Proven folate deficiency is treated with oral folic acid. As explained above, this must never be given alone in macrocytic anaemia unless vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ deficiency has been excluded. If there is evidence of iron deficiency, oral iron should also be given.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Aplastic/hypoplastic anaemia</h3>
                        <p>Aplastic anaemia is a rare condition which may be congenital or acquired. It may be primary (no cause identified) or secondary to:</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li>drugs, e.g. chloramphenicol, chemotherapy, zidovudine, ganciclovir, phenylbutazone</li>
                        <li>irradiation</li>
                        <li>chemicals</li>
                        <li>infection, e.g. viral hepatitis</li>
                        <li>autoimmune disease.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>There is usually leucopenia and thrombocytopenia as well as anaemia, although pure red cell aplasia may occur. The aplasia may be transient or chronic, and partial (hypoplastic) or complete (aplastic). The symptoms and signs depend on the relative degrees of anaemia, thrombocytopenia and neutropenia. The red cells are normocytic or slightly macrocytic. The marrow trephine biopsy is hypoplastic. The differential diagnosis is with other causes of pancytopenia, particularly marrow replacement/fibrosis. Severe aplastic anaemia has a high mortality. A significant number of patients respond to antilymphocyte globulin, but the best chance of cure lies in bone marrow transplantation from an HLAidentical sibling donor. Androgens and corticosteroids have occasionally been effective. Supportive care of the neutropenic patient (p. 268) and transfusions of platelet and red cells are needed. With time, platelet and red cell antibodies develop and may complicate management.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Leucoerythroblastic anaemia</h3>
                        <p>Leucoerythroblastic anaemia is used to describe a condition in which the blood film shows immature leucocytes and erythroblasts. It has many causes, notably marrow infiltration with a solid tumour, myeloma, lymphoma, leukaemia or myelofibrosis. It is investigated by marrow aspiration/biopsy.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Anaemia of chronic disease</h3>
                        <p>Anaemia caused by chronic disease is, second to iron deficiency, the most common anaemia you are likely to encounter. Common causes are:</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li>chronic infection</li>
                        <li>renal failure</li>
                        <li>liver disease</li>
                        <li>malignancy</li>
                        <li>autoimmune disease.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The typical pattern is a normocytic or microcytic anaemia with reduced serum iron and total iron-binding capacity, intact marrow iron stores and reduced erythroblast haemosiderin. It is usually caused by suppressed erythropoiesis, although other mechanisms such as haemolysis may contribute. The anaemia is often relatively mild. There is no specific treatment other than management of the causative disease.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Haemolytic anaemias</h3>
                        <p>Destruction of red cells by a disease process either intrinsic or extrinsic to the cell causes:</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li>shortened red cell survival</li>
                        <li>increased erythropoiesis</li>
                        <li>anaemia if erythropoiesis cannot keep pace with red cell destruction.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>There may be morphological changes in the red cells, giving a clue to the cause of haemolysis.</p>
                        <p>In most haemolytic anaemias, red cells are removed by macrophages of the reticuloendothelial system, chiefly in the spleen. This process is termed extravascular haemolysis. Breakdown of haemoglobin increases the plasma level of unconjugated bilirubin, causing clinically overt jaundice in severe haemolysis. Splenomegaly and pigment gall stones may occur.</p>
                        <p>When there is rapid breakdown of red cells within the circulation (intravascular haemolysis), haemoglobin is liberated. Initially, it is bound to plasma proteins called haptoglobins. When the binding capacity of haptoglobins is exceeded, free haemoglobin is filtered in the kidneys and converted to haemosiderin in renal tubular cells. Haemosiderin can be detected in urine.</p>
                        <p>The haemolytic anaemias are a heterogeneous group of disorders which can be classified into congenital and acquired forms. Congenital haemolytic anaemias include:</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li>haemoglobinopathies

                        </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Acquired haemolytic anaemias include:</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li>autoimmune (p. 264)</li>

                        <h4>Diagnosis</h4>
                        <p>The clinical features of haemolytic anaemias are those of the anaemia, the sequelae of haemolysis and any underlying cause. In addition to haematological features, patients with chronic haemolytic anaemia are prone to leg ulceration as well as pigment gall stones.</p>
                        <p>Laboratory features of haemolysis are:</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li>evidence of increased erythropoiesis: reticulocytosis, polychromasia, erythroid hyperplasia of bone marrow</li>
                        <li>evidence of increased red cell breakdown: increased plasma unconjugated bilirubin and urinary urobilinogen, reduced plasma haptoglobin.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4>Congenital haemolytic anaemias</h4>
                        <p>The only congenital haemolytic anaemias covered here are those that you might expect to encounter as a house officer.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Sickle syndromes</h5>
                        <p>Sickle syndromes are caused by a recessively inherited amino acid substitution in the haemoglobin A molecule, which causes it to become insoluble and cross-link under hypoxic conditions. This causes haemolysis, 'stickiness' and microvascular occlusion.</p>
                        <p>Africans are most often affected, so heterozygotes are common in areas with a high African population. They may develop symptoms after surgery or during any situation that causes hypoxia. 'Sickle trait' can be diagnosed by the in vitro 'sickle test' and by haemoglobin electrophoresis.</p>
                        <p>Homozygotes are more severely affected. They have a chronic haemolytic anaemia and may have sickling crises precipitated by:</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li>hypoxia</li>
                        <li>dehydration</li>
                        <li>infection</li>
                        <li>other systemic stresses.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>During crises, microvascular occlusion causes infarcts of bone and soft tissues. Patients experience severe pain, fever and malaise. Splenic infarcts lead to hyposplenism and an increased risk of pneumococcal septicaemia. Salmonella osteomyelitis is common in areas of infarcted bone. There may be soft tissue complications, including retinopathy, acute renal papillary necrosis, acute pulmonary syndrome, and leg ulcers. Pigment gall stones are common. Pregnancy is hazardous. Prophylactic penicillin is required to prevent pneumococcal septicaemia.</p>
                        <p>Sickling crises are treated by</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li>keeping the patient warm</li>
                        <li>oxygen</li>
                        <li>intravenous fluids</li>
                        <li>opiate analgesia</li>
                        <li>antibiotics.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h5>The thalassaemias</h5>
                        <p>The thalassaemias are a group of congenital haemolytic anaemias caused by mutations or gene deletions affecting the $\alpha$-and $\beta$-globin chains ( $\alpha$ and $\beta$-thalassaemia, respectively). They vary in severity from a chance finding in an asymptomatic individual to a disease that is incompatible with life. Synthesis of abnormal haemoglobin causes 'ineffective erythropoiesis'. There is microcytosis and the cells are irregular in size, shape and degree of haemoglobinisation.</p>
                        <p>Heterozygotes (thalassaemia trait) usually remain asymptomatic but may become mildly anaemic during intercurrent infection or pregnancy. Remember thalassaemia trait in the differential diagnosis of microcytic anaemia. Thalassaemia major is not considered further here.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Acquired haemolytic anaemia</h4>
                        <h5>Autoimmune haemolytic anaemia</h5>
                        <p>Autoimmune haemolytic anaemia (AIHA) is most commonly idiopathic but may be caused by:</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li>autoimmune disease, e.g. systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)</li>
                        <li>neoplasia, e.g. chronic lymphocytic leukaemia</li>
                        <li>infection, e.g. infectious mononucleosis, mycoplasma</li>
                        <li>drugs, e.g. methyldopa.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The anti-red cell antibody involved may cause haemolysis at body temperature ('warm AIHA': usually IgG) or only at temperatures well below $37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ ('cold AIHA': usually IgM) and the clinical picture varies accordingly.</p>
                        <p><strong>Cold AIHA (cold haemagglutinin disease).</strong> Haemolysis is mediated by complement and usually intravascular, classically causing episodes of dark urine (haemoglobinuria) after cold exposure. At the same time, agglutination of red cells in peripheral capillaries may cause peripheral cyanosis, Raynaud's-like symptoms and even gangrene. Cold AIHA may occur as a transient problem after infectious diseases such as infectious mononucleosis or mycoplasma pneumonia. Red cell agglutinates can be seen on a blood film at room temperature.</p>
                        <p><strong>Warm AIHA.</strong> Haemolysis is usually extravascular, particularly in the spleen, and leads to jaundice and splenomegaly. The blood film shows spherocytosis.</p>
                        <p><strong>Direct antiglobulin test.</strong> In either case, the definitive test for AIHA is the direct antiglobulin test, in which antibodies are demonstrated on the red cell surface by the addition of anti-human globulin, which will cause agglutination.</p>
                        <p><strong>Management of warm AIHA.</strong> Warm AIHA can be treated with:</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li>steroids</li>
                        <li>splenectomy</li>
                        <li>immunosuppressive therapy.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Management of cold AIHA.</strong> Patients with cold agglutinins should be kept warm; they respond less well to steroids and splenectomy. Blood transfusion may be needed for haemolytic crises, but cross-matching can be difficult.</p>

                        <h5>Non-immune acquired haemolytic anaemias</h5>
                        <p>The nonimmune acquired haemolytic anaemias are caused by:</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li>fibrin deposited in the microcirculation, as in disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) (p. 279)</li>
                        <li>heart valves or other mechanical prostheses</li>
                        <li>toxic causes, including uraemia, lead poisoning and some drugs</li>
                        <li>paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria, a rare condition in which deficiencies of membrane proteins make the red cells susceptible to the lytic actions of serum complement.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>In the case of DIC and mechanical red cell damage, schistocytes (fragmented red cells) are seen on the blood film.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Blood transfusion</h3>
                        <p>There are two quite distinct indications for blood transfusion:</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li>to restore volume after acute blood loss</li>
                        <li>to restore the red cell mass in a patient with anaemia and a normal blood volume (compensated anaemia).</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>An excellent, 'official' guide is available at http://www.show.scot.nhs.uk/sbts/webpages/01aud. htm.</p>

                        <h4>Acute blood loss</h4>
                        <p>Acute blood loss is caused by trauma, haemorrhage, usually from the GI tract, and surgery. If haemorrhage is severe, there is circulatory collapse. The physical signs are from the blood loss itself and from volume depletion (p. 188).</p>
                        <p>You should transfuse red cells (with other fluids, if needed) as quickly as necessary to restore the circulation, monitoring the pulse, blood pressure and urine output. Remember that the haemoglobin concentration is no guide to the severity of acute blood loss because it takes time for haemodilution to occur.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Transfusion for anaemia</h4>
                        <p>In anaemia, plasma volume is normal despite lack of red cells. This process of compensation takes hours or days after acute blood loss. The indications for transfusion are less strong than after acute blood loss because:</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li>the patient is not shocked</li>
                        <li>treating the underlying cause of anaemia is a more permanent (albeit slower) solution than transfusing red cells, which have a short lifespan</li>
                        <li>transfusion increases blood volume and may cause volume overload (heart failure).</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Transfusion may nevertheless be indicated to:</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li>relieve symptoms</li>
                        <li>prepare anaemic patients for surgery</li>
                        <li>increase the red cell mass in case of further bleeding.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>As a rule of thumb, blood transfusion:</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li>is rarely indicated if the haemoglobin concentration is above $100 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{l}$</li>
                        <li>may be indicated between 80 and $100 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{l}$</li>
                        <li>is likely to be needed below $80 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{l}$.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>In general, iron, vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ or folate deficiency should be treated with haematinics. Transfusion for anaemia is particularly hazardous if the patient is in heart failure, when red cells should be given with an i.v. loop diuretic and close observation of the patient's haemodynamic state. Blood transfusion is expensive and potentially hazardous. It should not be 'dished out' carelessly.</p>

                        <h4>Blood groups</h4>
                        <p>The main ABO system consists of two markers inherited as Mendelian dominant traits from the parents. The red cells of an individual may carry the A antigen (group A), the $B$ antigen (group $B$ ), both (group $A B$ ) or neither (group O ). The antigens are carried on many tissues other than red cells and individuals are exposed early in life to those antigens that they do not carry. Thus group A individuals have agglutinins to the $B$ antigen and vice versa; group O individuals have agglutinins to both antigens and group AB individuals have agglutinins to neither. The importance of this system to blood transfusion is that donated cells may be lysed by host agglutinins; lysis of host cells by donor agglutinins is not usually a problem. Table 62 summarises the system and reminds you that group O subjects are 'universal donors' because their cells have neither antigen and will not be lysed if they are transfused into group $\mathrm{A}, \mathrm{B}$ or AB recipients. Group $A B$ subjects are 'universal recipients' because they have agglutinins against neither antigen.</p>
                        <p>The rhesus (D) blood group system is also conceptually very simple. About $85 \%$ of the Caucasian population (and a higher proportion of Asians) carry the D (or rhesus) antigen on their red cells. Those who are rhesus negative may develop antibodies against the D antigen but only if exposed to it by blood transfusion or, in pregnancy, by placental leakage.</p>

                        <h4>Cross-matching</h4>
                        <p>After determining the patient's ABO and rhesos blood groups, donor red cells of an appropriate group are then cross-matched, both at room temperature and at $37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ against patient's serum, to detect cold and warm antibodies. Positive results in these tests mandate further investigation, and a significant delay before compatible blood can be made available. There is an increasing move towards storing the patient's own blood in preparation for elective surgery, eliminating the risks of cross-infection and incompatibility (autologous transfusion).</p>

                        <h4>Complications of transfusion</h4>
                        <p>The major risks of HIV and hepatitis B and C infection can largely be eliminated by careful screening of donor blood. Other potential complications are:</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li>minor febrile reactions</li>
                        <li>haemolytic reactions</li>
                        <li>severe allergic reactions</li>
                        <li>transfusion-related lung injury</li>
                        <li>problems caused by massive transfusions</li>
                        <li>chronic iron overload.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h5>Minor febrile reactions</h5>
                        <p>Minor febrile reactions are not uncommon, particularly in patients who have developed platelet and/or white cell antibodies from repeated transfusions. They may be prevented by leucodepleting the red cells before transfusion, or using a filter to trap white cells and platelets during transfusion.</p>

                        <h5>Acute, severe haemolytic reactions</h5>
                        <p>Severe acute haemolytic reactions are fortunately rare, invariably caused by ABO incompatibility (e.g. a group O recipient receiving group A blood) and almost always caused by elementary errors like the incorrect labelling of blood samples or incomplete pretransfusion checks. They are likely to lead to undefendable litigation. The patient may develop pyrexia, chest or abdominal pain and pass black urine, rapidly progressing to shock, acute renal failure and DIC. If a haemolytic reaction is suspected, you should:</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li>stop the transfusion immediately</li>
                        <li>give intravenous hydrocortisone and chlorphenamine</li>
                        <li>check the patient's identity and details of the donor blood</li>
                        <li>return the blood to the transfusion laboratory with a fresh sample of the patient's blood</li>
                        <li>call for senior help and resuscitate as needed.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h5>Severe allergic reactions</h5>
                        <p>Severe allergic reactions occur occasionally. Patients who are deficient in IgA (1 in 600) and produce anti-IgA antibodies are particularly at risk.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Transfusion-related acute lung injury</h5>
                        <p>Acute lung injury can be caused by aggregation of neutrophils in lung capillaries precipitated by antiwhite cell antibodies in donor plasma; it may result in acute respiratory distress.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Massive transfusion</h5>
                        <p>Massive transfusions may lead to particular problems. Hypocalcaemia can result from the chelating action of citrate, particularly if there is liver disease, which impairs citrate metabolism. Dilution of platelets and clotting factors by stored blood leading to an increased risk of bleeding is another potential complication.</p>

                        <h5>Iron overload</h5>
                        <p>Repeated blood transfusions can eventually lead to cardiac, liver and endocrine damage.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Polycythaemia</h3>
                        <p>The term polycythaemia (increased number of red cells) is frequently used to mean erythrocytosis (increased haemoglobin concentration). That is not strictly correct but has become accepted in medical parlance. Polycythaemia and erythrocytosis are therefore both defined as an increased red cell mass. You will recognise it on the blood count as an increased haemoglobin concentration, red cell count and haematocrit. It may be absolute, or relative to a reduced plasma volume.</p>
                        <p>Absolute polycythaemia may be:</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li>primary: termed polycythaemia vera</li>
                        <li>secondary to increased erythropoietin.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Causes of secondary polycythaemia include:</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li>compensatory increased erythropoietin secretion as a result of:
                            <ul>
                            <li>tissue hypoxia</li>
                            <li>lung disease</li>
                            <li>cyanotic heart disease</li>
                            <li>altitude</li>
                            <li>hypoventilation (Pickwickian syndrome)</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>non-compensatory increased erythropoietin secretion from:
                            <ul>
                            <li>renal tumour or cysts</li>
                            <li>other tumours.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Only lung disease is a common cause of clinical polycythaemia.</p>
                        <p>Polycythaemia increases the oxygen-carrying capacity of blood but it also increases viscosity and impairs blood flow. Many of its clinical effects are the result of stasis and impaired tissue oxygenation.</p>

                        <h4>Polycythaemia vera</h4>
                        <p>Polycythaemia vera is a neoplastic stem cell proliferation which increases the formation primarily of red cells but also of leucocytes and platelets. Clinical manifestations result from:</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li>hyperviscosity</li>
                        <li>tissue hypoxia</li>
                        <li>vascular occlusive events resulting from stasis and thrombocytosis.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Paradoxically, patients may also bleed easily because their platelets are dysfunctional.</p>

                        <h5>Clinical presentation</h5>
                        <p>Patients may present with:</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li>systemic symptoms such as pruritus (particularly after a warm bath) or malaise</li>
                        <li>an arterial or deep venous thrombosis</li>
                        <li>neurological symptoms, including headache, tinnitus and visual disturbance</li>
                        <li>cardiovascular symptoms, including angina and intermittent claudication</li>
                        <li>dyspepsia or non-specific abdominal pain signifying GI mucosal ulceration</li>
                        <li>episodes of epistaxis or GI haemorrhage</li>
                        <li>gout.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>On examination, there is plethora, cyanosis, injection of the conjunctivae and, in most cases, splenomegaly. There may also be hepatomegaly. The blood count shows a haematocrit in the range 50-70%, with leucocytosis and an increased platelet count. The red cell mass, measured isotopically, is increased. The marrow is active but normoblastic. Serum uric acid and vitamin $B_{12}$ are usually raised.</p>

                        <h5>Management</h5>
                        <p>Treatment is with:</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li>venesection to reduce hyperviscosity</li>
                        <li>phosphorus-32 or an alkylating agent to reduce stem cell proliferation.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The aim is to reduce both the haematocrit and the platelet count. Life expectancy is reduced despite treatment, and the disease may transform into acute leukaemia or myelofibrosis.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Relative polycythaemia</h4>
                        <p>Relative polycythaemia is far more common than polycythaemia vera. It is a disorder often seen in middle-aged hypertensive men who drink and smoke too much. The primary abnormality is a reduced plasma volume. The aetiology is unknown.</p>
                        <p>Faced with an apparently polycythaemic patient:</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li>measure the haematocrit more than once to be sure the apparent erythrocytosis is not a cuffing artefact</li>
                        <li>consider the possibility of secondary polycythaemia, of which the common cause is chronic lung disease; measure the blood gases</li>
                        <li>check that the patient is truly polycythaemic (i.e. exclude relative polycythaemia) by measuring the red cell mass.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>If the patient has a leucocytosis, thrombocytosis or splenomegaly, the diagnosis is likely to be polycythaemia vera.</p>
