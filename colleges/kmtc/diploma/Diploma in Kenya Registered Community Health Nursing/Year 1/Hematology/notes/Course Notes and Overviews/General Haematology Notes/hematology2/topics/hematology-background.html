                        <p>The marrow is a large organ, approaching the size of the liver. In adults, most of it is in the flat bones, including the sternum, pelvis and vertebrae. White blood cell precursors form $75 \%$ of the marrow and most of the rest consists of erythroid precursors. Megakaryocytes (from which platelets are formed) are scattered throughout. It may seem surprising that so much of the marrow is devoted to the white cell series, given that there are 500 times as many red cells as white cells in the circulation. However, erythrocytes have a mean life of 120 days whereas white cells have a circulating lifespan measured in hours. Even in health, marrow is an extremely active tissue which is able to respond to sudden stresses like haemorrhage and infection. All blood cells are derived from multipotent, uncommitted stem cells. These differentiate into the lines of committed stem cells from which red cells, platelets, monocytes, granulocytes and lymphocytes are formed. The processes of differentiation and proliferation are controlled by growth factors, including interleukins, colony-stimulating factors and erythropoietin.</p>

                        <p><strong>Anaemia.</strong> The symptoms include:</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li>tiredness</li>
                        <li>breathlessness</li>
                        <li>chest pain</li>
                        <li>ankle swelling.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Tiredness is thought of as the classical symptom of anaemia but most tired people are not anaemic and some patients (particularly elderly ones) have few symptoms despite profound anaemia. This is usually because the anaemia has developed slowly and their lifestyle does not make heavy demands for oxygen. Apart from tiredness, impaired oxygen delivery causes breathlessness, light-headedness and faints. It worsens angina and can precipitate heart failure, especially if it is superimposed on coronary artery disease.</p>
                        <p><strong>Red cell excess (polycythaemia).</strong> The symptomatology is covered on page 266.</p>
                        <p><strong>Leucopenia.</strong> The symptoms of leucopenia include:</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li>mouth ulceration</li>
                        <li>infective symptoms.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Mouth ulceration must always be taken seriously in an at-risk patient. Infective symptoms occur with both neutropenia and lymphopenia.</p>
                        <p><strong>White cell excess (leukaemia and lymphoma).</strong> The symptomatology is relatively specific to individual diseases, which are covered on pages 267-273.</p>
                        <p><strong>Platelet/coagulation disease.</strong> Symptoms include:</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li>easy bruising</li>
                        <li>bleeding</li>
                        <li>thromboses.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Thrombocytopenia causes petechial haemorrhages and bruising. When it is severe, it also causes bleeding from the gums or into the gut. Impaired coagulation more commonly causes bleeding into soft tissues than overt external bleeding. Haemophilia may cause prolonged bleeding from minor injuries and surgery but often presents with bleeding into joints. Other hereditary clotting disorders are rare, apart from von Willebrand's disease, which most often causes skin and mucous membrane bleeding because the abnormality results in a defect of platelet function. Remember to ask about menorrhagia and bleeding problems after dental extractions and surgery. Thrombophilia (increased tendency to clot) causes recurrent venous and arterial thromboses.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">General history</h3>
                        <p>You should take a detailed drug history from every patient. Remember not just the prescription drugs but also medicines bought over the counter. Take a family history if the patient has haemolytic anaemia, a bleeding tendency or thrombophilia and construct a family tree if it is positive. Take a dietary and alcohol history. Note the length of history and take particular note if the symptoms suggest that more than one aspect of haematological function is affected (e.g. symptoms of infection, bruising and anaemia). Be alert to symptoms of systemic disease, such as weight loss, dyspepsia, change in bowel habit, night sweats and pruritus.</p>

                        <p>The physical signs of anaemia are extremely subjective. Examine the conjunctivae, which are less affected by variations in capillary blood flow than the skin or nail beds. Definite conjunctival pallor is</p>

                        <p>relatively specific for moderate-to-severe anaemia. Examine the sclerae carefully for jaundice (not detectable until serum bilirubin is raised to three times normal); it is present in haemolytic but not other types of anaemia. Look at the patient's face: a plethoric complexion with suffusion of the conjunctivae may be a sign of polycythaemia. Examine the abdomen for splenomegaly, which is a prominent feature of chronic extravascular haemolysis, and is a key finding in polycythaemia vera.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">White cell disorders</h3>
                        <p>Neutropenia should be considered in any patient with severe oral ulceration/candidiasis. Examination for lymphadenopathy requires skill, not just in knowing where and how to palpate but in interpreting the findings. If there are palpable lymph nodes, note:</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li>whether they are hard, firm or soft</li>
                        <li>whether they are tender or non-tender</li>
                        <li>their approximate size</li>
                        <li>whether they are mobile and discrete or matted together.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Axillary and inguinal lymphadenopathy is commonly found in normal people, particularly if they have a history of injury or infection. Pathological lymph nodes are larger, present in the neck and epitrochlear region of the elbow and sometimes coalescent or matted. Lymph nodes that are enlarged because of infection are smaller than those of lymphoma (usually less than 2 cm ) and more likely to be discrete. The distribution of lymphadenopathy in Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) is considered on page 271. Assess the size of the spleen and liver and search for para-aortic and pelvic nodes. Mild splenomegaly may be caused by an infection but moderate or massive splenomegaly suggests lymphoma, myelofibrosis or chronic leukaemia. Hepatomegaly may be found in myeloproliferative diseases. Tissue infiltration (particularly of the gums) occurs in some leukaemias.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Platelet and coagulation disorders</h3>
                        <p>Petechial haemorrhages are a sign of thrombocytopenia. They are characteristically seen first over the lower legs, where capillary pressure is highest. Later they become generalised, and may coalesce as bruises (ecchymoses); particularly over the arms. Inspect the gums for bleeding and the fundi for retinal haemorrhages, which should be taken very seriously as a sign of impending cerebral haemorrhage. Joint swelling caused by bleeding (haemarthrosis) is an important feature of haemophilia and other coagulation disorders.</p>
                        <p>Thrombocytosis and other hypercoagulable states have no specific physical signs other than those of arterial or venous thrombosis.</p>

                        <p>When you take blood, you can affect the result by:</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li>excessive cuffing: a prolonged increase in venous pressure artificially increases the haematocrit</li>
                        <li>being slow to put blood in the tube or not mixing it thoroughly: coagulation in the tube gives a falsely low platelet count and abnormal coagulation results.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Automated counters measure concentrations (per unit volume) of red cells, haemoglobin, platelets and leucocytes (lymphocytes, monocytes, neutrophils, eosinophils and basophils). They also measure the percentage of red cells present as reticulocytes (newly released cells) and calculate indices which describe the size of red cells and platelets and the degree of haemoglobinisation. Normal values for adults are shown in Table 1 (p. 7). In addition, a dried and stained blood film can be inspected to assess the morphology of the cells and detect abnormal cells. Some of the terms you will come across on blood film reports are given in Table 60.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Interpreting the haemoglobin and red cell indices</h3>
                        <p>Anaemia is diagnosed when there is a reduction in the concentration of haemoglobin caused by a reduced number of red cells or a reduced amount of haemoglobin within the cells. An increase in haemoglobin concentration resulting from an increased number of red cells per unit volume is termed erythrocytosis.</p>
                        <p>Whenever you are told that a patient is anaemic, you should ask for the mean cell volume (MCV), by which anaemias are classified (explained further on page 259). The cell counter also tells you how similar the red cells are to one another in size. This is expressed as the red cell distribution width (RDW). A low RDW signifies a normal, homogeneous population of cells. An increased RDW signifies heterogeneity in cell size as a result of:</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li>active haemopoiesis, because immature red cells (reticulocytes) are large</li>
                        <li>treatment of iron deficiency, resulting in a mixture of microcytic and normocytic cells</li>
                        <li>mixed deficiency, giving both small and large 'diseased' cells.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Reticulocytes can be counted automatically and are expressed as a percentage of the total red cell count.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">White cells and platelets</h3>
                        <p>Changes in cell counts are diagnosed by the automated counter. Examination of the film gives an accurate differential count and detects cells such as leukaemic blast cells. It also detects morphological changes such as the degree of lobulation of the neutrophil nuclei, which depends on their age. In infection, neutrophils are relatively immature and may appear as bands rather than with the normal multilobulated appearance; a 'left shift'. Conversely, the neutrophils are hypermature ('right shifted') in megaloblastic anaemia because vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ deficiency impairs haemopoiesis (p. 261). There may also be cytoplasmic abnormalities, e.g. vacuolation or heavy granulation of neutrophils during bacterial infection. Abnormalities of neutrophils, such as hypogranularity, are seen in myelodysplasia.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Platelets</h3>
                        <p>A simple platelet count is the clue to most platelet diseases.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Erythrocyte sedimentation rate</h3>
                        <p>The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is a very crude test which measures the rate (in $\mathrm{mm} / \mathrm{h}$ ) at which red cells sediment. Abnormal proteins in inflammatory conditions and myeloma cause rapid sedimentation. The ESR is, therefore, a non-specific marker of infection, inflammation and neoplasia. It may be non-specifically raised in anaemia and some non-inflammatory diseases such as uraemia. In some hospitals, blood viscosity or acute-phase proteins is measured as more reliable markers of inflammation.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Haematinics</h3>
                        <p>The blood count must always be checked before measuring haematinics because it is unlikely that a patient has significant iron, vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ or folate deficiency if the count is normal. An extremely high index of suspicion (e.g. suspected subacute combined degeneration of the cord, p. 236) would be needed to justify these extra measurements in the face of a normal blood count. Similarly, it is wasteful to measure serum iron or ferritin if the diagnosis of iron deficiency is obvious from the clinical context and blood count. With those provisos, measure:</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li>vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ and folate in patients with macrocytic anaemia</li>
                        <li>iron in patients with microcytosis</li>
                        <li>all three in a patient with anaemia and a normal MCV but a high RDW (to exclude a mixed deficiency).</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The diagnosis of iron, vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ and folate deficiencies are considered on pages 260 and 262.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Tests of coagulation and fibrinolysis</h3>
                        <p>These are discussed on page 276.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Bone marrow examination</h3>
                        <p>Bone marrow can be examined either as an aspirate from the sternum or iliac crest or as a trephine biopsy from the iliac crest. Marrow aspirate is useful for detailed cytology, cell counts and assessment of iron stores. Trephine biopsies are useful for judging cellularity, detecting tumour and diagnosing myelofibrosis (p. 271).</p>
                        <p>Remember that marrow examination is not infallible in detecting tumour deposits because they may be absent from the area sampled. Marrow aspiration is a painful procedure which should not be done without good indications. These include:</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li>to confirm iron deficiency or megaloblastic anaemia, if the diagnosis is in doubt or the patient does not respond to treatment</li>
                        <li>to investigate unexplained anaemia</li>
                        <li>to investigate suspected leukaemia, myeloma or other haematological malignancy</li>
                        <li>to monitor response to the treatment of leukaemia</li>
                        <li>to diagnose cancer, where there is circumstantial evidence of marrow involvement</li>
                        <li>to investigate agranulocytosis or thrombocytopenia</li>
                        <li>to stain and obtain cultures for suspected tuberculosis, histoplasmosis and leishmaniasis.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>In some conditions-notably myelofibrosis and malignant infiltration of the marrow-bone marrow aspiration may be unsuccessful. A 'dry tap' is pathological and of diagnostic value.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Lymph node biopsy</h3>
                        <p>Lymph node biopsy is the definitive investigation to diagnose lymphoma and identify its histological type. It is also used to diagnose disseminated cancer and other causes of lymphadenopathy. The features of lymph nodes that make them 'suspicious' are described on page 257, and other clinical features suggesting lymphoma are described on page 269. Which node should be biopsied is partly a surgical decision and partly determined by their 'feel'. Lymph node biopsies are usually taken under general anaesthesia. The specimen will be ruined for some analyses if it is put straight into formalin. It should be promptly handled by a skilled histology technician. Remember to request culture if tuberculosis is suspected.</p>
