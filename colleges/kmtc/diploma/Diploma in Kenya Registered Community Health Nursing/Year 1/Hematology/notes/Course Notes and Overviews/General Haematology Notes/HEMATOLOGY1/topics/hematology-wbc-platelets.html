                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p><em>Haemostasis: is a sequence of responses that stops bleeding. Damage of the vasculature quickly leads to massive bruising and, if unrepaired, leads to extreme blood loss and consequently organ failure. Haemostasis, the physiological processes that stop bleeding, is critical for human health. The coagulation system is remarkably complex in both structure and function. Many proteins are involved, produced by different cell types of the body, with both inactive and active forms regulated in a fine balance.</em></p>
                        <p>The coagulation system provides for immediate activation when there is blood loss that needs to be stemmed but also confines its activity to the site of blood loss. The haemostatic system includes blood platelets, endothelial cells, and plasma coagulation factors, which work together to rapidly form a haemostatic plug in an injured blood vessel.</p>
                        <p>Whenever a vessel is severed or ruptured, haemostasis is achieved by several mechanisms: (1) vascular constriction, (2) formation of a platelet plug, (3) formation of a blood clot as a result of blood coagulation, and (4) eventual growth of fibrous tissue into the blood clot to close the hole in the vessel permanently.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">1. Vascular constriction</h3>
                        <p>Immediately after a blood vessel has been cut or ruptured, the trauma to the vessel wall itself causes the smooth muscle in the wall to contract; this instantaneously reduces the flow of blood from the ruptured vessel. The contraction results from local myogenic spasm, local autacoid factors from the traumatized tissues and blood platelets, and lastly nervous reflexes.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">2. Formation of platelet plug</h3>
                        <p>If the cut in the blood vessel is very small-indeed, many very small vascular holes do develop throughout the body each day-the cut is often sealed by a platelet plug, rather than by a blood clot.</p>
                        <p>Platelet repair of vascular openings is based on several important functions of the platelet itself. When platelets come in contact with a damaged vascular surface, especially with collagen fibers in the vascular wall, the platelets themselves immediately change their own characteristics drastically. They begin to swell; they assume irregular forms with numerous irradiating pseudopods protruding from their surfaces; their contractile proteins contract forcefully and cause the release of granules that contain multiple active; they become sticky so that they adhere to collagen in the tissues and to a protein called von Willebrand factor that leaks into the traumatized tissue from the plasma; they secrete large quantities of ADP; and their enzymes form thromboxane A2. The ADP and thromboxane in turn act on nearby platelets to activate them as well, and the stickiness of these additional platelets causes them to adhere to the original activated platelets. Therefore, at the site of any opening in a blood vessel wall, the damaged vascular wall activates successively increasing numbers of platelets that themselves attract more and more additional platelets, thus forming a platelet plug. This is at first a loose plug, but it is usually successful in blocking blood loss if the vascular opening is small. Then, during the subsequent process of blood coagulation, fibrin threads form. These attach tightly to the platelets, thus constructing an unyielding plug.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">3. Clot formation</h3>
                        <p>The clot is composed of a meshwork of fibrin fibers running in all directions and entrapping blood cells, platelets, and plasma. The fibrin fibers also adhere to damaged surfaces of blood vessels; therefore, the blood clot becomes adherent to any vascular opening and thereby prevents further blood loss.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">4. Clot retraction</h3>
                        <p>Within a few minutes after a clot is formed, it begins to contract and usually expresses most of the fluid from the clot within 20 to 60 minutes. The fluid expressed is called serum because all its fibrinogen and most of the other clotting factors have been removed; in this way, serum differs from plasma. Serum cannot clot because it lacks these factors. Platelets are necessary for clot retraction to occur. Therefore, failure of clot retraction is an indication that the number of platelets in the circulating blood might be low. Furthermore, platelets entrapped in the clot continue to release pro-coagulants substances, one of the most important of which is fibrinstabilizing factor, which causes more and more cross-linking bonds between adjacent fibrin fibers. As the clot retracts, the edges of the broken blood vessel are pulled together, thus contributing still further to the ultimate state of haemostasis. Aspirin and other NSAIDs irreversibly inhibit platelet cyclo-oxygenase and impair platelet function. They inhibit vasoconstriction and platelet aggregation by blocking the synthesis of thromboxane A2.</p>
