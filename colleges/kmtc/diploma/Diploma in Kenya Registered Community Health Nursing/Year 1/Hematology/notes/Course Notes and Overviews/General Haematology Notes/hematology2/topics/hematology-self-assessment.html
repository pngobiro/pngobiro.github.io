                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Case history questions</h3>
                        <h4>Case history 1</h4>
                        <p>Your consultant is concerned that a 73-year-old man in atrial fibrillation is at risk of stroke and asks you to anticoagulate him. You are aware that the patient is vaguely confused and the nursing staff on the ward have received a telephone call from a neighbour stating that he has become increasingly reclusive. He has often been noted to be unsteady on his feet and has once been found lying in the road. At visiting time you have a chance to meet his wife to discuss the plan to use anticoagulation therapy and to give further information.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Suggest two important questions which you should ask</li>
                            <li>Name two haematological investigations which it would be appropriate to perform</li>
                            <li>Name two possible contraindications to anticoagulation in this case</li>
                            <li>If a decision were made to proceed with anticoagulation, describe two pieces of advice that you would give to the patient and his wife</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h4>Case history 2</h4>
                        <p>You are called on a Sunday to see a 63-year-old man with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and a fever of $38.6^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. He is in reverse barrier nursing because his total white cell count is $0.2 \times 10^{9} / \mathrm{I}$ and his platelets are $15 \times 10^{9} / \mathrm{I}$ despite daily platelet transfusions. He received intensive chemotherapy (fludarabine) 15 days previously and has been leukopenic for 7 days. You put on your gown, mask and gloves to examine the patient and find that he has no symptoms except those of the fever, mild headache, sweating and an uncomfortable feeling around his bottom.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Which of the following actions would be appropriate:
                                <ol type="a">
                                    <li>Order a chest X-ray</li>
                                    <li>Take a blood culture</li>
                                    <li>Do a blood count</li>
                                    <li>Do a digital rectal examination</li>
                                    <li>Start him on oral amoxycillin</li>
                                </ol>
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>The senior nurse on the ward encourages you to start him on the 'usual' antibiotics (ceftazidime and gentamicin). His fever is still elevated 6 hours later despite antibiotics and he looks more toxic. The consultant suggests that you add metronidazole to his regimen. Four days later you are also on call and are asked to see him again. He has had fever up to $38.3^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ for 4 days despite ceftazidime, gentamicin, metronidazole and 2 days of vancomycin. He now has a dry cough, in addition to a painful bottom.</p>
                        <ol start="2">
                            <li>What actions should you now take?
                                <ol type="a">
                                    <li>Look at his white cell and platelet counts from that morning</li>
                                    <li>Arrange for transfer to an intensive care unit (ITU)</li>
                                    <li>Examine him again carefully</li>
                                    <li>Treat him for a possible fungal infection</li>
                                    <li>Do blood cultures, including a fungal blood culture</li>
                                </ol>
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>On examination, you find crackles at the left base that do not clear on coughing and a black and red perianal area about 2 cm across with surrounding erythema.</p>
                        <ol start="3">
                            <li>Should you:

                                    <li>Speak to his consultant at home</li>
                                    <li>Arrange a chest X-ray</li>
                                    <li>Arrange an induced sputum</li>
                                    <li>Call the physiotherapist in</li>
                                    <li>Arrange for a special mattress to help his developing pressure sore</li>
                                </ol>
                            </li>
                            <li>Give a differential diagnosis and your thoughts on management</li>

                                    <li>True. Because hepatocellular dysfunction impairs the synthesis of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors.</li>

                                    <li>False. Vitamin K reverses the action of warfarin; protamine reverses heparin action.</li>

FDPs are raised by massive intravascular fibrin formation, as in disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and may be increased in thrombotic conditions but are not sensitive or specific enough to be a useful diagnostic test.

                        <ol>
                            <li>Whilst anticoagulation is indicated to prevent cerebral embolism in patients with atrial fibrillation, you must not initiate it unless you are sure it will be safe. Age, in itself, is not a contraindication, but there are aspects of the history which suggest there are other contraindications. There are strong hints that he may be abusing alcohol. The confusion is worrying because someone who is having falls and becomes confused could have a subdural haematoma, which is an absolute contraindication to anticoagulation. You should ask about:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>his alcohol intake</li>
                                    <li>dyspepsia or history of blood loss</li>
                                    <li>his likelihood of taking tablets and attending for anticoagulant monitoring reliably.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>You should measure his prothrombin time before starting anticoagulants; autoanticoagulation is common and would affect your choice of loading dose. It would also increase your anxiety about the possibility of alcohol abuse (prolonging the PT by causing hepatocellular damage). You should also check the haemoglobin concentration; anaemia would be a relative contraindication to anticoagulation or should, at least, be investigated before anticoagulation.</li>

                                    <li>False. Unnecessary if done that morning, which it will have been to see whether platelet transfusions were required.</li>
                                    <li>False. You must inspect his anal area as he has a symptom there, but a formal rectal examination is not appropriate as it may cause bacteraemia.</li>
                                    <li>False. Not appropriate; i.v. therapy required with broader coverage.</li>

                                    <li>True. Always true in this group of patients. Especially mouth, chest, skin and rectal area (p. 268).</li>
                                    <li>True. Candidaemia or invasive aspergillosis are now more likely. This group of patients with persistent fever during neutropenia have a $30 \%$ mortality, mostly as a result of fungal infection.</li>
                                    <li>True. It is always worth repeating blood cultures, even though he is on antibiotics, as these patients get breakthrough bacteraemia.</li>

                                    <li>False. His lesion is almost certainly not a pressure sore but a developing infection called icthyma gangrenosum (Pseudomonas aeruginosa).</li>

                            <li>He probably has two focal infections: one in his lungs and the other perirectally. The perirectal infection is likely to be caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, other bacteria including anaerobes, Aspergillus or mucormycosis. His lung disease may be caused by any of these or other bacteria or possibly Pneumocystis. He needs large doses of antifungals (amphotericin), a CT scan of the lung, which is helpful diagnostically, bronchoscopy, with lavage, to obtain material for microscopy and culture, and a biopsy of his rectal lesion, all as soon as possible.</li>

                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Patient A.</strong> This is a fairly typical picture of megaloblastic anaemia caused by vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ or folate deficiency with severe macrocytosis, leucopenia and thrombocytopenia; hypersegmented neutrophils on the blood film would confirm the diagnosis, as would bone marrow aspiration although this is not done as a routine. Haematinics should be measured.</li>
                            <li><strong>Patient B.</strong> This is a moderately severe microcytic anaemia (the differential diagnosis is given on p. 260). Iron deficiency is the most likely cause. The leucocytosis may be caused by infection or inflammation but could signify acute or subacute blood loss, a possible cause for the iron deficiency.</li>
                            <li><strong>Patient C.</strong> There is erythrocytosis, thrombocytosis and leucocytosis, suggestive of polycythaemia vera. The red cell mass is likely to be increased and splenomegaly may be present.</li>
                            <li><strong>Patient D.</strong> There is a normocytic anaemia with normal white cell and platelet counts. This would be typical of the anaemia of chronic disease (e.g. renal failure) but could also be caused by a mixed deficiency. This would be suggested by an increased: red cell distribution width (RDW) and a 'dimorphic' blood film. You should examine and investigate the patient for an underlying disease.</li>
                            <li><strong>Patient E.</strong> Here, there is a normochromic anaemia with mild thrombocytopenia, but the striking abnormality is the marked leucocytosis; this is typical of a chronic leukaemia. A differential white cell count and blood film would be crucial.</li>
                            <li><strong>Patient F.</strong> This shows moderate pancytopenia and could be seen in a patient with acute leukaemia, hypoplastic anaemia or after chemotherapy (see p. 262 for a fuller list of causes).</li>
                            <li>Prolongation of the prothrombin time may be caused by warfarin, consumption of clotting factors as in DIC, vitamin K deficiency or deficiency of the vitamin K-dependent clotting factors owing to liver disease. At 48 hours after a massive paracetamol overdose is about the time when hepatocellular damage becomes apparent, and the prothrombin time is quite a sensitive test for this. The likely diagnosis is acute hepatocellular necrosis caused by paracetamol.</li>
                            <li>An extremely high ESR is usually caused by multiple myeloma, giant cell arteritis or chronic/severe infection/inflammation. This patient also has a moderate normochromic anaemia. Multiple myeloma is a likely diagnosis. Renal failure and hypercalcaemia are common in myeloma. You should measure plasma urea, creatinine and calcium. The definitive diagnosis is made by plasma and urine immunoelectrophoresis, bone marrow examination and skeletal survey.</li>

                                    <li>Hypercalcaemia is a common cause of acute renal failure in multiple myeloma. Volume depletion is an important and reversible effect of hypercalcaemia. 'Myeloma kidney' may cause renal failure without hypercalcaemia. This is because of tubular damage by the paraprotein, secondary hyperuricaemia, amyloidosis and infection.</li>
                                    <li>With the history given, you should immediately measure serum calcium. You should also arrange serum and urine immunoelectrophoresis to identify a paraprotein but that is not an emergency investigation.</li>
                                    <li>You should assess the patient's volume status, using a central venous pressure line if necessary, and give saline to increase urinary calcium excretion.

                                    <li>There is a large soft tissue attenuation mass within the mediastinum abutting the trachea and aortic arch and compressing the superior vena cava (which cannot be seen). This is almost certainly a large lymph node mass.</li>

The combination with mediastinal lymphadenopathy makes the diagnosis of Hodgkin's by far the most likely diagnosis. Other causes of a mediastinal soft tissue mass include non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (not associated with alcohol-related pain) or sarcoidosis (the second most likely possibility in this case). Unlikely causes are tuberculosis, retrosternal thyroid (unlikely), thymic tumour, dermoid or lung cancer nodes (especially small cell).</li>

                            <li>Aplastic anaemia usually affects the red cells, white cells and platelets. Patients are anaemic, thrombocytopenic and neutropenic. The anaemia may be symptomatic; it may precipitate symptoms of coronary, cerebrovascular or peripheral vascular ischaemia and may cause heart failure. Thrombocytopenia may cause purpura, bruising and - in severe cases - mucosal or GI bleeding or cerebral haemorrhage. Neutropenia causes mouth ulceration, perineal infection and susceptibility to opportunistic infection. Anaemia is treated with periodic blood transfusions. Platelet transfusions are given if the patient is severely thrombocytopenic and at risk of haemorrhage. Granulocyte transfusions are relatively ineffective and so the treatment of neutropenia is prophylaxis against infection and aggressive treatment of the earliest signs of it.</li>
                            <li>The choice of antiplatelet or anticoagulation therapy depends upon the pathophysiology of the disease (see p. 275).</li>

                            <li><strong>3.</strong> The dry tap suggests myelofibrosis and splenomegaly is characteristic.</li>
                            <li><strong>1.</strong> This patient has ' B ' symptoms and pathological lymphadenopathy; the fact that it is in adjacent areas (on only one side of the diaphragm) suggests Hodgkin's disease.</li>
                            <li><strong>4.</strong> The Philadelphia chromosome is pathognomonic of chronic granulocytic leukaemia</li>
                            <li><strong>6.</strong> Either thalassaemia trait or chronic disease could also give a microcytic anaemia, but the clinical details strongly favour iron deficiency</li>
                            <li><strong>13.</strong> Of course there are many causes of renal failure, but the heading makes it clear that you should be making a haematological diagnosis; myeloma is the haematological disease most closely associated with renal failure.</li>

                            <li><strong>5.</strong> TIAs are caused by platelet emboli so aspirin is the treatment of choice.</li>
                            <li><strong>8.</strong> Fibrinolytic therapy is of no proven value, and may cause him to bleed into the fracture site. He will certainly need to take warfarin but must be treated with heparin first. Clinical trials consistently show low-molecular-weight heparin to be superior to unfractionated heparin so that should be your choice.</li>
                            <li><strong>8,5.</strong> Either aspirin or heparin would be correct, but low-molecular-weight heparin is the better answer.</li>
                            <li><strong>6 or 4.</strong> Unlike carotid TIAs, arterial thromboembolism from cardiac clot should be treated with warfarin (or sinthrone, although it is less commonly used). Depending on your perception of the danger of recurrence, you might give heparin, but medium-to-long term warfarin is the mainstay of preventing recurrence.</li>
                            <li><strong>5.</strong> Warfarin is indicated for preventing cerebral embolism in atrial fibrillation unless there are contraindications. Age, falls and concern about this patient's ability to care for himself are relative contraindications. Depending on likely compliance, you might prescribe aspirin.</li>

                        <p>Do not waffle on about 'taking a history' because your instruction is clear and do not attempt to perform a 'general' physical examination. You must use your knowledge to focus the examination on examining:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>all possible sites of lymphadenopathy: the epitrochlear region of the elbow, neck, axillae, and groins</li>
                            <li>the abdomen for para-aortic nodes (by deep palpation), hepatomegaly and splenomegaly</li>
                            <li>the conjunctivae for anaemia.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>It is reasonable to examine the chest if you have time, but make less of a play of this than the parts of the examination listed above because chest examination may well be normal, and these other features will be much more informative, whether negative or positive.</p>
                        <p>The character and distribution of the nodes are both important; see page 257.</p>
