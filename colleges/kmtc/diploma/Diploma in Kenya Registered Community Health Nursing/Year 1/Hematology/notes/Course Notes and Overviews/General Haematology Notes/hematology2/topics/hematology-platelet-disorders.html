                        <p>The role of platelets is to 'plug' defects in damaged vessels, initiate coagulation and promote healing. They:</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li>adhere to the vessel wall</li>
                        <li>become activated</li>
                        <li>degranulate</li>
                        <li>aggregate.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>This can best be thought of as a cascade process, which becomes self-perpetuating as they activate one another.</p>
                        <p>The cascade may be triggered by:</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li>damage to the vessel wall, which exposes platelets to collagen and von Willebrand factor (vWF)</li>
                        <li>blood coagulation, which leads to thrombin formation</li>
                        <li>the activation of other platelets, which causes discharge of ADP, thromboxane $\mathrm{A}_{2}$ and plateletderived growth factor</li>
                        <li>inflammation, which leads to release of plateletactivating factor from neutrophils and monocytes.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The process of adherence and aggregation is promoted by the prostaglandin thromboxane $\mathrm{A}_{2}$. This is derived from arachidonic acid within platelets and held in check by prostacyclin, which is synthesised from arachidonic acid in the endothelium.</p>
                        <p>Adherence leads to platelet degranulation. The contents of the granules attract other platelets, cause platelet aggregation and trigger blood coagulation. Uncontrolled platelet adhesion and thrombosis are prevented by secretion of prostacyclin and activation of protein C (p. 275) from adjacent healthy endothelium.</p>
                        <p>Platelet numbers can easily be measured with an automated counter. Their function can be assessed crudely by measuring how long a patient bleeds after 'nicking' the skin (bleeding time) and more accurately by platelet aggregation tests in the laboratory.</p>
                        <p>Conceptually, platelet disorders are straightforward. Patients may have too many or too few platelets or platelets that do not work properly. Changes in platelet number are caused by increased or reduced thrombopoiesis or platelet consumption. Moderate thrombocytopenia (e.g. count $<50 \times 10^{9}$ cells $/ \mathrm{l}$ ) or decreased platelet function may result in easy bruising. Severe thrombocytopenia (e.g. count $<10 \times 10^{9}$ cells/l) can cause mucosal or intracerebral haemorrhage, in which case urgent platelet transfusion is indicated. Transfused platelets have such a short life that transfusions may need to be repeated daily. Thrombocytosis or increased platelet activity raise the coagulability of blood, causing arterial and venous thromboses. Thrombocytosis is treated with antiplatelet drugs or chemotherapy.</p>

                        <p>Decreased platelet production is usually caused by one of the major haematological diseases or its treatment. Other causes include:</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li>bone marrow infiltration</li>

                        </ul>
                        <p>Increased platelet loss may be caused by:</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li>increased activity of the spleen causing 'sequestration' of platelets</li>
                        <li>entrapment of platelets in fibrin deposited in small vessels (see DIC, p. 279)</li>
                        <li>immunity or autoimmunity.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The two immune mechanisms of platelet destruction are:</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li>antibodies formed against platelet antigens</li>
                        <li>antigen-antibody complexes (e.g. precipitated by a drug), which bind to platelets and accelerate their destruction.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Idiopathic (immune) thrombocytopenic purpura, marrow suppression and DIC are the most important conditions to know about.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura</h3>
                        <p>Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura may occur acutely, often in infants or young adults, sometimes soon after a viral infection and with a self-limited course. It may also have a less acute presentation, typically in a young adult or middle-aged woman, and a chronic course.</p>
                        <p>The presentation is with purpura and bleeding, which may be severe. In its subacute form, it may be a chance laboratory finding. The disease is frequently benign but may lead to serious bleeding, such as GI haemorrhage, or (rarely) to cerebral haemorrhage. Platelet antibodies can be demonstrated in some patients and the marrow is active, signifying compensatory thrombopoiesis. Steroids or high-dose immunoglobulin infusions may be used. In the chronic form, steroid therapy may induce a lasting remission. If it does not and thrombocytopenia is severe, splenectomy may be effective by removing the site of platelet destruction.</p>

                        <p>Thrombocytosis may result from decreased platelet consumption after splenectomy, although it is usually only transient. Increased production may be secondary to any marrow stimulus such as bleeding, haemolysis surgery or as a reaction to inflammation or malignancy. The one primary disease is essential thrombocythaemia, an uncommon myeloproliferative disease characterised by increased numbers of variably active platelets. As has been explained above, patients may either develop arterial/venous thromboses or bleed. It is characteristically a disease of middle or old age. As well as thrombocytosis, there may be normocytic anaemia and leucocytosis (caused by myeloproliferation) and either splenomegaly or hyposplenism owing to splenic infarction. The marrow shows megakaryocyte proliferation with other myeloproliferative features. Treatment is with antiplatelet drugs or chemotherapy. Leukaemic transformation or myelofibrosis may be late complications.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Particularly in ischaemic heart disease and transient ischaemic attacks, antiplatelet therapy is of proven value in preventing arterial thromboses. It may also protect against venous thrombo-embolism. Aspirin is the most effective drug. It works by irreversible inhibition of cyclo-oxygenase, the key enzyme in prostaglandin synthesis. Since cyclo-oxygenase inhibition prevents synthesis of endothelial prostacyclin as well as platelet thromboxane, aspirin has prothrombotic as well as antithrombotic effects. These effects are dose related and the balance can be shifted towards antithrombosis by giving lower doses. The main side-effects are dyspepsia, peptic ulceration and GI haemorrhage. Other platelet inhibitors such as sulfinpyrazone and dipyridamole may also be used but there is less evidence that they are clinically effective. Platelet glycoprotein receptor antagonists are a new class of drug currently undergoing controlled clinical trial for treatment of cardiovascular disease.</p>
                        <p>Whether antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy is more appropriate depends on the pathophysiology of the disease in question: platelet activation is central to the arterial thrombo-embolism of cerebrovascular (p. 225) and ischaemic heart disease (p. 14), so aspirin is the treatment of choice to prevent them. Intracardiac thrombosis and venous thrombo-embolism are more dependent on the coagulation pathways and are, therefore, treated with anticoagulants.</p>
