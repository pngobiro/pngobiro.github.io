They are filled with hemoglobin which enables them to carry oxygen from the lung to body tissues and then carry carbon dioxide from the tissues to the lungs.</li>
                            <li><strong>WBC (Leukocytes)</strong> they are fewer in no. compared to the RBC to the ratio of about 1:660 (WBC: RBC). There are 5 main types:

                                    <li><strong>Neutrophils:</strong> (granulocytes) they contain enzyme-filled granules. Are the most prevalent white blood cell type. They protect the body against bacterial and fungal infections and ingest foreign debris. Two types are band (immature) and segmented (mature).</li>
                                    <li><strong>Lymphocytes:</strong> T- lymphocytes which help protect against viral infections and can detect and destroy some cancer cells. B-lymphocytes which develop into cells that produce antibodies.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Monocytes:</strong> ingest dead or damaged cells and provide immunologic defenses to many infective organisms.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Eosinophils:</strong> kill parasites, destroy cancer cells and are involved in allergic responses.</li>

                            <li><strong>Platelets (thrombocytes)</strong> are cell-like particles smaller than red or white blood cells. They help in stopping bleeding. They gather at a bleeding where they are activated. Once activated they become sticky and clamp together to form a plug that helps seal the blood vessel and stop bleeding. They release substance that helps promote clotting.</li>

                        In early foetal life, blood is synthesized in several tissues such as the liver, spleen, thymus and the lymph nodes. Later, before birth, formation of blood starts in the bone marrow. At birth, blood formation takes place in every bone. In adult life, $RBC$ production is confined to the end of long bones (red bone marrow) and also to the flat bones e.g. Ribs, iliac bones, sternum, vertebrae and some white blood cells are produced in lymphatic tissues (lymph nodes and spleen and the thymus)<br>
                        All peripheral blood cells are derived from a single stem cell- the Primitive cells.</p>

                        Pronormoblasts develop into a basophilic normoblast. This is where haemoglobin synthesis begins. The basophilic normoblast further develops into reticulocytes.<br>
                        The reticulocytes nucleus is lost & the cell is usually small in size. It then matures into an adult blood cell within three days. After which there is mature $RBC$ in circulation. (Erythrocyte)<br>
                        The red blood cell has no nucleus. Its shape is a biconcave disc. They contain the protein hemoglobin which gives them the ability to carry oxygen.<br>
                        <strong>N.B:</strong> Normal reticulocyte count in the blood stream is usually less than $2 \%$.<br>
                        A high reticulocyte count in circulation suggests increase in formation; as it happens in excessive haemolysis.</p>

                        Hormones - androgen, for formation of the $RBC$.<br>
                        Low oxygen levels in the body increase the RBC production by increasing the formation of glycoprotein, erythropoietin by the kidneys, erythropoietin stimulates the RBM to produce more RBC. When oxygen levels in the blood decreases the production of erythropoietin increases which increase RBC production. The increased NO. of RBC leads to increased oxygen transportation and delivery of oxygen to the tissues. Later the erythropoietin production reduces thus production reduces and vice versa. Life span 120 days then they die.</p>
