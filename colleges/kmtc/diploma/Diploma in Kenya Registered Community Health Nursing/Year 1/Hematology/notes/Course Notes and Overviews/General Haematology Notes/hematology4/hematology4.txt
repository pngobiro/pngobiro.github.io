\section*{Hematological History \\ }

ID: background: Mediterranean, Asian, black (thalassemia), black (sickle cell)
presenting symptom \& HPI: depend on how rapidly the anemia develops
- fatigue, malaise, weakness, palpitations, syncope, dyspnea, headache, vertigo, tinnitus
PMH: past anemias, therapies, past blood loss (GI/GU), blood donation history, menstrual history, signs/symptoms of renal, liver, endocrine disturbances, AIDS and other chronic diseases, malignancies
family Hx: important in hereditary anemia; ask about anemia, jaundice, gallbladder disease, splenectomy
medications: drugs may cause aplasia, macrocytic/megaloblastic states, hemolysis, blood loss
diet: iron, folic acid, vitamin B12 supplementation: amount, frequency, duration, reason
alcohol consumption: quantify amount and duration (toxic effect on bone marrow or anemia due to liver disease)

\section*{Physical Exam}
HEENT: pallor: mucous membranes, conjunctivae ( $\mathrm{Hb}<90 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{L}$ ) , icterus, cervical lymphadenopathy, ocular bruits ( $\mathrm{Hb}<55 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{L}$ ), glossitis

skin: pallor, jaundice, skin creases ( $\mathrm{Hb}<75 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{L}$ ), telangiectasia as in hemolytic
anemia, koilonychia (spoon-shaped nails) as in iron deficiency anemia

\section*{IRON METABOLISM}

\section*{IRON INTAKE (Dietary)}
"average" Canadian adult diet $=10-20 \mathrm{mg} \mathrm{Fe} /$ day
$\square$ absorption $=5-10 \%$ ( $0.5-2 \mathrm{mg} /$ day )
$\square$ males have a positive Fe balance
$\square$ menstruating females have a negative Fe balance

\section*{PHYSIOLOGIC CAUSES OF INCREASED FE REQUIREMENTS}
infancy-growth spurt
menstruation/growth
puberty-growth spurt, menarche
pregnancy-maternal RBC, fetus

\end{tabular} & \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\section*{IRON TRANSPORT}
majority of non-heme Fe in plasma is bound to transferrin
$\square$ transferrin
- beta-globulin
- carries Fe from mucosal cell to RBC precursors in marrow
- carries Fe from storage pool in hepatocytes and macrophages to RBC precursors in marrow

\section*{IRON STORAGE}
Fe is stored in two forms: ferritin and hemosiderin
ferritin
- ferric Fe complexed to a protein called apoferritin
- hepatocytes are main site of ferritin storage
- minute quantities are present in plasma in equilibrium with intracellular ferritin
hemosiderin
- aggregates or crystals of ferritin with the apoferritin partially removed
- macrophage-monocyte system is main source of hemosiderin storage

\section*{IRON INDICES}
bone marrow aspirate is the gold standard test for iron stores
serum ferritin
- single most important blood test for iron stores
- falsely elevated in inflammatory disease, liver disease (from necrotic hepatocytes), neoplasm and hyperthyroidism
serum iron
- varies significantly daily
- a measure of all non-heme Fe present in blood
- virtually all serum iron is bound to transferrin
- only a trace of serum Fe is free or complexed in ferritin
total iron binding capacity (TIBC)
- high specificity for decreased iron, low sensitivity
- measure of total amount of transferrin present in blood
- normally, one third of the TIBC is saturated with Fe , remainder is unsaturated
saturation
- serum Fe divided by TIBC, expressed as a proportion or a $\%$

\section*{INTERPRETING IRON INDICES}

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|l|l|}
\hline \multicolumn{6}{|l|}{Table 4. Interpreting Iron Indices} \\
\hline & Ferritin & Serum Iron & TIBC & RDW & Saturation \\
\hline Iron Deficiency & $\downarrow \downarrow$ & $\downarrow$ & $\uparrow$ & $\uparrow$ & $\downarrow \downarrow$ \\
\hline Chronic Disease & $\uparrow / \mathrm{N}$ & $\downarrow / \mathrm{N}$ & $\downarrow / \mathrm{N}$ & N & N \\
\hline Sideroblastic Anemia & $\uparrow$ & $\uparrow$ & N & No (dimophic picture) & - \\
\hline Iron Overload & $\uparrow$ & $\uparrow$ & N & - & $\uparrow$ \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\section*{IRON METABOLISM ... CONT.}

\section*{LABORATORY FEATURES}
$\square$ Fe stores diminished
- decreased stainable iron in marrow
- serum ferritin decreased
Fe stores absent (in order of increasing Fe deficiency)
- serum Fe falls
- TIBC increases
- hemoglobin falls
- microcytosis (Hb levels of $100-110 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{L}$ or $10-11 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dL}$ )
- hypochromia (Hb $90-100 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{L}$ or $9-10 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dL}$ )

\section*{IRON DEFICIENCY}
most common cause of anemia in Canada
imbalance of intake vs. requirements or loss
may indicate the presence of serious GI disease

\section*{PHYSIOLOGIC CAUSES}
increased need for iron in the body

\section*{PATHOLOGIC CAUSES}
in adult males and post-menopausal females, Fe deficiency is usually related to chronic blood loss
dietary deficiencies (rarely the only etiology)
- cow's milk (infant diet)
- "tea and toast" (elderly)
absorption imbalances
- post-gastrectomy
- malabsorption
hemorrhage
- obvious causes - menorrhagia
- occult - peptic ulcer disease, aspirin, GI tract cancer
intravascular hemolysis
- hemoglobinuria
- hemosiderinuria
- cardiac valve RBC fragmentation

\section*{CLINICAL PRESENTATION}
iron deficiency may cause fatigue before clinical anemia develops
brittle hair
dysphagia (esophageal web, Plummer-Vinson ring)
nails
- brittle
- koilonychia
glossitis
angular stomatitis
pica (appetite for bizarre substances e.g. ice, paint, dirt)

\section*{DIAGNOSIS}
major diagnostic difficulty is to distinguish from anemia of chronic disease
serum
- ferritin $<20$ is diagnostic of iron deficiency anemia
- iron deficiency anemia unlikely if ferritin > 22-322
- platelet count may be elevated
peripheral blood film (see Colour Atlas H3)
- hypochromic microcytosis: RBCs are under hemoglobinized due to lack of Fe
- pencil forms
- target cells (thin)
bone marrow
- intermediate and late erythroblasts show micronormoblastic maturation
- Fe stain (Prussian blue) shows decreased iron in macrophages
- decreased normal sideroblasts

\section*{TREATMENT}
treat the underlying cause
different preparations available: tablets, syrup, parenteral (if malabsorption)
dose: ferrous sulphate 325 mg PO TID or ferrous gluconate 300 mg PO TID until anemia corrects and then for 3 months after

\section*{IRON DEFICIENCY ...cont.}

\section*{RECOVERY TIME}

acquired
- primary
- may be a preleukemic phenomenon (10\%)
- secondary
- toxins

$\square$ diagnosis
- serum: Hb normal
- peripheral blood: normal except for possibly a few target cells
- Hb electrophoresis (confirmatory test): Hb A fraction of 0.65 (65\%);
- Hb S fraction of 0.35 (35\%)

\section*{Homozygous: Hb S Disease}
$\square$ clinical presentation
- chronic hemolytic anemia
- jaundice in the first year of life
- vaso-occlusive crises (infarction) leading to pain, fever and leukocytosis e.g. acute chest syndrome (pulmonary infarct) associated with infection, such as parvovirus, leading to aplastic anemia, acidosis, dehydration, and hypoxia
- susceptibility to infections by encapsulated organisms due to hyposplenism
- retarded growth and development +/- skeletal changes
- spleen enlarged in child and atrophic in adult
$\square$ diagnosis
- peripheral blood: sickled cells (see Colour Atlas H6)
- screening test: sickle cell prep

\section*{Management}
prevention of crises is the key
- establish diagnosis
- avoid conditions that favor sickling (hypoxia, acidosis, dehydration, fever)
- vaccination in childhood e.g. pneumococcus, meningococcus
- consider prophylaxis - penicillin V 250 mg PO bid
- good hygiene and nutrition
genetic counselling
folic acid to avoid folate deficiency

\section*{HEMOGLOBIN AND HEMOGLOBINOPATHIES ...cont.}
hydroxyurea to enhance production of HbF
- causes depression of the gene for HbF or by initiating differentiation of stem cells in which this gene is active; presence of HbF in the SS cells decreases polymerization and precipitation of HbS
- Note: hydroxyurea is cytotoxic and may cause bone marrow suppression

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}

\end{tabular}

\section*{Treatment of Vaso-Occlusive Crisis}
oxygen
hydration (reduces viscosity)
antimicrobials
correct acidosis
analgesics/narcotics (give enough)
magnesium (inhibits potassium and water efflux from RBCs thereby preventing dehydration)
exchange transfusion for CNS crisis
experimental anti-sickling agents

\section*{MEGALOBLASTIC ANEMIA}
failure of DNA synthesis resulting in asynchronous maturation of RBC nucleus and cytoplasm
non-megaloblastic anemia reflects membrane abnormality with abnormal cholesterol metabolism
megaloblast = large, nucleated RBC precursor; macrocyte = large RBC

\section*{Causes of Megaloblastosis}
folate deficiency (seen after 4 months of decreased intake)
B12 deficiency (seen after 10-15 years decreased intake)
antimetabolite drugs
- methotrexate
- folate analogues (sulpha drugs)
- purine/pyrimidine analogues (6-MP, 5-FU)
nitrous oxide
myelodysplasia/some cases of AML

\section*{B12 DEFICIENCY}

\section*{Etiology}
if intake stops abruptly body stores last 3-4 years
diet
- strict vegetarian (rare)
gastric
- mucosal atrophy of pernicious anemia
- post-gastrectomy
intestinal absorption
- malabsorption (e.g. Crohn's, celiac sprue, pancreatic disease)
- stagnant bowel (e.g. blind loop, stricture)
- fish tapeworm
- resection of ileum as in Crohn's and celiac sprue
rare genetic causes

\section*{HEMOGLOBIN AND HEMOGLOBINOPATHIES ...cont.}

\section*{Pernicious Anemia}
auto-antibodies produced against gastric parietal cells leading to achlorhydria and no intrinsic factor secretion
- intrinsic factor is required to stabilize $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ as it passes through the bowel
- decreased intrinsic factor leads to decreased ileal absorption of $\mathrm{B}_{12}$
female:male = 1.6:1
may be associated with other autoimmune disorders e.g. thyroid and adrenal deficiency often > 60 years old

\section*{Neurological Lesions in B12 Deficiency}
cerebral (common; reversible with B12 therapy)
- confusion
- delirium
- dementia
cranial nerves
- optic atrophy (rare)
cord (irreversible damage)
- subacute combined degeneration
- posterior columns - paresthesias, disturbed vibration, decreased proprioception
- pyramidal tracts - spastic weakness, hyperactive reflexes
peripheral neuropathy (variable reversibility)
- usually symmetrical
- affecting lower limbs more than upper limbs

\section*{Diagnosis \\  \\ serum}
- anemia often severe +/- neutropenia +/- thrombocytopenia
- MCV > 120
- low reticulocyte count relative to the degree of anemia
serum B12 and RBC folate
- caution: low serum $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ leads to low RBC folate because of failure of folate polyglutamate synthesis in the absence of $\mathrm{B}_{12}$
blood film
- oval macrocytes (see Colour Atlas H2A)
- hypersegmented neutrophils (see Colour Atlas H2B)
bone marrow
- differentiates between megaloblastic and myelodysplastic anemias
- hypercellularity
- failure of nuclear maturation
- elevated unconjugated bilirubin and LDH due to marrow cell breakdown
Schilling test to distinguish pernicious anemia from other causes
- Schilling test: part 1
- tracer dose ( $1 \mathrm{~g} \mu \mathrm{~g}$ ) of labelled $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ (cobalamin (Co*)), PO
- flushing dose ( 1 mg ) of cold $\mathrm{B}_{12}$, IM to saturate tissue binders of $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ thus allowing radioactive $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ to be excreted in urine
- 24 hour urine Co* measured

- Schilling test: part 2
- tracer dose $\mathrm{B}_{12}\left(\mathrm{Co}^{*}\right)$ plus intrinsic factor, PO
- flushing dose of cold B12, injected IM

- abnormal test result (< 5\% excretion) = intestinal causes (malabsorption)

\section*{Management}
$\mathrm{B}_{12} 100 \mu \mathrm{~g}$ IM monthly for life or oral Bı2
watch for hypokalemia (due to return of potassium to intracellular sites) and thrombocythemia

\section*{FOLATE DEFICIENCY}
$\square$ more common than B12 deficiency because folate stores are depleted in 3-6 months
folate complexes with gastric R binder
$\square \mathrm{R}$ binder is replaced by intrinsic factor in the duodenum
$\square$ this complex is absorbed in the jejunum

\section*{Etiology}
$\square$ diet (folate is present in leafy green vegetables)
- most common cause
- e.g. infancy, poverty, alcoholism
intestinal
- malabsorption

\section*{HEMOSTASIS}

\section*{THREE PHASES OF HEMOSTASIS}

\section*{Primary Hemostasis}
$\square$ goal is to rapidly stop bleeding
$\square$ vessel injury results in collagen and subendothelial structure exposure and release of vasoconstrictors
$\square$ blood flow is impeded and platelets come in contact with vessel wall
$\square$ platelets adhere to collagen and are activated resulting in change of shape and release of ADP and thromboxane A2
$\square$ these factors further recruit and aggregate more platelets resulting in formation of hemostatic plug

\section*{Secondary Hemostasis}
$\square$ platelet plug formed through primary hemostasis is reinforced through process of secondary hemostasis and a stable plug is formed
$\square$ secondary pathways involved in the activation of coagulation factors include
- intrinsic

Clinical Presentation
$\square$ hemarthroses, hematomas, GI and GU bleeding
$\square$ bleeding in response to trauma (mild and moderate disease)
- intracranial hemorrhage following head injury
$\square$ spontaneous bleeding (severe disease)
Laboratory Results
$\square$ prolonged PTT, normal INR (PT)
decreased factor VIII (< 40\% of normal)
$\square$ vWF usually normal or increased
Management
$\square$ minor but not trivial bleeding (eg. hemarthroses)

$\square$ major potentially life-threatening bleeding (eg. multiple trauma)
- heat treated Factor VIII concentrate
$\square$ prophylaxis (eg. multiple dental extractions, surgery)

$\square$ DDAVP in mild or moderate hemophilia A

\section*{II. Von Willebrand's Disease}
$\square$ heterogeneous group of defects
$\square$ usually autosomal dominant
$\square$ qualitative or quantitative abnormality of vWF
- vWF needed for platelet adhesion and acts as carrier for factor VIII
- vWF exists as a series of multimers ranging in size
- the largest ones are most active in mediation of platelet adhesion
- both large and small complex with factor VIII
both primary and secondary hemostasis affected
usually mild to moderate in severity

\section*{Classification}
$\square$ type I: decreased vWF in platelets and plasma (will see prolonged
bleeding time, decreased factor VIII)
$\square$ type IIA: decreased large and intermediate sized multimers in plasma and
platelets (will see prolonged bleeding time, normal levels of factor VIII)
$\square$ type IIB: largest multimers are missing from plasma but not from platelets

\section*{Clinical Presentation}
$\square$ mild
- asymptomatic
- mucosal and cutaneous bleeding, easy bruising, epistaxis, menorrhagia, gingival bleeding
moderate to severe
- as above but worse, occasionally soft-tissue hematomas, petechiae (rare), GI bleeding, hemarthroses

\section*{Course}
may fluctuate, often improves during pregnancy and with age

\section*{Laboratory Results}
$\square$ prolonged bleeding time and PTT
decreased factor VIII (5-50\%)
normal platelet count (except in Type IIB)
decreased ristocetin cofactor activity
$\square$ analysis of multimers

deficient clearance of hemostatic "debris" and fibrinolytic activators
accelerated destruction due to dysfibrinogenemias: increased fibrinolysis, DIC
thrombocytopenia: hypersplenism, folate deficiency, EtOH intoxication, DIC
platelet dysfunction: EtOH abuse
miscellaneous: inhibition of secondary hemostasis by FDPs
peripheral blood smear: target cells
diagnosis
- factor V because it has the shortest half-life

treatment: fresh frozen plasma, platelets

\section*{II. Vitamin K Deficiency}

\section*{Etiology}
poor diet (especially in alcoholics)

- antibiotics eradicating gut flora which is $50 \%$ of vitamin K supply
hemorrhagic disease of newborn

\section*{Diagnosis}
INR (PT) is elevated out of proportion to the elevation of the PTT
decreased factors II, VII, IX and X (because vitamin K-dependent)

\section*{Management}

$\square$ failure of myeloid cell to differentiate beyond blast stage
$\square$ clonal proliferation of immature hematopoietic cells
$\square$ incidence increases with age
$\square$ associated with exposure to benzene, radiation and alkylating agents

\section*{Pathophysiology}
uncontrolled growth of blasts in marrow leads to
- suppression of normal hematopoietic cells
- appearance of blasts in peripheral blood
- accumulation of blasts in other sites
- metabolic consequences of a large tumour mass
chronic myeloproliferative disorders and myelodysplastic syndromes can transform into AML

\section*{Clinical Features of AML}
decrease in normal hematopoiesis
- anemia
- pallor, weakness, fatigue, dyspnea on exertion
- thrombocytopenia
- purpura
- mucosal bleeding
- associated with DIC (promyelocytic leukemia- a type of AML)
- neutropenia $\rightarrow$ infections
- septicemia
- pneumonitis
- skin and mucosal infections

- gonads
- eyes - Roth spots (oval retinal hemorrhages surrounding pale spot), blurred vision, diplopia
metabolic effects - aggravated by treatment
- increase in uric acid $\rightarrow$ uric acid nephropathy

- release of pro-coagulants -> DIC

\section*{Diagnosis}
peripheral blood film (see Colour Atlas H11)
- decreased hemoglobin (usually normocytic, normochromic anemia) and platelets
- variable leukocyte count
- decrease in normal granulocytes
- presence of blast cells (Auer Rods) - azurophilic granules within lysosomes
bone marrow
- usually hypercellular
- increased blast cells - > 30\% leukemic blasts for definitive diagnosis (normal < 5\%)

increased uric acid, LDH and LFTs
decreased $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$

\section*{Management of AML}
cure - defined as survival that parallels age-matched population
first step is complete remission- defined as normal peripheral blood smear, normal bone marrow with < 5\% blasts, and normal clinical state
leukemia will recur after complete remission if no further treatment given
aims of treatment
- eliminate abnormal clone - cytotoxic therapy
- 1. Induction
- 2. Consolidation or BMT
- repopulation of marrow with normal hemopoietic cells
- consider acceleration with hematopoetic growth factors e.g. G-CSF, GM-CSF if increased incidence of severe infection
supportive care

- antibiotics if fever with C\&S of all orifices and chest x-ray
- platelet and RBC transfusions - CMV negative products
- prevention and treatment of metabolic abnormalities

\section*{Prognosis}
achievement of first remission

bleeding with hypovolemia
\end{tabular} \\
Frozen Red Cells & \begin{tabular}{l} 
rare blood groups \\
multiple alloantibodies
\end{tabular} \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
group compatible uncrossmatched blood is safer than
O-negative uncrossmatched blood - there is no universal donor

\section*{RED CELLS}

\section*{Packed Cells}
$\square$ stored at $4^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$
$\square$ transfuse within 35 days of collection, otherwise hyperkalemia due to cell lysis
transfuse within 7 days of collection if renal failure or hepatic failure is present to reduce solute load $\square$ each unit will raise hematocrit by about $4 \%$ or hemoglobin by $10 \mathrm{gm} / \mathrm{L}(1 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dL})$

\section*{Selection of Red Cells for Transfusion}
$\square$ donor blood should be crossmatch compatible (by mixing recipient serum with donor RBC)
$\square$ donor blood should be free of irregular blood group antibodies
$\square$ the donor blood should be the same ABO and Rh group as the recipient

\section*{PLATELETS}

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline \multicolumn{2}{|l|}{Table 17. Platelet Products} \\
\hline Product & Indication \\
\hline Random Donor (pooled) & thrombocytopenia with bleeding \\
\hline Single Donor Platelets & potential BMT recipients \\
\hline HLA Matched Platelets & refractoriness to pooled or single donor platelets \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
$\square$ each unit of random donor platelets should increase the platelet count by approximately $10 \times 109 / \mathrm{L}$
$\square$ single donor platelets should increase the platelet count by $40-60 \times 109 / \mathrm{L}$
$\square$ if an increment in the platelet count is not seen, alloantibodies, bleeding, sepsis or hypersplenism may be present

\section*{Special Considerations}
$\square$ irradiated blood products
- potential BMT recipients
- immunocompromised patients
CMV negative blood products
- potential transplant recipients
- neonates

\section*{GROUP AND RESERVE SERUM}
an alternative to holding crossmatched blood for individuals who may require transfusion
- recipient's ABO and Rh group is determined
- recipient's serum is tested for the presence of irregular blood group antibodies
- serum is kept frozen
compatible blood can be issued immediately in an emergency or within 30 minutes electively

\section*{ACUTE COMPLICATIONS OF BLOOD TRANSFUSIONS}

\section*{Febrile Nonhemolytic Transfusion Reactions}
$\square$ due to antibodies stimulated by previous transfusions or pregnancies against antigens on donor lymphocytes, granulocytes, platelets or to lymphokines that are released with storage of the cells
signs and symptoms: chills, fever
management and prevention
- stop transfusion
- acetaminophen
- steroids
- filtered blood
- washed blood

\section*{Allergic Reactions}
usually due to interaction between donor plasma proteins and recipient IgE antibodies
signs and symptoms: a spectrum from urticaria and generalized itching to wheezing to anaphylaxis
- Note: anaphylaxis is rare, usually in IgA deficient patients reacting against IgA in donor plasma
management and prevention
- antihistamines
- slow infusion
- steroids
- washed blood
- anaphylaxis may require IV epinephrine and IgA deficient blood components in future

\section*{Acute Hemolytic Transfusion Reactions}
$\square$ most commonly due to incorrect patient identification
$\square$ intravascular hemolytic reaction due to complement activation
$\square$ signs and symptoms
- muscle pain, back pain
- fever, N/V, chest pain, wheezing
- dyspnea, tachypnea (acute respiratory distress syndrome)
- feeling of impending doom
- hemoglobinemia
- renal failure - DIC
- hypotension and vascular collapse
- patient under general anesthetic may present with bleeding

\section*{BLOOD PRODUCTS AND TRANSFUSIONS ...cont.}
investigations
- repeat crossmatch and donor and recipient blood groups
- direct antiglobulin test (direct Coombs' test)
management
- stop transfusion
- hydrate aggressively
- transfuse with compatible blood products

\section*{Citrate Toxicity}
$\square$ seen with massive transfusion and with liver disease
$\square$ toxicity secondary to hypocalcemia
$\square$ prevented by giving 10 mL of 10\% calcium gluconate fo every 2 units of blood

\section*{Hyperkalemia}

\section*{Circulatory Overload}
$\square$ signs: dyspnea, orthopnea, cynasosis, sudden anxiety, hemoptysis, crackles in lung bases
$\square$ with prior CHF and in elderly patients
$\square$ minimize the amount of saline given with the blood

\section*{Hemorrhagic State due to Dilutional Coagulopathy}
$\square$ with massive transfusion
packed cells contain no Factor VIII or V or platelets
$\square$ correct with fresh frozen plasma and platelets

\section*{Bacterial Infections}
$\square$ never give blood $>4$ hours after a bag has been entered!
$\square$ signs and symptoms: chills, rigors, fever, hypotension, shock, DIC
(profound symptoms with Gram negatives)
$\square$ management: blood cultures, IV antibiotics, fluids

\section*{DELAYED COMPLICATIONS IN TRANSFUSIONS}
$\square$ days to weeks
$\square$ viral infection risks
- HIV < 1:500,000
- HBV < 1:250 ,000
- $\mathrm{HCV}<1: 10,000$

\section*{Delayed Hemolytic Transfusion Reaction}
$\square$ may be delayed up to 5 to 10 days
$\square$ extravascular hemolysis due to alloantibodies that are too weak to be
detected by indirect antiglobulin test or by crossmatch
$\square$ may be confused with autoimmune hemolytic anemia
$\square$ signs and symptoms: anemia, fever, history of recent transfusion, jaundice, positive direct Coombs' test
$\square$ further transfusion should be avoided

\section*{Iron Overload}
$\square$ often with repeated transfusion for long periods of time,
e.g. beta-thalassemia major
$\square$ use of iron chelators after transfusion can reduce the chance of iron overload
$\square$ complications include secondary hemochromatosis
- dilated cardiomyopathy
- cirrhosis
- DM, hypothyroidism, delayed growth and puberty

\section*{Transfusion Associated GVHD}
$\square$ transfused T-lymphocytes recognize and react against the "host" (recipient)
between 4-30 days later
$\square$ most patients with this have severely impaired immune systems
(e.g. Hodgkin's, NHL, acute leukemias)
$\square$ signs and symptoms: fever, diarrhea, liver function abnormalities, pancytopenia
$\square$ mortality about $90 \%$
$\square$ prevention: gamma irradiation of blood components
