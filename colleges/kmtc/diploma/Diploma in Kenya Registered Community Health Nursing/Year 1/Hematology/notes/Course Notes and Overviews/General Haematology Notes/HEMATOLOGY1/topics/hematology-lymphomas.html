                        <p>Cancers or malignancies of the lymphatic system. These are diverse group of solid tumours composed of neoplastic lymphoid cells that vary with respect to molecular features, genetics, clinical presentation and treatment. They start in lymph nodes but can involve lymphoid tissues and spleen. The lymphatic system carries a specialized type of white blood cells called lymphocytes through a network of tubular channels (lymph vessels) to all parts of the body including the bone marrow. Scattered throughout this network are collections of lymph nodes/ lymph glands.</p>

                            <li>. They are often classified according to the degree of cell differentiation and the origin of the predominant malignant cell The two major variants of Malignant lymphoma are:</li>
                        </ul>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Hodgkin's lymphoma-B cells</li>

                        </ol>

                            <li>Although these two variants both infiltrate the RES organs, they biologically tend to be clinically distinct.</li>
                            <li>The majority are of B-cell origin.</li>
                            <li>NHL is divided into:-

                            <li>The Histological Hallmark of Hodgkin's disease is the presence of Reed Sternberg cells, which are large malignant lymphoid cells of B cell origin. This is a specialized form of lymphoma that features the presence of an abnormal cell called a Reed-Sternberg cell.</li>
                            <li>They are often present in small numbers but surrounded by a large number of reactive T-cells, plasma cells, and Eosinophils.</li>
                            <li>Four types are recognized from the appearance of R-S cells and the surrounding reactive cells.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The WHO classification proposed classifying Hodgkin lymphoma into two major categories: nodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphoma and classic Hodgkin lymphoma. Nodular lymphocyte- predominant Hodgkin lymphoma represents only a small portion of all cases of Hodgkin lymphoma and is a unique form that generally exhibits a nodular growth pattern. Classic Hodgkin lymphoma is characterized by clonal proliferation of typical mononuclear Hodgkin cells and multinucleated Reed-Sternberg cells. Pathological classification of Hodgkin's Lymphoma is as follows:-</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>(i) Lymphocyte predominant/rich</li>
                            <li>(ii) Nodular sclerosis</li>
                            <li>(iii) Mixed cellularity</li>
                            <li>(iv) Lymphocyte depleted.</li>

                            <li>- The difficulties in establishing a reproducible and clinically useful Histological classification of NHL are reflected by large classification to date, than Hodgkin's Lymphoma.</li>
                            <li>- Clinically the most important factor is Grade; which is a reflection of proliferation rate.</li>

                        <p>Compared to HL, NHL is often widely disseminated at presentation.<br>Clinical presentation;</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>I) LN compression symptoms</li>
                            <li>II) Constitutional symptoms-Weight loss, fever, and pruritus, drenching night sweats</li>
                            <li>III) Hepatosplenomegaly</li>
                            <li>IV) Extra nodal disease i.e. BM involvement, gut, thyroid, skin, testes, brain, bone.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">HISTORY</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>- Past history: A number of diseases, infectious agents, and drugs or toxins have been associated with the development of NHL.</li>
                            <li>- A personal or family history of lymphoma or other prior hematopoietic malignancy, use of radiation therapy, immunosuppressive agents, chemotherapy, organ transplantation, and other underlying diseases should be obtained</li>
                            <li>- Relevant infections include HIV-I, HTLV-I, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), hepatitis C, Borrelia bergdorferi (B. afzellii species), and perhaps also hepatitis B virus</li>
                            <li>- Specific disorders associated with the development of NHL include connective tissue diseases (e.g. lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, Sjogren's syndrome), immunodeficiency disorders, mixed cryoglobulinemia, Castleman's disease, and inflammatory bowel disease treated with azathioprine/6-mercaptopurine.</li>
                            <li>- An occupational history should be obtained, as exposure to certain agricultural pesticides and Agent Orange have been implicated in the development of NHL</li>
                            <li>- Specific illnesses which are risk factors for the development of gastrointestinal lymphoma include: Crohn's disease gastrointestinal nodular lymphoid hyperplasia, Helicobacter pylori-associated chronic gastritis and Celiac disease</li>
                            <li>- Systemic complaints (B symptoms) : About 40 percent of patients with NHL present with systemic complaints of: Fever - temperature $>38^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, Weight loss - unexplained loss of $>10$ percent of body weight over the past six months, Sweats - the presence of drenching night sweats</li>
                            <li>- These complaints are of importance in determining prognosis</li>
                            <li>- Less frequent presenting systemic complaints of fatigue, malaise, and pruritus occur in fewer than 10 percent of patients.</li>
                            <li>- The presence of bone pain or gastrointestinal symptoms may indicate extranodal involvement in these areas</li>
                            <li>- Fever of unknown origin: Fever of unknown origin (FUO) refers to a prolonged febrile illness without an established etiology despite intensive evaluation and diagnostic testing.</li>
                            <li>- Historically, the most common causes of FUO have been infection, connective tissue diseases, and malignancy.</li>
                            <li>- NHL, especially one of the aggressive or highly aggressive variants, is a common cause of FUO due to malignancy.</li>
                            <li>- Lymphadenopathy: More than two-thirds of patients with NHL present with peripheral lymphadenopathy.</li>
                        </ul>

                            <li>- The physical examination needs to be directed to all potentially involved lymphoid sites</li>
                            <li>- These include:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>~ Waldeyer's ring (tonsils, base of the tongue, nasopharynx)</li>
                                    <li>~ Standard lymph node sites (e.g. cervical, supraclavicular, axillary, inguinal, femoral)</li>
                                    <li>~ Liver and spleen</li>
                                    <li>~ Abdominal nodal sites (mesenteric, retroperitoneal)</li>
                                    <li>~ Less commonly involved nodal sites (e.g. occipital, preauricular, epitrochlear, popliteal)</li>

                            <li>(ii) Immunophenotyping of surface antigens to distinguish B and T cell tumour.</li>
                            <li>(iii) Serum uric acid levels -These are markedly elevated in every aggressive High grade NHL.</li>
                            <li>(iv) HIV screening -This is a known risk factor of non Hodgkin's disease.</li>
                            <li>(V) bone marrow biopsy</li>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Staging</h3>
                        <p>- Staging system - The Ann Arbor staging system developed in 1971 for Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) was adapted for staging non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHLs)<br>- This staging system focuses on the number of tumor sites (nodal and extranodal), location, and the presence or absence of systemic ("B") symptoms</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Stage I</strong> refers to NHL involving a single lymph node region (stage I) or a single extralymphatic organ or site (stage IE)</li>
                            <li><strong>Stage II</strong> refers to two or more involved lymph node regions on the same side of the diaphragm (stage II) or with localized involvement of an extralymphatic organ or site (stage IIE)</li>
                            <li><strong>Stage III</strong> refers to lymph node involvement on both sides of the diaphragm (stage III), or with localized involvement of an extralymphatic organ or site (stage IIIE) or spleen (stage IIIS), or both (stage IIIES)</li>
                            <li><strong>Stage IV</strong> refers to the presence of diffuse or disseminated involvement of one or more extralymphatic organs (e.g. liver, bone marrow, lung), with or without associated lymph node involvement The presence or absence of systemic symptoms should be noted with each stage designation.</li>
