                        <p>Granulocytes are the most abundant white cells in peripheral blood.</p>
                        <p><strong>Neutrophils.</strong> Most granulocytes are neutrophils, a key element of defence against most bacteria and some fungi. Most neutrophils in the normal person are present in the blood loosely adherent to the walls of vessels (marginating pool). When the appropriate stimulus comes along (such as a bacterial infection) they are released from the marginating pool and attracted to sites of inflammation by chemotactic factors including complement. Once a neutrophil comes into contact with a microbe or foreign body it attaches itself, ingests it into a vacuole called a phagosome and kills it.</p>
                        <p><strong>Eosinophils.</strong> These are the next most abundant form. They attack parasites which are too large to be phagocytosed, and also have a role in mucosal immunity.</p>
                        <p><strong>Basophils.</strong> These are the least abundant form. They release histamine and other inflammatory mediators during immediate hypersensitivity reactions.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Monocytes</h3>
                        <p>Monocytes are large non-granulated white cells that are released from the bone marrow, circulate for several days and then enter tissues to become the tissue macrophages, including pulmonary alveolar macrophages, osteoclasts and the Kupffer cells of the liver. They engulf and kill bacteria in tissues and, as antigen-presenting cells, play a key role in immunity.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Lymphocytes</h3>
                        <p>Lymphocytes are derived from the same stem cells of the bone marrow as the other cell lines. During fetal development, they migrate out to populate the thymus, liver, spleen, lymph nodes and other lymphoid tissues. In adult life, some lymphocytes are formed in the marrow but most are formed in lymphoid tissues elsewhere. There are two distinct cell lines, morphologically identical but distinguishable by cell-surface markers. The B cells - plasma cells and memory cells - are responsible for humoral immunity. T cells are responsible for cellmediated immunity and for activating B cells. The subtypes of T cells are not discussed further here but an understanding of them is crucial to an understanding of AIDS (p. 381).</p>

                        <p>The normal neutrophil count is around $2 \times 10^{9}$ cells/l. There is an increasing risk of infection when the count falls below $1 \times 10^{9}$ cells/l and the risk of invasive infections rises substantially when the count falls below $0.5 \times 10^{9}$ cells/l. A longer duration of neutropenia (e.g. more than 7 days) also puts the patient at substantially greater risk of life-threatening infection. Infections include:</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li>streptococci</li>
                        <li>Gram-negatives, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa</li>
                        <li>Staphylococcus epidermidis (usually related to indwelling central venous lines, and not immediately life-threatening)</li>
                        <li>mucosal and invasive candidiasis</li>
                        <li>invasive pulmonary aspergillosis</li>
                        <li>herpes simplex virus (especially mouth ulcers).</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>A typical clinical scenario is that you are on call for haematology patients and summoned to the ward because a patient with no circulating neutrophils has developed a new fever 7-14 days after chemotherapy for leukaemia. You need to:</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li>assess whether there are any localising symptoms such as cough, skin rash, nasal symptoms, abdominal pain, etc.</li>
                        <li>examine the mouth, chest, skin and rectal area and any other sites that are symptomatic</li>
                        <li>assess whether the patient is in shock or going into respiratory failure</li>
                        <li>order a portable chest radiograph if the illness has any respiratory features</li>
                        <li>check the notes and recent results for any positive microbiology</li>
                        <li>take at least one blood culture and collect any other microbiological specimens that are indicated by the patient's symptoms</li>
                        <li>start broad-spectrum i.v. antibiotics according to the policy of the unit; typically these will include coverage for Ps. aeruginosa and streptococcal infections as a minimum (e.g. ceftazidime)</li>
                        <li>if there are any unusual features, or the patient is very ill, you should contact a senior member of staff responsible for the patient.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Expert microbiological advice is needed if the patient remains profoundly neutropenic and has persistent fever.</p>
                        <p><strong>Ceasing therapy.</strong> Antibiotics can usually be stopped when the neutrophil count has risen above $0.5 \times 10^{9}$ cells/l.</p>

                        <p>These neoplastic diseases may seem hard to understand and remember but a few simple principles provide a framework on which the diseases hang:</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li>all of them are neoplastic clonal proliferations but they differ in their degree of malignancy</li>
                        <li>the more chronic diseases tend to become increasingly malignant with time</li>
                        <li>a distinction can be drawn between lymphoproliferative and myeloproliferative diseases</li>
                        <li>the myeloproliferative group, particularly the more chronic types (polycythaemia vera, essential thrombocythaemia and chronic granulocytic leukaemia (CGL)) usually involve proliferation of more than one cell line</li>
                        <li>other marrow tissues that are not derived from stem cells proliferate reactively to myeloproliferation and lymphoproliferation, as in myelofibrosis and lymphoma.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Figure 65 shows the relationship between the diseases. In general, the more malignant the disease, the more intense the treatment required and the higher the chance of cure. Low-grade diseases tend to be chronic and incurable.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">The acute leukaemias</h3>
                        <h4>Classification and risk factors</h4>
                        <p>There are two broad categories of acute leukaemia, acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) and acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), the latter including several subtypes, shown in Figure 65. The incidence of ALL peaks in childhood. It is more common in males. AML is a disease of both children and adults, with a rapidly rising incidence in old age and no gender difference. Radiation exposure, genetic factors, viral infections and toxins, including chemotherapeutic drugs, have been implicated as risk factors for leukaemia, although the cause in an individual case is usually unknown.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Clinical and haematological features</h4>
                        <p>Acute leukaemia may arise de novo or in patients with chronic myeloproliferative disease or myelodysplasia. The clinical manifestations result from marrow dysfunction and tissue infiltration. They include:</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li>symptoms and signs of anaemia</li>
                        <li>bruising, bleeding and purpura</li>
                        <li>increased susceptibility to infection.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Tissue infiltration may cause:</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li>bone and joint pain</li>
                        <li>gum infiltration</li>
                        <li>skin rashes.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>There is occasionally hepatosplenomegaly and, in ALL, lymphadenopathy. The diagnosis is made on blood film and bone marrow examination. There is usually anaemia and thrombocytopenia. There may be leucopenia or a leucocytosis with blasts (primitive cells) in peripheral blood. The marrow is hypercellular and infiltrated with blasts. AML and ALL are distinguished and subclassified on morphological, cytochemical, immunological and cytogenetic characteristics. Rod-shaped cytoplasmic bodies, named Auer rods, are a virtually pathognomonic feature of AML.</p>

                        <h4>Management</h4>
                        <p>The treatment of ALL has been one of the success stories of oncology because two-thirds of children (fewer adults) are cured. Most forms of acute leukaemia are amenable to chemotherapy, but equally important is the intensive supportive treatment with antibiotics and blood products, and sympathetic management of the patient and his/her family. The aim is to eliminate the abnormal clone from blood, bone marrow and other sites and allow repopulation with normal haemopoietic cells. This is termed remission. A discussion of the specific drugs and regimens is beyond the scope of this chapter but treatment may include the following phases.</p>
                        <ol>
                        <li>Remission induction: elimination of neoplastic tissue, allowing recovery of normal marrow</li>
                        <li>Consolidation of remission</li>
                        <li>Prevention of recurrence in extramedullary sites (as in ALL) and maintenance of remission</li>
                        <li>Treatment of relapses.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>There are some important differences between the treatment of ALL and AML. More intensive myelosuppression is used in AML; consequently the risks of infection and bleeding are greater. In ALL, there is a high risk that systemic chemotherapy will not eradicate malignant cells from certain extra medullary 'sanctuary' sites, including the brain, spinal cord and testes; therefore, additional local treatment (e.g. intrathecal chemotherapy) is given. Relatively low-dose maintenance therapy is often continued for 2 to 3 years in ALL, whereas induction in AML is followed by several further courses of very intensive chemotherapy over a much shorter period of time in an attempt to prevent relapse.</p>
                        <p>If a suitable donor is available (preferably an HLAidentical sibling), allogeneic bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cell transplantation may be performed in both AML and ALL, in an attempt to reduce the chance of relapse. This offers a 'graft versus leukaemia' effect, in addition to the benefits of the chemotherapy given, but may at the same time cause graft-versus-host disease, which has a significant morbidity and mortality. Alternatively, autologous transplantation, using the patient's own bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cells, collected during remission, may be employed. This avoids the risk of graft-versus-host disease but does not have the benefit of a graft-versus-leukaemia affect, and there is a chance that the transplanted marrow may still contain leukaemic cells.</p>
                        <p>Over $90 \%$ of children and $80 \%$ of adults with ALL achieve remission; the 5 -year survival for children is over $60 \%$, but unfortunately the majority of adults relapse and die of leukaemia. The remission rate with intensive chemotherapy in AML is over $70 \%$, but the 5 -year survival is only $20 \%$. Many patients are elderly and not treated intensively, which results in a 5-year survival for all patients with AML of approximately $5 \%$. Increasing age has an adverse prognostic effect on all types of leukaemia and a high white count at presentation predicts a bad outcome. Specific cytogenetic defects in the leukaemic cells are closely related to either a good (e.g. t (8; 21) in AML) or bad (e.g. t (9; 22) in ALL) prognosis.</p>
                        <p>There is increasing interest in directing specific treatments towards molecular genetic defects newly identified in haematological malignancies. A big success story in this regard has been the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukaemia, a subtype of AML that carries a high risk of early death from bleeding in DIC. The genetic abnormality ( $\mathrm{t}(15 ; 17)$ ) involves a retinoic acid receptor gene, and it has been found that complete remission can be achieved by administration of all-trans-retinoic acid. Intensive chemotherapy still has to be used, but the risk of early death and incidence of relapse have been markedly reduced; as a result, the cure rate is now approximately 70%.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Myelodysplastic syndrome</h3>
                        <p>Myelodysplastic syndrome describes a group of disorders characterised by cytopenias of one or more cell lines with a cellular marrow and morphological abnormalities in both marrow and peripheral blood. Cytogenetic abnormalities can often be demonstrated. The cytopenias are presumed the result of ineffective haemopoiesis. Myelodysplastic syndrome progresses, at a variable rate, to AML. Management is supportive until leukaemia develops, when cytotoxic therapy may be indicated although the outlook is poor at this stage. Many patients are elderly and unsuitable for intrusive treatment. Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation can be considered in younger patients.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Myeloproliferative diseases</h3>
                        <h4>Chronic granulocytic leukaemia</h4>
                        <p>Chronic granulocytic leukaemia (CGL, also known as chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML)), is an uncommon disease which may occur at any age but peaks in the 50-60 age group. It is characterised by uncontrolled proliferation of myeloid progenitor cells, generally most noticeable in granulopoietic cells but also affecting red cells and platelets. The characteristic feature, present in $95 \%$ of patients, is the Philadelphia chromosome, resulting from a reciprocal translocation between the long arms of chromosomes 9 and 22 ( t (9; 22)).</p>
                        <p>These are the clinical features and some modes of presentation of CGL:</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li>patients typically present with symptoms of anaemia, weight loss fatigue, anorexia, drenching sweats or abdominal discomfort</li>
                        <li>palpable splenomegaly in $50 \%$, which may be massive, and there may be symptomatic splenic infarction</li>
                        <li>there may be symptoms and signs of haemorrhage</li>
                        <li>the diagnosis may be made by chance on a blood count.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>There is marked leucocytosis including, especially, neutrophils and myelocytes and, in many cases, basophils and eosinophils. The platelet count is usually normal or raised at presentation. The bone marrow shows granulopoietic hyperplasia.</p>
                        <p>CGL can be distinguished from other causes of leucocytosis by:</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li>symptoms and signs</li>
                        <li>blood film</li>
                        <li>Philadelphia chromosome</li>
                        <li>reduced leucocyte alkaline phosphatase score on a blood film.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>CGL progresses over about 3 years to a more malignant phenotype, culminating in an accelerated phase. This may be marked by rapid transformation to acute leukaemia (AML or ALL), or more gradual deterioration involving such features as anaemia, massive splenomegaly, myelofibrosis, marked basophilia or thrombocytosis. Response to treatment is generally poor and the outlook is bleak.</p>
                        <p>During the chronic phase, the disease is easily controlled by simple oral chemotherapy, usually hydroxyurea. Nevertheless, the Philadelphia chromosome is not eradicated. Alpha interferon can produce good haematological remissions, and occasional cytogenetic remissions. At present, allogeneic bone marrow transplantation during the chronic phase (if a suitable donor is available) is the only reliable means of achieving this key objective. However, new treatment directed against the gene product of the Philadelphia translocation has been developed and may become an important part of management in the future.</p>

                        <h4>Polycythaemia vera and thrombocythaemia</h4>
                        <p>Although polycythaemia vera and thrombocythaemia are myeloproliferative disorders, they are described in the red cell (p. 267) and platelet (p. 274) sections of this chapter because their clinical features are determined by the predominant cell type in peripheral blood rather than their progenitor cell.</p>

                        <h4>Myelofibrosis</h4>
                        <p>Myelofibrosis describes a disease in which proliferation of fibrous tissue in the marrow is the main feature. It may be the final result of other myeloproliferative diseases or may present as a primary disorder in middleaged or elderly people. There is anaemia - which may be leucoerythroblastic (p. 263) - and massive splenomegaly. It can be impossible to aspirate marrow. Trephine biopsy shows extensive fibrosis. The treatment is supportive, sometimes with splenectomy to improve red cell, white cell and platelet survival. It may progress to acute leukaemia.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Lymphoproliferative diseases</h3>
                        <h4>Hodgkin's disease</h4>
                        <p>There are incidence peaks of Hodgkin's disease in early adulthood and old age. The two main clinical characteristics of lymphomas are lymphadenopathy and systemic symptoms.</p>
                        <p>A cardinal feature of Hodgkin's disease (which distinguishes it from NHL) is that, when more than one group of nodes is involved, they are always contiguous, suggesting lymphatic spread of malignant cells. The cervical nodes are most often involved. With disseminated disease, there may be hepatosplenomegaly and extralymphatic involvement. Systemic symptoms include pruritus, fever, night sweats and weight loss. Anaemia is common. There may be neutrophilia and eosinophilia. Impaired cell-mediated immunity predisposes to infection, most typically herpes zoster. Alcohol-induced pain at the site of the disease is a quite specific symptom.</p>
                        <p>The diagnostic feature on lymph node biopsy is the presence of multinucleated Reed-Sternberg cells.</p>
                        <p>There are several histological subtypes of Hodgkin's disease, which vary, among other things, in the relative proportion of lymphocytes and reactive elements in the malignant tissue. Staging, however, is the most important determinant of treatment and prognosis. This is based on the Ann Arbor system' which, in its simplest form, is:</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li>stage I: involvement of one group of lymph nodes only</li>
                        <li>stage II: involvement of more than one group of lymph nodes on one side of the diaphragm</li>
                        <li>stage III: involvement of lymph nodes on both sides of the diaphragm</li>
                        <li>stage IV: presence of extra lymphatic disease (e.g. bone marrow, liver).</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The disease is also subclassified as:</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li>A: no systemic symptoms.</li>
                        <li>B: presence of fever, night sweats or significant weight loss.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Staging therefore involves:</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li>a careful history and examination</li>
                        <li>liver function tests</li>
                        <li>computed tomographic (CT) scanning of chest, abdomen and pelvis</li>
                        <li>bone marrow trephine biopsy.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Less favourable prognosis is associated with:</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li>lymphocyte depleted histology</li>
                        <li>higher stage</li>
                        <li>B subtype symptoms</li>
                        <li>increasing age</li>
                        <li>very bulky lymphadenopathy (e.g. massive mediastinal enlargement).</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Broadly speaking, treatment is with local radiotherapy for stages IA and IIA disease, and with chemotherapy, with or without radiotherapy, for higher stages. Depending on the above factors, Hodgkin's disease has a 50-90% 5-year survival.</p>

                        <h4>Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma</h4>
                        <p>NHL is a more heterogeneous group of disorders with varying malignancy and prognoses. It differs from Hodgkin's disease in four ways:</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li>higher prevalence</li>
                        <li>older mean age at diagnosis</li>
                        <li>non-contiguous, multicentric spread</li>
                        <li>extranodal involvement is more common.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Several types of NHL are known to be caused by viruses, including Epstein-Barr virus (Burkitt's lymphoma), human T cell leukaemia-1 virus and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Like Hodgkin's disease, NHL may present with lymphadenopathy and systemic symptoms, although the symptomology is more diverse.</p>
                        <p>Remember that lymphadenopathy must always be taken seriously. In younger people, it is more likely to be caused by infection than malignancy. In older people, there is a high likelihood of cancer (usually localised lymphadenopathy), lymphoma or chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (generalized lymphadenopathy). The diagnosis of NHL is made by biopsy. It is staged as for Hodgkin's disease.</p>
                        <p>There are two broad histological categories:</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li>low-grade NHL: this is indolent, but may become more aggressive with time; it is essentially without cure but survival may be prolonged ( $>5$ years)</li>
                        <li>high-grade NHL: This form carries a much higher early mortality but is more responsive to treatment, with an approximately 30% 5-year disease-free survival.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Treatment</strong> Because NHL is usually more widespread than Hodgkin's disease at presentation, treatment is more often with chemotherapy, although localised disease is treated with radiotherapy. Stem cell or bone marrow transplantation is used in some patients.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia</h4>
                        <p>Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is the least malignant of the leukaemias and is characteristically a disease of elderly people. It is more common in men than women. It may be a chance finding on a blood film or may present with lymphadenopathy or anaemia. Typically, there is hepatosplenomegaly. The blood film shows (sometimes massively) increased numbers of mature lymphocytes. Because the lymphocytes are B cells in over $95 \%$ of patients, there may be:</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li>a 'paraprotein' (see Myeloma, below)</li>
                        <li>depression of normal immunoglobulins and increased susceptibility to infection</li>
                        <li>autoimmune phenomena such as haemolytic anaemia or thrombocytopenia.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Cytotoxic therapy or corticosteroids may be given for symptoms or complications, although many patients need no treatment. Progressive disease causes:</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li>worsening lymphocytosis</li>
                        <li>increasing hepatosplenomegaly and lymphadenopathy</li>
                        <li>eventually, bone marrow failure.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>There is a 50% five-year survival.</p>

                        <h4>Multiple myeloma</h4>
                        <p>Multiple myeloma is a malignant proliferation of plasma cells (B cells), which are relatively highly differentiated and secrete a monoclonal immunoglobulin. Myeloma is predominantly a disease of old people, although it may arise at any time in adult life. The plasma cells may secrete:</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li>IgG, with or without free light chains (50% of patients)</li>
                        <li>IgA, with or without free light chains (20%)</li>
                        <li>free light chains only (20%)</li>
                        <li>Other patterns of paraprotein ( $10 \%$ ).</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The clinical features result from:</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li>plasma cell proliferation</li>
                        <li>systemic effects of the paraprotein</li>
                        <li>impairment of normal haematological function.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>There is bone destruction caused by humorally mediated activation of osteoclasts without the normal osteoblastic response. This may cause diffuse osteopenia or, radiologically, punched-out lesions at the site of plasma cell deposits. Pathological fractures may result. Such deposits may present as mass lesions: plasmacytomas. Bone destruction mobilises calcium; consequently hypercalcaemia (p. 355) is a common complication of myeloma.</p>
                        <p>Apart from its skeletal features, two other characteristics of myeloma are hyperviscosity and renal failure. Hyperviscosity occurs because the paraprotein alters the surface charge of the red cells and thus leads to aggregation. It may impair cerebral and peripheral blood flow, typically causing lethargy, confusion and impaired consciousness. It does not usually present a clinical problem in myeloma but is seen more often in Waldenström's macroglobulinaemia, a rare plasma cell proliferative disease with an IgM paraprotein.</p>
                        <p>Renal failure in myeloma results from:</p>
                        <ul>

                        </ul>
                        <p>The effects upon normal haematological function include:</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li>increased susceptibility to bacterial infection (typically septicaemia or pneumonia) as a result of reduced leucocyte numbers of function together with reduced secretion of normal immunoglobulins</li>
                        <li>anaemia or pancytopenia because of marrow replacement or suppression of haemopoiesis.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h5>Clinical presentation</h5>
                        <p>Patients may present with bone pain or fractures (particularly involving the spine and ribs), weight loss, anaemia, infective episodes and renal failure. Other typical symptoms include thirst, polyuria, nocturia (owing to hypercalcaemia and/or renal failure), constipation (from hypercalcaemia), lethargy and confusion.</p>
                        <p>The diagnosis is based upon finding:</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li>a high ESR (except in those with only light chain secretion)</li>
                        <li>the paraprotein, by immunoelectrophoresis of blood and/or urine</li>
                        <li>reduced concentrations of normal immunoglobulins (immune paresis)</li>
                        <li>radiological evidence of generalised osteopenia or local bone destruction</li>
                        <li>increased plasma cell numbers in a bone marrow aspirate.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Other laboratory features include:</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li>anaemia, thrombocytopenia and leucopenia</li>
                        <li>renal failure</li>
                        <li>hypercalcaemia.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>It should be noted that the term Bence-Jones proteinuria is of historical interest only. It describes the behaviour of light chains in boiled urine, now superseded by immunoelectrophoresis of concentrated urine.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Management</h5>
                        <p>Patients may become caught in a vicious spiral of hypercalcaemia, volume depletion and renal failure. The first step for such patients is i.v. fluid herapy (described under acute renal failure, p. 175). Infection should be sought and treated, pain controlled, and hypercalcaemia treated with corticosteroids and/or i.v. bisphosphonate if fluid alone does not control it. Plasma exchange may occasionally be needed to control hyperviscosity. Longterm treatment is with chemotherapy such as oral melphalan, an alkylating agent, or more aggressive regimens in younger patients. Bone pain may be controlled with radiotherapy. Despite treatment, the $50 \%$ survival is about 2 years.</p>
