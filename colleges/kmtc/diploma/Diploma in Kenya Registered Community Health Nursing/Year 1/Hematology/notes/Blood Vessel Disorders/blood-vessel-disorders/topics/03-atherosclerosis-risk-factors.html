                        <p>Atherosclerosis is a specific form of arteriosclerosis affecting primarily the intima of large and medium-sized muscular arteries and is characterised by fibrofatty plaques or atheromas. The term atherosclerosis is derived from athero- (meaning porridge) referring to the soft lipid-rich material in the centre of atheroma, and sclerosis (scarring) referring to connective tissue in the plaques. Any large and medium-sized artery may be involved in atherosclerosis, the most commonly affected are the aorta, the coronary and the cerebral arterial systems. Therefore, the major clinical syndromes resulting from ischaemia due to atherosclerosis pertain to the heart (angina and myocardial infarcts or heart attacks), and the brain (transient cerebral ischaemia and cerebral infarcts or strokes); other sequelae are peripheral vascular disease, aneurysmal dilatation, chronic ischaemic heart disease, ischaemic encephalopathy and mesenteric arterial occlusion.</p>

                        <p>The incidences for atherosclerosis are based on the major clinical syndromes produced by it, the most important interpretation being that death from myocardial infarction is related to underlying atherosclerosis. Cardiovascular disease, mostly related to atherosclerotic coronary heart disease or ischaemic heart disease (IHD) is the most common cause of premature death. Risk factors associated with increased risk of developing clinical atherosclerosis, act in combination rather than singly. Risk factors are divided into two groups (Table 15.1):</p>

                        <h3>1. DYSLIPIDAEMIAS</h3>
                        <p>Virchow in 19th century first identified cholesterol crystals in the atherosclerotic lesions. It has been established that hypercholesterolaemia has direct proportionate relationship with atherosclerosis and IHD. The following evidences are cited in support of this:</p>
                        <ol type="i">
                            <li>The atherosclerotic plaques contain cholesterol and cholesterol esters, largely derived from the lipoproteins in the blood.</li>
                            <li>The lesions of atherosclerosis can be induced in experimental animals by feeding them with diet rich in cholesterol.</li>
                            <li>Individuals with hypercholesterolaemia due to various causes such as in DM, myxoedema and familial hypercholesterolaemia have increased risk of developing atherosclerosis and IHD.</li>
                            <li>Populations having hypercholesterolaemia have higher mortality from IHD.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <p>The lipoproteins are divided into classes according to the density of solvent in which they remain suspended on centrifugation at high speed. The major classes of lipoprotein particles are chylomicrons, very-low density lipoproteins (VLDL), low-density lipoproteins (LDL), and high-density lipoproteins (HDL). The major fractions of lipoproteins tested in blood lipid profile and their varying effects on atherosclerosis and IHD are as under (Table 15.2):</p>

An elevation of total serum cholesterol levels above <span class="math-inline">$260 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dl}$</span> in men and women between 30 and 50 years of age has three times higher risk of developing IHD as compared with people with total serum cholesterol levels within normal limits.</li>
                            <li><strong>Triglycerides:</strong> Normal serum level is below <span class="math-inline">$160 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dl}$</span>.</li>

                            <li><strong>High-density lipoproteins (HDL) cholesterol:</strong> Normal desirable serum level is <span class="math-inline">$<60 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dl}$</span>. HDL is protective ('good cholesterol') against atherosclerosis.</li>

                        <h3>2. HYPERTENSION</h3>
                        <p>Is a risk factor for all clinical manifestations of atherosclerosis. It doubles the risk of all forms of cardiovascular disease. It acts by mechanical injury to the arterial wall due to increased blood pressure. Elevation of systolic pressure of over 160 mmHg or a diastolic pressure of over 95 mmHg is associated with five times higher risk of developing IHD than in people with blood pressure within normal range (<span class="math-inline">$140 / 90 \mathrm{mmHg}$</span> or less).</p>

                        <h3>3. SMOKING</h3>
                        <p>Is associated with higher risk of atherosclerotic IHD and sudden cardiac death. Men who smoke a pack of cigarettes a day are 3-5 times more likely to die of IHD than non-smokers. The increased risk and severity of atherosclerosis in smokers is due to reduced level of HDL, deranged coagulation system and accumulation of carbon monoxide in blood that produces carboxyhaemoglobin and eventually hypoxia in the arterial wall favouring atherosclerosis.</p>

                        <h3>4. DIABETES MELLITUS</h3>
                        <p>Clinical manifestations of atherosclerosis develop at an early age in people with both type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus. In particular, association of type 2 diabetes mellitus characterised by metabolic (insulin resistance) syndrome and abnormal lipid profile termed 'diabetic dyslipidaemia' is common and heightens the risk of cardiovascular disease.</p>

The prevalence of atherosclerotic IHD is about three times higher in men in 4th decade than in women. The lower incidence of IHD in women, especially in premenopausal age, is due to high levels of oestrogen and high-density lipoproteins, both of which have anti-atherogenic influence.</li>
