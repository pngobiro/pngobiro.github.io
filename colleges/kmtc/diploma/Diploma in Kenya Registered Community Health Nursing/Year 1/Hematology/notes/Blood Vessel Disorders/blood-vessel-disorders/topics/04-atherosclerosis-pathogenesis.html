                        <p>Atherosclerosis is a multifactorial process. A number of theories have been proposed.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Insudation hypothesis.</strong> The concept hypothesised by Virchow in 1856 that atherosclerosis is a form of cellular proliferation of the intimal cells resulting from increased imbibing of lipids from the blood came to be called the 'lipid theory'.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Encrustation hypothesis.</strong> The proposal put forth by Rokitansky in 1852 that atheroma represented a form of encrustation on the arterial wall from the components in the blood forming thrombi composed of platelets, fibrin and leucocytes. The components of thrombus (platelets, fibrin and leucocytes) have a role in atheromatous lesions. There four key factors involved in atherosclerosis arterial smooth muscle cells, endothelial cells, blood monocytes and dyslipidaemia. The pathogenesis of atherosclerosis is explained on the basis of the following two theories:</p>
                        
                        <ol>
                            <li>Reaction-to-injury hypothesis, first described in 1973, and modified in 1986 and 1993 by Ross.</li>
                            <li>Monoclonal theory, based on neoplastic proliferation of smooth muscle cells, postulated by Benditt and Benditt in 1973.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3>1. REACTION-TO-INJURY HYPOTHESIS</h3>
                        <p>This theory is most widely accepted and incorporates aspects of two older historical theories of atherosclerosis-the lipid theory of Virchow and thrombogenic (encrustation) theory of Rokitansky.</p>
                        
                        <p>The following is the accepted role of key components involved in atherogenesis, diagrammatically illustrated in Fig. 15.4.</p>

                        <ol type="i">
                            <li><strong>Endothelial injury</strong> is the initial triggering event in the development of lesions of atherosclerosis. Endothelial dysfunction may initiate the sequence of events. Two of the major risk factors which act together to produce endothelial injury are: haemodynamic stress from hypertension and chronic dyslipidaemia.</li>
                            
                            <li><strong>Intimal smooth muscle cell proliferation.</strong> Endothelial injury causes adherence, aggregation and platelet release reaction at the site of exposed subendothelial connective tissue and infiltration by inflammatory cells. Proliferation of intimal smooth muscle cell and production of extracellular matrix are stimulated by cytokines such as IL-1 and TNF-Œ± and by activated platelets at the site of endothelial injury. These cytokines lead to local synthesis of following growth factors having distinct roles in plaque evolution:
                            <p>Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) stimulate proliferation and migration of smooth muscle cells from their usual location in the media into the intima.</p></li>
                        </ol>

                            <li><strong>Role of blood monocytes.</strong> LDL does appear in the monocyte cytoplasm to form foam cell. Plasma LDL on entry into the intima undergoes oxidation. The 'oxidised LDL' formed in the intima performs the following functions on monocytes and endothelium:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>For monocytes: Oxidised LDL acts to attract, proliferate, immobilise and activate them and are taken up by scavenger receptor on the monocyte to transform it to a lipid-laden foam cell.</li>
                                    <li>For endothelium: Oxidised LDL is cytotoxic. Death of foam cell by apoptosis releases lipid to form lipid core of plaque.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            
                            <li><strong>Role of dyslipidaemia</strong> chronic dyslipidaemia in itself may initiate endothelial injury and dysfunction by causing increased permeability. Hypercholesterolaemia with increased serum concentration of LDL promotes formation of foam cells, while high serum concentration of HDL has anti-atherogenic effect.</li>
                            
                            <li><strong>Thrombosis.</strong> Endothelial injury exposes subendothelial connective tissue resulting in formation of small platelet aggregates at the site and causing proliferation of smooth muscle cells. This causes mild inflammatory reaction which together with foam cells is incorporated into the atheromatous plaque. The lesions enlarge by attaching fibrin and cells from the blood so that thrombus becomes a part of atheromatous plaque.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3>2. MONOCLONAL HYPOTHESIS</h3>
                        <p>Is based on the postulate that proliferation of smooth muscle cells is the primary event and that this proliferation is monoclonal in origin. The evidence cited in support of monoclonal hypothesis is the observation on proliferated smooth muscle cells in atheromatous plaques.</p>

                        <p>Early lesions in the form of diffuse intimal thickening, fatty streaks and gelatinous lesions are the forerunners in the evolution of atherosclerotic lesions. However, the clinical disease states due to luminal narrowing in atherosclerosis are caused by fully developed Atheromatous plaques and complicated plaques (Fig. 15.6).</p>

                        <h3>1. FATTY STREAKS AND DOTS</h3>
                        <p>Fatty streaks and dots on the intima may be the precursor lesions of atheromatous plaques. They are prominent in the aorta and other major arteries, more on the posterior wall than the anterior wall.</p>
                        <p>Grossly, the lesions may appear as flat or slightly elevated and yellow. They may be either in the form of small, multiple dots, about 1 mm in size, or in the form of elongated, beaded streaks.</p>

                        <h3>2. GELATINOUS LESIONS</h3>
                        <p>develop in the intima of the aorta and other major arteries in the first few months of life. They may also be precursors of plaques. They are circumscribed grey elevations, about 1 cm in diameter.</p>

                        <h3>3. ATHEROMATOUS PLAQUES</h3>
                        <p>A fully developed atherosclerotic lesion is called atheromatous plaque, also called fibrous plaque, or atheroma. Most often and most severely affected is the abdominal aorta, smaller lesions may be seen in descending thoracic aorta and aortic arch. The major branches of the aorta around the ostia especially the iliac, femoral, carotid, coronary, and cerebral arteries.</p>

                        <p>Grossly, atheromatous plaques are white to yellowish lesions, from <span class="math-inline">$1-2 \mathrm{~cm}$</span> in diameters. Cut section of the plaque reveals the luminal surface as a firm, white fibrous cap and a central core.</p>
                        
                        <p>Microscopically, the appearance of plaque varies depending upon the age of the lesion.</p>
                        <p>Cellular area under the fibrous cap is comprised by a mixture of macrophages, foam cells, lymphocytes and smooth muscle cells which may contain lipid. Deeper central soft core consists of extracellular lipid material, cholesterol clefts, and lipid laden foam cells. In older and more advanced lesions, the collagen in the fibrous cap may be dense and hyalinised, smooth muscle cells may be atrophic.</p>

                        <h3>4. COMPLICATED PLAQUES</h3>
                        <p>Pathologic changes that occur in fully-developed atheromatous plaques are called the complicated lesions. These changes include calcification, ulceration, thrombosis, haemorrhage and aneurysmal dilatation.</p>
                        
                        <ol type="i">
                            <li><strong>Calcification.</strong> Occur in advanced atheromatous plaques, especially in the aorta and coronaries.</li>
                            <li><strong>Ulceration.</strong> The layers covering the soft pultaceous material of an atheroma may ulcerate as a result of haemodynamic forces or mechanical trauma. This results in discharge of emboli composed of lipid material and debris into the blood stream, leaving a shallow, ragged ulcer.</li>
                            <li><strong>Thrombosis.</strong> Ulcerated plaque and areas of endothelial damage are vulnerable sites for formation of superimposed thrombi. Thrombi may get dislodged to become emboli and lodge elsewhere in the circulation, or may get organised and incorporated into the arterial wall as mural thrombi. Mural thrombi may become occlusive thrombi which may subsequently recanalise.</li>
                            <li><strong>Haemorrhage.</strong> Intimal haemorrhage may occur in an atheromatous plaque either from the blood in the vascular lumen or from rupture of thin-walled capillaries that vascularise the atheroma, is a common complication in coronary arteries.</li>
                            <li><strong>Aneurysm formation.</strong> Advanced lesions are associated with secondary changes in the media and adventitia. The changes in media include atrophy and thinning of the media and fragmentation of internal elastic lamina. The adventitia undergoes fibrosis. These changes cause weakening in the arterial wall resulting in aneurysmal dilatation.</li>
