                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Diagnosis of SCD is based on clinical presentation, personal and family history, clinical features (signs/symptoms) and laboratory testing. In this section, we describe the clinical presentation that a clinician should be able to pick and suspect SCD especially during the first contact with a health care facility. The importance of drawing the family pedigree through thorough history taking so as to ascertain the family history for the condition is emphasized.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Clinical Features</h3>
                        <p>The spectrum of clinical expression is heterogeneous with some people having mild disease while others present with complications. These include:</p>
                        
                        <h4>Acute presentation</h4>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Vaso-occlusive crisis especially painful crisis:</strong> dactylitis (painful swelling of hands and feet), severe back pain, pain localized to specific limbs (upper or lower limbs), chest pain or abdominal pain</li>
                            <li><strong>Other vaso-occlusive crises</strong> such as acute chest syndrome (fever with new onset shortness of breath), stroke (manifest as weakness of limbs depending on region affected or other neurological sequalae), priapism</li>
                            <li><strong>Haemolytic crisis:</strong> symptomatic anemia presenting as fatigue/extreme tiredness or decreased activity or irritability with increasing jaundice (yellowness of eyes, palms and soles of feet in pediatric population)</li>
                            <li><strong>Aplastic crisis:</strong> symptomatic anemia as described above usually resulting from parvovirus B19</li>
                            <li><strong>Sequestration crisis:</strong> notable increase in spleen or liver size more so in paediatric age group. This can result in symptomatic anemia with or without hemodynamic instability</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p><em>NB: the above may be associated with infective process presenting with fever.</em></p>

                        <h4>Chronic presentation:</h4>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Gallstones sometimes predisposing to acute cholecystitis</li>
                            <li>Chronic leg ulcers</li>
                            <li>Avascular necrosis of the head of the femur causing limping with shortened limb</li>

                        <p>The laboratory diagnosis of sickle cell disease can be considered as neonatal screening and diagnosis after the neonatal period as discussed below:</p>
                        
                        <h3>Neonatal Screening</h3>
                        <p>To determine the Hb type through separation techniques on extracted material from dried blood spots. Initial newborn screening test results should be confirmed by follow-up studies with a different method for Hb separation (see Figure 1: Neonatal Screening Algorithm). Tests used for newborn screening include Isoelectric Focusing (IEF), High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) or Haemoglobin Electrophoresis described in more details below.</p>
                        
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_09_20_93d02985464b31ed1659g-16-1.jpg" alt="Algorithm for pre-neonatal period screening for Sickle Cell Disease." class="content-image">

                        </figure>

                        <h3>Diagnosis after the Neonatal Period</h3>
                        <p>This is through careful assessment of the clinical features, complete blood count, reticulocyte count, peripheral blood morphology and Hb separation techniques, family studies and if necessary, genetic testing. This diagnosis is categorized into preliminary tests and confirmatory tests. (See Figure 2: Post Neonatal Period Screening) for the diagnosis algorithm.</p>
                        
                        <h4>1. Preliminary Tests</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>a. Full blood counts, reticulocyte counts, blood film morphology:</strong> In the blood counts the main features are a reduction in the Hb (anaemia) that could be normocytic or macrocytic (with increased hemolysis or for patients on Hydroxyurea). Microcytic red blood cells may occur in SCD if it co-exists with beta thalassemia, or iron deficiency. The reticulocyte count is raised due to hemolysis that occurs with the disease. On peripheral smear, irreversibly sickled RBCs may be seen, polychromasia and presence of nucleated red blood cells which are in keeping with the hemolytic process. RBC inclusions -Howell Jolly bodies - that may indicate splenic dysfunction may be seen.</li>
                            <li><strong>b. Sickling Test:</strong> This test can be easily performed in a laboratory at lower level facilities. The test will be positive in individuals with Sickle Cell Disease as well as in Sickle Cell Trait. Hb separation technique is necessary once it is positive as it does not distinguish the different forms of SCD. This test should, however, NOT be used for screening newborns and is not advisable for children as it may give false negative results due to elevated HbF levels. The test is also of no added value if the blood film morphology shows Sickle Cells.</li>
                            <li><strong>c. Haemoglobin Solubility Test:</strong> This method detects the presence of HbS and will be positive in individuals with homozygous forms (HBSS) heterozygous forms (HbSC, HbSβ-thalassaemia) and in SCT. False negative tests may occur due to high levels of foetal haemoglobin (i.e. low concentrations of Hb S) in infants with SCD. This test can be performed in the lower level laboratories. An Hb separation technique is necessary once it is positive as it does not distinguish the different forms of SCD. The test is of no added value if the blood film morphology shows sickle cells.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>2. Confirmatory Tests</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>a. Haemoglobin Electrophoresis (HE):</strong> This is one of the Hb separation methods and here the determination of the type of Hb depends on the migration of the different forms through a medium that conducts electricity when subjected to an electrical field. The final position of a haemoglobin type depends on the pH of the medium and the charge of the haemoglobin molecule. Capillary HE allows for differentiation as well as quantification of the different types of haemoglobin. This test can be performed at level 4 facilities and above.</li>
                            <li><strong>b. High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC):</strong> HPLC allows for quantification of normal and variant haemoglobins even at low concentrations, enabling differentiation of Hb Sβ0 and Hb Sβ+ thalassaemia from HBSS as well as identification of compound heterozygous disorders such as Hb S-HPFH (hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin). It may be used for neonatal screening. This test can be performed at level 4 facilities and above.</li>
                            <li><strong>c. Isoelectric Focusing (IEF):</strong> This is a type of electrophoresis that is used for separation of different types of haemoglobin. It is often used for neonatal diagnosis.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4>3. Point of care rapid tests</h4>
                        <p>Several rapid point of care tests are available in the market and have been shown to have high specificity and sensitivity when compared to the HPLC¹⁰. These are useful at the lower level facilities where more conventional Hb separation techniques are unavailable and rapid results are needed. These tests will identify Hb A, Hb S, Hb C. However, they cannot quantify the different haemoglobins or identify accurately other forms of SCD such as Hb Sβ-thalassaemia. Confirmation of the results can be done using Hb electrophoresis, HPLC or IEF. These tests are useful in the identification of SCT/ carriers.</p>
                        
                        <h4>4. Other ancillary laboratory investigations useful in detection and monitoring of the disease include:</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>a. Biochemical changes include elevated levels of Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH), low haptoglobin, high total indirect bilirubin and mildly high aspartate aminotransferase (AST).</li>
                            <li>b. DNA analysis using Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) are used for prenatal, preimplantation diagnosis or in situation where haemoglobinopathy cannot be confirmed by the special hematological tests.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <span class="heading-text">Management Principles</span>
                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Management of patients with SCD requires a multidisciplinary approach in order to cater for acute and chronic complications of the disease. Comprehensive management of SCD is a group of evidence-based interventions that are geared towards reduction of morbidity and mortality from the disease and improve quality of care of these patients and their families.</p>
                        <p>Comprehensive care of SCD begins with appropriate diagnosis preferably during the newborn period; the start of penicillin prophylaxis started before the age of 2 months and continued upto 5 years; immunization practices; safe transfusion practices; psychosocial support for the patient and families; nutritional support with folic acid supplementation; appropriate pain management; routine follow up clinics; hydroxyurea use and screening for chronic complications of SCD.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Newborn Screening for SCD</h3>
                        <p>The best approach is to have nationwide screening of all newborns for SCD but this comes with challenges of limited resources. Inclusion of children born at home has a financial implication to the health budget. A targeted approach where all newborns in high endemic areas are tested shortly after birth and early screening and testing of suspected children in potentially low endemic areas may be used as an alternative. The Cooperative Study of Sickle Cell Disease study (CSSD) identified that most of the children with sickle cell disease died before their second birthday due to infection and anemia hence the need to identify these patients even before they shown signs of disease.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Penicillin Prophylaxis</h3>
                        <p>Patients with SCD are prone to infection and death from encapsulated bacterial organisms like Streptococcal pneumoniae due to splenic dysfunction that occurs within the first 5 years of life. It is therefore recommended that children with SCD should have penicillin prophylaxis started within 2 months of life and continued until 5 years of age. However, for patients who have had surgical splenectomy, it is given for life. Its use may be continued until later in life for children who have had more than two episodes of severe pneumonia. The dose of Penicillin V is as follows:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Children less than 3 years: Penicillin V syrup 125mg twice daily</li>
                            <li>Children more than 3 years: Penicillin V syrup/tablets 250 mg twice daily</li>
                            <li>Patients with penicillin hypersensitivity may use erythromycin as an alternative</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Immunization Practices</h3>
                        <p>Children with SCD are should get all the vaccines as per the Kenya Expanded Programme on Immunization which covers infectious diseases that are relevant to SCD like Streptococcal pneumonia, Hemophilus influenza type B and Hepatitis B. It is however recommended that they get additional vaccines and boosters as follows:</p>

                        <h3>Hydroxyurea Use</h3>
                        <p>The CSSD study was a landmark prospective cohort study that demonstrated the benefits conferred by use of hydroxyurea in SCD like reducing painful crisis, blood transfusion and infection in patients with SCD. The Ped- HUG and Baby- HUG trials have also demonstrated the benefits of hydroxyurea use in children with no safety concerns. The REACH trial in which Kenya was one of the four participant countries, also confirmed the clinical benefits hydroxyurea in children with sickle cell disease and co-morbidities like malaria and malnutrition and also did not show any safety concerns in these patients.</p>

                        <p>Laboratory monitoring of patients on hydroxyurea requires a full blood count done every 8-12 weeks and liver functions tests done every 12 weeks initially until when on a stable dose and thereafter when necessary.</p>
                        <p>The approaches of Hydroxyurea dosage include:</p>
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li><strong>Standard dosing:</strong> In this approach a fixed dose is selected within the recommended range and used for patients without escalation for example a dose of 20 mg/Kg/day (unless dose limiting toxicity is experienced).</li>
                            <li><strong>Escalating dose to maximum tolerable dose:</strong> In this approach, patients are started on the lower therapeutic range and the dose increased every 8-12 weeks until the dose limiting toxicity (myelosuppression or hepatotoxicity) is experienced or until a maximum of 35 mg/kg/day is reached.</li>
                            <li>Hydroxyurea is available mainly as capsules which have limitations when used in children with challenges in dosing and administration occur. Liquid formulations (syrup) can be prepared and have a shelf life of between 14-90 days thus making hydroxyurea use in pediatrics practical.</li>

                        <h3>Blood Transfusion in SCD</h3>
                        <p>Blood transfusion is a key therapeutic modality in SCD. All staff involved in the prescription and administration of blood and blood products must be familiar with the NBTS transfusion guideline. Blood transfusion in the emergency will serves to increase the oxygen-carrying capacity and to reduce vaso-occlusive complications. Blood transfusion may be through a simple (top-up) transfusion or exchange transfusion. Exchange transfusion is used to reduce the concentration of HbS in circulation (usually to <30%) without increasing the haematocrit or whole blood viscosity. This is required in some complications of the disease such as treatment of acute ischemic stroke, acute chest syndrome (ACS), priapism or peri-operatively. Exchange transfusion may be performed using the manual method or by using apheresis equipment.</p>

                        <h3>Chronic Transfusion Therapy</h3>
                        <p>The aim of chronic transfusion therapy is to keep the HbS level <30% (depending on the clinical situation). This can be achieved by regular top up transfusions keeping the Hb between 10-11g/dl, typically every 3-6 weeks. Note that iron overload must be prevented/ managed. See annex 2 Iron chelators to be considered during transfusion. This can be measured using HPLC and Hb Iso-electrophoresis.</p>

                        <p>One of the hallmarks of SCD is vaso-occlusive crisis for which pain is the most distressing symptom for most patients and their families. Each institution, requires to adopt pain assessment tools and administer pain medications as early as possible as recommended by the World Health Organization ladder, round the clock, and by the patient. Below are some pain assessment tools that can be used depending on the patient's age and other characteristics.</p>

                        <p>Parents can be taught how to use analgesics like paracetamol and Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) and other non-pharmacological methods at home. However, for patients in the hospital, pain needs to be assessed as the fifth vital sign and managed appropriately. The fear of addiction that health care workers have when using opioids in children with SCD has been shown to be unreal and uncontrolled pain found to have negative effects on patients.</p>
                        <p>The availability of opioids like morphine requires to be addressed in order to manage SCD pain appropriately. Several formulations like intravenous/ patches/oral forms (in tablets/ syrup) need to be availed.</p>

                        <h3>Psychosocial Support</h3>
                        <p>SCD is a chronic disease with many challenges to the patient and their families. Patients go through periods of pain, requirements for inpatient care with separation from their families or daily activities, physiological changes in their bodies due to the chronic hemolysis and the potential threat of SCD complications. Parents experience guilt of having passed the sickle cell gene to their child, challenges of watching their children experience the complications of SCD like pain, absenteeism from work as they regularly seek health care for their children and the financial drain of the disease. Adults with SCD sometimes also experience stigma when choosing marital partners and when making career choices. This necessitates that patients and their families are offered psychosocial support within the healthcare system or as part of patient support groups.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Nutritional Support</h3>
                        <p>SCD patients should eat diets with healthy nutritious foods just like other normal children. Parents should be encouraged to give their children plenty of water or fluids. Folic acid supplementation is necessary due to its increased demand from the chronic hemolysis.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Malaria Prophylaxis</h3>
                        <p>SCD patients are susceptible to malaria infection which may have serious consequences. It is recommended that for patients living in high transmission malaria areas or non-immune individuals that prophylactic antimalarial drugs are used in addition to the general precautions (e.g. use of insecticide treated mosquito nets and environmental measures). Patients living in low malarial transmission zones do not require prophylaxis. Below are recommendations of the drugs that can be used for malaria prophylaxis:</p>

                        <h3>Care to be Commenced at First Visit</h3>
                        <p>Clinical care to be commenced at first visit include: health education on the disease, appropriate drugs and clear plans for all subsequent follow-ups. Their immunization program should also be communicated to cater for routine and SCD specific requirements. The diagram below shows a summary of the care plan.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Education:</strong> Educate family (including child) on disease causation complications, need to comply with clinic visits and medications. Family issues including siblings and when the child is old enough some reproductive health issues.</li>
                            <li><strong>Drugs*:</strong> Folic acid, Malaria prophylaxis if residing in high risk regions, Penicillin V or Erythromycin in cases of penicillin allergy.</li>
                            <li><strong>Vaccinations*:</strong> Ensure routine program up-to date. Pneumococcal based on schedule status and age (see below).</li>
                            <li><strong>Planning future care:</strong> Generally, monthly and bimonthly clinic visits are recommended for stable children under 2 and over 2 years respectively. Thereafter visits should be individualized. The patient can however visit the clinic at ANY TIME for medical, educational or psychosocial concerns.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>Not ALL services listed below need to be provided on each attendance. Always check that the child has had everything done on the new-patient list; due to the nature of a new-patient attendance it is not always possible to have achieved everything at that first appointment.</p>
                         <ul>
                            <li><strong>Comprehensive History:</strong> All the components of history included in figure 4 are performed here as well.
