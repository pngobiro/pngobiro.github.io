                            <li>Opioid analgesics- used judiciously to avoid potential respiratory depression.</li>
                            <li>$2 / 3$ of pts with SCD have $\uparrow$ airway reactivity .</li>
                            <li>Use inhaled $\beta$ agonist in pts with wheezing, severe resp distress, clinical or x-ray evidence of hyperinflation, or prior h/o asthma or obstructive airway disease.</li>
                            <li>vigorous hydration in combination with opioid analgesics can lead to pulmonary edema.</li>
                            <li>frequent clinical evaluation of these pts is required, and the maintenance of a euvolemic state is the Rx goal.</li>
                            <li>Exchange transfusion- setting of progressive infiltrates and hypoxemia refractory to conventional RX.</li>
                            <li>$\downarrow$ of HbS level to $<30 \%$, hct of $\sim 30$ percent\%, leads to marked improvement in majority.</li>
                            <li>empiric anticoagulant RX not recommended unless thromboembolic phenomena documented- $\uparrow$ risk of intracranial and renal bleeding.</li>

                            <li>Aplasia is the result of direct cytotoxicity of the parvovirus to erythroid precursors, especially colony-forming units, erythroid (CFU-E)</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>early phase - peripheral blood reticulocytes and bone marrow normoblasts disappear or are greatly reduced in number.</li>
                            <li>cessation of erythropoiesis is followed by a rapid $\downarrow$ in Hb .(Red cell survival in HbS 10-20 days)</li>
                            <li>Self-limited</li>
                            <li>Within 5-10 days, RBC production resumes $\rightarrow$ reticulocytosis and nucleated RBCs in peripheral blood.</li>
                            <li>Often, the patient is first seen early in recovery phase-so differentiation from a hemolytic crisis may be difficult.</li>
                            <li>Although leukocytes and platelets are usually normal, all marrow elements may be affected .</li>
                            <li>Rx- supportive care with red cell transfusion when necessary.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3>Splenic Sequestration</h3>
                        <p>characterized by sudden trapping of blood in the spleen.</p>
                        <ul>

                            <li>occurs in infants and young children whose spleens are chronically enlarged before autoinfarction and fibrosis.</li>
                            <li>commonly in second 6 months of life and rare after 2 yrs .</li>
                            <li>has been documented in infants as young as 3 and 4 months of age.</li>

                            <li>may have an earlier onset of splenomegaly and a lower level of Hb F at 6 months of age.</li>
                            <li>often associated with respiratory tract infections or rarely, parvovirus B19 in conjunction with an aplastic crisis .</li>
                            <li>Already enlarged spleen rapidly $\uparrow$ in size at the expense of blood volume; hypovolemic shock and death may occur within hrs.</li>
                            <li>Pertinent pm finding is engorgement of splenic sinusoids with sickled cells.</li>
                            <li>Survivors have a tendency for recurrent episodes until 5 or 6 years of age, by which time fibrosis of the spleen has occurred to limit its expansion.</li>
                            <li>Rarely, sudden trapping of blood in the liver (hepatic sequestration crisis) also may occur.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3>Hyperhemolytic Crises.</h3>

                            <li>Described in association with hereditary spherocytosis and mycoplasma infection.</li>
                            <li>Rare in G6PD, due to young mean age of sickle RBCs.</li>
                            <li>Increased lipid peroxidation of sickle RBCs by reactive O2 species derived from activated neutrophils is another possible mechanism for infection-associated hemolytic crises.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3>Megaloblastic Crises</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>sudden arrest of erythropoiesis by folate depletion .</li>
                            <li>Chronic erythroid hyperplasia imposes a drain on folate reserves.</li>
                            <li>occurs when food intake is interrupted by illness, alcoholism or when the folate requirement is augmented by rapid growth or pregnancy.</li>
                            <li>Rare- due to common practice to give prophylactic folate ( $1 \mathrm{mg} /$ day) to pts with SCD</li>
