                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h3>The Health Care Providers</h3>
                        <p>A trained counsellor should be able to perform this task. Although they are few, capacity building will be done to train others to provide this service. This can be achieved with laypersons and paraprofessionals. Individuals selected for this task must possess certain personal qualities including good communication skills, engaging personality and the discipline to limit information transmission to what has been approved for them to provide.</p>

                        <h3>Identifications of Different Needs</h3>
                        <p>Children and teens with SCD and their families may need academic and vocational guidance as well as advice on recreational activities and travel. The basic premise is that parents should treat their affected child as normally as possible and they should encourage activities that foster self-esteem and self-reliance. These feelings will help children and adolescents to cope more effectively with their illness. Educational materials should be provided to teachers and other school officials who interact regularly with children with SCD. School personnel should meet with the parents to set realistic educational goals. Illness often interrupts schooling and extracurricular activities, so tutoring or other assistance may be needed. Unless impaired by cerebrovascular disease, children with SCD have normal intelligence and should be encouraged to reach their full potential. Vocational counseling is important for adolescents and adults with SCD. The long-term goal is to prepare the child with SCD for independent living. Introducing children and adolescents to adults with SCD who have coped successfully with their illness has a positive effect.</p>

                        <h3>Prenatal</h3>
                        <p>Availability of prenatal diagnosis offers the family choices regarding the continuation of pregnancy. When decision is made to continue, the practitioner has time to assist the family in preparing for the arrival of a child with SCD. This time must be spent educating the parents and family about the disease and the need for family and community support. The better educated the family and the community, the better care the patient will receive. Many communities have SCD support groups that provide an avenue for sharing anxieties as well as helpful information. Whenever possible, satisfactory housing, accessible optimal medical care and reliable transportation must be planned before the baby arrives.</p>

                        <h3>Infancy</h3>
                        <p>Health insurance, emergency transportation, housing and anxiety about recognizing symptoms are some of the issues new parents may need help acknowledging and addressing. Frequent clinic visits and home visits will allow the opportunity for parents and providers to establish a comfortable relationship to address these issues and help establish an ongoing pattern of compliance. Although advances in medical research have increased the chances for longevity, lack of understanding on the part of providers may result in inappropriate treatment plans that defy adherence. The establishment of clinical practice guidelines in SCD has decreased but not eliminated preventable deaths. In addition, non-compliance may undermine the best care plans.</p>

                        <h3>Travel, Sports and Fun Activities</h3>
                        <p>Patients should be encouraged to exercise regularly on a self-limited basis. School-age children should participate in physical education but they should be allowed to rest if they tire and encouraged to drink fluids after exercise. The potential risks of strenuous exertion should be discussed with the patient.</p>
                        <p>Children and adolescents may engage in competitive athletics with caution because signs of fatigue may be overlooked in the heat of competition. Coaches are advised against blanket exclusion from participation or excessive demands for athletic excellence. Patients with SCD should dress warmly in cold weather and avoid swimming in cold water. Patients or families should seek advice on the best modes of travel. Flying in pressurized aircrafts usually poses no problems for sickle cell patients. However, they should dress warmly to adjust for the cool temperature inside, drink plenty of fluids and move about frequently when possible. On the other hand, travel above 15,000 feet in non-pressurized vehicles, mountain climbing, hiking or deep sea diving or staying under water without breathing (static apnea) can induce vasoocclusive complications. Ordinary travel by car, bus or train is not associated with increased risk of complications although frequent rest and refreshment is good.</p>

                        <h3>Transition to Adolescence</h3>
                        <p>Adolescence is a difficult time of life for youngsters with chronic diseases. While their peers become independent, teenagers with SCD may need frequent help due to illness. They can become frustrated and have trouble expressing their feelings. Concern about issues such as body size, sexual function, pain management and death often is expressed as rebellion, depression or refusal to heed treatment.</p>
                        <p>Adolescents should be advised not to use tobacco, alcohol and illegal drugs. Post pubertal adolescents should be educated about sexuality, safe sex practices and use of condoms to prevent sexually transmitted diseases.</p>
                        <p>Girls should be counseled about the risks of pregnancy in women with SCD, safe birth control practices and merits of pregnancy at the right age and social circumstances. Adolescents may view their long-time pediatric health care providers as too close to their parents and not speak frankly to them. In this case, families could be referred to adolescent medicine specialists to discuss sensitive issues and prepare for adulthood. Alternatively, adolescents may be more open to express their concerns through "teen support groups."</p>

                            <li><strong>Care Level 1: The Primary Health Care</strong>
                                <p>The facilities at this level include communities, dispensaries and the health centres. The care offered here shall be basic. These shall mainly be identification of persons with sickle cell disease in the community and referral to the next level of care. The players shall include community members, community health workers and nurses whose responsibility is to identify, use a family tree to map out the likely patients and provide basic health care as per CHW package, physiotherapy, psychosocial support and health education.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Care Level 2: Satellite Treatment Centres</strong>
                                <p>All the primary 47 County referral hospitals are in this category. Treatment and follow up will be provided in all these hospitals. All the identified and mapped satellite treatment centres will be linked vertically to the more advanced County referral hospitals and horizontally. The technical level of expertise shall require a nurse, medical doctor, dentist, pharmacist, clinical officer and physiotherapist trained to care for persons with sickle cell disease. A consultant medical specialist, paediatrician, physician or other equivalents should provide leadership and coordinate the activities within the county.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Care Level 3: Mid-level care/ Intermediate Centres/ Comprehensive Care Centres</strong>
                                <p>These are Regional County referral facilities that are slightly more equipped. These shall be more capacitated and located in hot spot areas with staff that shall provide additional laboratory and clinical care. Treatment and follow up will also be provided in these centres on case by case basis.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Care Level 4: Advanced Care Centres</strong>
                                <p>Advanced level of care centres shall be able to handle complicated cases, specialized treatment and routine follow-up on case by case basis. Currently, Moi Teaching Referral Hospital and Kenyatta National Hospital are the only facilities providing advanced Sickle Cell Disease care. To increase accessibility, Coast General Hospital and Jaramogi Oginga Odinga Referral Hospital shall be included to this level of care to serve more regions.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Centres of Excellence</strong>
                                <p>SCD Centres of Excellence shall be established. They will be dedicated centres that will offer comprehensive care for SCD as offered in Level 4 care. Additionally, they should be able to perform research and training of subspecialists for SCD care alongside provision of advanced care such as stem cell and bone marrow transplants. These shall be Kenyatta National, Kenyatta University Teaching and Moi Teaching and Referral Hospitals.</p>

                        <p>Investigations to be performed prior to admission for transfusion are:</p>
                        <ol type="i">
                            <li>Full blood count</li>

                        </ol>

                        <h4>Operative Preparation</h4>
                        <p>Informed consent is needed from the care giver in liaison with a Haematologist/physician as directed in the national transfusion guidelines.</p>
                        <p>Do not attempt to raise the haemoglobin level by more than 4 g/dl at any one transfusion. The usual rate of transfusion is 2-3 ml/kg/hour and for elective transfusion, should never exceed a maximum rate of 150 ml/hour. For post-transfusion, check full blood count and HbA/S ratio. Additional annual investigations include HBsAg, level of anti-HBs Ab (revaccinate if less than 100 IU/ml), HCV Ab and HIV.</p>

                        <h4>Preliminary Investigations:</h4>
                        <ol type="i">
                            <li>Full blood count</li>

                            <li>Cross-match approximately 30 mls/kg (average unit contains 220-250mls)</li>
                            <li>Request exchange transfusion blood from laboratory. It will need to be ABO, Rh and Kell matched and sickle negative</li>
                            <li>Urea, electrolytes, creatinine, liver function tests and Calcium</li>
                            <li>Arterial blood gases in patients with symptoms suggestive of ACS or girdle syndrome</li>

                        <h3>Annex 2: Iron Chelators to be Considered During Transfusion</h3>
                        <h4>Overview</h4>
                        <p>Based on available evidence¹⁶⁻¹⁷ on Desferrioxamine (DFO), Deferiprone (DFP), Deferasirox (DFX), combination of DFO and DFP should be made available as treatment options for patients who have Sickle Cell Disease and have iron overload caused by transfusions.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Desferrioxamine (DFO)</h4>
                        <p>Can be used from the age of 2 years and is administered parenterally (subcutaneous infusions 8-12 hours of a 10% DFO solution, using an infusion pump for at least 5 days per week). Recommended starting point is when the serum ferritin levels reach 1000 μg/L or after the first 10-20 transfusions due to the fears that toxicity would have on growth of ears and eyes at low levels of body iron. Standard dosing is 20-40 mg/kg for children and up to 50-60 mg/kg for adults per day. For rescue therapy where iron overload has already happened, doses of over 50 mg/kg are required to achieve negative iron balance.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Deferiprone (DFP)</h4>
                        <p>Can be used from the age 6 years and is administered orally at 75 mg/kg/day, given in three doses. Each 500 mg tablet is scored to facilitate tablet splitting. An oral solution is also available for paediatric use. Adjustments may be made based on the patient's response but should never exceed 33 mg three times daily.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Deferasirox (DFX)</h4>
                        <p>Can be used from the age of 2 years and is administered as an oral suspension preferably before meals. It is used as a first-line monotherapy in many countries. A starting dose of 20 mg/kg is recommended for patients who have received 10-20 transfusion episodes and currently receive standard transfusion at rates of 0.3-0.5 mg of iron/kg/day. For normal transfusion use more than 0.5 mg/kg/day. In patients with pre-existing high levels of iron loading, use of 30 mg/kg/day is recommended. Higher doses of up to 40 mg/kg/day are recommended for rescue therapy that can be divided into two daily doses.</p>

                        <h4>Combined DFO and DFP</h4>
                        <p>Combinations of these two drugs are useful, especially when various monotherapy regimes have failed to control either liver iron or cardiac iron. In general, if a patient is not doing well with DFP monotherapy, combined treatment offers an additional option to improve iron balance. Specialist haematologist should work with a clinical pharmacist for dose calculations and adjustments. See table 11 for specific guidance¹⁸.</p>
