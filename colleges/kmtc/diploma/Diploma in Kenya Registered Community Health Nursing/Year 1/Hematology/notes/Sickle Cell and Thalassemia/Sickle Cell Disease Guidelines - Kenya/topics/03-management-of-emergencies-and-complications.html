                            <li>Encourage oral fluids first, it should be used whenever possible.</li>
                            <li>Give IV fluids if the patient is unable to drink well, has severe pain, abdominal symptoms, or is not settling.</li>
                            <li>Stop IV fluids when the patient is stable, and pain is controlled.</li>
                            <li>Maintain a strict input/output chart for every patient.</li>
                            <li>Any crystalloids with sugar can be used. In children 5% Dextrose + 0.45% saline is preferred with a review needed for added potassium as per the Basic Paediatric Protocols 2016 for fluid management.</li>

                            <li><strong>Management:</strong>
                                <p><strong>Admit and monitor:</strong> Hourly Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), Vital signs (BP, Pulse, RR, SO₂ Saturation), Hydrate with up to 60% maintenance.</p>
                                <p><strong>Perform:</strong> Exchange transfusion within 4 hours of admission or if delay expected then give top-up transfusion within 4 hours aiming to achieve HbS <30%. This can be repeated depending on neurological status and HbS level.</p>
                                <p><strong>Supportive care (as indicated):</strong> Antibiotics or Acyclovir for Bacterial or viral meningitis, Antimalarials as necessary, Anticonvulsants for convulsions, Dexamethasone for increased intracranial pressure.</p>
                            </li>

                        <h3>Priapism</h3>
                        <p>A persistent penile erection that continues hours beyond or is unrelated to sexual stimulation. In childhood, males with SCD need to know that priapism is one aspect of SCD and they should tell their parents or guardians/doctor if it occurs. If this condition is untreated it can result in impotence in the future. It can be triggered by sexual activity or full bladder.</p>

                            <li><strong>At the initial evaluation:</strong> Document the time of onset, Document precipitating factors e.g. trauma, infection, use of drugs (e.g. alcohol, psychotropic agents, sildenafil, testosterone, cocaine).</li>
                            <li><strong>Further Steps:</strong> Increase fluid intake, Analgesia and anxiolytic agents e.g diazepam, Catheterize and attempt micturition, Walking and warm baths may also help avert early priapism.</li>
                            <li><strong>Refer:</strong> For episodes lasting more than 2 hours, patient should be transferred directly to the referral hospital with senior practitioners able to provide the necessary haematological and urological interventions.</li>

                        <h3>Orthopaedic</h3>
                        <p>The most common orthopaedic complications of SCD are related to vaso-occlusion (avascular necrosis) or infections (osteomyelitis and septic arthritis).</p>
                        <h4>Avascular Necrosis</h4>
                        <p>Pain in the hip or groin referred to leg or knee on movement; later at rest, repeated or prolonged pain for more than 8 weeks should be investigated for aseptic necrosis. Proximal humeral changes may be seen in shoulders as an incidental finding on CXR. Limitation of movement particularly; abduction, external rotation of the hip joint and external rotation of the shoulder.</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                             <li><strong>Differential diagnosis:</strong> Osteomyelitis/Septic arthritis suggested by pyrexia, systemic illness and positive blood cultures.</li>
                             <li><strong>Investigations:</strong> X-ray, MRI.</li>
                             <li><strong>Supportive Management:</strong> Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents ± codeine derivatives, Rest, Avoid bearing weights.</li>
                             <li><strong>Definitive Management:</strong> Refer to orthopaedic surgeon.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4>Osteomyelitis/Septic Arthritis</h4>
                        <p>The diagnosis of osteomyelitis in the context of SCD differs slightly from the general population in microbiology. Though the ranking of bacterial aetiology is the same, Salmonella is more frequent in this group. Presents with: unusual swelling and/or pain, fevers and persistent signs of inflammation around the site (redness, tenderness, warmth, swelling).</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                             <li><strong>Investigations:</strong> Full blood count, CRP, ESR, Blood cultures, X-Ray, Ultra sound and MRI of affected bone, Joint aspiration.</li>
                             <li><strong>Management:</strong> A decision is taken to treat for osteomyelitis. Refer to orthopaedic surgeon; appropriate antibiotics should be chosen according to prevailing guidelines.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Renal and Ophthalmic</h3>
                        <p>Renal and ophthalmological complications, capable of threatening quality of life and/or causing death are seen in long standing disease.</p>
                        <h4>Renal Complications</h4>
                        <p>Renal involvement can occur throughout the life of an individual with sickle cell disease.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Common manifestations of Sickle Cell Nephropathy:</strong> Hyposthenuria (urine concentration abnormalities), Microalbuminuria or proteinuria, Haematuria, Acute or Chronic Kidney Disease and End-stage Renal Disease, Medullary Carcinoma.</li>
                            <li><strong>Recommended diagnostic tests before referral:</strong> Urine for Microalbuminuria, 24-hour urine protein determination if proteinuria, 24-hour urine creatinine clearance, Serum Electrolytes.</li>
                            <li><strong>Management:</strong> Should be referred to appropriate experts to manage as per existing guidelines.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4>Ophthalmic Complications</h4>
                        <p>Ophthalmic complications can occur any time in life but are more often seen after the age of 10 years. Ophthalmic complications are relatively common and may occur in any vascular bed of the eye and may not be detected at their early stages unless an eye examination is performed annually. An INDIRECT fundoscopy should be done at least once a year. Examination of the fundus should be performed annually.</p>
                        <p>This examination can be done by a specialist ophthalmologist or a clinical officer with additional one-week training on indirect fundoscopy. Currently, the following facilities have this service: Sabatia Eye Hospital, Tenwek Hospital, Kenyatta National Hospital, Light House Mombasa and Kwale Eye Centre.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>If there is no sickle cell retinopathy, annual check ups suffice.</li>
                            <li>Check ups every 6 months are recommended if there is non-proliferative sickle cell retinopathy.</li>
                            <li>Monthly check ups are recommended for proliferative sickle cell retinopathy.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>If ophthalmic complications are identified or suspected the patient should be referred to the nearest ophthalmology services available.</p>
