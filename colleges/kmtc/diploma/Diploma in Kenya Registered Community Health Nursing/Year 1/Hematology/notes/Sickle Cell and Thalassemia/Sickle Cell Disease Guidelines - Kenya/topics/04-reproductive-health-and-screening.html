                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Sickle Cell Disease adversely affects the course of pregnancy, childbirth and puerperium. It is therefore important that men, women and mothers are aware of SCD and its effects on their reproductive health. Educational and health promotion counseling should be provided to all women and men of childbearing age to reduce reproductive risk and improve pregnancy outcomes. Trained healthcare workers should undertake counselling on health promotion and prevention of complications arising from sickle cell disease, childbirth and thereafter. Where the partner of a man or woman with SCD has unknown SCD status, a screening/test for haemoglobinopathy should be carried out at the nearest health facility offering that service. After testing, couples who are at risk for having a potentially affected fetus and neonate should be referred to a specialist for genetic counseling and care.</p>
                        <p>In women with SCD, regular use of contraception can decrease the health risks associated with an unintended pregnancy.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Progestin-only contraceptives (pills, injections, and implants), levonorgestrel IUDs, and barrier methods have no restrictions or concerns for use in women with SCD.</li>
                            <li>If the benefits are considered to outweigh the risks, combined hormonal contraceptives (pills, patches, and rings) may be used in women with SCD.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Pregnancy in women with SCD is considered high risk; there is an increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes including intrauterine growth restriction, pre-term delivery and still birth. Risks to the mother include an increased frequency of pain crises and an increased risk of thrombosis, infections, pre-eclampsia and death in comparison to women who do not have SCD¹². It is therefore important that a woman with SCD be seen prior to conception and be followed throughout pregnancy, childbirth and puerperium to improve pregnancy outcomes for the mother and baby.</p>

                        <h3>a. Pre-conceptual counseling should include:</h3>
                        <p>Partner screening for haemoglobinopathies, analgesic dependency, transfusion history, discussion of mode of delivery, immunization history and neonatal screening.</p>

                        <h3>b. Investigations</h3>
                        <p>Beyond the minimum prenatal profiles these patients should have the following:</p>
                        <ol type="i">
                            <li>Haemoglobin level at every clinic visit</li>
                            <li>Urea and electrolytes to screen for sickle cell nephropathy</li>
                            <li>Screening for red cell allo-antibodies</li>
                            <li>Echocardiogram, if possible, to screen for pulmonary hypertension.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3>c. Ante-natal Management</h3>
                        <ol type="i">
                            <li>Folic acid should be given once daily both pre-conceptually and throughout pregnancy. If there is laboratory confirmation of iron deficiency by serum iron levels, iron should be prescribed</li>
                            <li>Hydroxyurea should be stopped at least three months before conception</li>
                            <li>Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) and angiotensin receptor blockers should be stopped before conception</li>
                            <li>Women with SCD should be considered for low dose aspirin 75 mg once daily from 12 weeks of gestation and be advised to receive prophylactic low molecular weight heparin during antenatal admissions</li>
                            <li>Persistent vomiting with dehydration increases the probability of a sickle cell crisis, therefore they should be advised to seek medical attention early.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3>d. Intra-partum management¹³</h3>
                        <ol type="i">
                            <li>Women with SCD should be advised to give birth in hospital where a haematologist is available</li>
                            <li>At 38+0 weeks, an elective normal delivery can be induced or elective caesarean surgery if indicated</li>
                            <li>Opiate analgesia except Pethidine can be used to complement regional analgesia for caesarean sections</li>
                            <li>Adequate hydration must always be maintained</li>
                            <li>Oxygen saturation should be sustained at above 94% during delivery</li>
                            <li>Perioperative complications of surgery in SCD patients include hypoxia, dehydration, bone pain crisis, significant anemia, and acute chest syndrome</li>
                            <li>Prophylactic antibiotics must be given on time and therapeutic doses should be given early enough to avoid complications arising from especially atypical bacteria and/or nosocomial infections</li>
                            <li>Other strategies to improve perioperative outcomes in SCD include conservative preoperative blood transfusion therapy, epidural analgesia, adequate postoperative pain control with opiate and non-opiate analgesia.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>A woman who is pregnant and has Sickle Cell Disease should be followed up at a level 3 or 4 facility. Proper follow up should be adhered to and advise on what can be done at primary facilities. HCWs at the facilities need to be capacity build to identify symptoms, care for patients and empower for referral.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Screening programmes include pre-marriage/preconceptual, antenatal and neonatal programmes. In addition, targeted screening for sickle cell haemoglobin may be carried out in other circumstances like: before anaesthesia for a person in high endemic area; for sportsmen and for recruitment into the disciplined forces. The aim is to either reduce the effects of a condition or to lessen the number of births of a baby with a serious disorder (by offering information about carrier status prior to marriage or conception).</p>
                        <p>Screening should be socially and ethically acceptable to the community served, health care workers involved, individuals identified as carriers and their families. Potential benefits should outweigh any potential harm. The quality of counselling is very important in avoiding adverse social effects. Imparting information as to carrier status has been found to be more acceptable to the people concerned if they are also informed of the potential benefits of being a carrier. For example, in the case of β thalassaemia trait, not just the partial protection from falciparum malaria but also protection against coronary artery disease and ischemic cerebrovascular accidents¹⁴.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Neonatal Screening</h3>
                        <p>Neonatal screening, when linked to timely diagnostic testing, parental education and comprehensive care, markedly reduces morbidity and mortality from SCD in infancy and early childhood. All children presenting with unexplained acute illness, including acute pain in any part of the body, anaemia, acute neurological symptoms, loss of vision, collapse, respiratory symptoms, hepatosplenomegaly, jaundice, swollen limbs and sepsis should be tested for SCD. If screening is missed at birth, then it should to be done at first contact with the system.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Premarital, Antenatal and Postnatal Screening</h3>
                        <p>Patient's relatives and youths are encouraged to screen for their status. Family trees should be used to link the potential carriers and SCD patients.</p>
