                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The term 'sociology' can be traced to Auguste Comte in 1837. He combined the Latin word for society (socio) with the Greek word for science (logy) thus identifying an area of study that pertained to the science of society.</p>
                        <p>Sociology is the study of social life, social change, and the social causes and consequences of human behaviour.</p>
                        <p>Sociology is about people. It is about how people interact and why they behave as they do.</p>
                        <p>According to Akinsola (1983) sociology is explained as a social science that deals with the organisation of societies, people's patterns of behaviour within the social structure, and how these social structures are arranged in the society.</p>
                        <p>Anthropology is divided primarily into physical anthropology and cultural anthropology.</p>
                        <p>Anthropology is the classification and analysis of humans and their society, descriptively, culturally, historically, and physically. Its unique contribution to studying the bonds of human social relations has been the distinctive concept of culture.</p>
                        <p>It has also differed from other sciences concerned with human social behaviour (especially sociology) in its emphasis on data from non-literate peoples and archaeological exploration.</p>

                            <li>He was the first professor of Sociology</li>
                            <li>He was keen in to demonstrate that sociology was a science.</li>
                            <li>He believed e.g. that social phenomena can be measured and that even if it is not possible to undertake laboratory experiments with human beings corporative studies which serve a similar purpose can be undertaken.</li>
                            <li>He succeeded in showing that suicide rates differ very significantly between social groups (even though suicide is personal), e.g. that members of some religious groups are more prone to suicide than others.</li>
                            <li>He found that suicide rates are co-related to social factors such as loneliness and economic well being.</li>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Aristotle the ancient Greek philosopher declared long time ago that man is a social animal, he who does not need society should be either a beast or an angel! A man is a product of group life, it is the group that socializes him. it is the group life that will make a man a coward or a self sacrificing hero..a law abiding citizen or a criminal,it is this mansociety relationship that forms the central theme of sociological inquiry.</p>
                        <p>The relationship between man and society is one of the most profound problems we have to tackle, it takes us to a more fundamental question of relation between the individual and society. The question is what do we owe each other?</p>
                        
                        <h3>1. man depends on society</h3>
                        <p>Is observed that everyone breathe, live and work like millions around them.in the society and individual is surrounded and encompassed by culture, a societal force, he conforms to norms, occupy statuses and play roles within the society. Social life is an intrinsic need for man.emotional,material and intellectual developments are impossible without society.</p>
                        
                        <h3>There two theories that explain the relationship between man and society</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li>the social contract theory</li>
                            <li>the organismic theory of society</li>
                        </ol>
                        
                        <p>According to the social contract theory all men are born free and equal. Individuals precedes society. Society came into existence because of an agreement entered into by individuals. the main proponents of this theory are Thomashobbes,John locke and J Rousseau</p>
                        
                        <h4>A) thomas hobbes(1588-1679)</h4>
                        <p>he was an english thinker,he opined that society came into being as a means for the protection of men against the consequences of their own nature. He claims that man was solitary,poor,nasty,brutish and short. Man in his state of nature was not at all social, he says that all men were selfish,cunning,egoistic, brutal,as. these things become intolerable men entered in to a contract to ensure security and certainty of life and property. The agreement was each for all and all for each.</p>
                        
                        <h4>B) john locke</h4>
                        <p>He was an english philosopher, he believed that man in his natural state enjoys liberty,freedom.but there was no sytem of law and justice. hence corruption and degeneration of man upset him. There was an ill condition full of fears and continual danger,in order to get rid of this fear.man entered in to social social contract.this led to governmental contract in order to releive the ill condition.</p>
                        
                        <h4>J.J. Rousseau(1712-1778)</h4>
                        <p>a french writer in his book "the social contract" wrote that man in his state of nature was a "noble savage" he was leading a life of primitive simplicity and idyllic hapinness, he was unaware of wrongs and rights. As populaion grew these things disapeared property institutionsdestroyed equality.man thought of mine and thine thuscame rich and rich led to war,conflict and murdes,this led to emergent of soiety according to him..</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Socialization is the process of earning group norms, habits and ideals - the things that a child needs to know in order to function as a confirmed member of society.</p>
                        <p>The following factors are important in this process</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>imitation</strong>-coping the acts of others, either consciously or unconsciously,spontanoeus or deliberate, through this a child learns social behavior patterns, children have great capacity to imitate they do it indiscriminately</li>
                            <li><strong>suggestion</strong>-this is a process of communication in which the suggested i.e. a is accepted without logical grounds a child lacks the ability to think and reason hence highly suggestible.</li>
                            <li><strong>identification</strong>-as the child grow they begin to identify with the people around them, and these are usually things that satisfy the child's need.as the child grows the areas of identification inceases</li>
                            <li><strong>language</strong>-languge is the medium of expression, in the beginning the child utters meaningless words but gradually the skill of language is acquired. Thus in the process of learning, language is important.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3>Phases or forms of socialization</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li>primary socialization</li>
                            <li>anticipatory socialization</li>
                            <li>Secondary socialization.</li>
                            <li>developmental socialization</li>
                            <li>re socialization</li>
                        </ol>

                        <p><strong>Primary socialization</strong>-takes place in infancy and childhood, it's the most crucial stage of socialization. The basic behavior pattern of a child is learnt at this stage. The child internalizes many of the socially accepted values,attitudes, beleifs, and behavior patterns of his culture. This stagee has three sub stages</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>the oral</strong>-where child builds up definite expectations about feeding time, and learns to signal pressing needs for care.</li>
                            <li><strong>the anal stage</strong> begins more or less after a year of infancy. Here the child is trained to take care of themselves such as toilet training.</li>
                            <li><strong>the oedipal stage</strong> begins roughly from the fourth year and goes up to puberty, all the roles prescribed according to sex are internalized by the child. The child identifies with the social roles.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <p><strong>Secondary socialization</strong> starts from the latter stage of childhood up to maturity. Socialization is a continuous process that takes place throughout the individuals life.</p>
                        <p><strong>Anticipatory socialization</strong>, is learning that is described towards a persons future role anticipatory socialization makes the individual expect their own participation in a social situation by watching how others would behave in that situation.</p>
                        <p><strong>Developmental socialization</strong>-as the individual grow he changes and moulds themselves according to the standards and the needs of the society.he identifies himself with the society,also it is a process by which a person is introduced to be part of society into which one was born and learns its culture.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Primary socialization</strong> - learnt from parents and extended family on acceptable behaviour.</li>
                            <li><strong>Secondary socialization</strong> - from peers(age mates), school, neighbours and by watching adults.</li>
                            <li>other agents of socialization- the family, media such as Television, newsprint</li>

                        <h3>Types of social change</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Evolution</strong>: The term evolution refers to slow or gradual change, which occurs with very low human effort, with almost unnoticeable changes in social structure. Examples are language, marriage patterns, child rearing practices and so on.</li>
                            <li><strong>Revolution</strong>: This term refers to a rapid and deliberate change, which can radically change a society's way of doing things. Revolutions are planned for a specific purpose and are initiated by direct human action. For example, the Russian revolution and in East Africa, the Ugandan revolution that brought a new political system under President Idi Amin.</li>
                            <li><strong>Reform</strong>: This term refers to a deliberate effort by humans to alter the society's way of doing things. Reforms apply lesser force than revolutions and their effects are much more extensive than revolution. An example is the changes that occurred when Kenya's educational system switched from the 7-4-2 to the 8-4-4 system of education. These changes have influenced the whole education institution in this country so that all institutions of higher learning have had to re-do their curriculum. In addition, other colleges and universities, which accepted Kenyan students based on the old 7-4-2 system, have also re-adjusted their entry requirements to cater for the new system. You must have noticed this widespread type of social change.</li>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>It is process which ranks members of society according to wealth, prestige, power, sex, age and ethnic origin</p>
                        <p>In African societies, members are ranked according to sex, age, ethnic origin and occupation (Peil 1977).</p>
                        <p>Status may be:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>ascribed/born with e.g Prince</li>
                            <li>Achieved/acquired.eg President</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Stratification is the process by which the individuals and groups are ranked more or less enduring hierarchy of status.</p>
                        <p>Difference is the law of nature., every society is stratified in one way or the other.no two individuals are exactly alike.diverstity and inequality are inherent in every society. Hence human society is stratified everywhere.</p>
                        
                        <h3>The Conflict Theory of Stratification</h3>
                        <p>draws largely on the writings of Karl Marx, he saw society as divided into two major groups (capitalists and proletarians or workers) who are inevitably in conflict. Whereas Marx was particularly concerned only with the economic or market hierarchy, which he termed class, Max Weber suggested that people are also stratified according to status (prestige or lifestyle) and power. These three hierarchies may be closely related, but this is not necessarily so. Marx assumed that those with a high economic position would also have power, but rich businessmen often have less power than higher civil servants on moderate salaries; clergymen and teachers usually have higher status than either wealth or power - though this was more likely some time back.</p>

                        <h3>What is conflict?</h3>
                        <p>Stephen Robbins states that conflict "refers to all kinds of opposition or antagonistic interaction. It is based on scarcity of power, resources or social positions, and differing value structures."</p>
                        <p>According to Prowler conflict is defined as a fight, struggle with others or groups also as a collision or clashing of opposed principles</p>

                        <h3>Values of a conflict</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Spotlights problems that require attention</li>

                        <h3>TYPES OF CONFLICTS</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>INTRA PERSONAL</strong>: Conflict between oneself e.g. Medical staff have many roles such as Manager, teacher, counselor, researcher, care giver etc. Has to collaborate with other members of the health team. Conflicts can occur due to work overload creating conflicting priorities</li>
                            <li><strong>INTERPERSONAL</strong>: Involves two or more persons who have differing attitudes, goals or behavior</li>
                            <li><strong>INTRA GROUP</strong> -Involves some or all group members affecting their performance</li>

                        </ul>

                        <h3>Conflict resolution styles</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Fight</strong>: In a fight, two or more people are aggressive with one another. Fighting can be done with words, weapons or fists. Following a battle of some description there will be a winner and a loser, or both may lose.</li>
                            <li><strong>Flight</strong>: In a flight situation, one party walks away from the conflict. The problem is left unresolved and there may be a winner and a loser. Common 'flight' language includes 'never mind', 'just forget it' and 'whatever'.</li>
                            <li><strong>Flow</strong>: In a flow situation both people walk away from the conflict satisfied with the solution which they have reached together. Conflict resolution encourages everyone to 'go with the flow' and create solutions!</li>
