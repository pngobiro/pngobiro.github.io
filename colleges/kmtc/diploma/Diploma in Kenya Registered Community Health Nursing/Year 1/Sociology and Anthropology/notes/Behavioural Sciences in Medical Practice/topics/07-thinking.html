                        <p>Thinking is the mental activity that makes human behaviour complex and fascinating. It is some kind of ongoing mental activity with internal representation of the outside world of which the subject is aware but which is unobservable by another person. It must be inferred from the behaviour of the individual. It may or may not have been induced by an external stimulus and it may or may not result in some psychologist define thinking as a response to any stimuli. According to them thinking is more complicated than responding. For example, a mathematical problem at times can be solved by two different methods, with the same result. So thinking is not responding but a process by which one arrives at the solutions. These processes of solving problems can be different in different individuals and different situations.</p>
                        <p>Human thought process is like information processing sequences, building from basic information such as pattern recognition and perceptual analysis. Thinking is mental process of forming a new representation by transforming available information. Thinking involves attention, memory, reasoning, imagination, decision making and judging. Thinking has three characteristics-</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Thinking occurs in the mind but is inferred from observable behaviour.</li>
                            <li>Thinking is a process that manipulates knowledge in a person's cognitive system.</li>
                            <li>Thinking is directed toward finding solutions to problems facing the individual (Mayer, 1981).</li>

                        <span class="heading-text">How do we Think?</span>
                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>We store information from our experience with people and things; we make mental representation of these experiences in our minds. At times we generalise our experiences like learning is better early in the morning, all students who wear spectacles are studious. Thinking relies on a variety of mental structures to form a thought. These are symbols, concept, schema, imagery, cognitive maps and language.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Symbols</h3>
                        <p>Thinking has also been defined as the manipulation of symbols. Symbol is an object that can represent other objects. For example, a triangle can represent family planning or × in a mathematical equation can stand for multiplication. Thus the red triangle and x are symbols. Though words form important symbols in our thinking, yet symbols are not limited to the familiar language of words. There are other symbolic languages, such as language of mathematics; Tangible symbols include such symbols as a stop sign, a cross on the church, a red cross on the ambulance. We think in symbols as verbal language is a rich symbolic process. A symbol conveys a meaning, it provides information about some object or event to which it refers and thereby suggests appropriate action to the persons who perceives it. Symbolic stimuli produce reactions appropriate to some stimulus other than themselves, e.g. sign DANGER alerts someone to take necessary action. Though thinking is private and invisible yet we can study the result of simple manipulation and then work backwards making guesses about what kind of symbols might have been manipulated and about how this manipulation is performed. The study of the process of thinking is dependent upon introspection and verbal report by the subject.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Concepts</h3>
                        <p>When symbol stands for a class or group of objects with common properties, it refers to a concept, like green, women, injection. Concepts are labels one gives to a group of objects; it is the organisation of a variety of different objects or events into categories. Some concepts can easily be formed as they are basic, whereas other concepts are difficult to form. Concept learning is based on principles of generalisation and discrimination (see Chapter 5). A child learning the concept of dog may generalise all small animals as dog. Later with parental correction and with personal experience the child is able to discriminate dog from other small animals. Language ability helps us to form concepts from concrete to the abstract ones. Piaget's stages of intellectual development indicate that the child first learns object concepts and develops more abstract concepts only as he grows older (see Chapter 12). The inability to form abstracts is characteristic of certain disorders like, schizophrenia, mental subnormality and some neurological disorders. Normal individuals have capacity to treat new stimuli as familiar and remembered categories. This ability to categorise individual experiences is regarded as one of the most basic abilities of thinking organisms (Mervis and Rosch, 1981).</p>
                        <p>Psychologist have identified a level in concept hierarchies at which people best categories and think about objects. The basic level can be retrieved from memory, e.g. chair is identified as piece of furniture. The basic levels of concepts are the fundamental of thought.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Schemas</h3>
                        <p>Schemas are general conceptual frameworks regarding certain people objects and situations one's life. You correlate 'exams' with studying most of the time, anxiety to finish the course, lots of books and cutting down on social activities. This visual representation provides expectation about the features likely to be found in a particular situation. Whenever incomplete or ambiguous information is available, we make inferences. Schemas are the primary units of meaning in the human information processing systems. We comprehend new information by integrating new inputs and what we already know.</p>
                        <p>We also have schemas of events; these are referred to as script. A script is a cluster of knowledge about sequences of interrelated, specific events and actions expected to occur in a certain way in particular settings. We have a script for going to a picnic, traveling in train, making presentations. Scripts may depend upon the culture, e.g. traveling in train in India is different from traveling in train in Japan.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Imagery</h3>
                        <p>Supposing you have joined a hostel and you have an empty room. You are supposed to arrange the room. What will you do? How will you plan the places for your things like bed, study table, books, music system and other accessories? For this you need an imagery to plan the arrangement and setting of your things. Imagery is the mental picture which is usually not complete. Imagery is an important tool for solving many problems. Mental imagery is the ability, which varies between individuals, to experience 'internally' something resembling but not identical with a percept, visual, auditory, olfactory, etc. These mental images may be memories of previous events, scenes, etc. or apparently original as, for example, in the case of some creative artists. The ability to experience vivid and details images which are then projected into the environment and perceived as if external is known as eidetic imagery. The images may occur spontaneously in some situations, while on other occasions they may result from a conscious effort on the part of the individual. These may be referred to as autonomous and controlled imagery respectively. This difference may be extended to all thinking so that a distinction is made between what may be described as purposive and fantasy thinking—the difference depending essentially on the degree of control exercised by the thinker.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Cognitive Maps</h3>
                        <p>A cognitive representation of a physical space is called a cognitive map. These are internal maps that guide future actions towards desired goals. Cognitive maps help people to visualise a situation like one draws a visual route to reach a particular destination. Visual thought and verbal thought differ in the ways information is processed and stored. Visual thought increases complexity and richness to our thinking. Visual thinking can be useful in solving problems related to special or geographical relationship.</p>
                        <p>Culture influences the cognitive maps due to the subjective impression of physical reality. The maps often mirror our personal or culturally egocentric perspective. If you are asked to draw a female figure that would be different in features and dress as compared to a figure drawn by an American.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Language</h3>
                        <p>Thinking involves the manipulation of internal or covered representations of external and overt events or behaviour, but that is because of the existence of language. Language serves two major functions, it helps us to communicate with one another and it provides system of symbols and rules that facilitate thinking. Language like any other external behaviour may be represented internally, and much human thinking involves a kind of internal speech. There are also many examples of nonlinguistic thought as when composer 'hears' in his mind music that he is creating or an artist 'sees' a painting he will put on to canvas.</p>

                        <p>Luria, the Russian psychologist, on the basis of studies of children, has regarded the internalisation of speech as the major factor in the development of thinking. He has also shown that patients with lesions of the frontal lobes may suffer from loss of speech control as well as more general disorganisation of behaviour, and presumably of the thinking process underlying it. Milner (1963) has also found that frontal lobe patients show impairment on a card-sorting task in which cards can be categorised in terms of colour, form of number. If the principle was changed (e.g. from form to colour), the patients continued to sort cards according to the original principle, showing preservation of behaviour. There are also other disturbances associated with frontal lobe damage, including motivational deficit, so that the association of frontal lobe and the process of thinking can only be regarded as tentative.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Thinking has been classified in number of ways. Some of the important types of thinking are discussed here.</p>
                        <h3>Purposive and Fantasy Thinking</h3>
                        <p>Our thought can go to extremes from purposive, realistic thinking to fantasy or autistic thinking. Autistic thinking is a personal, idiosyncratic involving fantasy day dreaming being in your own world. This type of indivisualised thoughts can be important for creative acts. But in extreme cases it can be abnormal as it generates delusions and hallucinations. Realistic thinking is logical, takes account of external reality and, clearly, is involved in reasoning and problem-solving. Autistic thinking in contrast, is primitive, nonlogical in its association of ideas and is not subject to correction by reference to reality.</p>
                        <h3>Convergent and Divergent Thinking</h3>
                        <p>Another dichotomy between two forms of purposive thinking as suggested by Guilford (1956) and later developed by Hudson (1966). Convergent thinking applies to problem solving which involves focussing on to the one and only correct answer-the sort of problem that has commonly been used in conventional tests of intelligence (e.g. 'fat is to think as tall is to .....?) Divergent thinking requires the production of as many answers as possible (e.g. 'how many uses can you think of for a flower pot?) and has been considered to be important in relation to creativity.</p>

                <!-- END: types-of-thinking -->

                <!-- START: functions-of-thinking -->
                <section id="functions-of-thinking" class="content-section" aria-labelledby="functions-thinking-heading">

                        <span class="heading-text">Functions of Thinking</span>
                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Thinking has various functions that help us in our day-to-day activities requiring reasoning, problem solving, and decision making and judging.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Reasoning</h3>
                        <p>Reasoning is a process of realistic, goal directed thinking in which conclusions are drawn from a set of facts. In reasoning information both stored and collected from the environment are used according to the set rules. Reasoning is classified as deductive and inductive.</p>
                        <p>Deductive reasoning involves drawing a conclusion that follows logically established rules from two or more statements. Examples of this reasoning is that A has high blood sugar, so he has diabetes.</p>
                        <p>Inductive reasoning uses available evidence to generate a conclusion about the likelihood of something. For inductive reasoning one constructs a hypothesis based on available evidence and then test it against other evidence. Inferences are accomplished by integrating past experiences, weighted value of the importance of the evidence and creativity. Examples of this type of thinking are probing into a murder case.</p>
                        <p>Most scientific reasoning is inductive as often a medical diagnosis is made on the inferences drawn from the case history of the patient. Inductive reasoning plays a key role in our lives in solving many problems, like misplacing certain object and then trying to find that.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Problem Solving</h3>
                        <p>Problem solving is thinking that is directed towards solving specific problems. This is the important part of our thinking that moves from an initial state to a goal state by means of a set of mental operations. Solving a problem implies that the organism is faced with a task the solution to which is not immediately apparent, but which it is able to solve after an interval during which the problem-solving activity including thinking or reasoning has occurred. In other words, problem-solving involves the acquisition of an appropriate response to a novel situation.</p>
                        <p>The ability to find an answer to the question that is to solve a problem is a cognitive ability which has a goal. Goal can be achieved by various methods for which the psychologists have explained on the basis of different theories. These are-learning theory, Gestalt theory and information processing theory.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Learning theory</h4>
                        <p>The learning theory approach to problem solving is illustrated by work of Pavlov, Watson, Thorndike. According to Thorndike the cats placed in the puzzle boxes learned to pull the string that got them out of the trial and error process. Here the cats were only learning a new habit because of the reward and reinforcement of getting out of the box. The cats did not understand the mechanism of pulling the string led to the escape.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Gestalt theory</h4>
                        <p>The work of German psychologist Kohler (1927) is an example of Gestalt approach where famous experiments of insight learning were conducted on the chimpansee, Sultan. The bananas were placed outside Sultan's cage, out of reach, and he was given a stick, he would use the stick to pull the bananas to him. Sultan's problem occurred when neither of the two sticks he had was long enough to reach the bananas. He tried to get the bananas with one of the sticks but was not successful and walked away. Suddenly, he went back and by chance combined the two sticks together, make a single long stick. With this he could immediately reach to the bananas. According to Kohler, Sultan used insight which is often known as an 'aha' experience. He came up with a completely new creative solution to his problem which he continued to use in the similar situations.</p>
                        <p>The Gestalt approach to solving problem is based on rearranging the situation to gain on insight into its fundamental nature. Here is a problem for you to answer.</p>
                        <p><code>|||||||||</code></p>
                        <p>These are nine sticks, try to make them ten without adding another stick</p>
                        <p>Problem-solving occurs through a process of trial and error. You would have experienced many such incidents where the initial method to solve the problem was based on trial and error but later on the solution comes through insight. It may come suddenly to your mind while you were doing something different. The Gestalt view of problem-solving, is a more holistic one. Instead of a solution proceeding gradually by small steps as proposed by Thorndike, the Gestalt school considered that the problems are solved efficiently when organised into a good structure. This is also called reproductive thinking as it duplicates or reproduces old habits. The productive thinking.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Information processing</h4>
                        <p>According to this approach problem-solving is a complex activity comprising several processes. These processes include-registering information, retrieving information from memory and using both kinds of knowledge in a purposeful way. The study of information processing has grown along with the use of computers and at times it has been equated to artificial intelligence.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Stages of problem-solving</h4>
                        <p>Whenever you have to solve a problem try to think what all is required. Supposing you have been asked to make a research proposal, what necessary steps would you take? Generally, whenever they have to solve a problem, we go through three hour stages, we prepare, we produce and we evaluate.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Preparation</h5>
                        <p>The first step to problem solving is to understand the problem as our interpretation can be affected by the way the problem is presented. At times, there is a problem of fixed or rigid mental set which can interfere in understanding and thereby working on the problem.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Production</h5>
                        <p>We need to generate possible solution. Simple problems may be solved just by collecting correct information either from long-term memory or from other sources like books, advice from others, etc. The more complicated problems require complex strategies. The two basic kinds of solution strategies are algorithms and heuristics.</p>
                        <p>An algorithm is a strategy that exhausts every possible answer till it comes up with the correct solution used diligently, it guarantees a correct solution. Algorithms are rarely used because they do not exist for many problems and they are very time-consuming. A heuristic is a "rule of thumb" that can lead to a very quick solution to no solution at all. Heuristics may involve planning that ignores some of the problem information while focussing on other information or it may involve means end analysis that tests for a difference between the state that currently exist and one that desired and doing something to reduce the difference. Heuristics may also involve working backward to review the ideal situations and then determining what steps will lead to the ideal situation.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Evaluation</h5>
                        <p>We have to decide how good is our solution. It may be easy for some solutions but many problems have less precise goals and are harder to judge may have many solutions to the problem in which we have to decide which is the best solution. When a problem is solved by insight learning the evaluation is very quick but in information processing and association type of problem-solving one may move up and down and gradually come to the solution of the problem. Hence, the evaluation process is also different than that of insight.</p>
                        <p>Mental blocks can hinder problem-solving ability. Mental blocks are functional fixedness, i.e. one may find it hard to perceive a new function for an object that was previously associated with some other purpose. Some other factors like habitual strategy, past experiences or conditioning, actor-Observer bias and mental set may interfere with finding right solutions. Mental set is a tendency to respond to a new problem in the same manner used to solve previous problem. These factors function as "Black Box" in our thinking.</p>
                        <p>If you want to avoid pitfalls in problem-solving follow these guidelines-</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Formulate a plan by making a outline</li>
                            <li>Work in a organised manner</li>
                            <li>Begin working with easy options</li>
                            <li>Mentally rehearse taking the right action</li>
                            <li>Involve yourself completely in the problem, try to get maximum information on that</li>
                            <li>Be enthusiastic, think positively</li>
                            <li>Anticipate the challenge.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Decision Making</h3>
                        <p>In our day-to-day living there are many incidents in which we have to make decisions. It may be a simple decision as to which dress to wear, or complex decisions like whether to join Paediatrics or to take up Radiology for postgraduation. Similarly, we have to take number of decisions related to patient care like diagnosis and treatment. Decision making is an important part of all science-based professions. This is a cognitive process leading to the selection of a course of action among alternatives, it produces a final choice and is an action or an opinion.</p>
                        <p>Decision making is a kind of problem-solving. In which we are presented with several alternatives among which we must choose. While taking decisions one tries to optimise utility—perceived benefit or psychological value. Most decisions are risky in the sense that we cannot be sure of the outcome for example, while treating a patient with intestinal carcinoma, you are not sure whether the patient would benefit with chemotherapy, radiotherapy or surgery. You take the risk of deciding one type of treatment that is to be given.</p>
                        <p>The problem arises when we have to decide and choose between several alternatives. When there are no fixed rules of deciding then there is a risk of making errors in decision making due to subjective bias. We often make use of the heuristic of representativeness to arrive at subjective probabilities, we decide whether the current situation is similar to one we have encountered before, and then we act accordingly. While in some situations it may be useful to decide according to the past experience, but this approach can at times cause problems as it may interfere with new way of thinking. While deciding one also considers availability of options and weighing the relative advantages and disadvantages of a particular decision.</p>
                        <p>Decision making style have been suggested by MBTI (Myers-Briggs Type Indicator).</p>
                        <p>According to this there are four dimensions—thinking and feeling, introversion and extroversion, judgement and perception, sensing and intuition. People high on intuition, judgement and thinking tend to take better decisions.</p>
                        <p>Decision frame is a structure of a problem presentation. Decisions are influenced by decision frame that is how the facts are presented for decision making. The oncologist in favour of radiotherapy as compared to chemotherapy may present morbidity rate with chemotherapy.</p>

                        <h4>Personal Biases in Decision Making</h4>
                        <p>There are several personal bias which interfere with correct decision making. These are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Selective search for evidence</li>
                            <li>Premature termination of search for evidence unwillingness to share a view</li>
                            <li>Experiential limitations</li>
                            <li>Selective perception</li>
                            <li>Wishful thinking or optimism</li>
                            <li>Choice-supportive bias-when we distort our memories of chosen and rejected options to make the chosen options seem relatively more attractive</li>
                            <li>Recency-tendency to place more attention on recent information and either ignore or forget more distant information</li>
                            <li>Repetition bias</li>
                            <li>Influences of initial information</li>
                            <li>Inconsistency</li>
                            <li>Role-fulfillment</li>
                            <li>Faulty generalisations.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h3>Judging</h3>
                        <p>Judgement is a process by which we form opinions reach conclusions and make critical evaluations of events and people on the basis of available information. Sometimes we make spontaneous judgments based upon our attitude. Often decision making and judgement are considered as two sides of a coin. Judgements are based on inference, the reasoning process of drawing a conclusion on the basis of evidence or prior beliefs.</p>

                        <p>Sometimes we may make wrong judgements due to over-generalised stereotypes based on minimal or faulty information. There are several factors which cause mental blocks in our thinking.</p>
                        <p>The unconscious prejudice may bias our thinking due to which one may not arrive at impartial and neutral judgement. The past experiences hidden in our unconscious mind may interfere with our judgement. Prejudices like racism and sexism are commonly witnessed in the judgements.</p>
                        <p>Cognitive bias is a systematic error in inference, decision and judgement. Apprehension of bias is inevitable as decision making process depends on different experiences and perspectives. This can occur when we perceive random events and nonrandom, when we make short cuts to solve a problem, perceiving people as causing rather than being victimised by events, not exploring a range of possible solutions. The reasons for cognitive biases are first and last impression, self-esteem at stake, personal need, ego enhancing bias, beliefs and stereotypes. Often mental state of a person like anxiety, depression, frustration and irritability may lead to wrong judgements. Some psychologist have studied how complex judgements are made. They have suggested that there two main heuristics (mental short cuts) that are responsible for mistakes made in judgement. These are availability heuristic and representativeness heuristic. The availability heuristic means that we make judgement based upon how easily we can come up with a similar example. It is a cognitive strategy that estimates probabilities based on personal experience. You estimate the likelihood of an outcome based on how easily you can imagine similar outcomes. As example of this strategy recall that you were in a hurry, you decided to take a particular route to reach a particular destination. On the contrary, you had encountered more obstacles on this route or would have taken longer to reach your destination. The representativeness heuristic is a cognitive strategy that assigns items to categories based on whether they possess some representative characteristics of the category. The danger of this strategy is oversimplified thinking.</p>
                        <p>We look for common features found in a typical category member for example; we assume certain characteristics for vegetarian people.</p>

                        <p>In recent years, with the development of computer technology in clinical decision-making the process of diagnosis, prognosis and treatment may be represented in the form of 'decision tree'. The decision is taken based on elements of evidence or 'indicants', such as answers by the patient to a question, the presence of a physical sign on examination or the result of a laboratory test. Later, a comparative evaluation is done of the computer programme of the diagnostic programme with diagnosis formed by clinicians. A similar procedure is used in the experimental study of thinking by computer stimulation, but it has been shown that clinicians themselves differ widely in their diagnostic behaviour. A further application has been the construction of computer programmes actually to aid diganosis in specific clinical areas such as congenital heart disease and thyroid disease.</p>
                        <p>Disorders of thinking are one of the prime concerns in psychiatric patients. Many psychiatric disorders specially schizophrenia and some neurological disorders like dementia, delirium cause disorders of thinking, the examples, lack of association, neologisms (coining new words), circumstantiality, flight of ideas and delusions. In depressive illness aim of cognitive therapy is to modify negative thinking in terms of not being liked by others, rejection by others and bleak future.</p>
                        <p>Decision making is not only important for the physician who is treating but is also important for the patient and his relatives. Imagine a situation where a patient is on the ventilator for two months and the doctor provides the options to the family to continue or to wean off the patient from the ventilator. Similarly, the patient might have to decide whether he wants to be treated for angina by pharmacotherapy or he should undergo surgery. Similarly while dealing with patients with substance abuse decision to stop abuse of the substance is entirely patient's responsibility. To help individuals who are poor in making decisions, programmes have been developed to provide skills training, which is based on cognitive and behavioural theories.</p>

                        <p>Thinking is a mental activity in which one responds to the problem by cognitive rearrangement or manipulation of both information from the environment and the information stored in a long-term memory. We think by means of symbols, concepts, schema, scripts, imagery and cognitive maps. Thinking has important function in problem solving, decision making and judging. Problem-solving has been explained on the basis of learning theory, Gestalt theory and information processing. To solve a problem generally we take three steps like we prepare or plan, we produce and we evaluate the solution. Decision making is important in clinical practice for the physicians as well as the patients. Cognitive bias may interfere with impartial rational judging. Problem-solving and decision making are used in every step in patient care.</p>
