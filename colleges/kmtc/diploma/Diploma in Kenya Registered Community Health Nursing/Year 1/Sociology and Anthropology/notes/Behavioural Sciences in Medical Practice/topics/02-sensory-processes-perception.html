                        <p><em>Ranjeet, a young man comes to you with severe anxiety, Ranjeet is a music teacher in a private school, he is blind due to congenital defect, and he is married but does not have children. His wife has normal vision, but she is not educated. The anxiety was precipitated after a neighbour suddenly passed away following cardiac arrest. The incident has caused concern and fear in Ranjeet's mind that being blind, how can he handle such a situation if the need be. Any sensory defect can have negative psychological impact on the individual's personality and adjustment.</em></p>
                        <p>We live in a world of objects and people—a world that constantly bombards our senses with stimuli, bringing us information and presenting us with decisions, first on how we'll perceive these stimuli and then on how we'll behave in response. The sensory organs-vision, hearing, smell, touch and taste are highly complex systems and they do not make a straightforward response to each stimulus encountered. The knowledge comes to each one of us through our senses. We know about the world around us from what we learn directly about it, using our bodily sensations. We can understand the external world only from what our senses can detect of it.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, sensation becomes the primary source of all human knowledge. In human being unlike simple organism, sensation is only a small part of much more complicated information processing systems.</p>
                        <p>Let us define some terms here. A stimulus is any form of energy to which we can respond (light waves, sound waves, and pressure on the skin). A sense is a particular physiological pathway for responding to a specific kind of energy. Sensation is the feeling we have in response to information that comes in through our sensory organs. Perception is the way our brain organises these feelings to make sense out of them. This involves recognition of objects that comes from a combination of sensations and the memory of previous sensory experiences.</p>

                        <p>Sensations contain both a 'quantity' element (size, hardness, coldness), and a 'quality' element (attractive, bad or dangerous). For example if you get burnt from a hot pressure cooker, you may think of all pressure cookers as being dangerous equipment. The physical property of heat may therefore, take on the psychological property of dangerousness. Thus the physical and physiological events are collectively called 'sensation'. That is the way in which the body responds to energy impinging upon it from the environment.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Sensation refers to the process of receiving information, whereas to perceive means to interpret and understand. Perceiving is not seeing, believing. Perception refers to what is immediately experienced by a person. Sensory events are translated into patterns of activity in the sensory channels and the central nervous system. Some of what we perceive is very closely linked to these activity patterns. Perception is the process of knowing the world outside you, by forming some mental representation. Perception is a complex process, extending far beyond the mere registering of light, sound, and other impulses from the external world. This external information must be internally coded and transformed before anyone can know what is really out there. Often your beliefs and expectations about some external stimulus prove to be more important in determining your behaviour than the physical characteristics of that external object. Perception is like solving a complicated puzzle. You must take bits and pieces of information that are present in the external world and fit them together somehow to form a comprehensive internal picture.</p>
                        <p>It may at first appear that every object in the external world makes direct contact with the brain via the sense organs: the eyes, ears, skin, and so on. But this view of perception is much too simple. There is no direct one-to-one relationship between the image formed by your eye and your perception of that image. The situation is indeed even more complex, since many physical arrangements in the external world can produce exactly the same image upon the eye. For example, it follows from elementary principles of geometry that a small triangle near you will produce the same image in the eye as that of a large triangle further away. Since any single external cue is likely to prove insufficient to narrow down the possibilities about the external world, we are forced to rely upon various combinations of cues. Although each cue by itself may be unreliable, if we consider enough cues together, we can often come up with an accurate mental picture of the external situation.</p>
                        <p>However, for much of what we perceive, the sensory patterns merely provide the 'raw data' for experience. The sensory information is transformed elaborated and combined with memories to create what we actually experience or perceive.</p>

                        <h3>Perceptual Processes</h3>
                        <p>We do not perceive world as loud sounds, bright lights or patches of colours. We perceive the world around us as objects like, book, glass, and plants. We hear doorbell, footsteps and songs. That means the sensory inputs at the focus of our attention have form and meaning. Perceptual processes which provide meaning to what we see or hear are classified as-form, visual depth, constancy, movement perception, plasticity and individual differences. We shall very briefly examine these processes.</p>

                        <h4>Form Perception</h4>
                        <p>The sensory inputs we receive come into our awareness as shapes, pattern and form. The basic element needed for visual form perception is the presence of contour. A contour is an area within the visual array where there is an abrupt change in luminance. The normal optic array is filled with contour information and an area completely enclosed by a contour is usually seen as distinct and separate form.</p>
                        <p>Another fundamental process in form perception is the recognition of a figure on a ground. We see objects as standing against a background. The words on this book are figures against the background of the page. We must be able to differentiate between the figure and these backgrounds, from which they are emerging. But in a reversible figure ground stimulus; perception of figures is a psychological act of interpretations and not necessarily, directly predictable from the stimulus array. Reversible figure ground relationship illustrates the multistability of perceptual organisation, i.e. some stimulus inputs can be organised differently in perception.</p>
                        <p>Organisation in perception partially explains our perception of complex patterns as unitary forms or objects. We see objects as objects only because grouping process operate in perception. Some laws of organisation are:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Law of proximity-items close together in space or time tend to be perceived as belonging together.</li>
                            <li>Similarity-similar objects tend to be grouped together.</li>
                            <li>Symmetry-there is a tendency to organise things to make a balanced or symmetrical figure that includes all the parts.</li>
                            <li>Continuation-there is a tendency to perceive a time that starts in one way as continuing in the same way.</li>
                            <li>Common fate-elements, which are perceived as moving together from an organised group.</li>
                            <li>Law of closure-refers to perceptual process sees, which organize the perceived world by filling gaps in stimulation.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h4>Depth Perception</h4>
                        <p>Artists, philosophers, and psychologists have long been challenged by the everyday fact of 3D seeing. The problem is set by the very structure of eye, which forms an optical image on a 2dimensional surface, the retina. We make use of information, or cues in the sensory input to generate the 3D perception. The depth cues, were first studied by artist Leonardo da Vinci (14521519) to keep artists portray depth and distance on a flat canvas. We use monocular and binocular cues to create such effect.</p>
                        <p><strong>Monocular cues:</strong> These operate when only one eye is looking. The artist to give us depth experience from a flat painting generally uses these. The depth perception is created by-Linear perspective (the distances operating the images), clearness, interposition (one object obstructs view of another), shadows, gradients of texture (change without abrupt transition) and movement.</p>
                        <p><strong>Binocular cues:</strong> Many of the cues for depth perception require only one eye. Individuals with vision in one eye have adequate depth perception in most conditions. When we observe with twoeye vision, at the world we add binocular cues to the depth perception to the monocular cues. As the two eyes receive slightly different view of the world thereby producing binocular cues.</p>
                        <p><strong>Nonvisual cues of depth and distance:</strong> There are two possible cues to the perception of depth namely convergence and accommodation. The conception was that subject adjusted this accommodation and convergence until he had a sharp and single image of the object.</p>

                        <h4>Visual Pattern Perception</h4>
                        <p>When we consider all the processes that underlie the recognition of complex, everyday pattern, we find they can be classified in two ways:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Data-driven processing</strong>-begins with the arrival of sensory information reaching the receptors (data). This input is said to drive a series of analyses, beginning with registration of luminance differences in image, colours, lines, angles, etc. This analysis proceeds from retina up through various levels of visual pathways, until it reaches higher centres of brain.</li>
                            <li>The other type is called "<strong>conceptually-driven processing</strong>-it uses higher level conceptual processes including memories of past experiences; general organisational strategies; knowledge of world and expectations based upon surrounding context or situation. Both type of analyses can be occurring simultaneously, or they may occur one after the others.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p><strong>Constancy of perception:</strong> Our perceptual experiences are not isolated; they build a world of identifiable things. This world as we perceive is a stable world. An object that has been constituted perceptually as a permanent and stable thing is perceived as such regardless of the illumination on it; the position from which it is viewed; or the distance at which it appears. This stability of environment as we experience is termed as 'perceptual constancy'.</p>
                        <p>Size constancy refers to the fact that as an object is moved further away we, tend to correct it for distance and still see it as more or less normal in size, when we, see an object at a distance, we might judge its size in one of the 3 ways:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Perspective size: According to the geometry of perspective, i.e. size inversely proportional to distance. This size would correspond to size of image on retina.</li>
                            <li>Object size: If object constancy is perfect we might judge an object by its known size.</li>
                            <li>Compromise between perspective size and object size: It might compromise and see the objects smaller at a distance, but not as much smaller as geometry of perspective indicates. Size constancy develops largely as the result of experience. Similarly, the tendency to see an object, as of standard shape regardless of the viewing angle is shape constancy. The tendency to see an object as of normal colour regardless of light and shadow is called 'colour constancy' and brightness respectively, finally, the fact that objects retain their same positions, even as we move about is known as 'location constancy'. Although the word constancy is an exaggeration, but it dramatises our relatively stable perception of objects.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h4>Movement Perception</h4>
                        <p>When we perceive movement, we sense action in space taking place over time. We usually explain the perception of movement according to the stimulation of successive parts of sensory surface. Adaptive behaviour requires that we perceive movement accurately; otherwise one would land up in the hospital following an accident. Perceived motion also occurs without any energy movement across the receptor surface or without a successive pattern of stimulation, and is called apparent motion. In contrast to this there is real motion, the perception of the actual physical movement of the objects.</p>
                        <p><strong>Apparent motion</strong> It is movement perceived in the absence of physical movement of an image across the retina. This is caused by the following factors:</p>
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li>Autokinetic effect-if we stare at a single spot of light in a completely dark room, after a few seconds light will appear to move in an erratic manner. This apparent movement of stationary light is called Autokinetic effect.</li>
                            <li>Stroboscopic motion-This illusion of motion is created, when separated stimuli, not in motion are presented in succession. This motion is used in making of cartoon films. Each frame of a film is slightly different from the preceding one, but when frames are presented rapidly enough, the picture blends into a smooth motion. A simple form of stroboscopic motion is called "PhiPhenomenon", according to this, in a dark room if these are four lights and one of these four lights blinks on and off, followed shortly by another, there is an illusion of a single light moving from first position to the second. When all four lights flash on and off in a rapid sequence, it appears that single light is travelling in a circle, but the perceived size of the circle is smaller; than would be the case if lights were actually rotating.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p><strong>Real motion:</strong> The perception of real motion depends upon relations between objects within the visual field. Whenever there is movement, the brain has to decide what is moving and what is stationary with respect to some frame of reference. We generally tend to assume that large objects are stationary and, smaller objects are moving. "Induced movement" is experienced when we look at the moon through a thin cover of moving clouds. In a clear sky, the moon appears to be stationary. When framed by moving clouds the moon will appear to race across the sky, while clouds appear stationary.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Plasticity</h4>
                        <p>Visual deprivation or plasticity is restriction of the visual output. This is generally caused during the development stage in early infancy. Individuals born with congenital cataract face this type of problem.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Individual differences</h4>
                        <p>Individuals differ in the ways they process sensory inputs to give rise to what they experience. Two individuals watching sunset in the western coast beach may have very different perceptions of the sunset. One may report it was breath taking or pure magic, whereas the other may report a red circle gradually descending. These differences in the perception are the result of the following factors.</p>
                        <p><strong>Perceptual learning:</strong> Eleanor Gibson (1969) has defined perceptual learning as "increase in the ability to extract information from the environment as a result of experience or practice with the stimulation coming from it". This learning influences behaviours and experiences; and also determines the focus of attention. There are many examples to show that learning can mould perception. The one common example that we commonly encounter is the competence of individuals trained in various professions, as compared to untrained individuals. Skills in any variety are result of perceptual learning, which is achieved only through practice. Another very relevant example of perceptual learning is that blind persons learn to extract information from the environment, which generally the sighted people can not do, e.g. very sensitive discrimination of auditory sounds.</p>
                        <p>Related with learning one often wonders whether the perception is inborn or is influenced by the environmental factor. Those who advocate nature's role, say that brain organisation is determined by genetic codes and is so innate. The perception that depends upon this organisation is thus also innate. They say that sensory deprivation or special sensory experience during critical period results in a loss of brain connections that were genetically determined, because they needed environmental input, or nurture, for their maintenance. On the other hand, supporters of environment, argue that while genetic codes may provide a rough blueprint nurture interacts with the genetic outline during critical periods to direct growth and cause the proper brain connections to be made, so according to them alterations in the environment during critical period actually change the way the brain grows and the connections are made.</p>
                        <p><strong>Perceptual set:</strong> We frequently perceive an event or object because we were mentally prepared for a particular object or event to arise. Set refers to the idea that we are ready to receive certain kinds of sensory input. Such set or expectancies vary from individual-to-individual. Imagine the time when you were expecting your result for admission to a medical college, you will be able to recollect that you were able to spot the result in the newspaper in no time whereas your friends who were not expecting did not even look at this news. Perceptual sets are related to the actual physical environment of the stimulus itself or to the internal factors, such as emotion or motivation.</p>
                        <p><strong>Motives and needs:</strong> Several experiments have been conducted to study the effect of need and motive on perception. We attend to and organise sensory inputs in ways that match our needs. When you are hungry or thirsty, you are likely to pay more attention to places that would satisfy your need.</p>

                        <h4>Illusions</h4>
                        <p>Visual illusions are a dramatic example of how perceptual cues can be assembled incorrectly. Many illusions do not support the traditional view of perception that we infer from what we see. An illusion is any figure that gives rise to a bizarre interpretation of reality. The illusions demonstrate that what we perceive often depends on processes that go far beyond the 'raw data' of sensory input. Illusions show that perception results from transformation, elaboration and combination of sensory inputs. Specific instances in which the apparent curvature or length of a perceived line are not predictable from the curvature or length of its stimulus pattern, have been called the "Geometrical illusions". But this does not mean that they occur only with regular lines and patterns; they can also be demonstrated with quite irregular drawings and with real objects in normal environment. The illusions are important because they may provide clues for our understanding of processes of shape perception.</p>
                        <p>We shall examine some illusions that have a direct basis in our perception of ordinary objects and scenes. In these cases it may be that our senses have become so used to interpreting a particular stimulus in a given way that they cannot readily be dispensed with the 'stereo type'. The famous Muller-Lyer illusion (Fig. 2.1) shows that people usually perceive the vertical lines of different lengths. In reality both the vertical lines are equal in length. This illusion arises because of the architectural perspective implied in these two arrangements of lines.</p>
                        
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_11_10_5e89b0eccc8308b427a9g-023-1.jpg" alt="The Muller-Lyer illusion, showing two vertical lines with arrowheads pointing inwards on one and outwards on the other, creating the illusion that the lines are of different lengths." class="content-image">
                            <figcaption>Fig. 2.1: Which of the lines is longer? The Muller-Lyer illusion</figcaption>
                        </figure>
                        
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_11_10_5e89b0eccc8308b427a9g-023-2.jpg" alt="A variation of the Muller-Lyer illusion showing just the arrowheads, which still create a perceptual distortion of the space between them." class="content-image">
                            <figcaption>Fig. 2.2: Measure the space between the two sets of arrowheads at their point</figcaption>
                        </figure>
                        
                        <p>However, Figure 2.2 shows, even when the vertical lines are removed from the figure the illusion still persists; the inward pointing arrowheads still seem to be further separated at the point than are those in the outward pointing version. The reason for this illusion is that even in normal circumstances we do not utilise all the available information when we perceive objects.</p>
                        <p>Same illusion is evoked even when arrows are replaced by circles (Fig. 2.3). In this presence of the circles now generate the illusion of one line being longer than the other.</p>

                        <p>Lines that converge suggest an appearance of distance. The common example of this is a stretch of long road or railroad tracks that remain parallel and equally wide as they disappear into the distance (Fig. 2.4). The Ponzo illusion also occurs due to the converging lines suggest depth (Fig. 2.5).</p>

                        <p>Illusions make clear that the context in which a given stimulus appears will determine how it is perceived. Figure 2.6 demonstrates the importance of context in determining perception that we cannot ignore. In spite of our knowing that we do not perceive accurately, still we are unable to prevent the false interpretation arising out of these figures. These illusions show that our perception is independent of our conscious will. Information reaching us in normal circumstances may frequently contain inaccuracies imposed by these unconscious processes even though we are unaware of it happening.</p>

                        <p>At times the illusions can have serious effects. The Poggendorf Illusion can cause serious tragedy like, crashing aeroplanes, or misguiding the surgeons while operating. This is the simple illusion, which occurs when there are two parallel lines and a third line intersects them (Fig. 2.7). As you can see that the diagonal lines do not appear to intersect, though in reality they are extensions of the same line. The Poggendorf illusion can be explained by a combination of physical and cognitive factors. These factors are called structural effects and processing strategies. The structural effect depends upon the biological and optical construction of the eye. The processing strategy depends upon the cognitive decisions that are shaped by learning, experience and motivation.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Is perception a developmental process? Like any other psychological processes, perception is also different in children as compared to the adults.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, throughout the life span of an individual some changes occur in the perceptual processes. Basic perceptual functions in children may continue to mature during first year due to the actual normal functioning of the visual system. At behavioural level, we can find some responses in newborns to the direction, distance or movement of stimuli. Infants are capable of directing their age movements toward targets. Neonates tend to make convergent and divergent eye movements. Even repetitive eye movement sequence in the presence of a moving pattern called optikinetic nystagmus, is seen. But visual acuity of neonates is quite poor. Infants can discriminate between patterns. Fontz (1963) found that infants younger than one month, reported a looking preference for stimuli containing facial features; but could not differentiate between normal and a scrambled face. This suggests they are discriminating patterns on basis of simple elements rather than on the basis of total stimulus organisation. However, by 4 months, there is definite preference for unscrambled face; indicating they can identify human face. Process of habituation can be seen from the very first days of life. So, the newborn child does have a reasonable set of perceptual capacities, quite soon after the birth.</p>
                        <p>One of the most informative ways to monitor changes in perceptual discrimination, recognition and information processing is to observe the way in which child selects information from external stimuli. By monitoring eye movement patterns in children we can determine the manner in which they are viewing and hence constructing. As child becomes older there is gradual movement toward a consideration of more global aspects of a pattern and its elements. Older children are more efficient at extracting details. But there is one form of pattern discrimination error, which is characteristic of young children. This involves mirror reversals (common around 3 year and gradually decrease, until child is about 10 or 11 years). Letter reversals, in children suggest that a child is relatively insensitive to orientation of a stimulus.</p>
                        <p>Perceptual change in adults involve basic sensory function especially like dark adaptation which tend to diminish with age, response to more complex visual problems becomes better, or more accurate with age.</p>
                        <p>As we grow older, there seems to be gradual decrease in efficiency of sensory structures. This is, however accompanied by gradual improvement in our abilities to perform complex, perceptual integrations and discriminations.</p>

                        <p>You would have heard that some persons have reported correctly about their previous birth, or can predict about some event which is about to occur in very near future, like some accident is to take place or such a person sitting 500 kms would be doing a particular task. These extraordinary types of perceptions require no sense organ stimulation whatsoever. Though, ESP is a controversial issue, yet some research has been carried out even in India. ESP stimulates also called as parapsychological phenomenon is of two main kinds-</p>

                        <p>There is skepticism about ESP, one of the chief reasons being that no method has been formed for reliably demonstrating the phenomena. Also, the results do not vary systematically with the introduction of different experimental manipulation. But still, it is desirable to keep an open mind about issues that permit empirical demonstration, as some ESP phenomena do.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>We meet someone for the first time and talk with or observe him or her for a few minutes. Even in this short space of time we make judgements about a number of characteristics. Social perception is concerned with our interpretation of behaviour in social settings and generally refers to how we perceive others, favourably or unfavourably. Social perception is of great relevance to medical profession. How the patient perceives the physician determines his trust for physician's healing power. Similarly physician's perception of the patient, his illness, agony and pain influences physician's involvement and efficacy of treatment. In the present era of consumer protection social perception of both the physician and the patient has gained even more importance. We form opinion of other persons by means of initial impression formed, the reasons for prejudice and discrimination, and also the development of liking and relationships with specific individuals through interpersonal attraction.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Attribution</h3>
                        <p>As we do not have access to the personal thoughts, motives, or feelings of others, we make inferences about the traits based on the behaviour we observe. If we infer that something about the person is primarily responsible for the behaviour our inference is called "dispositional attribution." But if we include that some external force is, primarily responsible for the behaviour, it is called "situational attribution".</p>
                        <p>Basic tendency to ascribe causes to events is believed to be an inherent part of how people process information in both their social and physical world. A particular behaviour is considered to be caused by environmental forces plus personal forces, which is further divided into motivation and ability. Motivation involves both an intention to do something and an exertion of efforts to accomplish it. There is also relation between personal force of ability and environmental forces such as task difficulty. Together, these qualities form the perception of 'can' if the personal force of ability outweighs environmental force, then individual can do action.</p>
                        <p>Behaviour is seen as involving choices and intended effects on the part of the individual. A perceiver is said to take into account not only what other person does but also what the person might have done. What a person does is a chosen action. Some of the effects of chosen and unchosen actions are same, but other effects are uncommon to both chosen or unchosen actions. It is these uncommon effects, which yield clues regarding the intentions of another person. A perceiver gains most of the information about personal characteristics of another person, from a small number of uncommon effects, which have low valance.</p>
                        <p>According to Kelley (1967) the observers evaluate the motives for the behaviour of others using a number of criteria. Observers use this information to form a casual schema with which they make sense of things happening around them.</p>
                        <p>Attribution theory and social cognition has been applied in a number of different settings. Of our relevance is cognitive theory of depression by Beck (see Chapter 21). This theory describes the faulty inferences people make when in a depressed state. These depressed persons blame themselves when something goes wrong, think others have interfered and nothing can be good for them even in the future.</p>
                        <p><strong>Self-perception:</strong> We use, much the same processes for self-attribution, as that for other attribution. When we want to make attributions about our own behaviour, we become observers of that behaviour and make attributions much as if we were observing someone else. Therefore, with our behaviour we would first determine whether the environment, has caused the behaviour through some strong external force. If this does not seem likely, we then, assume, the behaviour occurred because of some internal motives or personality traits. Internal states are inferred by ruling out external forces.</p>
                        <p><strong>Errors in attribution:</strong> We underestimate the situational causes of behaviour, jumping to conclusions about dispositions of person. This bias toward disposition rather than situational attributions is called fundamental attribution error. Due to the expectation people tend to see, what they want to see and hear what they want to, our motives and emotions may also lead us to expect to perceive certain things. Projective tests, capitalise on these influences of motivation and emotion on perception. Perhaps, the greatest influence of motivation on perception is to be found in perception of such complex events as social and interpersonal relationships. This is so, because social situations are often indefinite and ambiguous. Our perception of them are less, definite and stable than our perceptions of physical objects. Expectancy or set, refers to the idea that we may be 'ready' and 'prepared for' certain kind of sensory input. Expectancy has much to do with selection of what we perceive or attend to. It also has a large role to play in the way, we perceive ambiguous situations.</p>

                        <h3>Sensory Defects</h3>
                        <p>When sensory apparatus is damaged or partially destroyed the impairment of perception may not be an accurate reflection of sensory damage. In Hemianopia, for example destruction in visual cortex of brain can render one half of visual receptor apparatus inactive, so that patient's visual field is cut in half vertically. Surprisingly patient may not report this as a handicap to his everyday activities, as he has been able to readjust or compensate for it. Gestalt psychologists investigated such patients to demonstrate their principle of closure in perception. A circle presented to such a patient, so that it overlapped the functioning and blind areas was reported as a complete circle. As in other situation where, closure operates hemianopic perceived the whole figure when the amount presented was sufficient to determine the nature of whole. Similar closure effects have been seen in patients suffering from deafness; affecting only certain sound frequencies, and in patients with disorder of tactile sensations.</p>
                        <p>A more elaborate instance of this tendency to closure after defect occurs in phenomenon known as "phantom limbs". Following amputation the patient may continue to experience realistic sensations in missing limb for sometime even for years. This odd phenomenon is related to the "perception of bodily self" or bodily image derived from sensations in muscles, tendons, joints and balancing mechanism, as well as from vision, hearing, taste, touch and smell.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Perceptual Function</h3>
                        <p>Perceptual functions have been tested which basically are based on Gestalt principles. The Ishihara test for colour blindness is one of the examples, the subject is shown the series of cards, and each contains a mosaic made up of hundreds of little dots of different colours. Embedded in mosaic might be a numeral, which can be presented on the basis of the principle of similarity. A normal person will use colour, as basis of similarity but colour blind, will use brightness as basis of similarity.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Pain Perception</h3>
                        <p>Melzack and Wall (1965) have proposed a "Gate control" theory of pain, which takes into account psychological variables as well as sensory inputs (see Chapter 25). Perception of intensity of pain, tolerance and its impact on the global functioning of the individual is dependent on perception of pain.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Hallucinations</h3>
                        <p>Hallucinations are defined as percepts, which occur without an external stimulus. They can occur, in any of the senses and have all characters of normal perception, yet there is nothing in environment, which stimulate the sense receptors to produce experience. It is different from illusion, as in an illusion some of the sensory features of stimulus are identified but recognition of whole is incorrect. Hallucinations occur in patients with psychotic disorders especially chronic schizophrenics and in patients having organic psychosis. They can be classified in terms of particular sense through which they are apparently experienced, visual, auditory or tactile.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Sensory Deprivation</h3>
                        <p>Sensory deprivation can lead to considerable psychological disturbance. Such disturbances are also known to occur in patients admitted for a very long duration in the hospital especially those patients confined for long periods or indefinitely in respirators, those restricted by attachment to various pieces of recording equipment and lifesupport systems in intensive care units, and those deprived of sight for a period after eye surgery. Even more generally, we may note that the manifestations of impairment of consciousness in delirious states are commonly at night, which may in part be due to the lower level of sensory and perceptual stimulation at that time. The active modification of the sensory input is required in certain clinical situations.</p>

                        <p>The sensory organs-vision, hearing, smell, touch and taste are highly complex systems and they do not make a straightforward response to each stimulus encountered. The knowledge comes to each one of us through our senses. Sensation is the primary source of all human knowledge. In human being unlike simple organism, sensation is only a small part of much more complicated information processing systems.</p>
                        <p>A stimulus is any form of energy to which we can respond (pressure on the skin), a sense is a particular physiological pathway for responding to a specific kind of energy. Sensation is the feeling we have in response to information that comes in through our sensory organs. Perception is the way our brain organises these feelings to make sense out of them. This involves recognition of objects that comes from a combination of sensations and the memory of previous sensory experiences. Sensation contains both qualitative as well as quantitative element, and both physical and physiological events are collectively called 'sensation'. Sensation refers to the process of receiving information, whereas to perceive means to interpret and understand. Perception is the process of knowing the world outside you, by forming some mental representation. Perception is a complex process, extending far beyond the mere registering of light, sound, and other impulses from the external world. This external information must be internally coded and transformed before anyone can know what is really out there.</p>
                        <p>Since any single external cue is likely to prove insufficient to narrow down the possibilities about the external world, we are forced to rely upon various combinations of cues. Much of what we perceive, the sensory patterns merely provide the 'raw data' for experience. The sensory information is transformed elaborated and combined with memories to create what we actually experience or perceive.</p>
                        <p>Perceptual processes, which provide meaning to what we see or hear, are classified asform, visual depth, constancy, movement perception, plasticity and individual differences.</p>
                        <p>Visual illusions are a dramatic example of how perceptual cues can be assembled incorrectly. An illusion is any figure that gives rise to a bizarre interpretation of reality. The illusions demonstrate that what we perceive often depends on processes that go far beyond the 'raw data' of sensory input. Specific instances in which the apparent curvature or length of a perceived line are not predictable from the curvature or length of its stimulus pattern, have been called the "Geometrical illusions". But this does not mean that they occur only with regular lines and patterns; they can also be demonstrated with quite irregular drawings and with real objects in normal environment. The illusions are important because they may provide clues for our understanding of processes of shape perception. Throughout the life span of an individual some changes occur in the perceptual processes.</p>

Social perception and attribution are important for physicians as these are related to their interpersonal relationship with the patients.</p>
