                        <p><em>A 3 years old child admitted in paediatric ICU, is in very critical condition. The patient is restless, crying with pain and has very little chance of survival. His parents are constantly enquiring about his condition. As a doctor attending upon the child, what should you do? Tell the parents about his critical condition or just do not talk to them. Often patients and family members have been ignored and not informed about the condition. Now more and more patients and family members wish to know all about the disease process, prognosis and treatment plans. In such cases, where the illness is fatal, the doctors' role in comforting the patient and family is very vital.</em></p>
                        <p>The care of the dying patient and the comfort of the bereaved are major responsibility of the doctor. It is as important as providing treatment. These areas have only in recent years been studied systematically. Death evokes fear and embarrassment among most people, as they have not experienced death till late in their lives. The medical professions also do not encounter death as frequent as it was in the past. With the improvement of life expectancy in this century, death has become less well known and therefore, perhaps, more frightening. Yet death is inevitable in many conditions and doctors have to be prepared to deal with such situations. They should be able to offer help in easing the process of dying. For doctors, it may also now evoke more of a sense of professional failure since the expectation is increasingly one of the cure from life-threatening diseases-a fact which colours the doctor's attitude to the death. It is of considerable value to understand and thereby help, both the dying and the bereaved.</p>
                        <p>The reactions of family members to death vary according to the nature of death. The ending of life may take a variety of forms—sometimes sudden and unexpected as with a fatal accident or heart attack, sometimes slow and expected following a period of 'terminal' illness. Many healthy elderly people die peacefully in their sleep without warning; death being simply due to 'old age'. Determinants of the psychological response to dying are associated with its cause (e.g. due to ageing or disease, and if so its nature), with the individual and with his environment. Fears of death are at times focussed less on the thought of death itself, and more on the process of dying. Sometimes, death is disturbing as it may result in extreme physical distress.</p>
                        <p>Many factors influence an individual's response to death. One of the common significant response is the presence of religious faith, since this often holds out the promise of eternal life. It has been observed in hospitalised patients, that those who had a firm religious faith have least anxiety. Consoling power of religion is seen in all types of patients, with different religious background. Sudden death due to accidents or cardiac arrest, are more difficult to accept than death due to chronic illness.</p>
                        <p>Another factor that influences responses to death is, age in the younger patient as the anxiety is further aroused by parenthood with apprehension concerning dependent children. Depression is also frequently seen among the dying. While this may by partly related to physical discomfort in some illnesses, it may also stem from feelings of isolation resulting from a tendency to avoidance or emotional withdrawal on the part of others when a person is known to be dying. At the same time, this disengagement may sometimes be a two-way process, with the dying person himself withdrawing, perhaps in anticipation of the final parting. Depression may additionally be explicable as part of a kind of anticipatory grief or mourning by the individual for the losses that he is experiencing or expecting by loss of life.</p>
                        <p>The patient (if conscious) and family members face a very difficult time as the death approaches. Many problems arise at this time due to lack of communication and doctors' ability to handle such situations. Often the doctors take death of the patient as a matter of fact and the patient may just be a bed no. 2 for them. This attitude and manner of communicating causes lots of harsh feeling in the family members. It is thus important for the doctors to understand different types of reactions and responses to death and thereby deal accordingly.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Robert, a 43-year-old businessman, and his wife had two sons. Doctors had given him six months to live, but offered and even encouraged him to undergo chemotherapy which would give him a ten per cent chance of recovery. The chemotherapy had wrecked his body and made him physically much weaker. In spite of this, his family and his doctor desired him to continue. When he was asked as to what he wanted to do, that was the first time that he said that he wanted the treatment stopped and that he only wanted to spend the rest of the day of his life with his family and with as much peace as possible.</p>
                        <p>This incident supports the fact that the quality of time spent in the last days of life is most important for all concerned. The family members should be encouraged to support patient's attempts to remain as independent as possible. He can be involved in making decisions concerned with the family. In our culture there is a tendency to hide facts from the patient. When we do not talk about death with the patient, it does not mean that the patient is not aware of it. Rather, they conceal their anxieties and other thoughts to themselves, which might be more painful. If the patient is in a conscious state, talking about death, at least warning of impending death can help the patient to be prepared for it. Surely it is better to face death than to die suddenly. We need to be there willing to listen to the thoughts, feelings, fears and doubts about dying. Do not brush aside the topic, so as not to cause any unnecessary upsets or avoid the subject because you cannot cope up with the patients, and family's reaction. In some situations, the patient may not want to talk about the pending death. In those situations we should not push this subject. Chapter 23 gives details of communicating with dying patients.</p>
                        <p>There are two areas of decision making that concern the dying patient. One has to do with the treatment and the other has to do with practical needs and plans for the immediate future such as organising finances, making will for legal matters, seeking spiritual readiness and rekindling relationships. Lack of information is one of the primary causes of anxiety among the terminally ill. We should therefore take all things into consideration before deciding to withhold any information about the patient. It would be tragic if one were to die without fulfilling or expressing one's wishes regarding areas of one's wishes.</p>
                        <p>If the family members are well-informed about the pending death, they can either fulfill their certain religious rituals or mend their relationship with the dying person, if it was disturbed.</p>
                        <p>By not warning the family members, we often generate guilt feelings in them. I have encountered a situation, where the wife when informed about her husband's death said that if she was informed earlier, at least she could have offered some prayers to improve her husband's next life (a Hindu belief).</p>
                        <p>There are many practical and thoughtful things that we can do to help the patients in their final days. Life is precious, even when death is near. We should do all that can make them comfortable.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The effect of death on those who are still alive has also received systematic investigation in recent years. A fairly consistent pattern of mourning has been identified (Parkes, 1965). Typical or uncomplicated grief is usually seen following the death of a parent, child, sibling or first-degree relative with whom there has been at least a moderate amount of social contact within the preceding year.</p>
                        <h3>Stages of Bereavement</h3>
                        <p>Bereavement involves several stages. The first response to an unexpected death is one of shock and disbelief-a period of denial, which may last from a few hours to a fortnight. A 42 years old woman lost her husband while he was undergoing angioplasty. When the news was conveyed to her by the relative, she became absolutely shocked, did not cry, and kept saying that 'Deepak is feeling better, he has sent me home to look after children. Tomorrow he will be discharged from the hospital.' She was not able to give any reasons why the other relatives were crying. She came out of this state after half an hour. During this period, bereaved person feels numbed but is able to carry on with the usual routine, as well as coping with arrangements for the funeral.</p>
                        <p>Gradually however, this protective denial begins to give way to a full realisation of the loss and is associated with feelings of despair. Attacks of yearning may be accompanied by great distress, with reminders of the deceased (such symptoms may include feelings of tightness, etc.). Between these waves of distress, there is a general state of depression, apathy and sense of futility. Sleep is disturbed and appetite poor. There is a preoccupation with thoughts of the deceased and often a characteristic restlessness which may appear aimless but probably represents a searching for the dead-sometimes acknowledged by the bereaved person, who consciously looks in places previously frequented by the dead person. Irritability and anger are as responsible for the death. Often in the hospital, sometimes the medical staff is blamed, and at times the relatives become very aggressive and abusive towards the doctors. On the other hand, there may be feelings of guilt and self-blame for past behaviour towards the deceased, whose memory tends to be idealised. In the earlier part of this stage, however, there is a tendency to think of the dead person as still alive to feel his presence or to actually see or hear him but gradually this is replaced by full realisation of the loss. Another frequent characteristic is the appearance of traits of the deceased in the behaviour of the bereaved including often the symptoms of the last illness. Finally, the intensity of this stage begins to decline after a few weeks and is generally minimal by about six months, with full acceptance of the death. For several years thereafter, however, there may be occasional brief periods of depression and yearning, usually precipitated by reminders of the loss and especially by anniversaries.</p>
                        <p>A great deal of mental activity is involved in the process of grieving. Freud (1917) described his mental activity as grief work and Lindemann (1944) subdivided this into three components: (1) emancipation from bondage to the deceased (2) readjustment to the environment from which the deceased in missing, and (3) formation of new relationships. The first of these tasks is the most crucial and depends upon the bereaved person remembering, often repeatedly, the many shared experiences that formed the basis of the relationship with the deceased. This process is initially extremely distressing but becomes progressively less, so with passage of time such recollections do not bring pain but pleasure. Table 14.1 summarises the stages of bereavement.</p>

                                <li>Shock and disbelief</li>
                                <li>Protective denial</li>
                                <li>Preoccupation with thoughts (Feeling of guilt and self-blame)</li>
                                <li>Tendency to think of dead people alive</li>
                                <li>Appearance of traits (of the deceased person in the bereaved)</li>
                                <li>Depression</li>
                                <li>Full acceptance</li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>

                        <p>A person's mourning does not of course take place in isolation, but within a sociocultural context, which includes the particular beliefs and rituals of his culture Anthropological studies have shown that these vary widely between different societies, each of which seems to have developed its own beliefs about the meaning of death together with a set of rituals concerning the disposal of the bereaved. Now, the ritual associated with bereavement has declined, and Gorer (1965) claims that this loss of recognition and support for the expression of the grief is responsible for increased psychological disturbance among bereaved people today. In this respect, the Orthodox way of ritual mourning appears to provide a more favourable environment. In our culture, there is also a tendency to encourage the strict control of feelings on the part of the mourner.</p>
                        <p>Religious beliefs are also important in bereavement. Just as belief in an 'after -life' can colour the attitudes of the dying to their condition, so too it affects those who are left behind. The idea of ultimate reunion can be a great comfort to the bereaved, though it sometimes leads to suicide in order to hasten the process.</p>
                        <p>Children also have problems in accepting death of their dear ones. Children develop the concept of death around seven years of age. Due to the incomplete understanding, very young children often cannot accept the absence of the person due to death. As children do not openly express their fears regarding death, they often develop emotional problems, which are manifested in a sudden drop in their academic performance, sleep disturbances, development of fears, depression and insecurity. Children should be helped to talk out their fears and anxieties.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The care of the dying is also one of the responsibilities of the doctor. A great deal can be done to provide relief from physical discomfort, and especially pain; but care of the whole person includes consideration of his psychological welfare, and this is a matter which has received more systematic attention in recent years.</p>
                        <p>One of the most frequently discussed problems, is how much information should be given to dying patients, in particular, whether and if so when, they should be made aware of the fact that their illness is fatal. This question is often put in relation to cancer-should the patient be told? the implication being that this is like pronouncing a death sentence. In fact, the matter is nowhere near as simple at this. By no means all patients diagnosed as having cancer will have their lives shortened by the disease, while there are obviously many of other diseases that can threaten life. Nor in the presence of a fatal disease, is the doctor usually able to predict with any degree of accuracy when death will occur. For their part, patients often suspect and sometimes are sure that they are dying before being told so. Doctors vary in their attitudes to telling patients the truth about fatal illness, ranging from those who consider it never right to do so, to those who believe in always providing such information. Most, probably take a position somewhere between these two extremes and try to judge what is best for each individual patient.</p>
                        <p>Most dying patients ultimately come to an awareness of the truth, whether or not they ask for and are given it. Greater stress should be given on listening to what patients have to say and ask than on what should be said to them. If they are given the opportunity to talk about their situation, to voice their concerns and to express their wishes, it is usually possible to judge the best response to any question about prognosis. Some indicate quite openly that they do not want to know if their illness is fatal, and this wish should be respected. Others, ask the question in such a way that it indicates the need for reassurance, or at least hope ('It's not cancer, is it doctor?'). In this event, rather than giving an immediate denial and perhaps untruthful reply, which will be of more lasting value to the patient than a consoling but false picture of the future; by allowing him to talk freely and repeatedly in this way, and by giving simple explanations of his disease, the patient's awareness of dying may gradually grow in an atmosphere of sympathetic understanding.</p>
                        <p>Attitude towards death, namely, the sense of failure felt by medical and other staff in the face of a fatal illness. This may sometimes lead to a tendency to withdraw from contact with the dying, which may be sensed by the patient.</p>
                        <p>Many patients are sensitive to this difficulty on the part of some doctors and feel unable to talk openly to them about their illness, for fear of causing embarrassment. However, that a shift may be occurring within the medical profession towards greater frankness, and this is associated with an increasing emphasis on the care of the dying in medical education.</p>
                        <p>An awareness of the normal sequence of events in typical grief, together with an understanding of the psychological processes involved, should be of assistance to those who are concerned with advising and helping the bereaved, and indeed it has become recognised that bereavement counselling requires more than common sense if it is to be effective.</p>
                        <p>During the early stage of numbness, the bereaved person needs a certain amount of assistance with simple decisions and practical matters to do with the registration of the death, funeral arrangements, etc. Once the initial phase of shock has passed, sharing of the feelings of grief may be most helpful, while advice to 'stop thinking about it' can be positively harmful. Expression of emotions should be allowed but not forced by insensitive probing. Individuals will vary in the degree to which they actually express their grief-what is important is that they should be able to feel it. This means rejecting the customary social attitude, which seems to imply that grief can be avoided by not talking about it, and by restricting conversation to trivialities instead. The bereaved person needs sympathetic understanding but not pity, and at this time, social support system provided by relatives and friends in our culture is very helpful in coping with the loss. Bereavement sometimes leads to abnormal reactions, which may be of clinical importance, both physically and psychologically. There is evidence for an increased incidence of both morbidity and mortality from organic disease, following bereavement. Bereavement may also result in a psychiatric illness such a neurotic illness, depression, schizophrenia, or mania, for example. In this case, the actual nature of the psychological disturbance is probably not determined by the bereavement, which simply acts as a nonspecific precipitating stress.</p>
                        <p>Sometimes you may encounter abnormal grief reactions, which may be seen as variants of the normal process, and are thus 'stressspecific', i.e. they only occur following a loss. Parkes (1965) describes three types of abnormal grief. Chronic grief represents an intensification and prolongation of the typical form, and is frequently associated with recurrent ideas of guilt and self-blame, and with physical symptoms, similar to those of the final illness of the deceased. Inhibited grief tends to occur in the very young or the very old, and is characterised by the prolonged inhibition of a large part of the total picture of typical grief, with substitution of other symptoms instead. Delayed grief is typical or chronic grief occurring after a delay of months or years.</p>
                        <p>Parkes reviewed the evidence, mostly from studies of bereaved women, concerning the determinants of severe grief reactions, and concluded that the high-risk case would have the following characteristics; a young widow with children and no close relatives nearby; a timid, dependent personality, history of depressive illness; a relationship with her husband which was closely dependent or ambivalent with no preparedness for his unexpected death; and finally, a family and cultural tradition which inhibits the expression of grief.</p>
