                        <p>Attention is the perceptual processing of selected inputs for inclusion in our conscious experience, or awareness, at any given time. We do not react equally to all stimuli that impinge upon us; we focus upon only a few. In other words, this perceptual focussing is called attention. Concentration is the ability to sustain attention for a specific period, on a particular object or subject.</p>
                        <p>The processes of attention divide our field of attention. Consider being in the sports stadium watching a cricket match. While your focus of attention is on the batting of the player, yet you are also aware of the scoreboard, you would also be trying to focus on the commentary and you also would be dimly aware of other observers sitting next to you, or occupying front rows. Here though your focus was on the player, the marginal inputs (awareness of other events) illustrate characteristic of attention that it is constantly shifting. What is at the focus one moment may be in the margin the next moment and the objects being in the margins may become the focus.</p>
                        <p>Attention is needed for the efficient assimilation of information and generation of coordinated behaviour. It is like a computer system that gets stuck if it tries to process at each level a large number of simultaneous events. The attentional limitation is not necessarily one of response in compatibility though this might sometimes be a factor. You can understand this by an example that in an experiment on conditional salivation reflects to a sound new light can suppress processing of the sound as indexed by inhibition of salivation. This is a competition for a limited processing capacity rather than motor output (Rizzolatti, 1983).</p>
                        <p>A basic process in attention is considered to be a kind of filtering of the sensory information we receive. We cannot process all the information in our sensory channels, so we filter out, or block irrelevant information (Broadbent 1958). There is evidence, that stimuli to which we are not actively attending still register in some form in our perceptual system, even though we may not recognised them at that time. There are two types of processing, known as parallel processing and serial processing. The parallel processing is when we are able to pick up information from two different conversations or sources simultaneously. On the other hand serial processing is when we pick up information in a serial order from different sources.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>There are certain factors, which are either external or internal factors, which direct and facilitate our filtering of inputs.</p>
                        <h3>External Factors</h3>
                        <p>There are many external factors, which attract our attention more easily than other stimuli. The features that call for selection of focus of attention are stimuli, which are of higher intensity, like loud music, or lecture delivered with microphone. Stimuli of larger size generally arouse attention, thus you would experience that in seminars or conferences emphasis is placed on bold and large lettering for audiovisual presentation. Contrast and novelty are other characteristics of the stimuli, which easily catch attention. These principles are often used in making of commercial advertisement, designing fashion clothes, architecture of a building. You also use these methods in your academic presentations. Repetition and movement of stimuli are also used by the media to facilitate attention, as moving objects are more attended to, as when compared to static objects.</p>
                        <h3>Internal Factors</h3>
                        <p>The internal factors are those present within the individuals that cause them to attend to one event instead of other. One of them is 'motive' or need, if you want to buy a car, your attention would go more easily on advertisements related to selling of cars, similarly if you are hungry, you attend more to the eating places. Preparating set, i.e. a person's readiness to respond to one kind of sensory input, but not to other kinds, is another factor, which determines attention and was dicussed in Chapter 2 (Sensation and Perception). Interest, also influences the selectivity of attention. These internal factors may be the temporary or permanent state of our mind at a given time, e.g. motives keep changing interest may be more or less permanent as interest in sports. These factors provide us with a certain amount of consistency in the events to which we pay attention. So they give our experience, or perception of the world some direction and stability.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Attention can be subdivided into different subsystems. These are based on somewhat different brain regions. Perry and Hodges classify attention as follows:</p>
                        <h3>Selective Attention</h3>
                        <p>Imagine you are in the library preparing for your seminar. While you are going through the latest research in the journal, you also hear some of your fellow students talking to each other, the attendant helping someone to find a book, the telephone ringing, noise of hammers coming from one corner of the library where the carpenters are at work. Despite all these potential distractions you are probably still able to focus your thoughts on the article that you were reading. Our ability to attend one main event whilst being remotely conscious of others provides us with the paradox of how attention can be both a selective and a divided process simultaneously. The restriction of mental processing to one event at a time is called 'selective attention'.</p>
                        <p>This type of attention provides the means by which we reduce the workload on our mental systems. Schizophrenic patients have been found consistently deficit in their ability to focus on a particular task. They show marked impairment inability to avoid distracting stimuli.</p>
                        <p>Broadbent (1958) has explained how attention is controlled by a filter. According to him, the information that becomes filtered out of the system (consciously unattended) will receive only a low level of analysis. How we select what to select, and on what criterion, is decided very early in the processing of information.</p>
                        <p>Selection is based upon the physical properties of the stimulus and is also referred to as sensory selection. Broadbent's filter theory of attention has been used in number of experiments with normal individuals as well as with schizophrenic patients and this still holds a popular place in theories of attention.</p>
                        <p>Generally most of the individuals cannot perform more than one task without taking their mind off the other. However, there is some evidence that people may be able to be trained to perform two difficult tasks at the same time.</p>
                        <h3>Divided Attention</h3>
                        <p>It is our every day experience that we are able to divide our attention between two or more events or tasks, such as listening to music while studying, knitting while watching television, or engaging in conversation while driving. Psychologists studying the selective aspects of attention have always emphasised how limited our ability is for diverse attention. In the typical experiment of dichotic listening it was always found that subjects were unable to attend more than one thing at a time. However, in these experiments generally the tasks given were very intellectually demanding, hence subjects had very little mental power left for attending to another task.</p>
                        <p>It is fairly recently that more attention is being focussed on the divided attention. Kahneman (1973) proposed the 'resource allocation' theory of attention.' Resources' refer to a reservoir of mental energy from which is drawn the appropriate amount when dealing with specific tasks. The more difficult the task, the greater will be the demands of the mental resources required to complete it. The less energy one particular task demands then the more of that energy will be available for allocation to other things being done simultaneously. It is not the task themselves that determine the allocation of the resources but the person who performs them. For instance, even though a particular task may require a lot of resources we may perform poorly on the task simply by not putting enough effort into it. This allocation of cognitive resources to the task, is under conscious control and we are free at any time to switch our attention to other events.</p>
                        <p>Our capacity for dividing attention between tasks increases with practice on them. It has been suggested that our mental resources do not have limited capacity but may actually expand with practice. It may, therefore, be possible to develop our cognitive resources in more efficient ways, once the principles are more clearly understood.</p>
                        <h3>Sustained Attention</h3>
                        <p>Sustained attention or vigilance is required to process stimuli of long duration. Sustained attention underlies the capacity to detect a signal over long periods (Perry and Hodges 1999), for example to inspect a screen and report when a signal appears. Sustained attention can be assessed on continuous performance test. The test consists of rapidly presented set of task with varied spacing and timing of target and nontarget stimuli.</p>

                        <p>Compare a person who has been driving for long to that of a novice. One notices that after acquiring the skill a person can drive and converse or listen to the music at the same time, whereas the novice will have to put in all his mental resources in driving, e.g. his concentration on the road, on the steering wheel, accelerator, brakes, etc. This fundamental difference between our ability to perform a complex task as a beginner and later as a skilled person is that of degree of mental effort involved. The way that a skilled person applies a little effort in order to perform a task fluently is a source of constant frustration to the struggling novice. Skilled performance seems to require few cognitive resources such as that involving attention to detail. Shiffrin and Schneider (1977) proposed that attention occurred in two domains, which they named 'dom A' and 'dom B'. Dom A processing describes general, undivided attention, the features of which are that it is passive, automatic, has a relatively large capacity and makes a multilevel analysis of the attended information. Conversely, dom B processing is consciously controlled and is an active system having limited capacity and having no control over the processing that occurs in dom A. The dom A system continuously receives input about the environment that it processes unconsciously. Tasks that are well learnt have their elements stored in long-term memory, so they are available during the automatic processing of events when such tasks are subsequently performed.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Attention and concentration are the psychological processes, which are the first to get affected in illness and especially in psychiatric disorders. The patients with schizophrenia exhibit deficits in attention, which is evident even from the casual clinical contact with these patients. Some schizophrenics lack the capacity to perceive and respond to situations objectively, due to their inability to achieve a major 'set'. The schizophrenic is characterised by segmental set, in which response preparation is compromised due to an inappropriate focus on minor or irrelevant aspects of the stimulus array. The attentional deficits in schizophrenic have been assessed on immediate serial recall tasks, span of apprehension, reaction time, dictomic listening, backward masking and continuous performance tests. Assessment of attention and concentration has been discussed in Chapter 18, on assessment.</p>
                        <p>Undue preoccupation with memories of recent and/or past events associated, for example, with bereavement, an anxiety state or a depressive disorder, results in diminished attention to the external world, so that information is not registered and the individual becomes forgetful and unable to pursue a task requiring sustained attention such as reading.</p>
                        <p>In some patients who complain of physical symptoms for which no organic cause can be discovered, it is probable that their complaints are, at least in part, due to an excessive focussing of attention on the site of the symptom and that what they are experiencing is a bodily sensation which does not normally reach the level of awareness. Just as in some patients input may be selectively enhanced, so in others it may be blocked for psychological reasons. There are patients who, though free from organic disease, present with a loss of skin sensation in part of the body, or of a special sense such as vision or hearing. Such complaints usually do not correspond with those produced by organic disease and they are commonly described as hysterical. It has for long been suggested that the mechanism by which they occur is a process of involuntary dissociation between a limited part of consciousness (e.g. that concerned with skin sensation from a particular area or with visual or auditory perception) and the rest of consciousness. Thus these parts are dissociated or shut off from the rest of awareness and the individual no longer experiences the appropriate sensations or perceptions.</p>
                        <p>Some of the phenomena produced by hypnosis may be related to alterations of attention, and indeed the fundamental basis for the process may be a highly selective focussing of attention by the subject on the hypnotist with a corresponding lowering of attention to all other stimuli. Thus in a suitable subject the hypnotist is able to suggest a selective inattention to particular stimuli, resulting in, for example, an area of skin anaesthesia or a loss of a special sense such as vision or hearing.</p>
                        <p>Diseases affecting the brainstem (i.e. including the reticular formation), such as inflammation (e.g. encephalitis lethargic or sleeping sickness) or pressure from a tumour, can cause drowsiness, sleep or complete loss of consciousness. Conditions affecting the functioning of the brain more generally (e.g. through lack of oxygen or blood supply) may cause a state of delirium, with impairment or 'clouding' of consciousness; the patient may become confused, or dis-oriented-not knowing the present time or place and hallucinated, may have difficulty in concentration and subsequently have little or no memory for events at the time. Finally, episodes of unconsciousness occur in some forms of epileptic seizure, a condition associated with an electrical discharge in the brain which, in some individuals, 'epileptics', arises spontaneously from time-to-time, but can be provoked in anyone by chemical or electrical means (e.g. electroconvulsive therapy or ECT). Attention deficit hyperactive disorder is a common clinical condition in children. This disorder has onset before seven years of age, is four to five times more common in boys than girls. Attention disturbances are manifested as failing to finish the tasks that were started, easy distractibility, and difficulty in tasks requiring sustained attention. Children with poor attention may have average intelligence yet their school performance is very poor. These children often have comorbid problem of conduct disorder or specific learning disability.</p>

                        <p>Attention refers to the perceptual focussing on certain stimuli with the aim of including them in the conscious awareness. Ability to sustain attention for some time is called concentration. Attention is influenced by external and internal factors. The former includes intensity and size of the stimulus, novelty, contrast and movement. The internal factors include motivation and interest. Attention is of three types, namely, selective attention, sustained attention and divided attention. Selective attention refers to the ability to focus the thoughts on a particular stimulus, despite the presence of other factors. Sustained attention refers to the ability to hold attention over considerable period of time (vigilance). Divided attention implies focussing attention on two or more tasks simultaneously. Attention also involves automatic and conscious processing. Study of attention is important since attentional deficits are commonly seen in patients, especially those having anxiety, schizophrenia, somatic complaints and certain neurological conditions. Poor attention and difficulty in sustaining concentration is the primary complaint in children diagnosed as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.</p>
