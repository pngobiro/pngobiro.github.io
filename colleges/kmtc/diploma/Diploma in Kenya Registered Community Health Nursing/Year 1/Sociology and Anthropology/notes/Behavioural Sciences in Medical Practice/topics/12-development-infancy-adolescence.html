                        <p><em>Sanjay, a 15 years old adolescent, has frequent temper outbursts, he does not get along with his parents, he has occasional fights with his parents and his younger sister. He frequently demands money from his parents, which the parents cannot afford. His parents feel that his academic performance is also going down, as he spends lot of time in looking at himself in the mirror, and is interested in talking to girls. Though he is a terror at home, but on the other hand, he is very popular amongst his friends. Sanjay is not suffering from any psychiatric problem, but is passing through an adolescent period. To understand normal deviations in behaviour, one should be aware of the normal developmental process.</em></p>
                        <p>The human life cycle influences health and illness at all its stages. Human development starts at the time of birth and continues till death. Development passes through important stages of life. These can be understood in terms of Infancy, Childhood, Adolescence, Adulthood and Old age. In this chapter, developmental process from infancy to adolescence shall be discussed, and in the next chapter, development process in adulthood and old age would be discussed.</p>

                        <p>The human infant has a number of adaptive reflexes, including the grasping and sucking reflexes. Infants are social creatures from the day they are born. Early social development, lays a foundation for later relationships with parents, siblings, friends and relatives. Self-awareness and social referencing (increased awareness of others) are two important elements of social development. Self-awareness is seen around 15 months of age. The core of social development lies in the emotional bonds that babies form with their caregivers. Infant attachment is reflected by separation anxiety, which appears around 8-12 months of age. Separation anxiety refers to the distress displayed by infants, when separated from their parents or caregivers.</p>
                        <p>Language proceeds from control of crying to loosing, to babbling, followed by use of single words and then to telegraphic speech. Prelanguage communication between parents and child involves shared rhythms, nonverbal signals (in the form of touch, vocalising, gazing or smiling). Turn taking is the tendency of parent and child to alternate in the sending and receiving of signals and messages.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Stages of Development</h3>
                        <p>Development occurs along multiple lines, it is overall physical development, cognitive, personality, social and neurological development. The personal experiences, organisational styles, coping strategies, feelings and thoughts, all contribute to create one's unique experience of life.</p>
                        <p>Development moves in a fixed, predictable manner, with minor variations in all individuals. Some of the important milestones of development are given in Table 12.1.</p>

                        <h3>Cognitive Development</h3>
                        <p>Jean Piaget (1896 to 1980) focussed on how children and adolescents think and acquire knowledge. His theory is referred to as genetic epistemology, which means to study of acquisition, modification and growth of abstract ideas and abilities on the basis of an inheritive or biological substrate.</p>
                        <p>The concept of schemata lies at the core of his theory. He defined it as a specific cognitive structure that has a behavioural pattern. As an individual grows, the schema becomes more and more complex. Later schemas are referred to as operations, which include imitation, abstraction and higher intelligence. Piaget spoke of two processes: (a) assimilation, and (b) accommodation. The former refers to taking in of new experience, through one's own system of knowledge. The latter implies modification of existing schemas to the demands of the environment. These two processes give rise to the-concept of adaptation, which is the individual's ability to adjust to the environment and interact with it.</p>
                        <p>Piaget gave four stages of cognitive development.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Sensory Motor Stage</h4>
                        <p>It occurs in the first two years of life. It is characterised by learning that occurs through sensory observation. The child is concerned with learning to coordinate purposeful movements with the information from his senses. Object permanence is an important achievement that occurs during this period. It implies that object have an existence independent of child's involvement with them. The child is able to maintain a mental image of an object even though it is not visible.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Preoperational Stage</h4>
                        <p>It occurs during the second and the seventh year. The child uses language and symbols extensively. Thinking and reasoning are at an intuitive level. The child lacks a sense of cause and effect. The characteristic feature of the stage is egocentric thinking that is, having a limited point of view and inability to take the role of other person. Animistic thinking, the tendency to endow physical events and objects with life like psychological attributes is also seen during this stage.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Concrete Operational Stage</h4>
                        <p>It is the stage that occurs between the seventh and eleventh year. In this stage, the child operates and acts on concrete, real and perceivable world of objects and events. Operational thinking replaces egocentric thinking, which means that the child is able to attend and deal with a wide array of information and is able to take others perspective. In this stage, the child is able to form a logical conclusion from two premises and this is known as syllogistic reasoning. The child is able to reason and follow rules and regulations develop moral sense and a code of values. Children who become overly invested in views may show obsessive-compulsive behaviour, and children who resist a code of value often seem willful and inactive.</p>
                        <p>Conservation and reversibility are the other two characteristics of this stage. Conservation is the ability to recognise that the shape and form of objects may change but the mass remains the same. Reversibility is the capacity to understand the relations between things, to understand that one thing can turn into another and back again. For example, ice and water.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Stage of Formal Operations</h4>
                        <p>This stage occurs from 11 years onwards through the end of adolescence. The adolescent is able to think abstractly, reason deductively, define concepts and deal with permutation and combination. Hypotheticodeductive thinking, which is the highest organisation of cognition, occurs during this time. The individual is able to make a hypothesis and test it against reality.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Psychosexual Development</h3>
                        <p>Freud was probably the first psychologist, to emphasise the developmental aspects of personality and in particular to stress the decisive role of the early years of infancy and childhood in laying down the basic character structure of the person. Freud felt that personality was well-formed by the end of the fifth year, and that the subsequent growth consisted for the most part of elaborating this basic structure.</p>
                        <p>Freud's notions about personality development came from many sources. But mostly his theory sprang from his observations of his own patients. Freud was fascinated by the fact that most of his patients seemed to have gone through very similar developmental crises as children. Freud believed that "the child is the father of the man". Eventually, he decided that one passes through various psychosexual stages of development, which correspond to the maturational stage of ones body at various times in the life. Each stage is associated with a unique crisis of some kind.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Oral Stage</h4>
                        <p>Oral stage is the period which lasts from birth to about one year of age. The first crisis is that of birth, when one is thrust out into the world and becomes dependent on others to meet the needs. You had innate reflexes that help to survive by creating libidinal energy that had to be discharged; but the manner in which you release this energy changes as body matures. When you were newborn, the brain centres, which control mouth movements were physically, the most developed so libidinal energy released easily through such oral activities as sucking and swallowing.</p>
                        <p>Freud saw many child-like oral behaviour patterns in his patients, such as talking too much, over-eating, excessive smoking and so forth. He presumed that this "residue of their infantile experiences" remained locked away in their unconscious minds because of some traumatic experience they had while in the oral stage. These patients had problems because they were still trying to release libidinal energy through adult oral activities. Therapy for these patients would obviously involve some form of "catharsis" to allow the patients to discharge the libidinal energy that had been repressed while they were still in the oral stage.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Anal Stage</h4>
                        <p>The second crisis occurs when parents begin making demands, which conflicted with instinctual need to obtain immediate gratification of all biological and psychological needs. The second crisis reaches a peak during toilet training, when parents insist that you learn to delay gratification. Freud assumed you resolved this crisis by creating an "ego" or conscious self that could respond to reality by gaining voluntary control over the release of libidinal energy through anal activities.</p>
                        <p>Some of Freud's patients were excessively neat, obstinate, and miserly. These three traits make up what Freud called the "anal character", and he saw all the three as attempts to punish the mother for the trauma of toilet training. The mother demanded that the child "be clean", so the patient became unreasonably tidy. The mother demanded the child to "produce", so the child rebelled by withholding its feces, and became fixated at the anal stage. As an adult, the patient still rebels by obstinately refusing to part with single paise. Again, catharsis and giving the patient insight into the roots of the problemseemed to Freud to be the best therapy.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Phallic Stage</h4>
                        <p>At stage three or so, sex organs began to mature, and did the centres in the brain associated with sexual activity. Thus, one acquires a new avenue for discharging instinctual energies. During this phallic period, boys build up a warm and loving relationship with their mothers, which Freud called the Oedipus complex. At the same age, girls experience an intense "emotional attachment" for their fathers, called the Electra complex. Freud stated that, during the phallic stage, boys experience incestual desires to possess their mothers and compete with (or even kill) their fathers, while girls like their fathers and fear or hate their mothers.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Latency Period</h4>
                        <p>According to Freud, one enters the latency period at about age five or six. At this time, one starts to move out of the home more frequently, and friendships with peers taken on greater importance on one's emotional and intellectual development. Freud believed this was natural homosexual period during which boys found 'heroes' among older male friends and peers, and girls developed 'crushes' on other girls and older women.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Psychosocial Development (Erikson)</h3>
                        <p>Erikson proposed a psychosocial theory of development. This means that the stages of a person's life from birth to death are formed by social influences, interacting with a physically and psychologically nurturing organism. In Erikson's words, there is a mutual fit of individual and environment that is, of the individual's capacity to relate to an over expanding life space of people and institutions, on the one hand, the readiness of these people and institutions to make him part of an enjoying cultural concern (Erikson, 1975).</p>
                        
                        <h4>Eight Developmental Stages</h4>
                        <p>According to the Psychosocial theory, development proceeds in stages-eight in all; the first four stages occur during infancy and childhood, the fifth stage during adolescence and last three stages during the adult years including old age. Erikson has placed particular emphasis on the adolescent period because it is then that the transition between childhood and adulthood is made.</p>
                        <p>These consecutive stages are not laid out according to a strict chronological timetable, because Erikson feels that a given child has its own timetable, and therefore, it would be misleading to specify an exact duration for each stage. Moreover, each stage is not passed through and then left behind. Instead, each stage contributes to the formation of the total personality. Each of these stages is characterised by its own type of crisis, or conflict. Erikson saw these crises as being eight great tests of your character.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Trust Vs Mistrust</h4>
                        <p>Erikson called the first developmental stage the "sensory stage", which corresponds to Freud's oral stage. To Erikson, the crisis at the sensory stage is that of learning basic trust or mistrust of other people. At this point in life, the infant is totally dependent on others for its needs. If his mother (or someone else) meets these needs, the infant learns to depend on others in later life. If for any reason, the mother is inconsistent in satisfying the infant's needs, the infant may carry suspicion and doubt through the rest of its years.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Autonomy vs Shame, Doubt</h4>
                        <p>The second of Erikson's stage, similar to the anal stage, is that of muscular development. During toilet training the child learns to control its own muscles and begins to assert its individuality. The crisis here is that of autonomy, or the ability to control one's own bodily functions. The child either learns autonomy, or if it is unsuccessful, develops shame and doubt about its own abilities.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Initiative vs Guilt</h4>
                        <p>The third stage, that of locomotors control, is similar to Freud's phallic stage. Now the child attempts to develop its own way of asserting its needs and gaining its rewards. Urged by its instincts to possess its opposite-sex parent (at least in fantasy) and to rival its same-sex parent, the child faces the crisis of inner desires versus society's demands. Erikson believed that if the child could channel its sexual needs into socially acceptable behaviours, the child acquired initiative. If not, the child might build up a strong sense of guilt that would haunt it the rest of its days.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Industry vs Inferiority</h4>
                        <p>Both Freud and Erikson called the fourth developmental stage that of latency. During these (typically) school years, the crisis the child faces is that of competence or failure. If the child does well in school, he learns that he can succeed and thus becomes industrious. If he does poorly, it gains a sense of inferiority.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Identity vs Indentity Confusion</h4>
                        <p>At puberty, Freud thought sexual interest returns and the individual must make the final adjustment, that of heterosexuality. Erikson saw the puberty crisis as that of either finding your identity, or of developing what he called role confusion. You must decide what the future will hold and who you will become. Although the social roles available may vary from one society to another, you must decide which of these roles to adopt. By discovering who and what you want to be, you are able to plan your life as a working, functioning adult.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Intimacy vs Isolation</h4>
                        <p>Erikson postulated three final stages of maturation beyond the five that Freud spoke of. The first of these stages, which occurs in young adulthood, presents you with the crisis of intimacy versus isolation. If you have "found" yourself by now, you can then go on to the delightful task of "finding" someone else to share life's intimacies with. If you fail to resolve your identity crisis, however, you will remain isolated from the closest forms of psychological "sharing" with others.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Generativity vs Stagnation</h4>
                        <p>Societies often pass through a period of rapid development, then settle into complacency when growth stops and stagnation sets in. Erikson believed that adults often experience the same "growth" crisis during their middle years. Human beings need more than intimacy. We must be productive and helpful to our fellow humans, and we must make a contribution to society. The crisis decision here then is, that between what Erikson called generativity and stagnation.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Integrity vs Despair</h4>
                        <p>Erikson's final stage is that of maturity. If you live long enough, you have to face squarely the fact that you are mortal, and that some day you will die. By resolving your prior crises, you gain the strength to integrate even death into the pattern of your existence, You come to terms with yourself, content with the knowledge that you have done the best that you could under the circumstances. Knowing that your life has been successful, you can die as you lived, with integrity. But, if you fail to solve the earlier crises, you may see your life as having been useless, incomplete, and wasted. And thus, you may succumb to feelings of despair at the futility of existence.</p>
                        <p>Summary of these eight stages is given in Table 12.2.</p>

                        <p>Adolescence is a period (ranging from 11-19 years), during which a growing person makes a transition from childhood to adulthood. The biological, psychological, cognitive, emotional and social changes taking place in the years around puberty are greater than at any other age since the second year of life. Adolescence period has its importance in preparing a young individual to meet challenges of social and economic world. In the recent years, there have been tremendous changes in our Indian social environment and economic conditions, which has influenced the psychological development of an adolescent. Emotional and psychological development of an adolescent needs understanding and careful handling by adults as this period is the most sensitive period in an individual's life.</p>
                        <p>The late adolescent period is marked by selecting a career. Career development consists of four broad phases:</p>
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li><strong>Exploration phase</strong> Possibilities are made an initial search for career.</li>
                            <li><strong>Establishment phase</strong> The individual finds a job, enters a career, develops competence and gains status.</li>
                            <li><strong>Mid career phase</strong> is a time of high productivity and acceptance by co-workers.</li>
                            <li><strong>Later career phase</strong> The individual serves as a respected expert and a guide/role model for young workers.</li>

                        <h3>Emotions Experienced during Adolescence</h3>
                        <p>To understand the adolescent, it is important to know what he does and thinks but it is even more important to know what he feels. During adolescence, emotion is involved in everything in which the adolescent is involved. Different emotions are expressed by an adolescent when his desires are fulfilled, or when he is blocked or thwarted, in his efforts, or when he is harmed or threatened with harm.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Adolescent Love</h4>
                        <p>To achieve the tasks of loving, an adolescent needs to achieve emotional independence of parents. The need to love and to be loved is supremely important in their lives. Examples of love are also seen in devotion towards group by delinquents and impulse for doing idealistic things. With adolescence, one is faced with new demands, new situations, in which the task of love and sex must be faced. The capacity or ability to love serves function to fulfill and broaden the potential for enjoying one's life. A person who is unable to love, for psychological or social reasons starts comparing himself with other peers and feels depressed.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Sexuality</h4>
                        <p>Adolescents engage in range of sexual behaviours. Experimentation with sex is becoming very common with adolescents due to the effect of media. At times, these involvements lead to unwanted teenage pregnancies, abortions and guilt feelings. If these guilt feelings are not handled appropriately, it can lead to negative repercussions for future sexual relationship. Some adolescents engage in homosexual activities, both as active and passive partners.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Anger</h4>
                        <p>Adolescent's temper flares often and easily because he is overly sensitive, he tends to feel abused, and his self-esteem and confidence are shaky partly due to the occurrence of physical and hormonal changes.</p>
                        <p>It is through his anger that an adolescent most sharply asserts his demands and interests. The basic conditions that arouse anger remain much the same throughout life, but there are changes with age in the particular circumstances that provoke it. When we try to understand anger in the adolescent, it is easier to identify what it is that makes him angry than to tell why it makes him angry.</p>
                        <p>During adolescence, persons rather than things most often provoke anger. There are many unavoidable frictions in the give and take of everyday life. Many adolescents are annoyed, not only by specific parental practices but also by parental traits and habits. It is often observed that anger is frequently aroused by unjust criticism by parents, being treated like a child at home, clashes of opinion with parents, and troubles with brothers and sisters.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Anxiety</h4>
                        <p>Many adolescents may experience a vague feeling of uneasiness, a feeling of being on edge, other feelings such as fear, anger, restlessness, irritability, or depression. The underlying conflict springs from a clash between incompatible impulses, desires, or values. Such a conflict prevails when a person is angry but is afraid of giving offense. Likewise, it exists when a person is eager to be popular but has strong scruples against doing what is necessary to become popular.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Anxiety-producing Stresses in Adolescence</h4>
                        <p>Everything that an adolescent for the first time recognises about himself, every venture that he accepts or declines, every decision he makes, may threaten earlier ideas, perceptions, and attitudes he has acquired regarding himself.</p>
                        <p>The course of physical growth itself has many emotional repercussions in adolescence, such as the stresses connected with early or late maturing, adolescent obesity, concern about development of the genitals and secondary sex characteristics. In the sphere of sex, he has urges and faces temptations, choices, and hasards, which are more critical than his earlier experiences with sex. In his interpersonal relations, he faces problems of independence-dependence, conformity-nonconformity, and self-assertion-self-negation.</p>
                        <p><strong>Anxiety and self-determination:</strong> Planning for career is the preoccupation of this period. Some adolescents work very hard to achieve their goals. But some, with high achievement drive face anxiety either in achieving their targets, which might have been set very high or due to hurdles and delay coming in the way of success. Currently, many adolescents have the urge to earn lots of money in no time; when they find that it is not an easy task, they feel frustrated and depressed.</p>
                        <p><strong>Anxiety-producing stresses in adolescence:</strong> The need for intimacy normally first appears in preadolescence. Intimacy means emotional closeness and it involves mutuality. It may become anxiety provoking for an adolescent, if due to a slower rate of development, he has no need for intimacy when most of the other persons of his age have this need.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Relationship with parents and siblings</h4>
                        <p>There is a general agreement that adolescence is a challenging and sometimes trying time for both the young and the parents. The rapid rate of social change, which we are currently undergoing means that the adolescents and the parents have grown up in markedly in different worlds. When the developmental experiences that shape our personalities and social changes that must be confronted are very different, a generational gap may be expected. The adolescents develop different cultural values and outlooks. Differences in their knowledge tend to magnify the conflict between parents and adolescents.</p>
                        <p>Parental support and guidance, in addition to meeting the basic needs of developing young people for nurturance, are especially crucial in the face of stressful nature of adolescent transition. The parent-child relationship affects the relative ease with which the young person adjusts to the changed role a new demands of adolescence.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Relationship with Peers</h4>
                        <p>Peer group provides the adolescent with the arena for much of the learning and developing that occurs in all the life tasks. Peers play crucial role in the psychological and social development of most adolescents, especially in age segregated, technological societies like our own, where entrance into adult world of work and family responsibility is increasingly delayed. The peer group provides opportunities to learn how to interact with others, to control social behaviour, to develop age relevant scales and interest and to share similar problems and feelings. Role played by peers in adolescence is especially critical. Relationship between both same and opposite sex peers during the adolescent years come closer to serving as prototype for later adult relationship-in social relations, in work and in interaction with members of opposite sex. The young man or woman who has not learned how to get along with other of the same sex and to establish satisfactory heterosexual relationship, by the time he or she reaches adulthood is likely to face serious obstacle in the years ahead.</p>
                        <p>Adolescents are also dependent on peer relationships, simply because ties to parents become progressively looser, as the adolescent gains greater independence. In addition, relation with family members are likely to become charged with conflicting emotions in the early years of adolescents-dependent yearnings, exist along side independent striving, hostility is mixed with love and conflict occur over cultural values and social behaviour. Consequently, many areas of adolescent's inner life and outward behaviour become difficult to share with parents.</p>
                        <p>During this vulnerable stage of development relationship with peers may also be harmful. Adolescents may be pressurised by a group of their peers into suspending their own better judgement and engaging in behaviour they may later regret. These may range from relatively minor improprieties to more serious, sometimes tragic incidence.</p>
                        <p>Finally, the role of the peer group in helping an individual to define his or her own identity becomes particularly important, during adolescence because at no other stage of development is one's sense of identity so fluid.</p>
                        <p><strong>Social isolation and alienation:</strong> The prevalence of reported loneliness, shyness and social anxiety among adolescents appears to be rather high. Research investigating correlates of adolescent loneliness and social isolation, has focussed on several factors that seem to contribute to these interaction difficulties. Occasional feeling of loneliness, isolation, and awkwardness are probably normal. Among more seriously adolescents, the investigations have identified deficits in certain social skills, social participation and cognitive behavioural characteristics and social outlook problems.</p>
                        <p>There are powerful forces in the culture that lead adolescents to disguise or repress their emotions. The most common example is repression of sexual feelings in traditional and conservative families.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Ego and Identity</h3>
                        <p>The adolescent "search for identity" leads to increased conflict with parents. Increased identification with peer groups is commonly seen during this period.</p>
                        <p>An essential problem of adolescence is that of finding a workable answer to the question, "Who am I?" As you have seen, that Erikson has pointed out a strong sense of ego identity in the adolescent, so he sees himself or herself as a separate, distinctive individual. Indeed, the very word individual, as a synonym for person, implies a universal need to perceive oneself as somehow separate from others, no matter how much one may share motives, values, and interests with others.</p>
                        <p>The individual needs to have a sense of psychosocial reciprocity-a consistency "between that which he conceives himself to be and that which he perceives others to see in him and expect of him". Erikson's assertion that one's sense of identity is tied, at least partly, to social reality is important, it emphasises the fact that societal or individual rejection can seriously impair an adolescent's chances of establishing a strong, secure sense of personal identity. Any developmental influences that contribute to confident perceptions of oneself as separate and distinct from others, consistent and integrated, having a continuity over time, and similar to the way one is perceived by others, contributes to overall sense of ego identity. By the same token, influences that may impair any of these selfperceptions, fosters what Erikson calls "identity confusion".</p>
                        <p>Due to difficult transition from childhood to adulthood, and of sensitivity to social and historical changes, the adolescent during the stage of identity formation is likely to suffer more deeply that ever before or even again from a confusion of roles, or identity confusion. This stage can cause one to feel isolated, empty, anxious, and indecisive. Adolescents may feel that society is pushing them to take decisions, thus they become even more resistant. They are deeply concerned with how others view them, and are apt to display a lot of self-consciousness and embarrassment.</p>
                        <p>Adolescent might feel he is regressing rather than progressing. The term identity crisis refers to the necessity to resolve the transitory failure to form a stable identity, or a confusion of roles. Each successive stage in fact, "is a potential crisis because of radical change in perspective" (Erikson, 1968).</p>
                        <p>Negative identity is a sense of possessing a set of potentially bad or unworthy characteristics. The most common way of dealing with one's negative identity is to project the bad characteristics onto others. It can lead to a lot of social pathology, including prejudice and crime, but it is also an important part of the adolescent's readiness for ideological involvement.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Personality and Social Development</h3>
                        <p>Change in self, or sense of self, is an important issue in adolescence. The sudden changes in their bodies bewilder young people and make them question who they have been and who they are becoming. "Am I the same person I used to be?" they wonder. "What will be like from now on?" As teenagers continue to question and puzzle over their greatest preoccupation, their life's work, they are in danger of becoming confused. This confusion can show itself by the individual's taking an excessively long time to settle on a career.</p>
                        <p>Inconsistency and impulsiveness in behaviour interferes temporarily in achieving unique personality. In some manner, the distinctive characteristic that differentiates one individual from others in the psychological and behavioural realms must be consistent over time so that the individual can psychologically and be "himself" to himself and others. During adolescence, with peer group identity one sees changes in value system, beliefs, attitudes and behaviour, which are an integral part of personality. Stability in family relationship and role modelling is equally important in the formation of personality at this stage.</p>

                        <p>Understanding of normal child development helps in identification, management of mental subnormality and specific developmental delays. As a part of normal growth and development, children commonly undergo the psychological problems. Problems like specific fears sleep disturbances, regression, sibling rivalry and rebellion. However, if these normal problems worsen or last for long periods, it may be a signal for more serious disturbances. The serious disturbances are in the form of toilet training (enuresis and encopresis), feeding disturbances (overeating, anorexia nervosa and pica), speech disturbances (delayed speech and stuttering), learning disabilities, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and autism.</p>
                        <p>Adolescent period is a very sensitive period hence maintaining positive mental health is very important. Many adjustment problems of minor nature and psychiatric problems of major/ severe nature develop during this period. Psychiatric problems and substance abuse have been dealt in detail in other chapters of this book. Adjustment problems mainly occur due to lots of factors like unresolved conflicts, misunderstanding with parents, impulsiveness, anger outburst, aggressive behaviour and increased interest in sexuality. There has been an increase in awareness of adolescent problems so some adolescents seek psychological help, but still a large number of adolescents experience anxiety of growing within themselves.</p>
                        <p>Many adjustment problems occur due to lack of information on sex. As masturbation is a common experience for adolescent boys, but there are many misconception associated with that, dating behaviour is increasing in present generation adolescents, which is not acceptable to many of the parents, especially in case of girls. So conflict and interpersonal problems arise. For girls, the problems begin with demand for autonomy. For girls conflicts are generally related to type of dresses, they want to wear, visit to beauty parlors and attending late night parties. Environment has a key role in increasing mental health problems. To some extent, media is responsible for their increase. Violence, aggressiveness and sexual liberties shown on TV. Screens, movies and songs instigate adolescents to behave in similar ways. The changing values of our society are different. Pressures and challenges to the adolescents like show-off of wealth, smoking, drinking, driving recklessly, late night parties and free mixing of both sexes in some sections of societies becomes a reason of conflict for others due to peer group pressures.</p>
                        <p>During the last few years, adolescent medicine has started to deal with a number of social problems experienced by youths such as tobacco, alcohol and drug abuse. Inadequate resilience to stress and adversity, and sexually transmitted diseases. Indeed, alcohol is the most widely used psychoactive drug among adolescents (32) and initiation of the use of tobacco (at the age of >11 ) has increased rapidly, especially in girls. Almost half of adolescents have used an illicit drug before they finish high school, and 25 percent have consumed an illegal drug other than marijuana (30). Moreover, approximately half of fatal motor vehicle accidents and homicides, as well as substantial proportion of suicides among adolescents, are associated with the use of alcohol and other drugs (33). The high incidence of adolescents affected with sexually transmitted diseases also has been pointed out.</p>
                        <p>A fairly common medical subject such as adequate nutrition for proper growth and pubertal development has become an obsessive problem for many teenagers, whose greater awareness of their physical appearance causes dissatisfaction with their body weight and physical image. Excessive dieting and inappropriate weight loss in girls usually interfere with normal growth and menstrual cycles. Most of these adolescents are not excessively overweight. Many, are most concerned over the localisation of subcutaneous fat on their hips, thighs, waist and buttocks. Most young girls, with these concerns diet without medical supervision. They begin by skipping breakfast or lunch, and prolong fasting. They often take diuretics, laxatives and appetite suppressants and end up with unexpected secondary health problems. Inappropriate preoccupation over weight and poor diets may be predisposing factors to more serious eating disorders, such as anorexia nervosa and bulimia, with all the psychological, gynaecologic and metabolic sequelae associated with these conditions.</p>
                        <p>Medical doctors also have to deal with another fairly common eating disorder, i.e. some forms of obesity. Excessive overweight in pubertal boys and girls, not only causes important psychological problems, which affect social, educational and sport activities, but also is a predisposing factor for hypertension and elevated cholesterol with a greater risk of cardiovascular diseases later in adulthood. Excessive food intake, sedentary lifestyles, excessive television viewing habits, and poor physical activities are among the main causes of obesity in childhood and adolescence.</p>
                        <p>The relationship between overweight during adolescence and subsequent educational achievement, marital status, household income, and self-esteem on 370 obese patients aged 16 to 24 years, was studied by Gortmaker et al. These authors concluded in a seven year follow-up that this condition had important negative social and economic consequences, which were more adverse than those of many individuals with other chronic diseases. Practically all adolescents are over sensitive about body image, and fat teenagers are especially vulnerable to social discrimination. Medical doctors must see and talk to these adolescents without the presence of their parents, carrying out a private dialogue, even at ages of 10 or lower. Youngsters on their own usually become more friendly, open, receptive and cooperative than in the presence of their parents. Adequate counselling and properly balanced dieting, not fancy commercial diets, should be prescribed with a periodic weight check. No drugs for weight reduction should be administered. These patients should be counselled that while they are modifying their body to reach their final physical shape late in puberty, they are developing their personality; their self-assurance, and their self-control. Their efforts therefore, are not only directed to modifying their physical aspects but also to building up their personality.</p>
                        <p>Adolescent growth proceeds at an astonishing pace, the most rapid of any postnatal time (average weight increment during the adolescent growth spurt is 16 g/day for females and 19 g/day for males). It is also during adolescence and young adulthood that the skeletal mineral accretion is completed, the peak bone mass being critical for skeletal maintenance and prevention of osteoporosis. Lesions of arteriosclerosis also begin to accelerate at this age and peak incidence of anorexia and bulimia nervosa is in adolescence. Moreover, overweight and obese conditions occurring at this age show persistent health effects decades later. Furthermore, food habits which develop as the adolescent enjoys increasing independence and responsibility for his or her own dietary intake are believed to persist into adulthood, making this a critical time for preventive health interventions.</p>

                        <p>The human infant has a number of adaptive reflexes, including the grasping and sucking reflexes. Early social development lays a foundation for later relationships with other people. Development occurs along multiple lines, it is overall physical development, cognitive, personality, social and neurological development. The motor development is mainly in the first few years of life. Cognitive development according to Piaget, occurs in four stages, sensory motor stage, preoperational stage, concrete operational stage, and stage of formal operations.</p>
                        <p>According to Freud, the personality development passes through various stages of psychosexual development. These stages are oral stage, anal stage, phallic stage and latency period. Erikson has proposed a psychosocial theory of personality development, which consists of eight stages. The first four stages occur during infancy and childhood, the fifth during adolescence and the last three stages during the adult years including old age.</p>
                        <p>Adolescents are a transition period in one's life from childhood to adulthood. Psychological and emotional development reaches its peak during this period. The changes occurring in an individual are varied and rapid which if not handled carefully can disturb the mental health of an individual.</p>
                        <p>Constitutional delay of the onset of puberty is a fairly common reason for adolescents ( 14 and 16 years of age) and for their parents to seek a clinical consultation. While the age of puberty onset varies, the delayed initiation of pubertal changes and of the growth spurt frequently worries a large number of adolescents, especially boys, because of the social dimension of perceived delays. Some who perceive that their development is abnormal, start having problems in school, stop participating in sports, are no longer willing to participate in social events, etc.</p>
                        <p>Most girls with delayed puberty accept the explanation offered, especially when one can give approximate dates when these processes will start taking place. Conversely, boys are more difficult to manage, because most of them are quite upset over their sexual infantilism and short stature. Boys usually seek clinical help because their growth velocity has not increased significantly, at a time when their peers are growing faster than they. Boys often show a considerable difference in height from one year to the next. Frequently, they do not mention their main concern, i.e. that they are shorter than their school friends and are often ridiculed by peers. Such patients should be assured that the present situation is transient. They should be provided with an approximate date for the onset of their growth spurt based on testicular volument and their bone age and an estimate of final adult height. Some boys with delayed puberty are also quite concerned over their sexual infantilism. This concern often leads them to abandon sports activities because they do not want to undress with their more sexually mature peers. Some respond by making efforts to obtain better physical development. They perform strenuous exercises at the gymnasium, two to three hours daily, using heavy weights to stimulate muscle development. Physicians should advise them that such efforts will have very limited results due to a transient lack of sufficient testosterone to stimulate muscle mass growth. A useful metaphor is to compare their efforts to a man who wishes to move a car by pushing it, without the car having gasoline; he will be able to move the car, but slowly; igniting the engine would be better but this is impossible without gasoline; in sense, testosterone is the gasoline needed by the muscle for it to develop when stimulated by exercise.</p>
