                        <p>Memory is the storage of learned behavioural potentials over time. It brings a persistent change in the central nervous system brought about by environmental input and by the activities of the organism. Memory process can be divided into stages for the purpose of understanding (Fig. 4.1). Memory starts with the sensory input or stimulus from the environment. The input is through sensory channels, like vision, hearing or touch and is held briefly (seconds) in a sensory register. Information is passed through sensory register to short-term memory (STM) store where it is held for 20-30 seconds. Some part of the information from STM is further processed in rehearsal buffer that is information is repeated, and in some way linked with other information already stored in memory. From the rehearsal buffer processed information is passed on to longterm memory store (LTM) where it is organised in categories and stored for years. Information not so processed is forgotten. This process can be compared with your day-to-day experiences. To learn new technical words, or names, you have to rehearse several times.</p>

                        <p>Memory is viewed by cognitive theorist as an attempt to isolate some of the processes that act between the input of the stimulus and the response output. Memory is divided into three stages, encoding, storage, and retrieval. Encoding means transforming the sensory input into a form that can be processed by the memory system. The encoded information is transferred to storage. Retrieval involves locating memorised information when needed. Figure 4.2 summarises this model.</p>

                        <p>This could be compared with your experience of attending a particular class. You hear lecture and make notes that is you encode the lecture, then the notes are stored in some file using date or topic name. When later this information is required you retrieve by searching that particular file by it's topic name. Thus any memory system must perform three functions-</p>
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li>Input-allow information to be fed into the system</li>
                            <li>Storage-to maintain information</li>
                            <li>Retrieval-to access information when required.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>There is another way of looking at the way the memory works. Craik and Lockhart (1972) disagree with the concept of memory as a division into three completely separate memory structures-sensory, short-term, and long-term memory. They identify only one kind of memory and maintain that the ability to remember is dependent on how deeply we process information. We process material along a continuum of ever-increasing depth, running it through on levels that range from quite shallow to very deep. The deeper we process it, the longer it lasts.</p>
                        <p>This concept of memory sees it as more of an active than a reactive process with memory performance a direct result of the learner's mental activity. The shallowest level of processing, according to this model, involves your awareness of a sensory feature-what a word or number looks like or sounds like, what a food smells or tastes like, and so forth. As you recognise some kind of pattern in your sensory impression, you will process it more deeply. And when you make an association, that is give a meaning, to your impression, you will be at the deepest level of processing of all, the kind that will form the strongest and most enduring memory trace (Fig. 4.3).</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Recall of information is most often required in daily activities and especially in educational performances. We also recognise the material, or persons or places by acknowledging it.</p>
                        <p>Familiar material can be learned more rapidly than the unfamiliar material. There are at least three distinct ways of classifying memory. These are based on (1) neurological structure of the brain, (2) experimental model of psychology and (3) clinical practices of mental examination. On the basis of neurological, theory, memory is divided into verbal and non-verbal. On the basis of experimental model, memory is divided into sensory memory, short-term memory and longterm memory. On the basis of clinical practice, memory can be divided into remote, recent and immediate. Their levels of processing also differentiate short-term and long-term memory. Some detail of these memories is as follows:</p>

                        <h3>Sensory Memory</h3>
                        <p>Sensory memory is the first stop of an incoming stimulus. All sensory modalities (visual and auditory, tactile, olfactory and kinesthetic) are involved in receiving these first impressions. These impressions are either lost with time or processed further for later remembering. The duration of sensory memory is very short and it varies in time for different sensory modalities. Iconic memory or visual sensory memory may last from 250 msec to 500 msec , echoic or auditory sensory memory from 2 to 10 sec tactual memory about 4 sec and motor memory (kinesthetic) as long as 80 sec .</p>

                        <h3>Short-term Memory</h3>
                        <p>You have just seen that information from sensory register is passed on to short-term memory (STM). This is also known as primary memory and can be called as immediate memory. While you have no voluntary control over what happens to information in sensory storage, you can control what is stored in STM by rehearsal. Information is held; in STM store upto about 30 seconds, but the length can vary depending upon many factors. Short-term memory has very limited storage capacity; six to seven items can be stored at one time. With new stimulus input, the original items get erased or fade away. The storage capacity ran be increased by chunking, i.e. combining several items. Unfamiliar items fade out faster than familiar items. Items can be recalled at will while the information is in shortterm store.</p>
                        <p>Coding for short-term memory involves speech sounds, visual images and words. Generally visual stimuli is translated into sounds, for example, if a card of unfamiliar letters is flashed for half a second after 15 seconds and you are asked to repeat it, chances are that you would reproduce the sound resembling that letter.</p>
                        <p>Some experiments have also demonstrated that the material presented in the beginning of the next and at the end are recalled relatively well than those appearing in the middle. This is called serial position effect. When recall is better in the beginning of the text then it is known as primacy effect while if the recall is better for the last part of the text then it is called recency effect.</p>

                        <h3>Working Memory</h3>
                        <p>Working memory is at times used as an alternative term to STM. The concept of working memory is similar to STM with the only difference on its processing as well as its. storage functions. Working memory occurs between the short time of sensory memory and the long-term memory. A number of characteristics distinguished this memory processing phase.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Working memory has very limited capacity.</li>
                            <li>Retains material for a very short duration of time, for 18 to 20 seconds unless one tries to hold consciously.</li>
                            <li>Material is consciously processed and retention last as long as it is held in attention. This system is called working memory because the material transferred either in sensory memory or long-term memory has to be worked on, thought about and mentally organised. Working memory provides a mental working space to help in sorting and processing new information (Shiffrin, 1993). You can understand process of working memory by recalling that you tend to remember the telephone numbers till you have to dial it, after using the number it is discarded and it is no longer in the memory.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h3>Rehearsal</h3>
                        <p>Rehearsal means repeating items of information, silently or aloud and it helps to keep these items of information in the centre of attention. Experiments have shown that rehearsal could be maintenance rehearsal where in information is just repeated as it is. This is not very helpful in remembering for a longer duration. Elaborative rehearsal organises the material and gives meaning while rehearsing. This is an active process of transferring material from short-term memory to long-term memory. The amount of rehearsal given to items is important in the transfer of information from short-term to longterm memory, the more an item is rehearsed, and the more likely it is to become part of longterm memory. In elaborative rehearsal, people use strategies that give meaning and organisation to the material so that it can be fitted in with existing organised long-term memories.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Long-term Memory</h3>
                        <p>Long-term memory also known as secondary memory seems to be very complex as it stores many different aspects of our experiences. The storage capacity has no known limits and one can remember information for days, months, and years. It records the salient features of sensory inputs and files these according to various memory categories. It also creates an auditory representation of the input and it also records how to reproduce the information when required.</p>
                        <p>Long-term memory is of two types—procedural and declarative. Each one holds different kind of information. Procedural memory stores memory for how things are done. It is used to acquire retain and use perceptual cognitive and motor skills. Procedural memory is related to action sequence, you recall skill memories like swimming, driving, giving an injection. The interesting characteristic of this memory is that you remember the initial phase of learning. Once you have acquired the skill, you may perform without consciously thinking about the task. Declarative memory is for remembering explicit information. It is also known as 'fact memory'. Declarative memory contains two different categories of information.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Semantic Memory</h4>
                        <p>Conains meaning of words and concepts, rules of using these in language. Semantic memory is not easily forgotten, as the information is stored in highly organised way in logical hierarchies, from general to specific ones. Such organisation makes it possible for us to make logical inferences from the information stored in semantic memory.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Episodic Memory</h4>
                        <p>Contains personal experiences of long-term memories. It is a record of what has happened to us, or remembrances of past things. Episodic memory seems to be organised with respect to certain events that happened in our lives. The episodes do not have to have a logical organisation. It is less organised, episodic memory seems more susceptible to being forgotten than semantic memory.</p>
                        <p>Long-term memory is highly organised. Information is categorised in number of ways. One of the evidence of organisation is seen in 'tip of the tongue phenomenon'. You all would have experienced while trying to retrieve a person's name you cannot quite remember it but the name is at your tongue. If we look at this tip-of-the-tongue (TOT) phenomenon in greater detail, we find evidence for the organisation of long-term memory. The search through the memory store in the TOT state is not random. If the name we are looking for is Shalu, we may come up with Shalini or Shobha, but not Meena. If you try to experiment within this phenomenon, you would observe that when the subjects are in the TOT state, on hearing the definition but not able to hit the "target" word, they would tend to retrieve words from their long-term memories that (1) sounded like the target word, (2) started with the same letter as the target word, (3) contain the same number of syllables as the target word, and/or (4) have a meaning similar to that of the target word. The TOT phenomenon indicates that information is organised in long-term memory. Types of memory are summarised in Figure 4.4.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Forgetting is failure to retrieve information from long-term memory store. Much of the information is lost but enough remains, so that we have sketchy record of our lives. Sometimes what we think is forgotten in real sense is not forgotten because it was never encoded and stored in the first place. Many students complain that they do not remember the contents after attending the class or forget after reading the text. This happens due to lack of attention. Some information does not reach short-term memory from the sensory register or due to inadequate encoding and rehearsal; the information may not have been transferred from short-term to long-term memory. Information was not stored in long term memory because rehearsal was not sufficiently elaborate.</p>
                        <p>Many times we forget, as memory does not match events, which had occurred. This happens due to the constructive processes, i.e. during encoding, the to-be-remembered information, especially if it is a complex life event or something you have read, is modified. Certain details are accentuated, the material may be simplified, or it may be changed in many other ways so that what is encoded and stored is far from a literal copy of the input. Constructive processes of encoding distort what is stored in the memory and distortions are remembered. We remember the gist, or meaning of what we have read or heard but not the actual words themselves; inferences constructed at the time the information was encoded for storage is remembered, or portions of the to-be-remembered informations is encoded. Besides the faulty memory processes, some of the other common factors of forgetting are as following.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Interference</h3>
                        <p>According to this explanation, what we do in the interval between learning and recall, determines the course of forgetting. Experimental studies have shown that learning new things interferes with memory of what is learned earlier and prior learning interferes with memory of things learned later.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Retroactive inhibition</h4>
                        <p>This is a technical name for new learning that may interfere with material previously learned. This has been demonstrated in experiments as following.</p>

                        <p>As an example you may learn one chapter of physiology in activity I, then learn one topic of Anatomy in activity II, then try to recall what you had learned in physiology. The amount of information you forget would be due to interference caused by learning anatomy. Compared to this, if you learn a topic from Physiology, rest for sometime, then recall physiology you would find that your recall is better than that of the previous chapter.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Proactive inhibition</h4>
                        <p>When prior learning interferes with the learning and recall of new material, it is called proactive inhibition. To demonstrate this type of interference experiment is designed as following.</p>

                        <p>Supposing you learn English, then learn French and recall French, you would find that study of English interferes with your recall of French. Here what you have learned earlier, interferes with the subsequent memory.</p>
                        <p>Even though lots of experiments have been conducted, yet the process of interference is not very clear. One idea is that the interferences disrupts the various kinds of associations between stimuli and responses formed during learning. Another idea is that interference has its greatest effect on the memory of retrieval cues. You have seen in the earlier section that memory depends on retrieval cues, so if interference results in problems with these cues, forgetting will result.</p>
                        <p>In both types of interference it has been found that the effect of interference is less with meaningful material and after attaining some mastery in the subject. In initial period of your course you should try to allot different study times to similar subjects.</p>

                        <h3>Encoding, Organisation and Retrieval Problems</h3>
                        <p>If the stored information is not encoded well or organized at the time it was learned, it is forgotten. Retrieval cues are also important in memory, as we may not be able to recall some information in one situation but may spontaneously remember in the other situation. Retrieval is facilitated by organisation of the stored material and the presence of retrieval cues that can guide our search through long-term memory for stored informations. In the absence of proper retrieval cues, the sought for items stored in long-term memory are not found. Many times you would have experienced that you cannot recall something while actively searching for it, but after giving up that search while doing something else, you recall that object. The new activity in which you engaged, or the new context gives another set of reminders, which helps to retrieve that information. It is a good idea to give up and do something else in order to generate new retrieval cues.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Motivated Forgetting</h3>
                        <p>Emotional factors also play an important role in forgetting. If we encode information while in one emotional state and try to recall it while in another, recall suffers. Many lapses of memory in daily life illustrate motivated forgetting. We may forget the names of people we do not like. Repression theory holds that we forget because the retrieval of memories would be painful or unacceptable in some way to the person. Freud, in his book "The Psychopathology of Everyday Life" had illustrated many examples of repression in forgetting. Repression includes retrieval failure for the association of the threatening, anxiety-provoking information.</p>
                        <p>Anxiety or guilt producing material is more often forgotten than pleasant experiences. Supposing in a particular class you were scolded by the teacher, chances of forgetting what happened in that class would be higher. Psychologist have also found that some persons cannot forget unpleasant experiences easily, they have related this phenomenon with personality. Some stored information is so threatening and anxiety arousing that it's retrieval is possible only under special circumstances like hypnosis, free associations.</p>

                        <h3>Zeigarnik Effect</h3>
                        <p>A Russian psychologist demonstrated through experiments that incomplete tasks are remembered better than the completed tasks. This is sometimes called "Zeigarnik effect", "Egooriented" persons remember more of completed tasks as incomplete tasks generate more anxiety. On the other hand task-oriented persons remember more of incomplete tasks, as for them the incomplete task is more painful while completed tasks are not so.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Amnesia-Forgetting during Sickness</h3>
                        <p>Amnesia refers to loss of memory due to disease. Amnesia is a general "disorder of memory". The person may forget his past experiences or may have impaired ability to encode, store and to retrieve, thus forming of new memory is difficult. Amnesia is a profound memory deficit due to either the loss of what has been stored or to the inability to form new memories. Amnesias are classified under two categories: (i) biological and (ii) psychological.</p>
                        <p><strong>Biological amnesias:</strong> Forgetting could be due to any of following reasons-diseases of the brain like senile dementia, Korsakoff syndrome, concession from blows on head, brain damage, brain infections, tumour, stroke, temporary disturbances in the blood supply or effect of high dose of alcohol and drug abuse.</p>
                        <p><strong>Senile dementia:</strong> It is characterised by deficits in many intellectual abilities like memory, attention, judgement, and abstract thought, that could occur in aged people. The person has trouble remembering events that happened after the onset of the disease. Thus the person with this disorder has trouble learning and cannot recall well what happened last month, yesterday, or even a few hours ago. Senile dementia is usually the result of a reduction in blood flow to the brain.</p>
                        <p><strong>Transient global amnesia:</strong> These are profound memory problem with no loss of consciousness. It comes on suddenly without any obvious cause, and it typically lasts for only a few hours or days before memory becomes normal again. Fortunately, most people who experience such amnesia have it only once. This type of amnesia is called global because much of what has already been stored in memory is forgotten and because even though the person is conscious and can go about the routine business of daily life, no new memories are formed while the attack is in progress.</p>
                        <p><strong>Alcohol and drug abuse:</strong> These also cause amnesia, a person may have amnesia for the events occurring while under the influence of alcohol because encoding and storage processes have been disrupted by the effects of the alcohol on the brain. Heavy drinking over a period of years however, can result through vitamin-B deficits and other chemical imbalances, in irreversible brain damage and a pattern of symptoms known as the Korsakoff syndrome. Interograde amnesia the inability to form new memories is one of the prominent symptoms of this syndrome.</p>
                        <p><strong>Psychological amnesia:</strong> These types of amnesias occur due to psychiatric diseases where the person forgets his identity also. There may not be a permanent loss.</p>
                        <p><strong>Childhood amnesia:</strong> is due to the differences in the ways young children and older people encode and store information. As adults, much of our memory is encoded verbally and tied into networks, or schemata, that are based on language. But the young child without language encodes memories in a nonverbal form, perhaps storing information as images or feelings. Early childhood memories are thus said to be stored in forms no longer available to us as adults. Our language-dominated memories, do not have retrieval cues appropriate for gaining access to the image and feeling memories of early childhood. Perhaps the memory machine is just not able to store long-term memories until its maturation is essentially finished. Language ability and memory develop together because both depend on brain maturation. You all experience that dreams are forgotten on waking up. Dream amnesia may actually have a biological basis. The dreaming brain seems to be in a special state different from that of the waking brain.</p>
                        <p><strong>Defensive amnesia:</strong> People with defensive amnesia may forget their names, where they have come from, who their spouses are, and many other important details of their past lives.</p>
                        <p>It is called defensive because this type of amnesia is usually considered to be a way of protecting oneself from the guilt or anxiety that can result from intense, intolerable life situations and conflicts. Defensive amnesia is thus an extreme form of repression.</p>
                        <p><strong>Normal aging:</strong> has its problems too, but the typical forgetfulness of old age is hardly severe enough to be called amnesia. In normal aging, the memory problem, centres largely on the storage of relatively recent events; it is anterograde in nature. But, in marked contrast to senile dementia patients, normal old people are able to compensate for their mild memory problems. They try to do less and thus put a smaller burden on their information-processing systems, they provide themselves with reminder cues, perhaps by writing down what is to be remembered, and they organise their lives into routines so that fewer new things need to be remembered. In other words, normal old people adopt adaptive memory strategies.</p>

                        <span class="heading-text">Methods to Improve Memory</span>
                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>With training, practice and motivation memory can be improved. Some well-practiced methods, verbal as well as visual mediators to improve memory are listed in this section.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Mnemonics</h3>
                        <p>You can recall when a list of difficult technical words in pharmacology or unfamiliar words in foreign language is to be remembered. Mnemonics are devices that facilitate the learning and recall of many such forms of difficult material. One of the method is to associate whatever you want to recall with something already established in your memory bank, e.g. colours of rainbow are associated with name "Roy G. BIV", i.e. Red. Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo and Violet.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Method of Loci</h3>
                        <p>You visualise a scene and fit the items to be remembered in that scene. The scene can be a street, a building with rooms, the layout of a college campus, a kitchen, or just about anything that can be visualised clearly and contains a number of discrete items in specific locations to serve as memory pegs. Supposing you want to remember for examination classical conditioning, then start by imagining a dog, experimental room, food, bell and any person as an experimenter. Rehearse this image over and over until it is well-established in your mind. After you have formed your image, associate the events, the stimulus substitution, and extinction with this. The trick is to make associations with as many concepts as needed.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Pegword Method</h3>
                        <p>Pegword method is another technique through which a list of items and their relative positions can be learned effectively. To establish the main idea in your long-term memory, a wellorganized set of images to which the to-beremembered items could be linked. For letter systems you can establish mnemonic pegs by forming strong distinctive images of words that start with the sounds of the letter of the alphabet.</p>
                        <p>In number systems, you form an image with each number.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Rhyming</h3>
                        <p>Rhyming can be used for learning of long list involving numbers like the numbers 1 through 10. You can organize or arrange the first letters of words in such a way that it rhymes. In Anatomy many students use rhyming to remember names of the different bones.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Making a Story</h3>
                        <p>Making a story in this you can fit the facts in the story like you read in elaborative rehearsal.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Chunking</h3>
                        <p>This technique illustrates systematic ways of encoding information. If you want to remember a long list of digits, e.g. 1989609065 you can break the numbers into chunks, the first four digits could be remembered as the year you passed your school or associated with any significant thing that happened in that year. Next three digits could also be taken as date, e.g. for someone's birthday. The last 3 digits can be an address code. Like this chunks can be associated with some important thing for lasting memory.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Remembering Names and Faces</h3>
                        <p>As first steps in establishing a good memory for names and faces, we should: (i) be sure we hear the name clearly when introduced, (ii) repeat the name when acknowledging the introduction, and (iii) if the name is unusual, politely ask the new acquaintance to spell it. While we are making sure we have heard and rehearsed the name, we should be paying close attention to the individual's face.</p>
                        <p>The important thing for good memory is your motivation and ability to organise the material. One strategy in remembering things well is to organise, or arrange the input so that it fits into existing long-term memory categories, is grouped in some logical manner, or is arranged in some other way that makes sense. The organisational encoding may be inherent in the input itself or it may be supplied by individuals as they learn and remember new things.</p>
                        <p>Here are some tips to help you to improve your memory.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Plan your study content and make a time schedule to cover that content. Stick to this schedule firmly.</li>
                            <li>For academic and nonacademic activities. One can make use of methods that help us to study better for the exams and do well. These methods are listed in the section below.</li>
                            <li>As you have seen rehearsal is important to transfer information into long-term memory, and elaborative rehearsal is more effective than maintenance rehearsal. So make notes of important points as all the details of information cannot be remembered. Revise these notes.</li>
                            <li>You can use imagery to visualise the material you are learning and give auditory stimulation by reading aloud. For example while studying nervous system, visualise the structure of nervous system with minutest details and also read loudly. Multi-channel stimulation would improve your memory.</li>
                            <li>Try to organise your material with retrieval cues or reminders. Make a map of contents in your mind.</li>
                            <li>Give a feedback to yourself by testing your memory. Revise areas where you could not remember.</li>
                            <li>Review before examination. Try to learn but do not get anxious as you have seen high anxiety level would interfere with your remembering.</li>
                            <li>Give some short rest pauses between your study times. It would help to consolidate the material you are learning.</li>
                        </ol>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Measurement of memory is a complex task because a number of variables interact in recall. All these variables can be divided in three groups: (i) nature of the material, (ii) the methods used for testing the recall, and (iii) characteristics of the individual. A combination of these three factors is necessary for testing the memory. Methods to assess memory are given in Chapter 18.</p>
                        <p>The method employed for testing the memory includes, immediate recall, delayed recall, sequential recall, associative recall, reconstruction, recognition both filled and unfilled interval between presentation of material and their recall. Recall is also affected by individual's characteristics. A person who is more attentive and receptive can recall better. The physical state of the individual taking test, his motivation, age, sex, education, do play role in the recall; irrespective of the material and methods used for testing the memory.</p>
                        <p>We are much more concerned about memory disturbances and its quantification. There are two types of memory disturbances-period specific memory disturbances and generalised slowing in memory. The former includes retrograde amnesia and anterograde amnesia. Retrograde is a defect of recall whereas anterograde amnesia is a defect of registration/retention, from the point of occurrence of a significant life event.</p>
                        <p>Longer the time duration of washout of previous traces in case of retrograde and the difficulty in forming the images for subsequent recall in case of anterograde amnesia forms the degree of severity of memory disturbances. Conventional techniques of memory testing do not quantify these period specific memory disturbances.</p>
                        <p>The generalised slowing in the formation and retrieval of the traces however, can be quantified from the available psychological tests of memory.</p>

                        <p>Memory is the most recognised cognitive function. It is markedly sensitive and easily influenced by emotionality, problems of daily life, psychiatric disturbances, sleep deprivation, over work, fatigue, consumption of intoxicants, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), exposure to anaesthetic gases, head injury, etc.</p>
                        <p>In your clinical practice you shall come across many patients having minor memory disturbances, but you may also come across patients with very severe memory disturbance, where the patient may even forget his name, to which place he belongs. He may go from one place to another and have total loss of memory for the incident. In memory loss due to normal aging sometimes the individual may remember everything of the past, but is unable to form new memories. Memory problems are very common amongst students. Children with below average intelligence also have memory problems. Similarly poor memory is reported in children with attention deficit disorders. High anxiety state in students during examination impairs retention.</p>
                        <p>Psychological strategies for enhancing memory or aids to rehabilitation especially for patients with neurological problems have been developed. These are of special importance in rehabilitation of patients with head injury, and amnesias of all types. As any memory process includes three functions namely-encoding, storage and retrieval thus the strategies to enhance these processes are given in brief in the following section.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Encoding</h3>
                        <p>To improve encoding of the information advise patients/family members to:</p>
                        <ol type="i">
                            <li>Simplify information</li>
                            <li>Reduce the amount</li>
                            <li>Make sure he has understood</li>
                            <li>Repeat the information</li>
                            <li>Make associations</li>
                            <li>Encourage to organise and group the information</li>
                            <li>Process at deeper levels-think about makes it meaningful.</li>
                        </ol>
                        
                        <h3>Storage</h3>
                        <p>To improve storage process first of all rate of forgetting should be objectively assessed. Then attempts should be made to rehearse, then test and retest the memory. Use method of expanded or reconstruction rehearsal method as this is more effective than repetition.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Retrieval</h3>
                        <p>As retrieval is better in context where the patient is learning, so advise patients to go to the situation in which retrieval is required. Retrieval can be done by:</p>
                        <ol type="i">
                            <li>First letter prompts</li>
                            <li>Alphabetical searching</li>
                            <li>Mental retracing of events.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>In addition to this certain other strategies can be used for rehabilitation of patients with memory impairment. Environmental adaptations for patients having very impaired memory can be made by using labels, sign post, or colour coding. External aids can be used. These are of two types: (1) those aids that we use to store information externally, e.g. lists, plans, diaries, and (2) cueing devices. Also some of the methods listed above to improve memory can be used, like mnemonics. While helping such patients it is also important to advise family members not to make fun or laugh at these patients. An encouraging attitude towards the patient should be adopted.</p>

                        <p>Memory is an ability to remember, this is a very important cognitive process for our learning. The memory process is divided into three main stages-encoding, storage and retrieval. There are three distinct ways of classifying memory: (i) neurological structure of the brain, which divides memory into verbal and nonverbal, (ii) on the basis of experimental model, memory is divided into sensory memory, short-term memory and long-term memory, and (iii) on the basis of clinical practice, memory can be divided into remote, recent and immediate. Their levels of processing also differentiate shortterm and long-term memory. The two primary and secondary types of memory are, short-term memory wherein information is stored for maximum 30 seconds and has limited capacity. In long-term memory store, information is organised in semantic memory or in episodic memory.</p>
                        <p>There are four main causes of forgetting: (i) interference due to similar material, (ii) faulty encoding, storage and retrieval. If the sensory registration or input of information is faulty then memory will not be established. Similarly each of these stages are important for good memory, (iii) motivated forgetting, and (iv) amnesias which could be biological, due to diseases of the brain or psychological.</p>
                        <p>Memory could be improved with good planning, organisation, review and feedback. The other methods to improve memory are mnemonics, method of loci, pegword method, rhyming, making a story, and chunking. Some strategies have been developed to help and rehabilitate patients with severe memory defects such as head injury, dementias, normal aging. These strategies provide steps to enhance memory at different stages of processing.</p>
                        <p>There are several methods to assess memory, which have been given in Chapter 18.</p>
                        <p>Clinical applications of memory extend from various psychiatric; child psychiatric disorders to neurological disorders especially head injury and dementia. Methods to improve memory are of relevance to the students themselves.</p>
