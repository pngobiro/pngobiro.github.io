                        <p><em>A senior government executive, around 45 years old was referred for obsessive rumination. This problem was very severe and it interfered with his work, he felt insecure, so his wife, also an executive had to be with him always. Behavioural assessment revealed that besides his rumination about girl, he also was afraid to see gray hair, had intense anxiety as well as apprehension about his growing old. He had negative thoughts related to old age as nobody cares for, person becomes lonely and the life in old age is worthless. This case is not unique, as many of us can have problems of adjustment to age specific roles, illness, failing abilities and so on. On the other hand, we meet many people from various stages of life enjoying every bit of experience. This chapter shall help you to understand various developmental changes, which occur with the advancement of age so that you can identify the deviations and thus provide help.</em></p>
                        <p>According to the ancient Hindu literature, the development period was divided into four stages namely: Brahmacharya ashram, Grihasth ashram, Vanprasth ashram, and Sanyas ashram. The first two stages correspond to early period of childhood through adolescence and adulthood where the individual settles in job, gets married and has family responsibilities. The Vanprasth is equivalent to the middle age where the person after fulfilling some of the primary responsibilities of family, works for his selfactualisation joins religious organisations works for social cause; and finally, the sanyas being the old age where the individual retires and occupies himself with religious activities. Similar system of development has been adopted by the modern thinkers. Many of the developmental tasks described in ancient Hindu books are similar in nature with those described by modern thinkers.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The adulthood has been divided into three parts, namely, young adulthood (20 to 40-45 years); middle adulthood (40-45 to about 65 years); and old age (from 65 or 70 years onwards). This classification is only for the convenience of studying the developmental process in adult age, which is fairly a longer period than other stages like childhood or adolescence.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Stages in Adult Development</h3>
                        <p>It is only recently that due attention has been given to the developmental process from early adulthood to middle adulthood. Thus, some longitudinal studies have been carried out to study this process. The findings of these studies are as follows:</p>
                        
                        <h4>The Early Adult Transition (17 to 22 years)</h4>
                        <p>People feel halfway out of the family and sense a great need to get all the way out. They have a tenuous sense of their own autonomy and feel that real adult life is just around the corner.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Entering the Adult World (22 to 28 years)</h4>
                        <p>People now feel like adults. They are established in a chosen lifestyle; independent of their parents, and pursuing immediate goals without questioning themselves about whether they are following the right course.</p>
                        
                        <h4>The Age 30 Transition (28 to 34 years)</h4>
                        <p>People ask themselves, "What is this life all about now that I am doing what I am supposed to?" and "Is what I am, the only way for me to be?" They often reassess both work and family patterns. At this time, for example, career women think about having a baby, and homemakers begin to work outside the home.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Settling Down (33 to 43 years)</h4>
                        <p>People make deeper commitments to work, family, and other important aspects of their lives, setting specific goals with set timetables. Towards the end of this period, is the state which Levinson calls "becoming one's own man", when men break away from the authorities in their lives and work at attaining senior status in their own right.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Midlife Transition (40 to 45 years)</h4>
                        <p>People question virtually every aspect of their lives and values with an increasing awareness that time is limited. They may bridge the transition to the second half of life. They come to terms with the fact that the first part of adult life is over, and they will not be able to do all that they had planned before they grow old and die. The transition may be smoothly managed or it may assume crisis proportions, depending on their personalities and the specific situations they find themselves in.</p>
                        <p>While biology shapes much of what we do in childhood, culture and individual personality play a much larger role in adult life. The older we grow, the less our age tells about us. For example, two 45-year-old women may resemble each other physiologically, but the one who had two children in her twenties, remained at home would have a different outlook on life from that of her age-mate with a well-established career.</p>
                        <p>Traditionally, most adults have had strong feelings about the time in life, when certain activities are considered acceptable. People are keenly aware of their own timing and describe themselves as "early", "late", or "on time", regarding the time they got married, settled in a career, had children, or retired. This sense of timing seems to be shaped by environmental expectations, often affected by social class.</p>
                        <p>In recent years, however, as affluence has filtered down, as medical advances have kept people vigorous, and as the life span has lengthened, age-based expectations have become more flexible. We are more accepting of 40-year-old first time parents and 40-yearold grandparents, 50-year-old retirees and 75-year-old workers. As Bernice Neugarten and Gunhild Hagestad (1976) point out, we seem to be moving in the direction of what might be called an age-irrelevant society; and it can be argued that age, like race or sex, is diminishing in importance as a regulator of behaviour.</p>
                        <p>In adulthood, generally people are wellsettled in their careers barring a few. We are much more flexible in dealing with the basic developmental tasks of adulthood. These are years of good health and energy, especially in our twenties and thirties, with very slight, gradual changes not becoming noticeable till about age 50. We are at the peak of our muscular strength and our manual dexterity at about 25 or 30. We see and hear most sharply in our early twenties, gradually there is a decline in these senses, as majority of the people become farsighted around forty years. Taste, smell, and sensitivity to pain, touch, and temperature remain stable until at least 45 or 50.</p>
                        <p>Certain relatively consistent events mark adulthood in our society. These range from escaping parental dominance in the late teens, to a noticeable acceptance of one's lot in life during the 50's. Research indicates that midlife affects many people in the 37-41 ranges, but this is not universal. Midlife crisis is characterised by feeling of instability and anxiety.</p>
                        <p>Biological ageing begins between 25 and 30 years, but peak performance in specific pursuits may come at various parts throughout life. Most of the health changes from young adulthood to middle age are relatively minor. The organ systems are not as efficient as they had been, tending to lose some of their reserve capacity. Men's sexual capacity declines, and high blood pressure becomes a problem. Metabolism changes, and both sexes tend to put on weight.</p>
                        <p>How do individuals cope with physical changes, and therefore, with the awareness of their ageing? Past health history, family attitudes, and individual personalities play a large part. Women tend to be more health conscious, both for themselves and their families. This may have something to do with the fact that pregnancy and childbirth have involved them more closely with medical care, as well as with their traditional role as guardian of the family's health. While men often turn to diets and exercise, they tend to ignore symptoms (Lewis and Lewis, 1977).</p>

                        <h3>Physical Changes</h3>
                        <p>The ratio of the physical and the psychological changes in midlife vary, with the former affecting women universally and the latter becoming increasingly recognised syndrome among men.</p>
                        <p><strong>Menopause:</strong> It is a biological event in every woman's life, when she stops menstruating and can no longer bear children. There are variations in the age at which it may come. It can occur any time between 38 and 60 years of age, with the average between 48 and 52 (Upjohn, 1983). At one time, a number of psychological problems, especially depression, were blamed on the menopause, but recent research shows no reason to attribute psychiatric illness to the physical changes in a woman's body. Such problems are more likely caused by environmental pressures against ageing, which remind a woman that menopause marks the end of her youth. In those cultures that value the older woman, few problems are associated with the menopause (Ballinger, 1961). A society's attitude toward ageing seems to influence a menopausal woman's well-being far more than the level of hormones in her body.</p>
                        <p><strong>The male climacteric:</strong> Despite the fact that men continue to father children till quite late in life, there are some biological changes in middle-aged men. These include decreased fertility and frequency of orgasm, and an increase in impotency (Beard, 1975). Furthermore, men seem to have cyclic fluctuations in the production of hormones. About five per cent of middle-aged men are said to experience symptoms such as depression, fatigue, sexual inadequacy, and vaguely defined physical complaints. Since researchers have found no relationships between hormone levels and mood changes (Doering, Kraemer; Brodie and Hamburg), it is probable that most men's complaints are just as subject to environmental pressures as women's are. Some of the problems may be related to disturbing life events, such as illness of the man or his wife, business or job problems, his children leaving home, or the death of his parents.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Intelligence and Memory</h3>
                        <p>For many years, it was believed that general intellectual activity peaked at about age 20 and then declined. We have strong evidence showing that certain types of intelligence continue to develop throughout life. We have discussed in Chapter 6 about two types of intelligence, fluid and crystallised. Verbal abilities, a type of crystallised intelligence, appear to increase throughout adulthood and old age. Performance in solving new problems such as spatial-relations tasks, an aspect of fluid intelligence, peaks in the late teens and then begins a slow, steady decline. Furthermore, the accumulated wisdom that comes with adulthood may offset any decline in fluid abilities. Wisdom, the ability to exercise good judgement about important but uncertain matters of life, also affects our relationships with other people.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Personality</h3>
                        <p>Few of us hold the same outlook on life at 40 that we did at 20, showing the growth and development that takes place during adulthood. This growth comes about from many sources—the people we meet, the reading we do, the experiences we undergo, the challenges we face up to. Recent longitudinal studies of adults have dramatically illustrated the kinds of developmental tasks we deal with over the years.</p>
                        <p>Yet despite the changes that occur-in our lives and our thinking, we are still the same people. And we do tend to carry certain basic traits with us in all the twists and turns of life's pathways. The two threads of stability and change are intertwined throughout all our lives, with some of us showing more change and others more continuity.</p>
                        <p>One personality change, common in midlife is the tendency to express aspects of our personalities that we had repressed during our younger years. Sometimes, the repressed personality traits get a chance to manifest in middle age. With the recognition at this stage of life that some of our basic goals have already been achieved—the children reared, the career established, the identity in large measure achieved—both men and women feel freer to change from the stereotypical male or female role they had modelled themselves in younger age. They allow themselves to express long-buried aspects of their personalities, as many women become more assertive, competitive, and independent and many men allow themselves to be passive and dependent. You may find many men enjoying cooking in this age, which was never even dreamt in their young age. The significant aspect of such change is not of "contrasexual" nature but the fact that any trait that has been repressed for the first half of life may now flower, with the increased self-confidence and relaxation that often accompany middle age.</p>
                        <p>One other common personality change, which may help uncover such buried characteristics, is a tendency for people to become more introspective as they grow older. While younger people invest more of their energies in action rather than in thought, people at midlife and beyond tend to think about themselves more, analysing what they have done in their lives and why they have done it (Cytrynbaum).</p>
                        
                        <h3>Parenthood and Development</h3>
                        <p>Parenthood can be a creative self-growth experience as parents go through its several stages: anticipating ahead of time what parenthood will be like, adjusting to new demands and learning how to meet them at every stage of their children's growth, and then disengaging from the active parental role as children mature. As children grow, parents get a second chance to relive their own childhood experiences and to work out issues they had not resolved with their own parents. In addition, their children, who bring their own unique personalities and demands to this intimate, intensely emotional relationship, influence them. This is the period when children settle in own professions, get married and leave home. The parents especially mothers may feel lonely in the house. This phenomenon has been called "empty nest syndrome". Persons with poor coping ability or with too much of dependency on children find difficult to adjust with the new circumstances.</p>

                        <span class="heading-text">Old Age or the Senescence</span>
                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The interface between the body systems and the environment as it exists in senescence requires one to look at the older person in a special light. Most significantly, later life is marked by a number of progressive losses. For example, health, vocation, financial security, status, beauty, friendship, and even-eventually-life itself are all at risk for older people.</p>
                        <p>Abnormal development occurs when the elderly individual is unable to cope successfully with the large number of losses that he or she is apt to experience in the course of a life time. The symptoms that the elderly individual exhibits in the face of these stresses are likely to represent exacerbations of long-standing or well-established patterns of behaviour. Senescence leads to diverse physical and psychosocial changes that may affect the functioning of the older adult.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Developmental Tasks of Old Age</h3>
                        <p>Gerontologists have proposed two theories of ageing. The disengagement theory holds that withdrawal from society is necessary and desirable in old age. The activity theory counters that optimal adjustment to ageing is tied to continuing activity and involvement. According to a report, well being in old age is characterised by self-acceptance, positive relations with others, autonomy, environmental mastery, a purpose in life and continued personal growth.</p>
                        <p>Those who do achieve a sense of wholeness and integrity may develop one of the hallmarks of successful ageing, wisdom. Our culture traditionally relies on selected elderly people for advice about complex life problems. One reason may be that older people who have been attentive to their life experience, often have a perspective on reality that is richer and more informed than the view most younger people take.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Health Changes</h3>
                        <p>Physical functioning and health decline in old age. Although ageing does not affect the entire organism uniformly, we observe negative changes in nine body systems; they are musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, respiratory, nervous and special senses, gastrointestinal, urinary, integumentary, reproductive, and endocrine. Whether we look at the thinning of muscular fibres, loss of muscle tone in the bladder, or decreased basal metabolic rate, we discover a decline in the older person's vital functions. It is of special importance to the behavioural scientist, to recognise that all five senses suffer loss in even normal ageing, thereby skewing perception. For the most part, these conditions are more like chronic, debilitating illnesses, as opposed to acute episodes as seen earlier in life. The following pictures show physical changes that occur from adulthood to old age (Fig. 13.1).</p>

                        <h3>Psychological Changes</h3>
                        <h4>Intelligence</h4>
                        <p>Some intellectual abilities do not decline with age, while other abilities decline at different rates. In general, verbal abilities tend to be maintained while psychomotor speed and problem solving tend to decline. Studies using the Wechler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS), indicated the elderly do best on information, vocabulary, and comprehension subtests; less well on arithmetic and picture completion subtests; and worst on tests of object assembly, block design, and picture arrangement.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Learning and Memory</h4>
                        <p>Because learning and memory are closely intertwined and both are crucial to intellectual functioning, it is important to find out how the two operate in old age. Many investigators have worked at this task, and some general trends are emerging from their work. First, though older adults can certainly learn via classical and instrumental conditioning.</p>
                        <p>Second, in verbal learning-learning lists of words, for example, adults over 60 generally do not perform as well as do young adults, but experts are now debating whether these performance differences reflect real differences in learning ability. Some attribute the inferior performance of older adults to pacing problems. It is on timed tasks that older people perform most poorly.</p>
                        <p>Third, overcaution and pacing problems may also contribute to some of the memoryperformance deficits older people demonstrate. These deficits are not found in all aspects of their memory but are largely confined to processing of information.</p>
                        <p>Older people show deficits in the encoding and retrieval processes. They are less effective than are younger adults in coming up with good strategies for organising and rehearsing the memories they are encoding, and they often take longer than do younger adults to draw memories out of storage (Erber, 1982). Memories-be they words, pictures, or concepts—seem to be recognised about as effectively by older as by younger adults; it is recall, remembering from scratch or from partial cues, that tends to suffer with old age. As we have seen in Chapter on Memory that the memories are rarely lost, it just takes longer to find them in the file or takes longer to retrieve. The abilities may vary in the various components of memory-registration, storage and retrieval of information. Bellak (1976) reports that elderly individuals may remember better when information is personally meaningful, offered in small amounts, and presented in a way that is easy to code for storage.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Personality Changes</h3>
                        <p>Adult development from early adulthood to middle adulthood and to later life has been a largely neglected area of study. Recently, some attention has been given to the study of personality in later years, by adopting a developmental approach. Thus, as during the formative childhood and adolescent years, the adult is viewed as passing through various life phases. During these phases, the individual's perspective on life and death, personal accomplishments, and interpersonal relationships are ever evolving. The many changes faced by the elderly quite often call for a team approach to deal with their problems. Mental health problems may be one of many issues confronting the older person.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Stressful Life Events</h3>
                        <p>There is an increasing evidence that life events associated with older persons are higher due to death of the spouse, change in living conditions, at times rejection from children, lack of friends, restriction in financial condition and mobility. The physical disabilities like loss of hearing, poor visions, difficulty in walking, etc. may cause additional stress on the older person. These stressful events should be taken into consideration while understanding the problems of the aged, because the presence of stress can delay the recovery process of physical diseases (Chapter 10).</p>
                        <p>Indeed mental health conditions may be inextricably tied to other physical or social problems in the older person's life. An understanding of the role of body systems as well as needs for care and support are necessary, in order to be able to provide effective treatment to an older patient. Even the manner in which you communicate with the older patient is important in developing trust and good doctor-patient relationship. At times, it is good to integrate mental health treatment into the ovrall care plan for the older patient.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Social Changes</h3>
                        <p>Social losses among the elderly are a major concern. Widowed elders lose the psychosocial role of being a spouse and are much more likely to experience isolation and loneliness. People who experience isolation and loneliness are documented as being at high risk for mental illness.</p>
                        <p>The economical problems in old age often result in the biopsychosocial crises experienced by the elderly. The elderly persons from lower or middle economic class may live on relatively fixed incomes. During illness, if expensive medication is prescribed, many of these elderly persons are not even able to buy them. Lack of mobility, limited public transportation, poor intergenerational relationships, loss of status due to retirement, society's prejudice can result in synergistic blend of conditions that lead to a high rate of psychopathology and need for services among the old.</p>
                        <p>Gerontologists have proposed two theories of ageing. The disengagement theory holds that withdrawal from society is necessary and desirable in old age. The activity theory counters that optimal adjustment to ageing is tied to continuing activity and involvement. According to Ryft (1989), well being in old age is characterised by self-acceptance, positive relations with others, autonomy, environmental mastery, a purpose in life and continued personal growth.</p>

                        <p>Ageing brings difficulties of adjustment and these may be of sufficient severity to lead to pathological states of anxiety or depression, which required treatment. Middle adulthood is a period of productivity, being on the highest scales of the career and thus more prone to stress. As we have seen earlier in the Chapter of Stress, that it can give rise to number of physical problems. Coping with these physical problems and fulfilling the aspirations and ambitions may get into conflict. Understanding the varying reactions to such situations can be used in the management of physical problems.</p>
                        <p>With the advancement in medicine, the life expectancy has increased. Thus, in any country the population of the elderly people is growing. With advancement of age, not only the physical problems increased but the psychological problems are also greater. Since memory problems are a frequent complaint of elderly people who are depressed, discriminating between memory problems that are organic versus functional in nature is of prime importance. Amongst the psychological problems, depression is the most common problem encountered in the aged population. The depressive feeling may be associated with loneliness, physical illness or simply due to the decline of abilities due to normal ageing. Understanding the family circumstances, social support system and coping resources of these people can enhance the efficacy of the treatment.</p>

                        <p>The period of adulthood has primarily been divided into three periods, namely, early, middle and late adulthood. Depending upon the personality, attitude and lifestyle the differentiation between these three stages is not very clear-cut. Generally, there are not many physical or psychological changes in the early adulthood. The physical changes start showing up after the age of 50 years (middle age).</p>
                        <p>The middle age is the period, which can show some personality changes like the women becoming more assertive and the men taking the reverse role. The physical changes due to menopause can be associated with some psychological problems in some women. These being, who have negative attitude towards ageing or have not achieved what they wanted are more prone to depression at this age. The old age is generally considered around 65 years and above. In old age there are problems in learning new materials and deficits in memory primarily due to the difficulty in retrieval. There can be some personality changes as old age demands adjustment with retirement, limited resources and decline in functioning of the vital organs. Death of the spouse and children staying away can result in loneliness. Older people are at risk to develop mental health problems, especially depression.</p>
