                        <p><em>Bharati aged 48 years, is married and has two children. Bharati has been referred for her asthmatic attacks, which have recently become very severe and also occur more frequently. Her medication has been increased but Bharati has not got any relief. Bharati and her whole family are very upset due to her severe attacks, which at times even require hospitalisation. What could be the reason for Bharati's problem? One of the common causes in such situations is emotional distress. A detail history of psychosocial factors revealed that lately Bharati has been very upset, as her young daughter wanted to marry a boy from other caste. Bharati had tried to dissuade her daughter, but the daughter had her own perspective. Bharati has been worrying about this, has not been able to sleep, and has not discussed her problem with any one else. It is well known that the emotional state of the person has a great impact on the physical health; emotions can precipitate or aggravate an illness.</em></p>
                        <p>Emotion is one of the important aspects of human relationship. Emotions have a psychological aspects also related to behaviour and cognition, which influences the physiological aspects of the emotion. When you are screaming at someone's behaviour, it arouses sympathetic nervous system and your body reacts accordingly. An emotion involves a subjective awareness of a particular state of mind, which is recognised as happiness or fear, and an objective physiological change, like change in heart rate, and expressive motor behaviour (over activity, running away), which is observable and can be measured. Emotions are closely associated to health and sickness, thus an understanding of emotions is of great importance.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The dictionary gives many definitions of "emotion", most of which have to do with agitated movement of some kind. And most of this "agitated movement" has to do with goals. You often feel joy and happiness, when you reach a goal. You often feel angry and frustrated, when you perceive a barrier between you and a goal. And you may experience pain and depression, when you believe you cannot possibly get what you want or need. The emotional experience has not been much emphasised in the scientific definitions of emotion.</p>
                        <p>According to biologically oriented psychologists, emotion is primarily a physical reaction that involves rather special parts of your nervous system. The purpose of emotions is to arouse body for some kind of specific action (such as fighting), or to depress physical responses, so that body can regain itself.</p>
                        <p>To other psychologists, emotion is primarily an intrapsychic experience that involves "inner feelings" rather than physiological reactions (for overt behaviours). Some of these experts divide emotions into various types of mental experiences such as fear, anger, love, hate, and lust. Other intrapsychic psychologists view feelings as being bipolar either "pleasant" or "unpleasant". Still other group of psychologists perceives emotions as being behavioural responses. They are concerned with fearful reactions, rather than fears, and of inactivity or unresponsiveness rather than depression.</p>
                        <p>Cutting across this debate about what emotions are, is the age-old controversy about where emotions come from. Some psychologists believe that all cultures share similar emotional reactions. Other behavioural scientists view the emotions as being mostly learned reactions acquired through experience. These psychologists believe you had to be carefully taught to love the things you love, and to hate the things you despise.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Emotionality has been viewed by some physiologists as primarily a biological event, and they tend to focus on arousal and depression. Emotional reactions are perceived by them as being one's way of preparing to respond to some kind of physical or psychological challenge. Imagine you are about to be attacked by some robbers. Then you must prepare yourself either to fight or to get out of the threatening situation. Your physiological emotional responses will take place without your conscious volition or desire; you do not have to "will" your sweat glands to secrete water or your teeth to start chattering, when you are frightened or cold. These activities are handled for you automatically by the unconscious parts of your brain and nervous system.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Autonomic Nervous System</h3>
                        <p>Autonomic nervous system is that part of body which controls emotional reactions. It is connected to most of the glands and many of the muscles in the body. Autonomic nervous system has two major parts: (1) the sympathetic nervous system, whose activity tends to excite or arouse and (2) the parasympathetic nervous system, which tends to depress or slow down many of the bodily functions. Both parts of the nervous systems work together in a coordinated fashion to control bodily activities. When one needs to relax, parasympathetic system increases its neural activities, while sympathetic system slows down. It is the joint action of the two systems, which allows responding appropriately to most of the physical and psychological challenges one meets in life.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Sympathetic Nervous System</h3>
                        <p>Your sympathetic nervous system consists of a group of 22 neural centres, lying on or close to your spinal cord. From these 22 centres, axonic fibers run to all parts of your body, to the salivary glands in your mouth, to the irises in your eyes, to your heart, lungs, liver, and stomach, and to your intestines and genitals. Your sympathetic nervous system is also connected with your sweat glands, your hair cells, and with the tiny blood vessels near the surface of your skin.</p>
                        <p>Whenever you encounter an emergency of some kind-something that enrages you, makes you suddenly afraid, creates strong desire, or calls for heavy labour on your part, your sympathetic nervous system swings into action in several ways:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The pupils in your eyes open up to let in more light.</li>
                            <li>Your heart pumps more blood to your brain, muscles and to the surface of your skin.</li>
                            <li>You breathe harder and faster.</li>
                            <li>Your blood sugar level is elevated.</li>
                            <li>Your digestion is slowed down to a crawl.</li>
                            <li>Your skin perspires to flush out the waste products created by the extra exertion and to keep you cool.</li>
                            <li>The sympathetic nervous system also controls orgasm and ejaculation during sexual excitement.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>In short, activity in your sympathetic nervous system prepares you for fighting, fleeing, feeding, or sexual climax.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Parasympathetic Nervous System</h3>
                        <p>Your parasympathetic nervous system connects to most (but not all) parts of your body, as does the sympathetic. In general, parasympathetic stimulation produces physiological effects that are the opposite of those induced by sympathetic stimulation. Activity in your parasympathetic system does the following things:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>It closes down or constricts the irises in your eyes.</li>
                            <li>It decreases the rate at which your heart beats.</li>
                            <li>It slows down your breathing.</li>
                            <li>It lowers your blood sugar level.</li>
                            <li>It increases salivation, stimulates the flow of digestive juices, and promotes the processes of excretion.</li>
                            <li>It retards sweating.</li>
                            <li>It induces penis erection in the male and nipple erection in the female during sexual activity.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Generally speaking, activity in your parasympathetic nervous system conserves or builds up your body's resources.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Homeostatic Balance</h3>
                        <p>Increased neural excitement in the sympathetic system tends to inhibit activity in the parasympathetic, and vice versa. But the two systems are not really antagonists or competitors. Rather, they function together smoothly in a coordinated fashion to maintain an optimum balance between over-arousal and under-arousal. The sympathetic system gears the organism for energy output. As the emotion subsides, the parasympathetic system, the energy-conserving system, takes over and returns the organism to its normal state.</p>
                        <p>An example of joint activity of these two systems is the sexual act, where parasympathetic stimulation is necessary for erection to occur. However, orgasm and ejaculation are controlled by sympathetic excitation. Thus, sexual activity must begin with relaxation (parasympathetic stimulation) but typically goes on to arousal and climax (sympathetic stimulation). Too much sympathetic arousal or inhibition early in the sex act, leads to impotence in the male and disinterest or frigidity in the female. And too much parasympathetic stimulation will prevent orgasm in both sexes. Under normal circumstances, in most of the activities there is a normal balance between parasympathetic and sympathetic stimulation. On the contrary, individuals who are under stress or are angry, agitated, the balance between the two systems is disturbed and the sympathetic nervous system becomes more active.</p>
                        
                        <h3>The Adrenal Glands</h3>
                        <p>There are two adrenal glands, one sitting atop each of the kidneys. Adrenals produce hormones that influence sexual development and that monitor bodily functions such as urine production. But these glands also produce two chemicals that are referred to as the "arousal" hormones. Earlier, these two hormones were called as adrenalin and noradrenalin, now these are more commonly referred as "epinephrine" and "norepinephrine."</p>
                        <p>When epinephrine and norepinephrine are released into the bloodstream by adrenal glands, these hormones bring about all of the physiological changes associated with strong emotions such as fear, anger, hostility and sexual aggressiveness. These two hormones act to prepare blood pressure and heart rate, speeding up breathing, widening the pupils in eyes, and increasing perspiration. The release of epinephrine and norepinephrine is under the control of sympathetic nervous system, whose activities are imitated by the hormones. When you encounter an arousing situation, your sympathetic nervous system goes into action first, mobilising your body's energy resources and also causing the secretion of the two "arousal" hormones. As you secrete epinephrine, the arousal process by chemically stimulating the same neural centres that the sympathetic nervous system has stimulated electrically.</p>
                        <p>But the hormones also increase the firing rate of the nerve cells in the sympathetic nervous system itself. This stimulation causes you to secrete more of the hormones, which increases activity in the sympathetic system, and so on until the emergency has passed or you collapse in exhaustion.</p>
                        
                        <h3>General Adaptation Syndrome</h3>
                        <p>Hans Selye (1976) outlined the three states that body seems to go through when its resources must be mobilised to meet situations of excessive physiological stress. According to Selye, biological reaction to stress almost always follows the same adaptive pattern. Selye calls this pattern the General Adaptation Syndrome, or GAS and has three main stages or parts: (i) Alarm stage, (ii) resistance or counteraction and (iii) exhaustion. Suppose you suffer from a severe physical or emotional trauma. Your body will immediately respond with the alarm reaction, which is the first stage of the General Adaptation Syndrome. During this stage, your body and mind are in a state of shock. Your temperature and blood pressure drop, your tissues swell with fluid, and your muscles lose their tone. You may not think clearly and ability to file things away in long-term memory may be disrupted.</p>
                        <p>The second part of the GAS is the stage of resistance, or countershock. During this stage, your body begins to repair the damage it has suffered, and your mind begins to function more clearly. ACTH hormone is released by the brain, which acts on your adrenal glands, causing them to release their own hormones. These adrenal hormones counteract the shock in several ways, primarily by raising temperature and blood pressure. However, you pay a price for resisting the shock, for your body uses up its available supply of ACTH and adrenal hormones at a rapid pace. If the stress continues, your adrenal glands will swell as they strive to produce enough hormones to neutralise the stress.</p>
                        <p>During the first two GAS stages, your sympathetic nervous system is intensely aroused. However, if the emergency continues for too long, an overwhelming counter-reaction may occur in which your parasympathetic system takes over. You may fall into the third statethe stage of exhaustion. During this stage, you go into shock again because your body has been over-stimulated for so long, that it is depleted of ACTH and adrenal hormones. Further exposure to stress at this time can lead to depression, psychophysiological disorders or even death.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Psychologists and physiologists have tried to formulate some general principles to explain emotions. These theories are concerned with the relationship between individuals' bodily states the emotions they feel, and how emotions are involved in behaviour.</p>
                        
                        <h3>The James-Lange Theory of Bodily Reactions</h3>
                        <p>The most famous physiological theory of emotionality was proposed by William James in 1884. According to James, body always takes the lead in emotional situations; "feelings" are merely mental responses to the changes that have occurred in nervous system, muscles and glands.</p>
                        <p>An example of this could be, suppose you are walking through the woods one day and you almost step on a huge rattlesnake. Chances are, you will momentarily go into shock. Then, almost immediately, your heart will start pounding, your hair will stand on end, and you will breathe more rapidly. And if you are wise, you will slowly back away and then run for your life. Moments later, usually after you are out of danger, you will notice these physiological reactions and realise that you are scared.</p>
                        <p>You may think that you saw the snake, became frightened, and then ran. But according to James, this is not the case. For he presumes that your bodily reactions precede and thus cause your feelings. According to this theory, we are afraid because we run; we do not run because we are afraid. Later, similar explanation was given based on independent research by Lange and this is often called the James-Lange theory of emotions.</p>
                        
                        <h3>The Cannon-Bard Theory of Central Neural Processes</h3>
                        <p>Some objections were pointed out to the James-Lange theory by the physiologist Walter B Cannon. First, James-Lange assumed that feelings are dependent upon activity in the sympathetic nervous system. However, people who (through accident or disease) have lost use of their sympathetic systems still feel emotions and show emotional behaviours. Second, the bodily changes associated with emotions generally occur after the "feelings and behaviours" have started, not before they take place. Third, the same physiological changes occur in very different emotional states and in nonemotional states as well.</p>
                        <p>Cannon believed that emotional inputs were processed almost simultaneously by two different parts of the brain, the thalamus and the hypothalamus; the thalamus controlled emotional feelings, while the hypothalamus controlled bodily responses. You would experience conscious "fear" of a snake, even if your body were totally paralysed because "fear" and "running" are mediated by different centres in your brain. Bard advanced almost the same viewpoint later in 1937, since then this approach to the explanation of emotionality is called the Cannon-Bard theory.</p>
                        
                        <h3>The Lasarus-Schachter Theory of Emotional Arousal</h3>
                        <p>Sensory experiences lead to emotion only when the stimuli are cognitively appraised as having personal significance. Richard Lasarus (1984) advocated cognitive appraisal view, that emotional experience 'grows out of ongoing transactions with the environment that are evaluated'. According to Stanley Schachter (1971) the experience of emotion is the joint effect of the physiological arousal and cognitive appraisal. All arousal is assumed to be general and undifferentiated and it comes first in the emotion sequence. Cognition serves to determine how this ambiguous inner state will be labeled. This theory is also known as two factor theory of emotion. This approach has been challenged, as awareness of once physiological arousal is not a necessary condition for emotional experience.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Other Physiological Viewpoints</h3>
                        <p>Karl Lashley (1960) noted that people with damaged thalamuses still experienced emotional feelings, and people with damaged hypothalamuses still showed emotional responses. At about the same time, other scientists showed that both the limbic system and the right hemisphere were involved in mediating emotional feelings and behaviours.</p>
                        <p>The recent theorists have pointed out that bodily reactions do play an important role in creating and sustaining emotions. However, our feelings are so frightfully complex, that we simply cannot reduce them to mere hormonal neural activity. To gain a more complete understanding of emotionality, therefore, we must look at intrapsychic variables as well.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Intrapsychic psychologists believe contrary to the biological psychologists that how you perceive and feel about a situation determines your bodily reactions. An intrapsychic viewpoint emphasises the reverse.</p>
                        <p>For example, you can tell the difference (subjectively) between your emotions and you differentiate between such emotional states as hunger, fear, and anger. You apparently do so on the basis of intrapsychic cues rather than biological states. The physical changes that occur in your body are pretty much the same, no matter what type of emotional upheaval you are undergoing.</p>
                        <p>There is some recent evidence that adrenal glands produce more epinephrine when you are afraid, but secretes more norepinephrine when you are angry. However, both hormones are released to some degree in all arousal situations. Thus, we cannot tell objectively whether you are angry or afraid just by measuring the relative amounts of epinephrine and norepinephrine floating around in your bloodstream.</p>
                        <p>The importance of psychological factors in emotions has been supported by a study, in which human volunteers were injected with large amounts of epinephrine or norepinephrine, they often reported feeling as if they were "about to become emotional", but they could not say why. The "arousal" they experienced did not seem "real" somehow, because it was not focussed or directed toward any given object. Many of the volunteers described the experience as "cold rage".</p>
                        
                        <h3>Cognitive Factors in Emotion</h3>
                        <p>Bodily sensations, particularly the activity of the autonomic nervous system, are important to feelings of emotion, but different emotions show pretty much the same physiological patterns. People are usually aware that something is going on internally when they are angry, or excited, or afraid, but they do not discriminate their heart rate or blood pressure or what is happening in their stomach very well. The individual identifies and labels his state of physiological and psychological arousal in terms of the immediate circumstances, what angered them, or pleased them or frightened them. They go on to describe some of their bodily reactions and this determines whether he is, angry, fearful or happy. They do not define the emotion solely in terms of their own internal feelings.</p>
                        <p>These results support cognitive-physiological theory of emotion. According to Schachter (1971), emotion is internal physiological arousal in interaction with cognitive processes. Feedback to the brain from physiological activity gives rise to an undifferentiated state of affect, but the felt emotion is determined by the "label" the subject assigns to that aroused state. The assignment of a label is a cognitive process; the subject uses information from past experiences and his perception of what is going on around him to arrive at an interpretation of his feelings. This interpretation will determine how he acts and the label that he uses to define his emotional state. According to Lasarus (1966), the individual cognitive appraisal of any situation determines the emotional response, including its accompanying physiological changes. Appraisal is influenced by past experience and current availability of strategies for coping with threat.</p>
                        <p>Learning to label bodily sensations in terms of emotional tone (i.e. as pleasant or unpleasant) is relevant to some of the differences observed between experienced and inexperienced users, of alcohol, marijhuana, and other drugs. First, sensations are often unpleasant but much of the pleasure associated with the use of such drugs comes from cognitive and social factors. Initial users have to learn to label the physical sensations as enjoyable.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Modifying Arousal by Altering Cognitions</h4>
                        <p>If our state of emotional arousal is determined by our cognitive evaluation of the emotion-producing situation, then it should be possible to alter arousal level by changing one's cognitions.</p>
                        <p>Indeed, you can think of instances where initial emotional responses to stimuli change as the situation is reappraised as threatening or benign. You are awakened by the telephone at midnight. Your initial fear reaction aroused by the thought that some catastrophe has happened to a loved one changes to relief as you discover it is a wrong number. A potentially emotion-producing situation has become neutral because of a change in your appraisal of it.</p>

You would include love and hate, joy and sadness, anxiety and calmness, guilt and relief, anger and friendliness, fear and security, elation and depression. There are various classifications of the emotions. There are three basic innate emotions: fear, rage and love. From these, all other emotions are derived through conditioning process. McDougall (1908) listed seven primary emotions: flight-fear, repulsiondisgust, curiosity-wonder, pugnacity-anger, self abasement-subjective, self-assertion-elation and parental care-tenderness. There are complex emotions such as admiration, envy and sentiments (e.g. love, hate, respect). Sentiments are regarded as habitual responses to an object, involving a persistent disposition to respond in a particular way.</p>
                        <p>Emotions are generally measured on the scale with two extremes on either side; it may also be referred as positive pole or negative pole. An illustration of this would be-</p>

                        <p>Verbal descriptions of emotions are at best poor descriptions of complex psychological processes. Is your love for material things, the same sort of intrapsychic experience as your love for your mother or for your country? And when you say, you are "somewhat afraid of lizards", is that merely a weaker form of the fear someone else feels when he says, "I despise those creepycrawly things." We seldom experience emotions in a vacuum. Rather, emotions are tied to specific events, situations, and objects. Thus, it seldom makes much sense to talk about "love" in abstract terms. Rather, we should probably speak of "love of" something, or "the love for" something.</p>
                        <p>Some emotions are not only positive and arousing, they give us a pleasant feeling as well.</p>
                        <p>Other emotions are not only negative and depressing, they are also downright unpleasant. But again, things are not as simple as they seem. Some love makes us happy, whereas others are frustrating and unrewarding. Some hatred is depressing, while others stimulate us to pleasurable accomplishments.</p>
                        <p>Karl Pribram has attempted to explain the concept of "feeling tone". He believes that there are two types of positive affect: gratification and satisfaction. There are also two types of negative affect or feeling tone, which Pribram calls distress and dissatisfaction. You experience "gratification", whenever your needs are satisfied or your physiological drives are reduced. The feelings that accompany this gratification are relief, calmness, and tranquility. "Satisfaction" goes beyond mere calmness, it occurs when you reduce your uncertainty about things. The feelings associated with satisfaction are those of delight, relish, joy, and exhilaration.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Some situations appear to be innately emotion producing. Anger tends to be provoked by restraint against the carrying out of a motivated sequence of behaviour. Fear can be aroused by pain, a loud noise, or sudden loss of support in any young individual. The fear-arousing element seems to be strangeness, and we can postulate that the important factor is the ability to discriminate the new from the familiar.</p>
                        <p>Fear of something strange seems to be largely innate, but maturation and learning may be required as a background. At about eight months, human infants show an intense fear of strangers. No matter how sociable the child has been prior to this time, or how many different people he has been exposed to, the onset of "stranger shyness" is usually abrupt and intense? The most plausible interpretation is that maturation of perceptual abilities has enabled the child to discriminate familiar from strange adults.</p>
                        <p>Emotions may also be associated with new objects or situations by learning. In the classic experiment by Watson, the founder of Behaviourism, a boy named Albert was conditioned to fear, a previously neutral object, a white rat. When eleven-month-old Albert was shown a white rat, he reached for it, evidencing no fear. But every time he touched the rat he was frightened by a loud sound. He soon became afraid of the rat. The originally neutral rat became a "conditioned stimulus" to fear. Albert also showed fear of his mother's fur neckpiece and of other furry objects. Albert's fear generalised to objects that were similar in some respect to the rat but not to toys, such as rubber balls or blocks, that were unlike rat in appearance (Watson and Rayner, 1920).</p>
                        <p>It is probably that some irrational fears are acquired in this relatively automatic way. You would have experienced that children are very fearful of the hospitals because of their association of hospital with injections. Similarly, fear of thunder can be understood because lightning precedes thunder, the child may come to fear the lightning as much as the thunder, although the loud sound of thunder is the primary reason for fright. But most fears are probably learned in a more complex way, some through actual contact with harmful objects, but more through imitation of parental fears.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>How emotions are expressed? Are there individual differences in expression of emotions? The different research finding have pointed out that there are some emotions, which are universally expressed in the similar way, these have been termed as innate emotional expression. There are some emotional expressions, which are influenced by learning, culture and individual style.</p>
                        <h3>Innate Emotional Expression</h3>
                        <p>The basic ways of expressing emotion are innate. Children all over the world cry when hurt or sad, and laugh when happy. Studies of children blind and deaf from birth, indicate that many of the facial expressions, postures, and gestures that we associate with different emotions develop through maturation, they appear at the appropriate age even when there is no opportunity to observe them in others. Certain facial expressions do seem to have a universal meaning regardless of the culture in which the individual is raised, like facial expressions of happiness, anger, sadness, disgust, fear, and surprise.</p>
                        <h3>Role of Learning in Emotional Expression</h3>
                        <p>Although certain emotional expressions may be largely innate, many modifications occur through learning. Anger, for example, may be expressed by fighting, by using abusive language, or by leaving the room. Leaving the room is not an expression of emotion that is known at birth, and certainly the abusive language has to be learned. Certain facial expressions and gestures are taught by one's culture as ways of expression emotion. As you would have observed that laughter is restrained in some cultures.</p>
                        <p>Even gender differences in expression of emotions are seen, females are supposed to suppress expression of emotions. Thus, superimposed upon basic expressions of emotion, which appear to be universal, are conventional or stereotyped forms of expression, which become a kind of 'language of emotion', recognised by others within a culture. Skilled actors are able to convey to their audiences any intended emotion by using facial expressions, tone of voice, and gestures, according to the patterns the audience recognises.</p>
                        <h4>Arousal Level and Effectiveness of Performance</h4>
                        <p>A mild level of emotional arousal tends to produce alertness and interest in the task at hand. When emotions become intense, however, whether they are pleasant or unpleasant, they usually result in some decrement in performance. The curve in Figure 9.1 represents the relation between the level of emotional arousal and the effectiveness of performance. At very low levels of arousal (for example, when one is just waking up), the nervous system may not be functioning fully and sensory messages may not get through. Performance is optimal at moderate levels of arousal. At high levels of arousal, performance begins to decline. Presumably, the central nervous system is so responsive, that it is responding to too many things at once; thus, preventing the appropriate set of responses from dominating. Individuals differ in the extent to which their behaviour is disrupted by emotional arousal. Observations of people during crises, such as fires or sudden floods, suggest that about 15 per cent show organised, effective behaviour. The majority, 70 per cent, shows various degrees of disorganisation but are still able to function with some effectiveness. The remaining 15 per cent are so disorganised that they are unable to function at all. They may race around screaming or exhibit aimless and completely inappropriate behaviour.</p>
                        <p>Emotions, when sufficiently intense, can seriously impair the processes that control organised behaviour.</p>

                        <p>Emotions according to their intensity can be adaptive or disruptive. Here, emotions are related to stress and individual's ability to cope with stresses. Sometimes emotions are not quickly discharged but continue to remain unexpressed or unresolved. Perhaps, the situation that makes one angry (e.g. prolonged conflict with one's employer) or mat makes one fearful (e.g. worry over the chronic illness of a loved one) continues for a long period of time. The state of heightened arousal can take its toll of the individual's ability to function efficiently. Sometimes, continual emotional tension can impair physical health. In a psychophysiological disorder, the symptoms are physical, but the cause is primarily psychological. A number of different types of illness, e.g. ulcers, asthma, migraine headaches, chronic fatigue, high blood pressure and skin eruptions, are related to emotional stress. Long-term emotional stress can impair a person's physical health as well as his mental efficiency.</p>
                        <p>The physiological changes accompanying intense emotions are the basis for use of the polygraph, commonly known as the "lie detector", in checking the reliability of an individual's statements. The polygraph does not detect lies; it simply measures some of the physiological accompaniments of emotion. The measures most frequently recorded are alternations in heart rate, blood pressure, respiration and the galvanic skin response, or GSR (the GSR is a change in the electrical conductivity of the skin).</p>
                        <p>Feelings involve the expenditure of physical, mental, or behavioural energy. Learning to cope with emotions, therefore, requires learning how to handle the stresses and strains of life. Anxiety and phobias are result of intense emotional experience. Apprehension of panic attack or anxiety is related to the James-Lange theory. Even if the autonomic changes are not the cause of the emotional state, awareness of them, acts like a positive feedback to many patients. Another clinical condition of interest in relation to emotions is epilepsy originating in the temporal lobes. The electric discharge in that part of the brain may give rise to a transient state of intense fear.</p>
                        <p>Emotions and the accompanying physiological changes are considered by many to be of great importance in relation to psychosomatic medicine. The psychosocial factors may contribute to the causation of, or affect the course and prognosis of, organic disease.</p>
                        <p>In psychopharmacology, study of emotions has become important, as many factor influence the effect of a drug on behaviour such as dosage, route of administration and the presence of multiple effects. Even the placebo effect is due to the psychological influences arising from the patient's perception of the situation in which the drug is administered.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Emotion is an important aspect of human relationship. Emotions have a psychological aspect related to behaviour and cognition, which influences the physiological aspect of emotion. It is a subjective awareness as happiness or fear, and an objective physiological change like heart rate and expressive motor behaviour.</p>
                        <p>Emotion has been viewed as a biological event. Emotional reactions are controlled by autonomic nervous system, which has two parts: sympathetic nervous system and parasympathetic nervous system. It is the joint action of the two systems, which allows one to respond appropriately. When the individual is in a relaxed state, the parasympathetic nervous system increases its neural activities, while sympathetic nervous system slows down. A homeostatic balance is maintained between over arousal and under arousal. The physiological changes due to strong emotions are associated with arousal hormones produced by adrenal glands, namely, epinephrine and norepinephrine. The release of epinephrine and norepinephrine is under the control of sympathetic nervous system. General Adaptation Syndrome theory advocates that during excessive stress, the body goes through three stages mobilising its resources for an emergency. These three stages are the stage of alarm, the resistance and exhaustion.</p>
                        <p>James-Lange theory of emotion states that the emotions we experience result from our perception of the changes taking place in the body during emotion. However, the CannonBard theory believes that emotional inputs were processed almost simultaneously by two different parts of the brain, the thalamus and the hypothalamus. The emotional feelings were controlled by the thalamus and the hypothalamus controlled bodily responses. Other physiological viewpoints do not agree with Cannon-Bard theory as the individuals with damaged thalamus also experience emotions. Thus, psychologists have given intrapsychic explanations; they view emotions as experiences that involve inner feelings, than physiological reactions. The cognitive-physiological theory of emotion states that the individual's cognitive appraisal of any situation determines the emotional response, including its accompanying physiological changes. Appraisal is influenced by past experience and current availability of strategies for coping with threat. Though emotional reactions are shared by all cultures, but some emotional reactions are also learned through experience. Different research findings have pointed out that there are some emotions, which are universally expressed, these are termed as innate expressed emotion. There are some emotions, which are learned through culture and individual styles. The relationship between the arousal level and the performance determines its effectiveness. Performance is optimal at moderate levels. At low levels, the nervous system may not be fully functioning, and at high levels the performance declines.</p>

A number of different types of illness, e.g. ulcers, asthma, migraine, headaches, chronic fatigue, high blood pressure and skin eruptions, are related to emotional stress. Long-term emotional stress can impair a person's physical health as well as his mental efficiency. Emotions and the accompanying physiological changes are considered by many to be of great importance in relation to psychosomatic medicine.</p>
                        <p>Negative emotions can be quite stressful; learning to cope with emotions requires learning how to handle the stresses and strains of life.</p>
