                        <p><em>Dr Krishan Kant, is taking history of a patient, admitted in surgery ward. The patient has past history of abusing illicit drugs, he is not employed, and his appearance is not good. Presently the patient is having fever and has an infected wound on his right thigh. When this case history is presented, the consultant is surprised that in spite of being a good resident doctor, Dr Kant has neglected to elicit some common details, which were important to diagnose this patient. This incomplete case history was not due to lack of competence, but due to negative attitudes towards patients with substance abuse.</em></p>
                        <p>There is an increasing awareness of the importance of the role that attitudes and ability to communicate play, in the delivery of effective clinical services. It is extremely important for a doctor to be a congenial person who has the sincerity and tact to strike a good relationship with the health care team, his patients and their families. Attitudes related to patient care, taking responsibility and working in a team develop during the training of the medical students. Hence, it is necessary to assess attitudes of students from time-to-time.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>An attitude is a tendency to behave in a preferential manner. It denotes certain constant traits in an individual's ways of feeling and thinking, and his predispositions towards action with regard to another person such as, a patient Attitudes are our expressions of likes and dislikes towards the people and objects. They determine and guide our behaviour in different social situations. One may have noticed that a doctor's behaviour is different while treating an elderly person as compared to an adolescent, or if treating a critically-ill patient. These differences in behaviour are because of his attitudes towards old people and adolescents. Our attitude towards a critical, terminally-ill patient determines how we interact with him or his family members. An attitude has three components:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Cognitive</strong> what a person knows and his belief about the attitude object.</li>
                            <li><strong>Affective</strong> how he feels about the attitude object.</li>
                            <li><strong>Conative</strong> behavioural tendency towards the object, both verbal and nonverbal (Fig. 15.1).</li>
                        </ul>
                        <figure>

                            <figcaption>Fig. 15.1: Components of attitudes</figcaption>
                        </figure>
                        <p>Let us take an example to illustrate these three components of an attitude. Consider the views of an imaginary person named Dr Arvind Verma on the issues of drug addiction. Dr Verma has some beliefs about persons taking illegal drugs, the conditions under which they are taken and the problems these persons can create. All of these beliefs constitute cognitions about drug addiction. Dr Verma also has some feelings about drug addiction. Whenever he comes across such a person, he feels sorry and has sympathy for the family members of the addicted person. What does Dr Verma do to help these persons reflects his behavioural tendencies towards drug addicts. Thus attitudes are more than the mere knowledge of the subject matter. There is feeling associated with it and this determines the action that the person would take in that particular situation.</p>
                        <p>Attitudes are predisposed 'tendencies to respond in a particular way and not a fixed response. These are not innate. The whole personality structure of an individual and his behaviour are constituted by a complex of interlinked attitudes. Attitudes are influenced by a number of factors. Attitudes are preferences towards a wide variety of attitudinal items such as likes or dislikes, anti or pro, positive or negative. Anything that arouses evaluative feelings can be called an object of attitude, e.g. an attitude towards assessment of teachers. A distinction is commonly made between attitude and opinion. An opinion is a belief that one holds about some object in his environment. It differs from attitude, being relatively free of emotion. It lacks the affective component central to attitude.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>In medical, students' attitudes vary according to patient's characteristics, quality of teaching and attitudes of teachers. A significant relationship has been reported between attitudes and the learning material. The choice towards a 'particular medical speciality' plays significant role in determining the ultimate career choice. Attitudes influence the behavioural responses of the individuals. The professional attitude of the doctor is not only concerned with his feelings, beliefs and behaviour towards the patients, but also towards other elements of professional functioning like health care delivery, scientific interest and collaboration with other professionals. Importance of the assessment of attitudes for doctors can be related to the following factors:</p>
                        <p><strong>Patient care:</strong> Any negative attitude towards race, community or disease results in a prejudicial behaviour that affects the patients.</p>
                        <p><strong>Formation of attitudes of peers or juniors:</strong> Senior doctors has a significant impact on the students for the formation of opinions concerning healthrelated issues.</p>
                        <p><strong>Acceptance of new technology:</strong> In the present times, many new innovations in techniques, equipment and methods of health care delivery are taking place. Our attitudes can bias acceptance of new technology and high profile specialities.</p>
                        <p><strong>Interpersonal skills:</strong> Studies have shown that during training of undergraduate students there is a gradual decline in their interpersonal skills. This affects skills of history taking and elicitation of information from the patient.</p>
                        <p><strong>Curriculum planning:</strong> While planning a new curriculum or revising the existing curriculum in educational courses, one needs to identify the attitudes of the students and teachers.</p>
                        <p><strong>Effects of attitudes on meaningful learning and retention:</strong> Attitudinal bias has a differential effect on the learning of controversial things. With a favourable attitude, one is highly motivated to learn, puts greater effort and concentrates better. Negative attitude leads to close-minded view to analyse new material and hence, learning is impaired. Attitude structure exerts an additional facilitating influence on retention that is independent of cognition and motivation.</p>
                        <p><strong>Effect of attitudinal bias on training/learning:</strong> Attitudinal bias often causes loss of objectivity in a clinical setting. This is encountered in situations where either a relative patient is being examined or a patient revealing a history resembling the student's own life. Class or racial differences also impair a student's ability to relate effectively.</p>
                        <p>Marcotte and Held (1978) have suggested a set of responses that reveal attitudinal bias while examining the patients. These are:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Premature closure and dogmatic response</strong>—an early referral is made prior to taking a complete history, a simplistic solution may be provided in the initial contact.</li>
                            <li><strong>Evasion</strong>—student misses the patient's history and directs the conversation under his control.</li>
                            <li><strong>Premature reassurance</strong>—here the student negates the concerns of the patient and reassures the patient without having substantial evidence.</li>
                            <li><strong>Rejection</strong>—student may avoid conflict areas and reject patient's concerns by neglect.</li>
                            <li><strong>Condescension</strong>—Value-laden language is used so as to shame, embarrass or humiliate the patient.</li>
                            <li>Too many technical jargons are used by the student that confuses the patient.</li>
                        </ol>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Attitudes can develop through different modes. Heredity may play only a very small part through differences in the physical characteristics and intelligence. It is mainly the environmental factors that are responsible for development of attitudes. These are through family, peers, conditioning in sociocultural environment (Fig. 15.2).</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_11_10_5e89b0eccc8308b427a9g-151-1.jpg" alt="Flowchart showing the development of attitudes influenced by Family, Peers, and Sociocultural Conditioning." class="content-image">

                        </figure>
                        
                        <h3>Family</h3>
                        <p>Family is the first place for formation of attitudes. Parents begin the information flow that forms beliefs and attitudes about things. Categories are formed in our head on the basis of early information.</p>
                        <p>Sullivan has observed that the information provided by the parents in the earliest stages of life is very difficult to undo. Erroneous and nonadaptive attitudes moulded from parental feedback have tremendous implications for further personality development.</p>
                        <p>As we grow, we tend to be influenced by other sources such as friends and group members. They serve as reference group in the development of attitudes. One identifies oneself with friends and moulds one's attitudes in relation to the prevailing norms of the group concerned.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Peers</h3>
                        <p>Just as we learn from family in the early childhood, later our peer group has a tremendous influence on the development of attitudes. One may form very different or opposing attitudes in the company of friends, e.g. attitudes towards patients with AIDS or addictions, etc.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Conditioning in Sociocultural Environment</h3>
                        <p>There are ample examples in our sociocultural environment, which are responsible for conditioning our attitudes. One such example is words, which have acquired effective meaning.</p>
                        <p>They can create positive or negative attitudes. Many attitudes developed on the basis of classical conditioning are found to be irrational, as they have been paired with an emotion producing unconditioned stimulus either accidentally or in a quite extraneous situation. Similarly the appropriate attitudes can be developed through classical conditioning.</p>
                        <p>An attitudinal response can be learnt through instrumental conditioning by reinforcing a response that occurred in the presence of a discriminated stimulus. Any responses, which have a reinforcing consequence, are learnt more readily than those without reinforcement. Interracial and intercaste attitudes are prevalent in our culture, so if your interaction with persons from other caste is satisfactory, you tend to develop positive attitudes towards persons of that caste.</p>

                        <span class="heading-text">How to Facilitate Development of Attitudes?</span>
                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The problems of ensuring teaching as well as the development of attitudes may be ideally resolved by selection of medical students who will pay attention to humanistic concerns and by recruiting faculty members who can serve as role models for the younger students. However, a more realistic approach would be to build learning opportunities, and to ensure periodical assessment of the same. One needs to organise educational methods that cut across disciplines and provide the right setting for developing attitudes besides imparting knowledge.</p>
                        <p>Teachers motivate and facilitate the development of attitudes in students. Attitudes of senior students and peers also help in shaping those of future students. Though there are no guaranteed methods of teaching attitudes, yet teachers must be aware of all learning experiences that facilitate the development of worthwhile attitudes.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Providing Information</h3>
                        <p>Information can bring changes in attitudes. For example, information about smoking as a cause for cancer and heart diseases is likely to bring about changes in attitudes towards smoking. It may not work in all cases, but it is generally found to be helpful. Information about attitudes may be imparted through lectures, or audiovisual aids, especially, video and films. The attitude of even health professionals towards AIDS patients can be changed dramatically, by effective utilisation of video films and other audiovisual media.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Providing Examples or Models</h3>
                        <p>Most advertising is designed to change attitudes. A common technique is to show an ideal person using a certain product. The advertiser aims to provide a model or an example, which will be followed by the reader. Many students consider their teachers as a role model and often emulate their teacher's behaviour. If the teachers are rude to patients, then their students will tend to do likewise. It is therefore, essential to set good examples for the students.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Providing Experience</h3>
                        <p>Medical training provides a number of experiences, which shape the attitudes of the students. They may see patients with sores that have not been treated and that have become septic and possibly disabling. This direct experience of seeing the patient's suffering will have far more impact on shaping students attitudes than a whole lot of theoretical information about the need for early treatment of sores and superficial wounds.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Discussions</h3>
                        <p>Discussions in small groups are generally thought to be helpful in shaping student's attitudes.</p>
                        <p>Discussion also helps to make the previous three methods more effective. For example, it is helpful for students to describe and discuss the experiences that they have had with their patients. During the discussion, they can share their experiences with other members of the group. Discussions also help to change students' attitudes by the process in which a student gives his opinion and sees the reactions of other students. Discussions are more effective in small groups.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Role-play</h3>
                        <p>Role-playing is an exercise in which the students play roles of suffering patients, doctors, paramedicals, etc. and begin to experience different kind of behavioural attributes. In a role-play, the participants exaggerate a situation or an incidence so that the audience can better appreciate the gravity of the situation. Not only the participants benefit from the role-play, but also the audience who can empathies with the characters of the role-play. The job of the teacher is just to play a theme for the role-play and brief the participants on the theme. A group discussion can be conducted at the end of the role-play to analyse the theme and to identify the 'take home message'.</p>

                        <p>During the development stage if a student has developed certain negative attitudes, which later interfere with his professional competence, then it is desirable for the student to modify the negative attitudes. It is not an easy task to change attitudes, as they are consistent ways of reacting towards object. Attitudes can be changed under different conditions. It is necessary to modify unhealthy or irrational attitudes for learning new things.</p>
                        <p>Attitude change is influenced by both factors that are external as well as internal to the person. One should pay attention/consider the communicator, communication and the audience to bring about a change in attitude (Fig. 15.3).</p>
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li>Source or the communicator should be very effective and highly credible. He should be trustworthy and an expert to produce the change. Communicators, if they are similar to the target audience, their message is well taken, that means the communicator should is be someone from your profession, speciality and should be considered as a role model by you.</li>
                            <li>Content of communication has also been subjected to research. The findings are that communications, which discuss both the pros and cons to the point, are more effective in situations where there is initial resistance to accept. Communications associated with pleasant emotions can also enhance effectiveness.</li>
                            <li>Personality characteristics of the audience have been linked with attitude change. However, self-esteem and intelligence do not play a very important role in changing attitudes. Increased discrepancy between the audience's attitudes from the target's position can help in change of attitudes. Committing the audience to take challenges or do something has proven to be an effective technique for attitude change. General susceptibility or suggestibility of an individual will also determine their tendency to accept/ reject new information.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Similarly role playing, bringing change through smaller steps, distracting the audience are some other methods which have been used to change attitudes.</p>

                        <span class="heading-text">ASSESSMENT OF ATTITUDES</span>
                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>In the studies conducted by the consortium (Verma et al 1993), it has been revealed that some departments discussed attitudes at times while imparting the news of illness to the patients and their families, but no one assessed them. Medical educators assess the acquisition of student's skills but not attitudes. Assessment of attitudes seems to be ignored because of the following reasons:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Attitudes are often vague and ill-defined entities.</li>
                            <li>The teachers frequently differ on what attitudes are really desirable.</li>
                            <li>Our instruments for measuring attitudes are not really good. Hence many teachers consider it inappropriate to use these instruments of poor reliability and validity for the purposes of grading certification.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Measuring an attitude is a difficult task, as it has to be measured in an indirect way. One cannot see the attitude directly; it must be measured from what the individual says or does. Even when one talks about the behavioural component of an attitude, the predisposition to act in a particular way is concerned with the preparation to act rather than with the act itself. Attitudes do refer to internal aspects of behaviour but there are also external manifestations of attitudes, as they are often expressed in actions. What a person does, and the manner in which he or she does it, most directly expresses a person's behavioural tendency. Actions may also express beliefs or feelings, though not so directly as they do the behavioural component. Occasionally, physiological indicators may be used, but even these are only indirect byproducts of the internal arousal associated with an attitude.</p>
                        <p>The most common approach in attitude measurement is to find out how favourable or unfavourable is the individual to an idea. There are different methods of measuring attitudes. Some of these are very simple while others are complex. Broadly, attitudes can be measured by self-report methods, attitude scales and involuntary behaviour methods. Attitude scales are more often used because of their reliability. The commonly used scales are the Likert scale and the Osgood's semantic differential scale.</p>
                        <p>The various instruments in current use for assessment of attitudes are:</p>
                        
                        <h3>Rating Scales</h3>
                        <p>A series of statements concerning attitudes being measured are made, and the answer is expected on a 3-7 point scale. The most commonly used scales are Likert scale which ask the rater to rate the attribute on a five point scale viz. strongly agree/agree/undecided/disagree/strongly disagree. Osgood's semantic differential scale is another commonly used scale.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Likert scale</h4>
                        <p>In Likert scale, an attitudinal object is assessed on a five point scale ranging from extremely positive to extremely negative. It forms a continuum extending between two extremes of a scale. Each pole of the scale is represented by the attitude intended to be assessed. The scores are given from 5 to 1. Some of the examples of this type of scale are given below:</p>

                        (A: strongly agree, B: agree, C: cannot decide, D : disagree, E : strongly disagree).</p>
                        <p>Knowledge of behavioural sciences helps in understanding psychosocial aspects of illness<br>
                        (Strongly agree, Agree, Neutral, Disagree, Strongly disagree)</p>
                        <p>Each patient needs an different way of communication to explain his problems.<br>
                        (Strongly agree, Agree, Neutral, Disagree, Strongly disagree)</p>
                        <p>Monchy et al (1988) had developed a scale to measure professional attitudes of students on doctor-patient relationship. Some of its items are as follows:</p>
                        <p><em>The emotions of the doctor should agree ideally never play a role in his dealings with patients.</em></p>
                        <p><em>Only a small number of patients are able to understand complex health problems.</em></p>
                        
                        <h4>Osgood scale</h4>
                        <p>In Osgood's scale, two opposite adjectives are given with gradations. Following are some examples of this scale:</p>
                        <p>Behavioural Sciences course in medical curriculum is:</p>
                        <p>Useful ------------------------------ Not useful.</p>
                        <p>Informative ------------------ Not informative.</p>
                        <p>Interesting -------------------- Uninteresting.</p>
                        <p>Relevant ---------------------------------- Irrelevant.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Observational Rating Scales</h3>
                        <p>In clinical settings, the students' attitudes can often be assessed through observational rating scales. This requires repeated and standardised direct observation of student's behaviour (activity) over a long period and in natural professional situations such as in the ward with older patients, outpatient clinic or in primary health centre. Attitudes are assessed on a standardised rating scale. If the rating is not done carefully it can lead to various errors in the measurement. One example of this type is as follows.</p>
                        <p>If a student is being observed when he is examining a patient, and an evaluation is needed of how he gains the patient's confidence, the following rating scale may be used:</p>
                        <p>The student has:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Seems to be quite unaware of the problem</li>
                            <li>Made an effort, without following it up</li>
                            <li>Made an effort, and has followed it up</li>
                            <li>Taken the necessary precautions and has reassured the patient several times</li>
                            <li>Taken all the necessary precautions, and the patient appears completely relaxed</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Though assessment of attitudes is a difficult task it is worth taking the trouble, as it would ensure positive development of attitudes in medical students. This can be integrated with assessment of skills and knowledge.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Indirect Methods</h3>
                        <p>One of the methods is based on the principle that people remember better the things that they consider to be important. A group of student might be shown a filmed interview with a patient followed by a series of multiple choice questions, some of them relating to biomedical aspects and others to the social aspects of the case. The answers to questions relating to social aspects would indicate the attitudes of the candidate.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Construction of an attitude scale</h4>
                        <p>One often faces difficulties in deciding what aspect of an attitude is to be measured. We cannot measure everything at one time, so we must choose precisely what we wish to measure or examine. Often attitude scale needs to be constructed for a particular aspect that one wishes to measure. Following are the steps in construction of an attitude scale:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Specify attitude variable that is to be measured.</li>
                            <li>Collect wide variety of statements.</li>
                            <li>Edit the statements.</li>
                            <li>Sort out the statements into (an imaginary) scale.</li>
                            <li>Calculate the scale value.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Writing of the statements is difficult yet most important aspect of constructing an attitude scale. Some of the guidelines for writing the statements are given in the box.</p>
                        <aside class="callout note" role="note">
                            <h4 class="callout-title">Guidelines for Writing Statements</h4>
                            <ol>
                                <li>The statements should be brief.</li>
                                <li>Each statement should convey one complete thought.</li>
                                <li>The statement should belong to the attitude variable that is to be measured.</li>
                                <li>Care should be taken on language:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>use simple sentences</li>
                                        <li>avoid double negatives</li>

                                        <li>avoid words with more than one meaning.</li>

                                <li>The statements should cover the entire range of the effective scale of interest.</li>
                                <li>Statements should be such that they can be endorsed or rejected (agreed/disagreed).</li>
                                <li>Acceptance and rejection should indicate something about the attitude measured.</li>
                            </ol>
                        </aside>
                        <p><strong>Reliability and validity:</strong> Since most of the time, attitude scales are constructed for the specific aspect of behaviour, one should do item validation of the statements and estimate reliability and content and construct validity of the scale using standard procedures, such as test retest method, split half method, etc.</p>

                        <p>An attitude is a tendency to behave in a preferential manner. It denotes certain traits in an individual's ways of feeling and thinking, and his predispositions towards action with regard to another person such as a patient. Attitudes are our expressions of like and dislikes towards the people and objects. They determine and guide our behaviour in different social situations.</p>
                        <p>An attitude has three components, Cognitive—What a person knows and his belief about the attitude object, Affective—How he feels about the attitude object and Conative—Behavioural tendency towards the object, both verbal and nonverbal.</p>
                        <p>Attitude development in itself is a long process. The formation occurs on three different modes. The family, peers and the conditioning processes both operant and instrumental provide explanation for formation of rational and irrational attitudes. Balance theory tries to explain how attitudes change to create a balanced structure. However, if a imbalance exists, there is a tendency to move towards this balance.</p>
                        <p>Once we understand our attitudes we work in the direction of change especially modifying irrational and unhealthy attitudes. Attitude change is influenced by both internal and external factors. It involves a communicator, the quality of communication, the content of the message and the receiver's personality. For facilitation of development of new attitudes in such clinical settings we need to provide more information, a model, have more discussions, look into experiences of medical students and exact patient-doctor role plays. A list of essential and primary attitudes expected from medical students has been given at the end of the chapter. Thereby correct attitudes would bring in satisfaction of needs bringing in satisfaction of work.</p>
