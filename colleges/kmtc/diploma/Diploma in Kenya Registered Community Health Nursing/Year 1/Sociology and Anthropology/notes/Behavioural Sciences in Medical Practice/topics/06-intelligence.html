                        <p><em>Ramesh had recently celebrated his fifth birthday. His joyous parents got him admitted in a public school. Ramesh enthusiastically started going to the school. He had made one friend in his class. Gradually, Ramesh's mother got complaints from the teachers that he was NOT able to cope up with the task in the class, which other children were doing quite well. His parents started teaching the child at home, and also arranged an extra tuition class for him after the school hours. Yet Ramesh was either making too many spelling mistakes, or was not able to memorise, his handwriting was also very poor. Ramesh was no longer keen to go to the school. Ramesh's parents were advised to get his intelligence assessed. On standardised intelligence test Ramesh got a score of 70, borderline intelligence. He was advised admission in a special school for slow learners. Ramesh's parents could not judge his intelligence because it cannot be observed like height or weight, it can only be inferred from behaviour.</em></p>
                        <p>Intelligence as a concept is used very commonly in our day-to-day life. We often make comments that this person seems to be very intelligent or seems to be dull. But what is this intelligence? Different people would give different meaning to intelligence. Similarly psychologists have attributed a variety of factors to the concept of intelligence.</p>

                        <p>Most commonly accepted view is that intelligence is a general capacity for comprehension and reasoning that manifests itself in various ways. The most widely accepted definition is, "Intelligence is the global capacity of an individual to act purposefully, to think rationally and to deal effectively with his environment" (Weschler 1944). It includes the power of adaptation of an individual to his milieu, his ability to learn and for abstract thinking.</p>
                        <h3>Difference between Intelligence and Aptitude</h3>
                        <p>A distinction has to be made between intelligence and aptitude. Intelligence is the capacity or the potentiality that a person has, whereas aptitude is a combination of characteristics indicative of an individual's capacity to acquire some specific knowledge, or skill. Aptitude means an individual's aptitude for a given type of activity, the capacity to acquire proficiency under appropriate conditions.</p>

                        <h3>Two Factor Theory</h3>
                        <p>Charles Spearman (1927) proposed that individuals possess general intelligence factor (G) in varying amounts (degree). This determines the individual's overall ability. In addition to G, individuals also possess specific abilities, (S) G is universal inborn ability, and it is general mental energy. The amount of 'G' differs from individual-to-individual. Higher the 'G' in an individual, higher is the success in life. 'S' is learned and acquired in the environment, it varies from activity-to-activity even in the same individual: the individuals themselves differ in the amount of 'S' ability (Fig. 6.1).</p>

                        <p>Two individuals in a class may be comparable on their G factor, yet one may be very good with numbers while the other possesses higher musical ability.</p>

                        <h3>Multifactor Theories</h3>
                        <p>a. Thurstone (1936) felt that intelligence could be broken down into a number of primary mental abilities. He had derived 7 primary mental abilities on the basis of factor analyses. These abilities, as shown in the Table 6.1 are represented in items in test construction.</p>

                        <p>b. Guilford has broadened the concept of intelligence. According to him there are two types of thinking: (a) convergent thinking—solving a problem that has a defined correct answer and (b) divergent thinking—arriving at many possible solutions to a problem. This is predominantly creative thinking. He had proposed a three dimensional theory represented in a cubical model shown in Figure 6.2. Guilford maintained that intelligence test items should distinguish in terms of the operations performed upon the content and the product that results. This model provides for 120 factors of intelligence, which is a combination yield of 4 contents, 5 operations and 6 products. Assume that a subject is asked to rearrange jumble of words, e.g. CEIV, NERTE, to form a familiar words (VICE, ENTER). The content is symbolic; since the test involves a set of letter symbols; the operation is 'cognition' because it requires recognition of information and the product unit is a word.</p>

                        <h3>Process Oriented Theories</h3>
                        <p>These theories have focussed on intellectual processes-the pattern of thinking that people use when they reason and solve problems. These theorists prefer to use the term cognitive processes in place of intelligence. They are often more interested in how people solve problems and how many get the right solution. They have focussed on the development of cognitive abilities. Piaget's work is a significant contribution in this area (see Chapter 12). He viewed intelligence as an adaptive process that involves interplay of biological maturation and interaction with environment.</p>

                        </figure>

                        <h3>Information Processing Theories</h3>
                        <p>These theories break intelligence down into various basic skills that people employ to take in information, process it, and then use it to reason and solve problems. These basic skills may be simple or complex. Robert Sternberg (1984), distinguishes between information processing "components" and "metacomponents". Components are the steps to solve a problem and metacomponents are the basics of knowledge that one has to know to solve the problem. The information processing theory has often been compared with computers in which attention and memory have been designated as the intellectual hardware whereas the action schemes (Piagetian notion) are similar to specific, repeatable intellectual sequences, and executive schemes, similar to plans and strategies. The neo Piagetians are of the opinion that people's software becomes more sophisticated as they mature, with their schemes expanding in complexity and their amount of available mental energy increasing. Such changes in their view, promote the growth of intelligence. Other approaches focus on the rules involved in intelligent behaviour or the skills required for various tasks.</p>
                        <p>Hebb (1966) has distinguished two meanings of intelligence on neurological basis. Intelligence A is the innate potential based on the developmental process. This type of intelligence is dependent upon 'the possession of a good brain and a good neural metabolism'. Intelligence B involves the functioning of the brain, and is observable indirectly from the individual's behaviour. Intelligence A is not observable and cannot be measured, whereas intelligence B is measured through tests.</p>
                        <p>Cattell (1971) on the basis of factor analysis, has divided general factor of intelligence (G) into two parts-fluid intelligence (GF) and crystallised intelligence (GC). The former being innate, biologically or genetically determined and the latter is acquired based on cultural and educational experience. Fluid intelligence is related to ability to solve problems, thus is assessed on intelligence test like block design test on progressive matrices. Crystallised knowledge thus is measured on tests of information, arithmetic and vocabulary.</p>
                        <p>Eysenck (1973) distinguishes between speed and power components of intelligence. Speed is measured by the time required to complete the task and power is measured through test of reasoning.</p>
                        <p>Jensen (1980) splits intelligence into two levels. Associative ability being the capacity to learn, remember and recall information. It represents the lower level of continuum. Cognitive ability is concerned with reasoning and is located at the higher level. Cognitive ability depends upon associated ability but not vice versa.</p>
                        <p>Earl Hunt (1983) proposed that individual differences in intelligence are due to the different processes people use in solving problems. Hunt identifies these ways of cognitive processes that makes difference in people. These are: (1) way to internally represent a problem, (2) strategies for manipulating mental representation and (3) abilities necessary to execute basic information processing steps, according to the strategy requirement.</p>
                        <p>Howard Gardner (1983) has proposed seven types of intelligence, each one of those is important. The seven intelligences identified by Gardner are-</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Linguistic ability</li>
                            <li>Logical-mathematical ability</li>
                            <li>Spatial ability (navigating in space, using mental images)</li>
                            <li>Musical ability</li>
                            <li>Bodily-kinesthetic ability</li>
                            <li>Interpersonal ability (understanding others)</li>
                            <li>Intrapersonal ability (understanding oneself).</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Robert Sternberg (1986) has suggested triarchic (three points of origin) components in intelligence-in this knowledge acquisition, performance and metacognition is for learning new facts, for problem solving strategies and techniques for selecting a strategy and monitoring process towards success. According to Sternberg individuals can improve their experimental, contextual intelligence and componential intelligence by practice and effort.</p>

                        <h3>Emotional Intelligence (EI)</h3>
                        <p>Emotional intelligence refers to the way we handle the each other and ourselves. Peter Salovey and John Mayer (1990) coined the term emotional intelligence. Later Daniel Goleman (1995) did extensive work on the concept of emotional intelligence. Though personal intelligence is important for academic abilities yet emotional intelligence contributes towards a balanced personality. Emotional intelligence helps 'to be angry with a right person, to the right degree, at the right time, for the right purpose and in the right way' (Aristotle). The competencies of the emotional intelligence are crucial for success in work and in interpersonal relationships. It trains people to manage emotions and develop to skills to handle relationships. The five domains of emotional intelligence are-</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Knowing one's emotions</li>
                            <li>Managing emotions</li>
                            <li>Motivating oneself</li>
                            <li>Recognising emotions in others</li>
                            <li>Handling relationships.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>It is feasible to enhance emotional intelligence through training. Currently attempts are being made to include training in emotional intelligence in the school curriculum.</p>

                        <p>IQ is a commonly used term, which was first suggested by Stern and Kuplmann in 1912. On individuals, Intelligence quotient is expressed as a ratio of mental age (MA) to the chronological age (CA).</p>
                        <p>$$\mathrm{IQ}=\frac{\mathrm{MA}}{\mathrm{CA}} \times 100$$</p>
                        <p>The ratio is multiplied by 100 to remove the decimal. If the child has an average mental age, then a correlation of his mental age (MA) and the chronological age (CA) will form a straight line. In case the individual's mental age (MA) is higher than the chronological age (CA) then the curve will be different as shown in Figure 6.3.</p>
                        <p>An individual with an average intelligence has an IQ of 100. If the mental development falls behind the individual will have an IQ less than 100 and if the rate of development is faster the individual will have an IQ more than 100. If two children six and eight years old obtain a MA of seven years on an intelligence test then the younger child has a higher intellect.</p>

                        <h3>Growth of Intelligence</h3>
                        <p>Generally the growth of intelligence is rapid during early childhood and then slows down in teens (Fig. 6.4). Longitudinal studies using Wechsler's tests have shown that mental ability increases upto the age of twenty-six, after which it levels off and remains unchanged till late thirties. There is a gradual decrease in the intellectual ability after forty with a sharp decline after sixty. But it must be noted that decline in ability depends both on the person and the type of ability tested. Individuals engaged in active stimulating working environments with good physical health show little decrease in intellectual ability upto age seventy. Physical disabilities, particularly those resulting from strokes or progressive reduction of blood circulation to the brain usually result in a significant decrease in intellectual ability.</p>
                        <p>Mental abilities that require speed and shortterm memory decline earlier than general knowledge. The rate of decline of specific abilities is related to one's occupation, like people in literary work or professionals do not decline in mental ability as early as others. Experience and accumulated knowledge compensates for diminished speed in old age.</p>

                        <h3>Stability of Intelligence</h3>
                        <p>The stability of intelligence or IQ has received a great deal of attention from the educational psychologists because of its usefulness in education. There are two opinions. One holds that the IQ remains relatively stable over the years changing only very slowly. Another opinion is that if determined effort is made, a change in IQ can be obtained. There is a considerable evidence to indicate that stability in IQ is not absolute but only a small range of scores would change.</p>
                        <p>An extensive body of data accumulated, shows that intelligence test performance is quite stable. Studies have reported high correlations ranging from .72 to .83 on retest of intelligence scales. Bradway, Thompon and Cravens conducted a follow up on children originally tested between the age of 2 and 5.5 years as part of the 1937 Stanford Binet standardisation sample. Initial IQs correlated .65 with 10 years retests and .59 with 25 years retests. The correlation between 10-year retest mean age 14 years and mean age 29 years ( 25 year retest) was .85 . If the initial assessment is done in late childhood or after that then the correlations are found to be very high. The instability of IQ may occur as a result of drastic environmental changes. It can increase with stimulation and training but can decrease due to prolonged or severe illness, head injury, brain damage, high fevers, epilepsy, meningitis and adverse environmental factors like conflict at home, death of parent, malnutrition. Instability of scores could also be due to fast or slow development of the child than that of the normative sample population. Generally children in continually disadvantaged environments tend to lose and those in stimulating environments gain in IQ with age. The relationship between IQ, educational attainment, and later occupational achievement is positive. Many highly intelligent people perform disappointingly, while many with average IQ may do remarkably well. This is because factors other than intelligence, such as drive, persistence, attention, useful social contacts, and highly-developed social skills, are of major importance in the achievement in later life.</p>

                        <p>The question of relative importance of 'nature' and 'nurture' as a determinant of intelligence has been controversial. The role of genetics or heritability and environment has been extensively studied. Their comparative roles in determining intelligence are as follows:</p>
                        
                        <h3>Heredity</h3>
                        <p>Evidence pointing to the influence of heredity on intelligence comes mainly from family and the twin studies. A heritability index shows the proportional contribution of genetic or heredity factors of a particular trait in a given population under existing conditions. A frequent procedure to compute heritability index is to utilise intelligence test correlations of monozygotic (identical) and dizygotic (fraternal) twins. Correlations between monozygotic twins reared together and between monozygotic twins reared apart in the foster homes, have also been used. Table 6.3 summarises the results of a large number of studies (Bouchard et al 1990), indicating that closer the genetic relationship, the more similar is the tested intelligence.</p>

                        <p>Heritability estimates for intelligence have ranged from .40 to .86 . The lower estimate is based on the assumption that a sizeable portion of variation in IQ scores can be attributed to a genetic environmental covariation. Parents can influence their offspring both by direct genetic transmission and by the kind of environment they provide.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Environment</h3>
                        <p>Even though intelligence has a significant genetic component, environmental conditions can also be crucially important. The influence of the environment begins from the moment of conception. The development of the foetus, especially at critical times, may be affected by various physical factors including mother's diet, smoking, disease such as rubella and certain drugs. Subsequent environment especially during childhood, socioeconomic status, nutrition, health and educational influences of the family are very important determinants of IQ.</p>
                        <p>It has been recognised that children from lower social class families generally perform less well on intelligence tests than those from higher social classes. Studies of family influences suggest that greater parental attention received by children of smaller families and the first-born may result in higher scores. The use of media and the educational toys provide the right environment for intellectual stimulation. Similarly urban and rural set up, type of school attended lead to differential stimulation and type of experience which in turn affects the intelligence scores. Effect of education not only influences the test scores, but teacher's expectation may speed up or slow down the development of individual child.</p>
                        <p>One of the most convincing evidence for the influence of the environment comes from successful attempts, through intensive stimulation and education, to improve the IQs in high-risk children and mentally handicapped. Similarly IQ scores have been found to increase, when children are transferred from poor institutions to good foster homes.</p>
                        <p>To sum up, both heredity and environment play an important role in determining intelligence. These can be compared to land and seeds used to grow crop. Seed is like heredity and the land is like environment. If the land is not fertile, then even with good seed one cannot have a good crop. Similarly with a fertile land if poor quality seeds are used, the crop will not achieve good results. Thus just as for good crop, both fertile land and good quality seeds are required, similarly both heredity and stimulating environments are required for higher intelligence.</p>

                        <h3>Mental Subnormality</h3>
                        <p>Mental subnormality refers to subaverage general intellectual functioning, which originates in the developmental period and is associated with impairment in adaptive behaviour. A person is regarded as mentally subnormal if: (i) the IQ attained is below 70 on standard psychological tests of intelligence; (ii) their adaptive skills are inadequate to cope up with the daily routines. Adaptation skills are those behaviours by which an individual makes adjustments and independent living in the society. In childhood these are the self help activities such as eating and dressing independently. Later on the adaptive behaviours are concerned with basic academic skills, coping skills such as telling time, using money and assuming social responsibilities. Slowness in intellectual development may be widespread and affect all aspects of cognition. Only rarely will a child's functioning be retarded to the same degree over the entire range of skills, but where such skills are significantly impaired, it is reasonable to think of the child as showing general mental subnormality.</p>
                        <p>In our country the problem of mental subnormality is quite significant. The studies have shown an incidence of 4-5 per 1000 individuals. Mental subnormality is categorised in four levels-mild, moderate, severe and profound. Table 6.4 gives the characteristics of each of these levels.</p>
                        <p><strong>Clinical features:</strong> Mental subnormality may first be identified by delay in their motor milestones in the first few months of life. The child will be slow to obtain head control, sit unsupported. Large number of moderately retarded children however, shows normal motor development and present for the first time with language delay. The child may be thought to be deaf because he fails to take notice of sounds or shows lack of single words or word combinations at the appropriate age. Mildly retarded children may not be detected until they enter school when failure of educational progress may be found to be due to a general slowness of development rather than to a specific learning disability. Usually however, it will be found that the early development of the mildly retarded especially their early language development has been slow. Occasionally mental retardation arises as a result of some postnatal event, such as a head injury or cerebral infection. In these cases the time course of the condition will, of course be different.</p>
                        <p>Once diagnosed, the clinical features of children with mental retardation will depend more especially on:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>The severity of the condition</li>
                            <li>The presence of associated physical and psychiatric conditions</li>
                            <li>The quality of care and education the child receives.</li>

                        <p><strong>Management:</strong> Management should begin with an explanation to the parents of the diagnosis, its probable cause, the way in which the child can be helped, and the likely outcome. It is important to reassure parents that their behaviour has not produced the condition, though this does not mean that, in the future, there is not much they can do to help the child.</p>

                        <p>Retarded children take longer to learn new material and once they have learned something new, they usually forget more easily than the normal. Consequently they need more help, and more systematic help from parents, teachers, and other in the acquisition of skills. In particular, they often fail to learn by observation, and therefore, need more structured teaching. The help needs to be provided at an appropriate level for the child. It is useless to try and teach skills too far ahead of the child present mental age. Parents play an important role in training these children (also see Chapter 20).</p>
                        <p>In the preschool period the main role for professionals such as clinical psychologist, special educators, speech therapists, etc. is in helping parents to find ways to stimulate their child's development.</p>
                        
                        <h3>The Mentally Gifted</h3>
                        <p>In distribution of intelligence, the right extreme of the bell-shaped curve represents the gifted or the genius (Fig. 6.5). These are the individuals with IQs of 140 or higher. About one out of every 100 children has an IQ of 140-160. Less than one out of every 1000 has an IQ above 160. In the early childhood, a gifted child is generally found to be misfit in his class because the level of teaching in a normal classroom is for an average child, whereas the gifted child is able to comprehend much faster. As a consequence, they often indulge in behavioural irregularities. They have been found to be gross under achievers and extremely unhappy. One problem seems to be that such extremely bright children find themselves intellectually misfit with children of their own age, and physically misfit with the older people who are their intellectual equals. But things improve by adulthood and they appear to be happier and better adjusted than most others of their age. These days there are separate schools for the gifted children. With the right type of training their superior potential is channelised in constructive tasks.</p>

                        <p>Assessment (see Chapter 18) and understanding of intellectual functions is helpful in your clinical work as with this knowledge, you can diagnose a patient with mental subnormality or with very superior intelligence. Assessment of intelligence is discussed in detail in Chapter 18. Your explanations or guidance to the patient would be according to his intellectual level. In some diseases like neuropsychiatric disorders, epilepsy, and psychiatric disorders and in some of the endocrinological disorders, assessment of intelligence is of great assistance in their management. Physical and/or mental ill health may temporarily impair intellectual performance. Distressing physical symptoms may obviously interfere with mental concentration, while great anxiety, deep depression or the thought disorder of schizophrenia may make it extremely difficult for a patient to respond adequately to test material.</p>
                        <p>The influence of motivation may be quite profound on performance on intelligence test. If the individual sees no relevance of the intelligence testing to his current situation or problems he may make little attempt to cooperate with the tasks involved, and may then achieve a much lower score than would have been the case if he had been more highly motivated.</p>
                        <p>It is generally organic disease affecting the functioning of the brain that is likely to impair intellectual performance; so that it is in the field of neuropsychiatry particularly that intelligence testing may be of greatest assistance. Not only may there be evidence of a general falling off in intellectual functioning compared with an actual previous measurement, or an estimate based on past educational or occupational history, but more specific cognitive impairments may indicate lesions of particular parts of the brain.</p>
                        <p>The assessment of an individual's intellectual abilities can be of value in other clinical situations where psychological problems may be arising in an educational or vocational context.</p>
                        <p>Knowledge of intellectual functioning is also useful for yourself as a student and later as a teacher. Teaching method, content of the subject matter and expectations from students should be based on student's intellectual functioning.</p>

                        <p>Intelligence is not a unitary concept, it is a global capacity of an individual to act purposefully, comprehend and think rationally. Various theories have been put forth to understand the nature of intelligence. Different theories have explained nature of intelligence. According to Spearman, intelligence has two factors, general and specific factors, the multifactor theories of Thurstone, provides seven primary abilities. Guilford has classified structure of intelligence in products, contents and operations; their combination produces 120 factors of intelligence, Guilford has also made distinction between convergent and divergent intelligence. Cattell has classified intelligence as fluid and crystallised intelligence acknowledging role of heredity and environment. Gardner has advocated seven types of intelligence. According to Sternberg, individuals can improve their experimental, contextual intelligence and componential intelligence by practice and effort.</p>
                        <p>Emotional intelligence is a term used for ability to control emotions and ability to handle interpersonal relationship. EI is considered important for success in later life. Scores are more or less stable, as the test scores of the early years have been found to correlate highly with the scores obtained in late adolescence. Heredity and environment both play an important role in determining the intelligence.</p>
                        <p>Intelligence can be assessed through verbal or performance test. Intelligence quotient is the ratio between mental age and chronological age. Average IQ scores range from 90 to 110 (obtained on standard tests of intelligence). Those having an IQ below 70 are considered as mentally subnormal, while those with an IQ above 160 are considered as mentally gifted. Knowledge of intellectual functioning and its assessment, is of a great importance in clinical practice, especially in neuropsychiatry, psychiatry, endocrinology and paediatrics.</p>
