                        <p>Hans Selye (1974), the pioneer in stress research, defined stress as a stimulus event of sufficient severity to produce disequilibrium in the homeostatic physiological systems. We feel stress when our responses to even disrupt or threaten to disrupt our physical or psychological functioning. Positive stresses called 'Eustress', like shifting to a new house, promotion in job. When stress has negative effect on the individual, it is distress, for example, failure in examination, chronic illness, break-up with loved ones. The stimulus that evokes a stress response is called a stressor. A stimulus becomes a stressor by virtue of the cognitive interpretation or meaning that the individual assigns to the stimulus or by virtue of the fact that the stimulus affects the individual by way of same sensory or metabolic process, which is in itself inherently stressful. In physiological terms stress is the body's response to any stressful demand. Lazarus defined it in psychological terms as an Individual's cognitive judgement that his or her personal resources will be taxed or incapable of dealing with the demands posed by a particular event. According to Reuben Hill a stressor event is one that makes demands on the family system, rather than on the individual.</p>

                        <p>Stress comprises of stressor, the sources causing the stress and stress response, which is how the individual copes with the stressful situation, his coping resources like person's skills and social support systems (Fig. 10.1).</p>

                        <p>Stressor represents stimulus events requiring some form of adaptation or adjustment. Stressor can be internal stimuli like cognitions or thoughts or external stimuli like crowd, noise, and interpersonal difficulties. The stressed person shows several stages: (i) Stage of alarm, (ii) Stage of appraisal, and (iii) Stage of reaching for a coping strategy.</p>
                        <p>The stress response is a complex reaction pattern that consists of physiological, cognitive and behavioural components. The physiological component of the stress response activates the sympathetic and parasympathetic autonomic nervous system and elicits a set of physiological reactions. The stress response has three components namely the tonic-the resting or basal level of activity, the phasic-the reaction to the given stressor and recovery-return to the tonic level.</p>
                        <p>Sylve had described a three-stage reaction to stress consisting of alarm, resistance and exhaustion known as general adaption syndrome (GAS). The three stages are as following:</p>
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li>Alarm reaction, subdivided in two phases, shock and counter-shock. Shock phase is initial and immediate response. Counter shock is how the body rebounds to mobilise its defenses.</li>
                            <li>Stage of resistance: This is adaptation where you try to fight back.</li>
                            <li>Stage of exhaustion: This is extreme fatigue one feels after fighting against stress.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>As an example imagine you are in a building, which has caught fire. The place is full of people and there is only one exit door. Your first reaction would be of shock. For some time you are numb, but in no time you try to size up the situation. According to the second stage of resistance, you look for an alternative way to get out; you break open the window glass, jump into the balcony and finally get out of the building. In the process of getting out you may also help others to escape from fire. Finally when you are out from this stressful situation then there is extreme exhaustion and fatigue.</p>
                        <p>The first two phases of GAS prepare one's body to respond to stress in one of the two ways-either attacking the threatening force (fight) or escaping to safety (flight). These physiological responses result from the action of the adrenal gland which has been stimulated to increase the body's production of adrenalin hormone that gives body the required energy needed to adapt to the demands of the stressor.</p>
                        <p>The cognitive components of stress response represents the conscious appraisal of the stimulus, the individual's evaluation or perception of the situation. This also includes mood state, ranging from elation to tension, depression, difficulty in concentration and fatigue. Coping styles are also an example of cognitive coping. The behavioural component represents overt behavioural response to the stressor. Behaviour can range from withdrawal to aggression, and violence. Facial expressions also indicate behavioural reactions. Frequent outbursts of anger, competitiveness and sexual dysfunctions are manifestation of stress response.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Stress is not only desirable but also essential to life. A certain amount of stress is essential for normal health. Stresses can be positive or negative. The positive stress is called 'eustress', and the negative stress is termed as 'distress' (Selye 1974). Some events are associated with positive emotions, while others are associated with negative emotions, which in turn determine the quality of the stress experiences. We usually think of negative events or situations as the causes of stress. Some positive changes like constructing a house, a new job, promotion, marriage or becoming a parent may be stressful due to increased pressure and responsibilities. As these are associated with positive feelings like excitement, happiness, love and joy, they increase our resistance to stress. On the other hand, negative situations such as death of the spouse, parents illness, interpersonal problems, difficulty at the place of work, financial losses, etc. are all associated with negative feelings such as sadness, dissatisfaction, conflict, irritation and confusion. These feelings lower our resistance to stress and make us more vulnerable to mental disturbances and diseases. The negative aspects of stress can produce harmful effects on the body especially if they are continuing for a long time. Stress produces tension and exerts a great pressure on the body systems. It is like the body being in a state of constant preparedness to meet a challenge. This tension disturbs the mental and the physical health. Stress can also prevent healthy and smooth functioning of different organs of the body and accelerates the aging process.</p>
                        <h3>Stressful Life Events</h3>
                        <p>Research suggests that experiencing an excessive number of 'life events' in a particular period of time can lead to increased ill-health. Holmes and Rahe (1967) have indicated the relation of life events to our health. These events are normal events that occur in everyone's life over a lifetime-birth, death, marriage, divorce, new job, retirement, moving house or going for a holiday. The important factor is how often you experience these changes, whether they occur together at the same time or in a short span of time and whether they are positive or negative. The greater the amount of social readjustment required, greater the likelihood of developing an illness. Paykel showed that loss events such as loss of job or death are more likely to be associated with illness than gain events such as new addition in the family or buying a new house. The variety of illnesses that have been linked with life events range from heart disease, cancer and depression to the less life-threatening common cold or migraine.</p>
                        <h3>Daily Hassles</h3>
                        <p>Major life events are rare occurrences for most of us. One does not generally get married more than once or have more than two or three children, or change jobs frequently. Usually most of us are able to cope with these events quite effectively without being under too much pressure.</p>
                        <p>What could actually be more stressful are the small daily hassles or events which appear trivial, like standing in long bus queues, getting stuck in a traffic jam, arguments and fights with an uncooperative colleague at work, tension between family members or a very sick, aging parent. These daily tensions can produce a cumulative effect and may result in your having a breakdown one day.</p>
                        <p>Chronic stress from such daily hassles or stressors can cause physiological damage and also lead to the development of certain psychosomatic illnesses such as arthritis, irritable bowel syndrome, bronchial asthma, hypertension, migraine and other chronic illness.</p>
                        <h3>Stressful Life Events in Children</h3>
                        <p>Children also experience stress and they have different stressful events than those of adults. An excess of life events was noted in adolescents attending outpatient clinics with recurrent abdominal pain (Green et al 1985). Children tend to report pain that is associated with tension and worry about specific situations-usually academic tests or new situations. Vulnerable children who develop psychiatric symptoms, especially those having psychogenic pains, demonstrate a direct association of a traumatic loss and illness event (Mehta et al 1993).</p>
                        <p>Singh et al (1994) studied the relationship between stressful family life events and somatic complaints in 77 school children, and found a significant association between life event and somatic complaints, these increasing in almost direct proportion to the number of stressful family life events. Occurrence of symptoms was more in girls. The most frequent stressful life events were financial problems, moving house, death of a relative, chronic illness in the family and frequent change in job of parents.</p>
                        <p>Robinson et al (1988) studied adolescents with functional somatic complaints (chest pain, recurrent abdominal pain, limb pain, and hyperventilation syndrome). Patients reported significantly more negative life events, a lower self-esteem, more psychophysiological symptoms and a lower self-evaluation than controls. They suggested that functional somatic complaints in adolescents might be associated with poor psychosocial adjustment and reaction to negative life events.</p>
                        <p>Maloney (1980) stressed that grief reaction is often an important precipitant of symptoms. Pantel and Goddman (1972) studied 100 adolescents with recurrent chest pain. 31 per cent subjects reported occurrence of significant negative life events within 6 months of onset of pain.</p>
                        <p>Scharrer, Ryan-Wenger and Nancy (1991) found that children with RAP had higher mean stress under the parameters of frequency, severity and total stress. Stresses included parental arguments, not spending enough time with parents and falling sick. Mean scores for coping efficacy and total coping were higher in non RAP group.</p>
                        <p>Rangaswamy and Kamakshi (1983) studied the role of stress in 30 adolescent hysterics aged 13-17 years using the social readjustment rating scale of Coddington for 12-16 years old. This study was the first systematic study in the field of life events in children in India and reported that the majority ( 85% ) of hysterics had a significant life stress before the onset of symptoms. Malhotra et al (1992) found that sick children (hysteria/emotional disorders, hyperactive/ conduct disorders, enuresis and miscellaneous category) scored higher on life events and stress scores when compared to normal children.</p>
                        <p>Daily hassles often have more adverse effect than major stresses. Mehta and Singh (1995) reported that the relatively minor life events, i.e. daily hassles and major life events were significantly associated with persistence of recurrent abdominal pain (RAP). These children experienced greater incidence of stressful life events like change in school ( 66% ), beginning a new level in school ( 50% ), increase in arguments between parents ( 43% ), change in financial status of parent ( 33% ), change in father's occupation ( 23% ), loss of a job of a parent ( 20% ), hospitalisation of sibling ( 16% ), death of grandparent ( 10% ), hospitalisation of a parent ( 6% ), and mother beginning work (10% ). RAP children and control had more or less similar problems but the appraisal (how much an event disturbs) was different in the two groups. Due to poor coping strategies RAP children perceived greater negative impact of stressful events. Children's perception of stressful events was different than that of their parents. Problems related to the personal lives in school as well as in the family had more negative impact on them.</p>
                        <h3>Family Stress</h3>
                        <p>All of us who live in families, however, have also experienced the kind of stress that we share with others in our households. Family stress can take many forms. Many stressors obviously affect the entire family-such events as theft, sickness, marriage or childbirth. In India we have a large number of extended families and joint families thus family stress is the common problem. If one member of the family has chronic illness or financial loss, the rest of the family members are also affected.</p>
                        <h3>Executive Stress</h3>
                        <p>The office culture at all levels causes lot of problems related to stress. Number of organisations are experiencing that at higher ladder people have more and more of stress-related problems, often manifesting in physical problems like high blood pressure, short temper, insomnia, chronic fatigue syndrome, low back pains, headaches and migraines and increased consumption of alcohol and smoking. These problems are now known as executive stress as besides long hours of work, these people are involved in decision making, given lot of responsibilities and have result-oriented tasks. They have to meet competitions and challenges. A study conducted at NIMHANS (1996), on the police officers revealed that police officers in certain cadres have 'burnt out' syndrome—emotional exhaustion, depersonalisation and reduced personal accomplishment. Many established organisations have expressed their concerned and have started stress management programmes for their employees.</p>
                        <h3>Test Anxiety</h3>
                        <p>Test anxiety is stress-related factor commonly seen in students. Virtually all students experience some anxiety before a test. But students with excessive test anxiety feel 'frozen up' and panic before exams. Due to high level of anxiety their academic performance is also affected, even with hard work and high intelligence they are unable to get good results.</p>
                        <h3>Stress-esteem</h3>
                        <p>Pearlin (1989) has observed, that coping style and social support have effect on stress outcomes.</p>
                        <p>Self-esteem has been linked to elements of the stress process. According to Rosenberg (1965, 1986), self-esteem is "the evaluation which the individual makes and customarily maintains with regard to himself or herself: it expresses an attitude of approval or disapproval toward oneself". The process of self-esteem formation is said to involve the principles of "reflected appraisal", "social comparison", and "self attribution". Reflected appraisal involves the individual's interpretation of how he or she is viewed by others, whereas social comparison holds that "in the absence of objective information about themselves people judge themselves on the basis of comparison with others". Self-attribution refers to the tendency to draw conclusions about oneself from observing one's own actions, including the success or failure of efforts. It is clear that self-esteem is potentially modifiable by future social experience. Accordingly, to the extent it is relevant to psychological distress and disorder, it represents one obvious target for prevention and early intervention efforts in the service of mental health. The goal of such efforts would be to increase the individual's capacity to maintain self-esteem in the face of adversity and, especially, loss events.</p>
                        <p>A positive and resilient self-image (in contrast to a negative or labile self-esteem) represents a crucial resource for combating the negative implications for self that are the frequent accompaniments of stressful events. Presumably, the stability and extent of self-esteem is determined by the nature and consistency of one's cumulative experiences of reflected appraisals, social comparisons, and self-attributions.</p>
                        <p><strong>Self-esteem and Psychological Distress:</strong> It has been noted that poor self-esteem can lead to depression. Low self-esteem represents a vulnerability factor that increases risk of depression three-fold in the presence of stress. The significance of self-esteem as a mediator of the impact of unemployment on psychological distress has been demonstrated by studies involving diverse populations and designs. It has been reported that individuals high in self-esteem appear to be more resistant to the negative effects of unemployment than individuals low in self-esteem.</p>
                        <p>Low self-esteem is generally taken as a keydefining characteristic of depression. This view is associated with the cognitive theory of depression, which suggests that low esteem may be state dependent, arising out of depressive affect rather than contributing to it. Thus, it can be concluded that some important part of the causation involved in the self-esteem-depression relationship goes from esteem to depression, and that self-esteem may be especially significant among the disadvantaged and in high-stress circumstances. One implication of this conclusion is that prevention or intervention efforts should be made to enhance self-esteem to reduce the risk of psychological distress.</p>
                        <h3>Personality and Stress</h3>
                        <p>Certain personality types are prone to specific illnesses. This understanding helps us to modify a behavioural pattern to prevent the onset of related illness. People who are perfectionists, selfsacrificing, conforming, self-conscious, inhibited, shy and nervous, sensitive, get easily worked up, are more prone to get physical diseases if exposed to prolonged and severe stress.</p>
                        <p>Type A personality has often been associated with stress and illness. As you will read in Chapter 11, that these people are intensely ambitious, competitive and impatient. They are always preoccupied with deadlines and want to achieve things in the shortest possible time. Type A person expends enormous energy in pursuit of his goals. Migraine and tension headaches are also associated with this personality type.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>There is no way that we can escape stress throughout life. Stress whether good or bad, is an all-prevailing facet of life. It is unavoidable and inescapable. So, what everyone attempts is to cope with stress and maintain it at manageable levels. We all learn to cope with tensions.</p>
                        <p>Coping strategies in managing stress require change in yourself, others and the environment. You may have to use one of these according to the problem or situation. Coping means the ways and means you adopt to keep stress at manageable levels. If you are getting stressed because of overwork, you will need to learn to relax, change your working style, bring about certain changes in yourself, so that you perceive the stressor as not so threatening, or find ways to convert it into a motivating or driving force. If the stress is due to interpersonal problems then one can discuss with colleagues, similarly environment can be modified by reducing noise level, rearranging the things or going for a short holiday.</p>
                        <p>It is our reaction to stress that determines the effect of stress on our life. Cognitive appraisal or our perception of a stressor is the most important aspect of our coping ability, for example, for some people frequent travelling is pleasurable whereas a person with negative cognitive appraisal would think travelling as very tiring, monotonous, and waste of time. The way we feel depends to a great extent on the way we think about the events in our lives. Lazarus sees stress as a result of a transaction between person and environment. The way people appraise or construe their relationship with the environment is a function of cognition, or thought. These thoughts influence the way people feel. On the contrary individual's emotions affect the way they make sense out of the world around them. Thus, emotion (feeling) follows cognition (thought), and vice versa.</p>
                        <p>The way we all feel, think and act is a product of the way we as individuals interact with events. All experiences-the good and the bad: are filtered through one's unique personalities, personal histories, and viewpoints on life. By and large, we determine which of these experiences will be uplifting and which will be degrading. We do this partly in the way we act to shape our own lives and partly in the way we react to the shapes our lives assume.</p>
                        <p>Coping skills are an individual's attempt to resolve life stressors and emotional pain. Coping can be thought of as having two components, the methods used and the focus of the coping response. In terms of method of coping, the individual can utilise either an active response to resolve the stressful event or choose to avoid the stressor. The focus of the coping response may be directed at the problem itself (problemfocussed) or the emotional consequences of the stressor (emotion-focussed). Active cognitive coping responses manage one's appraisal of the stressfulness of the problem itself or its emotional consequences. Avoidance cognitive coping responses include those attempts to avoid having to confront the problem, like denying a heart attack, and claiming it to be just a severe case of indigestion.</p>
                        <p>Coping can be positive and negative. Some of the negative coping techniques are drinking alcohol, taking drugs, escaping from the stressful situation. There are certain ways to cope with the day-to-day stress in positive way. These are physical and mental exercises to reduce tension, diversion in various hobbies and activities to avoid negative thoughts, nutrition and healthy eating habits, lifestyle and congenial interpersonal relationship. The coping strategies usually employed by majority of people are distraction, situation redefinition, direct action, catharsis, acceptance, seeking social support, relaxation, and religion.</p>
                        <p>In cases where stress is severe and has consequently manifested in physical or psychological problems, help from the professionals should be taken. Stress inoculation training can help in coping with the stress.</p>
                        <h3>Stress-Inoculation Training</h3>
                        <p>Rajeev, a first-year college student, always breaks out in a cold sweat before taking an examination, is so tense and nervous that he forgets all the material and goes on to get a low grade on the test. Since Rajeev wants to do well at the university, he knows he will have to do something to overcome this debilitating test anxiety.</p>
                        <p>One thing Rajeev might do is to seek out a programme of stress-inoculation training. This approach uses techniques of behaviour modification to prevent stress in a variety of specific areas. These programmes educate individuals about their stressful reactions through an active give-and-take between leader and participants, give them a chance to rehearse ways to cope with the specific stressor being discussed, and then have them practice these coping skills on a variety of stressors, from mild to severe. In one programme geared to test anxiety, students are encouraged to learn new, helpful statements that they can say to themselves to replace the former anxiety-producing ones.</p>
                        <p>Stress-inoculation training has many other applications. It can help people overcome phobias, cope with pain, and control anger. One innovative way to use this same basic approach is to prevent stress before it occurs. Cognitive behavioural approaches have been used very successfully to manage problems arising from stress. Cognitive behavioural approaches are described in detail in Chapter 21.</p>
                        <h3>Family Coping</h3>
                        <p>The event that affects one human being-illness, a job promotion that requires a move out of town, the loss of a job, any major triumph or disappointment is likely to affect everyone in that person's family. Not only does the affected individual have to cope with the stress, the entire family must deal with it. Researchers who have studied family stress have found that families cope by the same basic means as individual's do by taking actions and changing their attitudes, both to solve the problems and to make themselves feel better.</p>
                        <h3>Assessment of Stress and Coping</h3>
                        <p>There are various methods to assess stress, these can be physiological measures or can be assessed on self-report, questionnaires, checklist and rating scales. One of the examples of rating scale developed for Indian population is given here. For children different scales are used as their stressors are different than those of adults (Table 10.1).</p>
                        <p>While psychological inventories and tests are also available that measure how the individual copes, clinical practice necessitates immediate empirical evaluation of the problem, the vulnerability level, and the coping strategies in use. The following list suggests guidelines of a generally useful approach to the assessment of patients, whether the predominant problem is ward-centred, and illness-related, or personalityrelated.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Do not use a set speech because each patient is different.</li>
                            <li>Introduce yourself, even to stuporous or confused patients.</li>
                            <li>Sit down and try to establish eye contact.</li>
                            <li>Avoid asking questions that can be answered 'yes' or 'no'.</li>
                            <li>Learn how to listen and observe.</li>
                            <li>Respond as seems appropriate, but make sure that the patient has the opportunity to talk, too.</li>
                            <li>Monitor your own thoughts because they may mirror those of the patient, or help explain your difficulties in getting across.</li>
                            <li>Modulate and measure your answers according to the needs of the patient.</li>
                            <li>Always ask yourself what the patient was like before becoming ill.</li>
                            <li>Clarification, control and cooling off are usually carried out simultaneously, just as perception, behaviour, and emotion are a unit.</li>
                            <li>Use the most timely, informative, and evocative questions, such as:
                                <ol type="a">
                                    <li>What has bothered you most about this illness?</li>
                                    <li>How has it been a problem for you?</li>
                                    <li>What have you done (or are you doing) about the problem?</li>
                                    <li>What has been the most difficult thing you have had to face until now?</li>
                                    <li>What did you do then?</li>
                                    <li>Whom do you rely on most, or expect will be most helpful to you?</li>
                                    <li>In general, how do things usually turn out for you?</li>
                                    <li>Tell me what you think about this whole situation.</li>
                                </ol>
                            </li>

                        <h3>Effect of Stress on Health</h3>
                        <p>Coping is a problemsolving behaviour designed to bring about relief and equilibrium. The common denominator of coping is to have a problem. The common task of physicians and patients is to solve problems related to being sick, that is, the medical plight beyond mere physical changes and consequences. Coping, therefore, is an integral part of medical practice as well as illness. With the same disease at comparable stages, and with more or less equivalent treatment, patients may have different problems, and physicians may themselves respond with a wide variety of reactions, diagnoses and management.</p>
                        <p>Coping means that one has to overcome a threat or master a risky situation. How patients cope is a complicated mixture of cognitive appraisal and reappraisal, initial responses and corrected responses. Being sick is a problem in itself. But the fact of being sick sends waves into the far reaches of a patient's life, undoing psychosocial balance, and even initiating illness in significant others (family and friends).</p>

                        <h4>Disease-related problem</h4>
                        <p>Different diseases have their own special complications with which almost every victim must cope. A disfiguring scar, ataxia, a colostomy, a restrictive diet, and so forth require some form of primary rehabilitation and retraining that entails coping processes. Behavioural scientist in a general hospital deals with psychosocial problems. Some of these are complications of rehabilitative procedures. For example, it is not uncommon for an elderly person to prefer a wheelchair to a prosthesis after a leg amputation. The patient may be able to walk well with assistance in the hospital, but be reluctant to venture beyond his room when he returns home. The treating doctor can talk about the amputation with the patient, and then about the living arrangements, the emotional support received or not received from others, and fears about walking unaided or alone on a crowded street. Behavioural Scientist is now being asked more often to help patients suffering from "diseases of progress". Almost every advancement in medicine is followed by an unexpected complication. Treatments that save patients from one disease may expose them to several others. The secondary problems of immunosuppression are prominent examples that require psychosocial intervention.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Sickness-related problems</h4>
                        <p>Illness have its interpersonal and intrapsychic qualities that may undo medical and surgical efforts. When the limits of medicine and surgery have been reached, psychosocial problems may just be gathering momentum. For example, a young father who develops carcinoma of the lung is not just physically sick. He worries about his job as well as about other psychosocial complications of illness and its treatment. He may complain about the physicians, argue with his wife, and even blame his children for his plight. All these objectionable results may conceal deep pessimism about survival and fear of abandoning people closest to him.</p>
                        <p>For some people, patienthood is easier than functioning in the outside world. A person who submits courageously to a series of operations may not be able to work when recovered and thereby becomes an even greater liability than before the surgery began. Every illness should be presumed to carry a balance of gains and losses for the individual. An unexpected improvement or recovery in a patient who has become accustomed to invalidism and the sick role may induce relative ego impairment if too many psychosocial responsibilities are thrust on the patient too quickly. Survival, support and self-esteem are only three important problems faced by chronically-ill patients, including those who are rescued from invalidism through newer medical and surgical treatments.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Vulnerability</h3>
                        <p>Vulnerability refers to the emotional distress that is the most personal aspect of illness. It reflects impairment of competence, control and consciousness. Consequently, vulnerability not only signifies distress in the here-and-now, but a disposition to behave or conduct oneself at less than full efficiency. The ways in which the human being is vulnerable are both endless and unexpected.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Manifestation of poor coping</h4>
                        <p>While dealing with other people you would meet people who are not good in coping with the daily hassles or stresses. Here are some behavioural patterns that can be observed in these individuals.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Vulnerability: Hopelessness</strong> - Patient believes that all is lost; effort is futile; there is no chance for recovery.</li>
                            <li><strong>Turmoil/perturbation:</strong> Patient is tense, agitated, restless, indicating inner distress.</li>
                            <li><strong>Frustration:</strong> Patient is angry about inability to resolve problems and get relief.</li>

                        <p>Vulnerability and the variations of coping have a somewhat reciprocal relationship, at least from the clinical viewpoint. Few patients use only one or two strategies to cope with very important problems, because in coping with important problems patients recall past experiences and apprehend future obstacles. Given a suitable combination or sequence of strategies, the patient who copes effectively will experience reduction of distress, relief, and perhaps even resolution of problems. Of the three principal parts of a patient's plight, coping is by far the most difficult to detect. The distress of vulnerability is usually far more obvious because high levels of vulnerability are what prompted consultation in the first place.</p>
                        <p>Good copers also have good doctor-patient relationships. They are optimistic and resourceful, can directly confront problems, and then can revise them in "cope-able" terms. Suppression and denial are only temporarily effective. Good copers are flexible in using all available options, just as they faced difficult situations in the past, even though the illness is the unique problem for every patient.</p>
                        <p>In contrast, patients who are poor copers tend to have higher emotional distress and do not clearly recognise pertinent psychosocial problems. The habits of avoiding, nullifying and disguising problems as well as the failure to be clear and communicative are diagnostic signs of poor coping. Blaming others or themselves is also an indication of poor coping potential. It is usually important to ask about time perspective and anticipated recovery, since these give a clue to how pessimistic or realistic the patient's view of the illness is. The doctor who works with patients needs experience in interview skills to deal with medical and surgical patients who are not primarily motivated to seek or use psychotherapeutic interventions.</p>

                        <p>Stress is a stimulus event of sufficient severity to produce disequilibrium in the homeostatic physiological systems. The stimulus that evokes a stress response is called a stressor. A stimulus becomes a stressor either by the cognitive interpretation or meaning that the individual assigns to the stimulus or by the fact that the stimulus affects the individual by way of some sensory or metabolic process, which is stressful. In physiological terms stress is the body's response to any stressful demand. In psychological terms stress is an individual's cognitive judgement that his or her personal resources will be taxed or incapable of dealing with the demands posed by a particular event.</p>
                        <p>Stress comprises of stressor, stress response and the individual's coping resources like skills and social support systems. Stressor represents stimulus events requiring some form of adaptation or adjustment. Stressor can be internal stimuli like cognitions or thoughts or external stimuli like crowd, noise, and interpersonal difficulties.</p>
                        <p>Stresses are classified as positive or negative stresses.</p>
                        <p>An excessive number of 'life events' in a particular period of time can lead to increase ill health. The variety of illnesses that have been linked with life events range from heart disease, cancer and depression to the less life-threatening common cold or migraine.</p>
                        <p>Major stressful life events and daily hassles have been reported to have association with ill health. In children a significant association has been found between stressful life event and somatic complaints. The most frequent stressful life events were financial problems, moving house, death of a relative, chronic illness in the family and frequent change in job of parents.</p>
                        <p>Self-esteem has relevance to psychological distress and disorder. In many psychiatric problems self-esteem is one of the components for prevention and early intervention efforts in the service of mental health. Poor self-esteem is three times more in depressed patients.</p>
                        <p>Coping strategies in managing stress require change in yourself, others and the environment. Coping means the ways and means you adopt to keep stress at manageable levels. Coping has two components, the methods used and the focus of the coping response. Coping can be positive and negative. Some of the negative coping techniques are drinking alcohol, taking drugs, escaping from the stressful situation. There are certain ways to cope with the day-to-day stress in positive way.</p>
                        <p>There are various methods to assess stress, these can be physiological measures or can be assessed on self-report, questionnaires, checklist and rating scales. One of the examples of the common task of physicians and patients is to solve problems related to being sick. Coping is an integral part of medical practice as well as illness. Different diseases have their own special complications with which almost every victim must cope. A disfiguring scar, ataxia, a colostomy, a restrictive diet, require some form of primary rehabilitation and retraining that entails coping processes. Sickness-related problems have interpersonal and intrapsychic qualities that may undo medical and surgical efforts.</p>
                        <p>Vulnerability refers to the emotional distress that is the most personal aspect of illness. It reflects impairment of competence, control and consciousness. Consequently, vulnerability not only signifies distress in the here-and-now, but a disposition to behave or conduct oneself at less than full efficiency.</p>
