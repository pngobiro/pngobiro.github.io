This illustrates an important principle of 'Learning,' the capacity to 'profit' from experience and practice.

                        <p>Learning is the central process to all our behaviour, as we learn to do various activities like speak, write, think, or play. Our attitudes and emotional expressions are also learned behaviours. All our adaptive as well as unadaptive, cognitive as well as affective behaviour are formed by learning processes. These are of vital importance in helping the person to adapt to his changing environment.</p>
                        <p>Learning is the acquisition through insight of cognitive structure. It is an internal process, not necessarily observable, in which information is integrated into the structure of what student already knows and understands. Learning is a process resulting in some modification, relatively permanent, of the way of thinking, feeling, and doing of the learner. The characteristics of learning is producing a behavioural change in the learner, leading to a relatively permanent change, that is also gradual, adaptable and selective resulting from practice, repetitions and experience, and not directly observable. There are three important factors in learning:</p>

                            <li>Learning brings change in behaviour.</li>
                            <li>Change takes place through practice or experience. It emphasises that all changes due to growth or maturation or by drugs, brain injury, are not learning.</li>

                        <p>There are a number of theoretical explanations about the process of learning. Some theories emphasise on stimulus response (S-R) relationships, and interpret learning as an associative process. Classical conditioning and operant conditioning are based on associative learning. Other psychologists argue that all types of learning cannot be explained on simple forms of S-R relationships. They give importance to perception and understanding for learning complex forms of learning. Cognitive theories are an offshoot of this explanation. However, we are social beings and we learn number of tasks in social context, so another group of theorists have given the social learning model. In the following section, all these methods of learning shall be examined in detail.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Classical Conditioning</h3>
                        <p>Classical conditioning is the simplest form of learning based on experiments of Pavlov, a Russian physiologist. Conditioning is a term used to describe the process by which the previously neutral stimulus (CS) gains the power to elicit the conditioned response (CR). Pavlov had noticed during the experiments that his experimental dogs salivated not only to the sight of food, but also to the sound of experimenter's footsteps. To study this phenomenon systematically, he associated the presentation of food to the dog with another stimulus, such as the sound of bell. After giving some trials in which the bell preceded the presentation of food, the dog started salivating at the sound of the bell. To explain this phenomenon, some technical terms are used; food is called unconditioned stimulus (US), and salivation elicited for food is called unconditioned response (UR). The sound of bell in the experiment was conditioned stimulus (CS). It was initially a neutral stimulus because except for an alerting or attentional response during the first few times it is presented; it does not evoke a specific response. The response of salivation to bell is called conditioned response, as it was originally a neutral conditioned stimulus; it evoked a specific response due to learning (Fig. 5.1) the conditioning procedure.</p>

                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_11_10_5e89b0eccc8308b427a9g-047-1.jpg" alt="A flowchart illustrating the classical conditioning procedure before, during, and after conditioning, showing how a neutral stimulus (bell) becomes a conditioned stimulus that elicits salivation." class="content-image">

                        </figure>
                        <p>The acquisition of a conditioned response is gradual and becomes stronger with repeated trials. There are certain acts of classical conditioning which require consideration.</p>
                        <p><strong>Acquisition:</strong> Each paired presentation of the CS and the US should be presented a number of times, and the interval between CS and US should be short. In simultaneous conditioning, the CS begins a little earlier than the onset of US and continues along with it until the response occurs. In delayed conditioning, the CS begins much before the onset of US. In trace conditioning, the CS is presented and then removed before the US starts.</p>
                        <p><strong>Stimulus substitution:</strong> An association or pairing of CS with US acquires the capacity to substitute for the US in evoking a response. With conditioning, a link or bond is formed between the CS and US, and as a result of this CS becomes equivalent to US in eliciting a response. Stimulus substitution occurs if CS is similar to US . But the recent theorists do not agree with this simple process of stimulus substitution. According to their viewpoint, CS becomes a signal for the US; when CS is presented, the US is expected and the learner responds due to expectation.</p>
                        <p><strong>Stimulus generalisation and discrimination:</strong> When the conditioned response to a stimulus has been acquired, other similar stimuli can also evoke the same response. This is known as stimulus generalisation. In Pavlov's experiments, the dog gave CR to slightly different bell also. It has also been demonstrated that the closer the similarity to US with other stimuli, the greater is the CR.</p>
                        <p>Discrimination is to make one response to one stimulus and a different response, or no response to another. This process is complementary to generalisation. In experiments it is demonstrated by using two different tones CS1 and CS2. On some trials CS1 is paired with US and on other trials CS2 is given alone without US. The subject learns to respond only to CS1, after learning takes place (Fig. 5.2).</p>

                        <p><strong>Extinction and spontaneous recovery:</strong> If the unconditioned stimulus (US) does not follow the conditioned stimulus CS repeatedly, the conditioned response gradually diminishes. Repetition of the conditioned stimulus without unconditioned stimulus is called extinction; this is not forgetting, as a specific procedure is involved in this.</p>
                        <p>Extinction is used for modification of problem behaviours in clinical practice. A response that has been extinguished, does recur later on its own, this is called spontaneous recovery. If there is a period of rest after extinction, the CR tends to re-emerge. This tendency is more marked after continuous than distributed practice of the response during extinction. At this stage, if reinforcement or US is not presented with CS, the response extinguishes permanently.</p>

                        <h3>Operant Conditioning</h3>
                        <p>Operant conditioning, a term coined by BF Skinner, means that the likelihood of a behaviour depends on the significance of the event immediately following it to person showing the behaviour. If the event following the behaviour is positively reinforcing or rewarding, then it will recur. If it is not reinforced or is punished, then it is less likely to recur and eventually stops completely, a process known as 'extinction'. An alternative related approach is 'stimulus control'-changing the preceding event. When a response operates on the environment, it may have consequences that can affect the likelihood of the response occurring again. This form of learning is also known as instrumental conditioning, because some action or behaviour of the learner is instrumental in bringing about a change in the environment, that makes the action more or less likely to occur again in the future. For example, putting food in your mouth (an operant) is likely to be repeated because of its pleasant consequences (Fig. 5.3).</p>
                        <div class="content-card">

                                <li><strong>Behaviour</strong> leads to <strong>Positive Consequences</strong> which leads to <strong>Recurrence of behaviour (positive reinforcement)</strong></li>
                                <li><strong>Behaviour</strong> leads to <strong>No reward or punishment</strong> which leads to <strong>Behaviour disappears (extinction)</strong></li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>
                        <p>This is an effective method for teaching new behaviour patterns and for modifying undesirable behaviours. A number of treatment strategies used in behavioural therapy and behavioural medicine are derived from this method (see Chapters 20, 22). The basics of operant conditioning are reinforcement and punishment. Thus, use of reinforcement and punishment shall be examined in detail.</p>
                        <p><strong>Reinforcement:</strong> The basic principles of operant conditioning are that when a behaviour occurs and is followed by reinforcement, it is more likely to occur again in the future. A great deal of our behaviour has been learned because it has been rewarded. For example, you study because you may find it reinforcing in terms of marks attained or praise from your colleagues. Many responses can be made to occur more frequently by following it with reinforcement. The behaviour can be shaped and moulded by appropriate arrangements of responses and reinforcers.</p>
                        <p><strong>Nature of reinforcers:</strong> Whether something is positively reinforcing or punishing, depends on the effect it has on behaviour. What may be positively reinforcing to one child may not be so for another. For example, usually food will be positively reinforcing, but to an anorexic girl, who hates the sight of food, it may be punishing. Pain is usually punishing, but to a child preoccupied with guilt with masochistic tendencies, it will be positively reinforcing or rewarding. Further, the strength and direction of reinforcement will depend to some degree on the child's relationship with the person administering or involved in it. A game of football is likely to be more positively reinforcing for a boy if it involves his father than his mother. A star chart for bed-wetting worked out in cooperation with a mother with whom a 6 years old has a good relationship, is likely to be more effective than if the mother and child are in serious conflict.</p>
                        <p>Reinforcements are divided into two types: (i) primary or material rewards, such as snacks, sweets, food, etc. and (ii) secondary or social rewards, such as praise, smile. Events or consequences, which strengthen behaviour when they are presented, are called positive reinforcers. In negative reinforcement, the response causes the termination of a painful event. Removal of painful or unpleasant consequences can also strengthen or reinforce behaviour. For instance, offering a screaming child an ice cream may result in a child stopping screaming. The adult is likely to continue to give ice cream (operant) to stop the child from screaming (negative reinforcement for the adult).</p>
                        <p>In children, the most common form of positive reinforcement is praise and attention. Children are likely to repeat behaviour, which gives pleasure to those whom they are fond of. Usually their parents and teachers are the most important people to give positive reinforcement; as they get older, other children/peers increasingly take on this role. If a teacher plays gratifying attention to bad behaviour (even if the attention takes form of shouting at the child), then bad behaviour will recur. Material rewards such as money, sweets, chocolates, other favourite foods, and watching television are also used as reinforcers.</p>
                        <p><strong>Schedule of reinforcement:</strong> According to Skinner, at the beginning of training you should reward each and every move the child makes toward the goal. However, once the child has mastered a given response in the chain, you may begin slowly fading out the reward by reinforcing the response intermittently. Continuous reinforcement is necessary at first, both to keep the individual to perform and to let him know that he is doing something right. However, once the child learns what that "something" is, you may begin reinforcing the response every second time, then every third or fourth time, then perhaps every tenth time. If you fade out the reward very gradually, you can get a child to make a simple response several times, for each reinforcement.</p>
                        <p>During the fading process, the exact scheduling of the reward is crucial. If you reinforce exactly every tenth response, the child will soon learn to anticipate which response will gain him reward. Skinner calls this fixed ratio reinforcement, because the ratio between the number of responses required and the rewards given is fixed and never varies. Instead of reinforcing exactly the tenth response, we can vary the schedule, so that sometimes the third response yields reward, sometimes the twentieth or any response in between. A hundred responses will yield about 10 rewards, but the child will never know when the next reward is coming. When trained on variable ratio schedules, individuals respond at a fairly constant pace.</p>
                        <p>Extinction generally occurs most rapidly following withdrawal of things that are positive reinforcers. Thus the withdrawal of love from people of whom the child is fond is often the most effective way of achieving extinction of the undesirable behaviour. In other children, the withdrawal of material goods, such pocket money, special food or drink, and opportunity to watch television are more important.</p>
                        <p><strong>Shaping:</strong> Refers to the gradual forming of the behaviour. Desirable new behaviour can be built up through successive reinforcement of a sequence of components parts of that behaviour. It is commonly used in teaching skills to mentally subnormal.</p>
                        <p><strong>Punishment:</strong> When we wish to eliminate an unadaptive behaviour, punishment tends to decrease the likelihood of occurrence of the responses. Any unpleasant consequence of behaviour, which makes that behaviour less likely to occur, can be seen as punishing. Physical punishment by parents is the most frequently used, but many children do not respond to it by a reduction in their undesirable behaviour. Probably, the attention they get when they are punished has a positive reinforcing rewarding effect, and this result overrides negative experiences of physical pain. The experience of negative emotional states like anxiety, depression and a sense of failure, are like strong punishment. In other words, punishment decreases the frequency of a response and stops the behaviours leading to it. Some of the common methods based on principle of punishment are time out from reinforcement, overcorrection and response cost. These methods, if used consistently and systematically, have been found to be very effective in modifying problem behaviour in children (Mehta, 1989).</p>

                        <h3>Comparison between Classical Conditioning and Operant Conditioning</h3>
                        <p>Both classical and operant conditioning are the important methods of learning, but you would have observed that these two types of conditioning are different in their process of learning from each other. These differences have been highlighted in the following Table 5.1.</p>

                        <h3>Cognitive Learning</h3>
                        <p>In learning more complex tasks, perception and knowledge or cognitive processes play an important role. Cognitive theorists state that learning cannot be satisfactorily explained in terms of stimulus response association. They propose, that a learner forms a cognitive structure in memory, which organizes information into relationships and meaning. Without any known reinforcement, new associations are formed and new relationships are perceived among events, simply as a result of having experienced these events. Links are made among stimuli, so that stimulus-stimulus (S-S) associations are learned. These theories take account of concept formation, in which the learner actively tests his ideas, rules and principles, in order to make sense of incoming information. Bruner et al (1966) hypothesised that the learner interprets and transforms any incoming stimulus in the light of previous experience. Gagne suggested that learning is an eight stage hierarchical process, involving events both internal and external to the learner and which incorporate many different types of learning (see Box 5.1).</p>

                        <p>Cognitive learning includes some of the following methods of learning.</p>
                        <p><strong>Insight learning:</strong> Kohler, a German psychologist, on the basis of this experiments on chimpanzees, emphasised that while working on a problem, one grasps three inner relationships through insight, not through mere trial and error, but by perceiving the relationships essential to solution. In his typical experiment, a chimpanzee in the bars was given two unequal sizes of sticks and the fruit was kept outside the bars, which could not be reached by one stick alone. After several trials, the animal all of a sudden joined the two sticks together to make it a single long stick, and with that he could reach the fruit.</p>
                        <p>Insight is often used in problem solving, puzzles and riddles. To emphasise the suddenness of the solution, it is also called by some as "Aha experience" (see Chapter 7).</p>
                        <p><strong>Sign learning:</strong> It is an acquired expectation that one stimulus will be followed by another in a particular context. What we learn is a set of expectations or a cognitive map of the environment, rather than specific responses.</p>
                        <p>Toleman believed that some learning is sign learning. We develop a sort of cognitive map or structure, instead of learning a sequence of the task. On the basis of understanding, we tend to make spatial relationships.</p>

                        <h3>Social Learning</h3>
                        <p>There are many forms of learning, which cannot be explained through conditioning or through cognitive learning. We also learn through observation. Social learning theorists stress upon observational learning or modeling, in which a person acquires a response to a specific situation, by watching others make a response (Bandura, 1969).</p>
                        <p>Imitation is one of the important methods based on this theory, which could be applied in learning of many skills. For example, many of your skills like giving an injection, measuring blood pressure, dressing of a wound or surgical skills, are learned by simply observing seniors performing those skills. Even maladaptive behaviours, like aggression are learnt through imitation. The learner acquires and stores internal (representations) response through images and verbal coding, which may be expressed later. Social learning methods are also applied in behaviour therapy (see Chapter 20).</p>

                        <h3>Observational Learning</h3>
                        <p>Imagine the following events:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>A student watches a consultant surgeon operating on an infant for diaphragmatic hernia. In this way, he begins to acquire the complex skills needed for this type of surgery.</li>
                            <li>A group of young men and women listen to a detailed account of an unusual, but highly successful bank robbery on the evening news. Later, they plan and carry out a similar robbery themselves.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>These two situations are different, yet they share one important feature of learning through observation. In each case, new forms of behaviour were acquired simply by observing others' actions.</p>
                        <p>There has been rising recognition of the key role played by observational learning in the behaviour of young children. Many experiments suggest that youngsters acquire a wide range of responses, including attitudes, values, and selfcontrol, through exposure to their parents or other persons that is, through exposure to social models (Rushton, 1976; Bandura, 1977). In several early studies, Albert Bandura and his colleagues exposed children to brief films, in which an adult model acted aggressively toward an inflated plastic doll. Observational learning is increased when we pay close attention to the actions of others, but is reduced when such attention is absent. It is also increased when we attempt to first summarise or code others' behaviour in some manner, and then rehearse it (Bandura, 1977; Berger et al 1979).</p>

                        <h3>Latent Learning</h3>
                        <p>This type of learning refers to any changes that are not evidenced by behaviour at the time of the learning. It occurs without any reinforcement for particular responses, and seems to involve changes in the way in which information is processed. You can get ample examples of latent learning from your own experiences. This is different from observational learning, as you have not consciously put an effort to learning, but later you can perform that particular skill or responses.</p>

                        <h3>Biological Learning</h3>
                        <p>You would have seen that in spite of using similar methods of learning, devoting similar time, yet all persons are not able to learn in a same way. Some people take more time to learn as compared to others. Thus, important process of learning cannot be fully understood without some grasp of the biological functioning of different people. We possess different capacities to receive and process different abilities to learn. The study of learning has acquired a new perspective, one in which the impact of biological factors is given increased emphasis. The most important concept that emerged out of this perspective is concept of preparedness, proposed by Seligman (1970). According to this concept, persons are prepared by their biological structure and function, to accomplish certain kinds of learning but not others. Learned behaviour can be divided into distinct categories.</p>
                        <p><strong>Prepared:</strong> These actions are closely related to the survival of the persons and very little training is required.</p>
                        <p><strong>Unprepared:</strong> The tasks are learned slowly as and when required by the person. These are not related to the survival.</p>
                        <p><strong>Contraprepared:</strong> These are responses, which are contrary to the persons' natural tendencies, for example, fears.</p>
                        <p>These findings seem to suggest that as human beings, we are prepared to acquire fears of some stimuli, e.g. snakes, lizards, etc. but not others, e.g. houses, flowers. This possibility is also seen in clinical practice. While individuals come for help in over-coming fears of some animals, objects and situations, but not on others.</p>

                        <span class="heading-text">Principles of Learning</span>
                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Learning is primarily controlled by the learner. It is unique and individual. It is affected by the total state of the learner. It can be cooperative and collaborative, it is an evolutionary process. It is a consequence of experience and is not directly observable. There are four principles of learning:</p>
                        <h3>Individuality of the Learner</h3>
                        <p>Each learner is a unique individual in terms of the style of learning and rate of learning. However, given adequate time and flexibility in approach all individuals can attain required level of competence.</p>
                        <h3>All Learning is Contextual</h3>
                        <p>Learning takes place when a person 'interacts' with a problem/situation, and 'processes' information in the light of his/her own previous learning and experience. By providing real life experience or using simulated situation, learning can be made more meaningful. Participatory training techniques, in which the trainee actively participates in the learning process, should be used, such as group discussions, case studies, demonstration, role play, games, exercises, projects, field work, etc. New learning should be built on the previous experience of the trainees. Asking questions about previous learning, not only activates the learner, but also helps in proper understanding of the subject.</p>
                        <h3>Role of Motivation</h3>
                        <p>Motivation holds the key for all learning. Motivation depends upon the needs felt by the individual, which varies from individual-toindividual, and from one situation to the other. However, one can make following generalisations regarding the factors motivating an adult learner:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Physiological needs: (self-preservation/ existence, hunger, sex)</li>
                            <li>Security: job security, living conditions, etc.</li>
                            <li>Social status: recognition, fellow feeling</li>
                            <li>Esteem: ego fulfillment</li>
                            <li>Self-actualisation: working for the sake of excellence.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>These are organised in a hierarchical manner. Unless the lower level need is met, the higher ones usually do not operate; e.g. an under-paid nursing orderly is more concerned about his pay, perks and making living. A doctor whose such needs are fulfilled might work for esteem or recognition.</p>
                        <p>Positive reinforcement of the correct response in course of learning greatly facilitates learning. The reinforcement could be in the form of verbal response (e.g. excellent, fantastic, ideal, that is great, etc.); it could be a nonverbal gesture (e.g. a pat, or a smile, etc.). Rewards have a positive effect on motivation and the punishment has negative influence. While promotion, higher pay, perks, awards medals, etc. represent extrinsic form of motivation; self-satisfaction, working for sake of work, pursuit of excellence represent intrinsic motivation. Intrinsic motivation lasts longer than extrinsic motivation.</p>
                        <p>Motivation is heightened, when a person has clear idea of the 'goals', and when he perceives value of reaching the goal. If the goal is not clear or not achievable at all, a person is not likely to put in efforts. Adult learners always think: is it worth pursuing? What do I get out of it? Does this task help in any way in my present or future job performance? The extent to which the answer is 'yes', the person is likely to put in effort. If the goal is not clear or not achievable at all, a person is not likely to put in efforts.</p>
                        <p>Motivation calls for a 'nonthreatening' environment in learning. Though learning is a cognitive activity, it is also an emotional experience. People learn when they are happy, cheerful. The training atmosphere must be cordial. The attitude of the trainer to a large extent determines this factor. A democratic and friendly trainer is more effective than an authoritarian, conservative trainer.</p>
                        <h3>Feedback</h3>
                        <p>Learning is very much facilitated, when individuals are helped to set the goals and given continuous feedback on their progress. The knowledge of success or failure includes not only the extent of achievement or failure, but also the logic and the cause of failure. Successful performance of tasks increases confidence, which again breeds success. The failure may either lead to frustration or may enthuse the person to take alternate approach leading to success.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Over the last few years, research studies have been focussed on how students learn. Learning process is influenced by a host of factors such as ability to concentrate, memory, organisation of learning material. Some of the students have difficulties with their studies, arising not just from lack of application or psychosocial problems, but from specific problems with the way they study and learn. There seems little doubt that good study skills contribute to academic success. With the skills, the student should have a positive attitude and motivation to the subject. It is very important to organise the time and resources available to the learner. Here are some tips by which you can learn more effectively.</p>
                        <h3>Definite Goal</h3>
                        <p>In any learning, student should have clear goal in view, as with a goal in mind, one works towards a definite and sure purpose. Students should get specific, immediate and achievable goals, as they enhance your motivation to learn and ensure better learning.</p>
                        <h3>Knowledge of Results or Psychological Feedback</h3>
                        <p>The learner must also have conscious assurance that he is making progress towards his achievement. Frequent and regular review of the amount of progress being made toward the goal, act as a strong motive to promote continuing effort on the part of the learner.</p>
                        <h3>Distribution of Practice Periods</h3>
                        <p>A number of experiments have demonstrated those shorter practice periods are more economical than longer periods, and when distributed over several days; they yield better returns that when they are concentrated into a single sitting.</p>
                        <h3>Whole versus Part Method</h3>
                        <p>Whether the entire topic should be learned all the way through in each trial, or by breaking it into small portions and learning in turns? The former is known as whole method and latter as part method. With easy units, whole method should be adopted. If material is difficult in relation to the learner's ability, smaller units should be learnt; but they still are as large wholes as a learner can manage efficiently. Try to learn in natural units.</p>
                        <h3>Logical Learning</h3>
                        <p>This means that instead of learning by heart, rote memorisation, you should try to grasp meaning and idea of the text. Logical learning calls for an arrangement and assimilation with other ideas in mind.</p>
                        <h3>Rest Pauses</h3>
                        <p>Take brief rest pauses in between your studies as mental fatigue blocks your ability to remember and think.</p>
                        <h3>Avoid undue Anxiety</h3>
                        <p>Worry, apprehension or nervousness interferes with good performance. Forgetting is more in state of anxiety.</p>
                        <h3>Rhyming</h3>
                        <p>To improve memory, rhyming can be helpful, as it is well known that certain kind of material (poems Vs. prose) can be learnt better by rhyming.</p>
                        <h3>Rational use of Media</h3>
                        <p>When information is given through multiple channels (viz. audio and visual), it makes stronger memory traces. Moreover, in medical education, the students need to understand and develop ability to see relationship among various topics. With the use of media (e.g. video films of selfinstructional programmes), a learner can go through the material at his own pace.</p>
                        <h3>Overlearning</h3>
                        <p>Continuing repetitions of stimulus response learning, even after 100% reproductions, help retain learned material over a longer period of time.</p>
                        <h3>Reading Aloud</h3>
                        <p>Better learning can be ensured at times with reading aloud than silent reading, especially if one has habit to get into day dreaming. This method of learning can be applied to many clinical situations like treatment of speech disorders.</p>

                        <p>Kirti studies day and night, yet barely manages to pass. Ravi can learn better through group discussions, whereas Amit learns better by selflearning. These differences in learning reported by these students as well as by some others, indicate that all students do not have the same method of learning. They have different methods of reading, interpreting and coding the information. There are individual differences in a student's ability to assimilate, retain and reproduce at the required time. Often, their strategies or methods of processing information are useful. However, some students may develop pathological learning strategies.</p>
                        <p>Different students describe their learning experience differently. Some students describe learning as the retention of knowledge achieved through repetition and recitation, while others describe it as an interpretative process aimed at understanding reality. Several studies have led to elucidation of the concept of learning strategies.</p>
                        <h3>How does Students Learn?</h3>
                        <p>Every student implements a set of procedures for accomplishing learning. These procedures denote that learning strategies are determined by student's perception and personal attributes. Two basic approaches to learning have been identified, namely, the "surface" and the "deep" approach.</p>
                        <p>The students with surface approach tend to memorise important parts of the text, from which they anticipate questions in assessment. The learning outcome is essentially a reproduction of the words from the textbook. Their focus of attention is limited to the specific facts, or disconnected information, which is rote, learned. Furthermore, the surface approach does not include perception of the holistic structure of information, but instead atomises it into disconnected bits and pieces that are memorised through repetition. This means that students taking a surface approach fail to derive full meaning, including implications and connections from information they have gone through.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, students with deep approach try to understand the meaning of the materials and relate it to previous knowledge, concepts and experiences. A deep approach involves perception of the holistic organisation of the material studied, organised in a hierarchical manner. A student using this approach is able to extract the meaning from words, not focussing on words as an end in themselves. The learner is sensitive to relationships among topics and to the structure.</p>
                        <p>A medical student needs to have a versatile approach. He should be able to use both deep as well as surface approaches as required, for a particular learning task. It is also important that he looks for the meaning and comprehends the learning material. In a study at AIIMS, it has been observed that in the 1st semester, undergraduate students adopt the surface approach. But by the time they reach the 7th, 8th semester, their approach changes towards deep. This change is linked to the demands of the curriculum assessment, teaching style and learning environment (Fig. 5.4).</p>

                        <h3>Student Autonomy</h3>
                        <p>Medical students ultimately need to become more effective learners, to enable themselves to respond to the variety of situations faced by them during their medical profession. A medical student learns a great deal on his own pace. Student autonomy refers to student independence and responsibility with regard to his learning. A medical student needs to develop an ability to decide which areas of study require more focus than others, and also which type of approach should be used in learning specific skills or subject matter.</p>
                        <p>Ability to think independently can be promoted by developing certain skills like choosing, deciding, deliberating, reflecting planning and judging. Cognitive and emotional development of the students also have a bearing on the development, which leads to increasing differentiation of perceptual categories revealing the uniqueness of events. On the emotional side, self-esteem and self-confidence in the student helps in the development of autonomy.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Skills Requisites of an Autonomous Learner</h4>
                        <p>Autonomy in learning does not come naturally to all students; it is a capability, which needs to be developed. If the student is exposed to the autonomous methods of learning without internalising the values of autonomy, then it will not result in the change of his approach. To be an autonomous student, one needs to have an ability and willingness to approach a situation with an open mind, to suspend critical judgement, and to act in accordance with rules and principles which are the product of the autonomous person's own endeavours and experiences.</p>
                        <p>Certain attributes of an autonomous learner need to be inculcated, in order to be an effective learner in higher education. The most important characteristic is that students should take responsibility for their own learning. Following are some steps to initiate autonomous learning in medical students (Table 5.2).</p>

                        </div>
                        <p>In the setting of medical education, autonomous approaches to learning are of great relevance. One such approach is in the form of problembased learning. The basic idea here is that the starting point for learning should be a problem, a query or a puzzle that the learner wishes to solve. Organized forms of knowledge and academic disciplines should be introduced, when the demands of the problems require them.</p>

                        <h3>Role of Teachers in Facilitating Learning</h3>
                        <p>The teachers should help the students to be autonomous learners. This can be achieved by guiding them to learn to focus in meanings of the contents. This can also be achieved by using advance organizers. Prior to teaching a new topic, the student goes through the main points of the study and gets a clearer idea of the subject. According to Ramsden, the factors influencing include teaching methods, the degree of enthusiasm/commitment of the teachers, the structure, pace and the level at which information is presented. The teachers need to provide opportunities for students to learn in a way, which suits the students preferred style of learning. Thus, teachers have an important role in helping students to learn successfully, control their cognitive processes, including learning to learn, to remember and to think.</p>
                        <p>But a student has a major responsibility in learning by developing skills to use learning strategies judiciously according to the topic, and develop motivation to learn and to handle his emotions.</p>

                        <p>Learning is fundamental to the development and modification of behaviour; knowledge concerning the process may be usefully applied to many clinical situations, not only for the patients but also for the students and professionals. Many of our subjective feelings, emotions and attitudes are probably conditioned responses. Through generalisation, it becomes difficult to identify the origin of our emotional responses. Both our adaptive emotional responses as well as unadaptive responses are learned and can be unlearned through principle of learning.</p>
                        <p>Behaviour modification or behaviour therapy is a group of techniques commonly used in the treatment of various psychiatric disorders, and in the training of mentally handicapped children. Cognitive learning methods are also applied in clinical settings.</p>
                        <p>Learning methods have wide applications in educational setting. In programmed learning, the material to be learned is broken up into small easy steps, so that the learner can accomplish without frustrations. Also with programmed learning, learner can master the task at his own pace. With versatile and flexible learning you can improve your learning style. Use of reinforcement principles can often, increase productivity, both in studies as well as in vocation.</p>
                        <p>The principles of operant conditioning have also been applied to various clinical problems. One example concerns the attempt to improve the social behaviour of long-stay patients in psychiatric hospitals.</p>
                        <p>Other conditions of clinical interest, where operant conditioning principles may be important-both in causation and treatmentare those disorders of behaviour, for example, excessive gambling, smoking, over eating and addictions. These behaviours are maladaptive in the sense of being harmful to the individual, yet become habitual. Other examples of maladaptive behaviour familiar to general medicine are abnormal illness behaviour, and noncompliance of treatment, can also be modified using behavioural techniques.</p>
                        <p>Learning theories have not only been applied to clinical problems of patients, but have also been applied in development of techniques to acquire clinical skills by health professionals. Some of these skills are related to interpersonal relationships. These skills are required for 'bedside' examination of patients, dealing with family members of the patients, and with colleagues, seniors and junior staff. Although personality differences may contribute to variation in this respect, clinical skills have to be developed through the process of learning. Many of such skills are learnt through imitation, modelling and role-playing.</p>
                        <p>There are certain disorders in which individual's ability to acquire new information is impaired (e.g. clouded consciousness, dementia). There are psychological tests to detect and measure the extent of impairment of learning. These are generally based on speed with which new material can be learned by the patient.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Learning is defined as any relatively permanent change in behaviour that occurs as a result of practice or experience. Methods of learning are classified as: classical conditioning, operant conditioning, cognitive learning and social learning, observational learning, latent learning and biological learning. In classical conditioning, a neutral stimulus CS is presented before the unconditioned stimulus (US), that evokes an unconditioned response (UR). As a result of association, the previously neutral stimulus begins to elicit a conditioned response (CR). In operant conditioning, an action of the learner is instrumental in bringing about a change in the environment that makes the action more or less likely to occur again in the future. Reinforcement is basic in this form of learning. Cognitive learning refers to changes in the way information is processed as a result of experience a person has had. Insight learning and sign learning are examples of cognitive learning. Social learning emphasises the role of observation, imitation and modelling in learning. Biological learning places emphasis on differences in the capability of individuals. There are four principles of learning, namely, individual differences in the learner, all learning is contextual, motivation and feedback is important for learning to progress. Learning can be facilitated by defining a definite goal, giving feedback, spacing your study time, learning unit size that is easily grasped, understanding the material rather than rote learning and by avoiding anxiety.</p>
                        <p>There are different learning styles used by the students. These are surface, deep and versatile; these learning styles also influence the learning outcome. In medical education, the students need to adopt their own autonomous approaches to learning. Teachers and education environment play a crucial role in helping students to develop the learning styles.</p>
                        <p>Clinical applications of learning are related to development of phobias, depression and other maladaptive behaviours. Behaviour therapy, social skills training and cognitive therapy are offshoot of learning theories. Learning pathologies cause failure and learning styles determine the learning outcome. Thus faulty learning styles can be modified.</p>
