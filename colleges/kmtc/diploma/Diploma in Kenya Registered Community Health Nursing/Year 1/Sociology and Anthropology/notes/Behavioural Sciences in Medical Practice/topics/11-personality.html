                        <p><em>Sivati, 24 years old female, is pursuing a career in town planning. She is elder of two sisters in a nuclear family. She has had an outstanding academic record. She is very conscientious, overdutiful, perfectionist and rigid which is manifested in all forms of behaviour from handwriting to keeping clothes, things, dressing and other tasks. As she adheres to very high standards of performance, she expects similar standards of performance from others too. This expectation from others often causes anger outburst and creates problems in interpersonal relationship. She is always in a hurry to complete tasks, is not able to relax and often gets severe headache. This is an example of how personality determines behaviour of a person and its relationship in developing illness.</em></p>
                        <p>In our everyday lives we are accustomed to making some kind of assessment of other people. If we are asked to describe someone we know, we are likely to say something about his appearance and other aspects of behaviour, which characterise him as an individual who is different from others. There are always variations in individual's personality development, and functioning which results in a unique personality.</p>

                        <p>Personality is a stable, characteristic way a person feels and behaves in a variety of situations. Personality as a concept is difficult to define and psychologists also differ in their explanation of personality, some mention it in terms of qualities, some as characteristics of person's behaviour or may be both. RB Cattell, (1965) defines it, as that which determines behaviour in a defined situation and a defined mood. The assumption here is that the behaviour of the individual will depend not only on the situation in which he finds himself but also on his emotional state at that time. It is the stability during this period, which allows behaviour to be predictable within limits. Gorctn Allport, a pioneer in personality research has defined personality ' as a dynamic organisation within the individual, of psychological systems that determine his unique adjustments to his environment'. According to Mischel (1976) personality consists of distinctive patterns of behaviour that characterise each individual's adaptation to his life. Reference must also be made to two other terms used synonymously with personalities, character and temperament. Character is a word that tends to be used in a morally judgemental way; the individual is evaluated in terms of cultural norms against which he is seen 'good' or 'bad'. Temperament refers to the emotional responsiveness of a person, such as hot tempered-placid, fearful-unworried.</p>

                        <span class="heading-text">Determinants of Personality</span>
                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Every child is born with certain potentialities. The development of these potentialities depends upon maturation and upon experiences encountered in growing up. The determinants that shape personality are viewed from different perspectives. The major distinction is drawn between biological influences, most likely to be genetically determined and environmental influences determined by family, school, peer group and culture.</p>
                        <h3>Heredity</h3>
                        <p>The relative contributions of heredity in the formation of adult personality have been studied by twin studies and statistical methods.</p>
                        <p>Eysenck studied personality dimensions in identical twins and nonidentical twins and found that the score on the dimensions of extra-version and neuroticism showed no significant correlation between the nonidentical twins but were closely related for the identical twins.</p>
                        <p><strong>Physique:</strong> Further evidence of importance of biological factors in personality comes from individual differences to variation of physique. Kretschmer has given concept of personality types based on physique. The two types being schizothymic and cyclothymic personalities. These two types were correlated to major psychiatric disorders schizophrenia and manicdepressive psychosis respectively. The schizothymic is shy, inward looking with long and narrow body build. This type corresponds to Jung's introvert personality. This cyclothymic is sociable, outward looking, but liable to swings of mood have muscular or fat body build. This types corresponds to Jung's extrovert personality.</p>
                        <p>Sheldon identified three types of physique from a large number of photographs of male college students. According to him there are three personality types associated with functions of, the body organ and systems developed from the embryonic layers. The three types are: (i) the endomorphic, the viscerotonic personality is characterised by a love of comfort and of food, (ii) the mesomorphic, muscular build individuals with a somatotonic personality, are vigorous, active and assertive, (iii) the ectomorphic the cerebrotonic personality is dominated by the central nervous system with inhibition, restraint and little social contact. These physical body types and personality types represent the extreme dimensions rather than categories.</p>
                        <h3>Environment</h3>
                        <p>Personality characteristics are the result of interaction between the individual and the social and physical conditions of the situation. The environmental factors advocate that personality can be acquired. In the process of personality development psychosocial determinants play a crucial role.</p>
                        <p><strong>Family:</strong> A family fulfils the basic physical and psychological needs of children as also seen in Chapter 16. During the early years of development the parents are the role models and through them various behaviours are learned, try to recall the time when you behaved just like your own mother or father. Family also transmits cultural values and norm, which influences your thinking process.</p>
                        <p><strong>School and peer group:</strong> School environment is different in various schools; some emphasise competition, some high academic achievement, and some schools place greater importance to overall development and some devote more time on creativity. The differences in school environment contribute towards personality development of their students. Similarly the peer group influences are well known in the development of adaptive as well as maladaptive personality traits. If you are in the company of high achievers, you are also motivated to do well.</p>
                        <p><strong>Culture:</strong> There has been a considerable amount of research on influence of culture on personality. Some cross-cultural studies have been conducted to study the effect of culture on various personality traits. McClelland found differences between ratings of achievement imagery in TAT stories of school boys in Japan, Germany, Brazil and India. Measures of fielddependence have also shown cross-cultural variations in many studies. The differences have been found in cognitive style and different child rearing practices. It has been found that a perceptual skill required for the performance on test of field-dependence depends upon past experience of similar task and which will vary from one culture to another. Cattell's 16 PF test has also been used to study cultural influences. If we apply cultural differences to study personality differences in our country, you would observe characteristic differences in individuals reared in urban or rural backgrounds. In some of the Indian studies conducted on disadvantaged children, it was found that learning of psychomotor skills was delayed in children with rural background. Similarly, cultural differences on personality can be seen in our context in individuals belonging to different communities like Punjabis, Bengalis, Biharis, Tamilians, etc.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Personality has been studied in a number of ways. The explanation of how people acquire and change the relative aspects of their behaviour comes from different theories of personality. Each personality theory has characteristic implications regarding the meaning of adjustment and deviance. However, two different approaches to study the concept are, the ideographic and the nomothetic-the former emphasises the uniqueness of the individual with intensive investigation of single cases and the latter with generalisation in the form of universal laws. Different theories may adopt any one of the approaches.</p>
                        <p>There are different schools of psychological thought about development of personality. There are number of different approaches to study personality. Cattell (1965) describes three historical phases in the understanding of personality. The oldest, though still continuing to the present day, is the prescientific or literary and philosophical phase. Many of the great poets, novelists and playwriters have, in their writings and especially in the characters have created and conveyed seemingly brilliant insights into the complexities of human nature. The second historical stage is called by Cattell the protoclinical, since it was based largely on observation of psychiatrically sick people by 'founding fathers' of psychiatry like Emil Kraepelin in Germany and Pierre Janet in France, but more especially Sigmund Freud and his early associates Carl Jung and Alfred Adler. Among the personality theories of psychodynamic approach, only the latter theorists would be discussed here. Two major limitations to this essentially descriptive historical phase in psychology are; first, the fact that it was derived from the study of psychological abnormality rather than the 'normal'; and second, the virtual absence of any attempt at measurement.</p>
                        <p>The characteristics of the third stage are evident from Cattell's description of it as quantitative and experimental. In other words, the scientific study of personality based on actual behavioural measurements. Four major theories of personality, psychodynamic, trait and type, social learning and humanistic theories are discussed in this section.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Psychodynamic Theories</h3>
                        <p>The psychodynamic approach is ideographic, arising from observations made, during the course of treatment of psychologically disturbed patients. Psychodynamic approach has received considerable recognition on the basis of Freud's work. According to him, the structure of mind is seen as functionally differentiated into three parts; Id, ego and superego. The unconscious id energises primitive instincts or drives, which are satisfied, by wish-fulfilling fantasies. Id is governed by pleasure principles. The largely conscious ego, gradually develops in order to mediate between the demands of the id and the constraints of the outside world in accordance with the reality principle and guided by the third structure, the superego, which represents the values and controls of society and other controls of society through early identification with the parents and other figures of authority (Fig. 11.1).</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_11_10_5e89b0eccc8308b427a9g-114-1.jpg" alt="A diagram illustrating Freud's concept of personality structure, showing the Superego (Conscious, Preconscious), Ego (Conscious, Preconscious, Unconscious), and Id (Unconscious) in relation to levels of consciousness." class="content-image">
                            <figcaption>Fig. 11.1: Relation of Id, ego and superego</figcaption>
                        </figure>
                        <p>The instinctual energy of the id, mainly in the form of libido is concerned with sex and selfpreservation attached to different erogenous areas of the body-oral, anal and phallic—though as a result of excessive gratification or frustration it may become fixated at a particular stage. Later the libido becomes more outwardly directed as erotic feelings toward the parent of the opposite sex, with rivalry and fear of the parent of the same sex develops into an Oedipus or Electra conflict which should be successfully resolved by identification with the same-sexed parent and repression of the sexual drive during the latency period, until its reawakening at puberty in the final genital stage of development.</p>
                        <p>Another important aspect of psychodynamic theoryconcerns with the defense mechanisms used by the ego to reduce or avoid anxiety. The ego has several defense mechanisms at its disposal to protect itself from being traumatised by the stress arising from these conflicts. But the ego is not always aware of what the needs of the id and superego are, because many of these needs are unconscious. The occurrence of signal anxiety warns the ego that libidinal tensions have become so strong that it must either handle them or be disabled by stress.</p>
                        <p>All the defense mechanism has three characteristics in common: (i) they reduce stress and anxiety, (ii) they deny or distort reality, and (iii) they operate at unconscious level. Some of the common defense mechanisms are: repression, denial, rationalisation, displacement and sublimation, and identification.</p>
                        <p><strong>Repression:</strong> It is the most important defense mechanism. It is the process by which the ego blocks off threatening thoughts or desires and thus keeps them from sweeping into the spotlight of consciousness. Most of these experiences have undischarged libidinal energy attached to them in some way. In repressing these experiences, the ego has to use up some of its own energy sources. And the more painful the memory, or the stronger the unacceptable urge, the more energy the ego must expend in order to keep the material repressed. Eventually the ego may run out of steam, and bits and pieces of the repressed material may leak though to consciousness as slips of the tongue, or as symbols in dreams.</p>
                        <p><strong>Denial:</strong> As you would see during your clinical practice that many patients deny having an illness. Denial is a defense mechanism by which the ego shuts itself off from certain realities, especially which is painful facts.</p>
                        <p><strong>Rationalisation:</strong> Again you would see patients who would give rationalisation for their noncompliance of treatment, e.g. a chronic alcoholic may rationalise for his drinking by saying that the drink provides him energy to earn money which is very important for bringing up of his children. Rationalisation is offering elaborate justifications for behaviours that are illogical or immature.</p>
                        <p><strong>Displacement and sublimation:</strong> The child's ego gains the ability to displace the flow of libidinal energy from one object to another. But the ego may use this ability inappropriately, as a defense mechanism. If the child gets angry with its mother, it dares not hit her because it will be punished. Therefore, it displaces its anger towards a safe object-such as a doll-that cannot retaliate if the child strikes it.</p>
                        <p>Sublimation is a form of displacement and most mature of the defense mechanisms. In this the energy is channeled away from unacceptable to socially acceptable acts. For example, an unmarried female may sublimate her sexual drives in form of painting or art work.</p>
                        <p><strong>Reaction formation:</strong> in reaction formation the ego changes unacceptable love into acceptable hate or vice-versa. If a mother hates a child—a feeling she must deny conscious awareness of—the mother may pat the child with affection. Or the mother's ego may indulge in projection by pretending that the child actually hates her. She thus projects her unacceptable emotions onto the child.</p>
                        <p><strong>Identification:</strong> In the next Chapter 12 on Development-Infancy to Adolescence you will read about psychosexual development theory, which describes Oedipus complex and Electra complex. Many people resolve their Oedipus or Electra crisis by taking on the characteristics of their same-sex parent. The young girl identifies with her mother. In adolescence, the girl identifies with other women and strengthens the conscious portion of her superego. Ego-ideals help to reduce anxiety by allowing the person to release libidinal energy in socially approved ways.</p>
                        <p>Early splits with Freudian psychoanalysis resulted in Alfred Adler's school of individual psychology and Carl Jung's analytical psychology, Adler claimed that even in normal circumstances a child feels helpless and begins to develop a particular strategy or lifestyle, to compensate for feelings of inferiority and to reach the goal of superiority. Adler drew attention to the importance of the ego and nonsexual factors in the personality. Jung also reacted against Freud's emphasis on sex. The motivating force in Jung's view, although still called the libido, was nonsexual and more in the nature of a life force. Jung postulated not only a conscious mind and a personal unconscious, but in addition a much larger collective or racial unconscious containing the beliefs and myths of the individual's race and at a still deeper level, a universal unconscious shared with all humanity. Jung called the collective unconscious archetypes. Psychosocial developmental theory of Erik Erikson (see Chapter 12) who, with Erich Fromm, Karen Horney and Harry Stack Sullivan, comprised the sociologically oriented group known as the neo-Freudians that developed in USA during 1930s. Emphasis was placed on the interpersonal rather than the intrapsychic dimension and on the conflicts, which may arise in relationships between the individual and others as well as within himself. More recently object relations theory, describes 'object' in the sense of a psychologically significant person or part of a person, has stressed the relationship of the individual to such objects. The stages of development are then seen as different means of achieving such relationships (e.g. through feeding at the oral stage), and adult personality as being much influenced by the nature of these early relationships.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Trait and Type Theories</h3>
                        <p>These theories focus on internal influences on personality. According to this viewpoint, personality is consistent from situation-to-situation not because of an emotional outlook coloured by early experience, nor because of universal needs. Rather these explanations focus on specific attributes peculiar to the individual, in some cases physical and in others psychological. Some of these theories divide individuals into distinct categories as being of one type or another. Jung's introverts and extroverts are types. Sheldon's classification according to the physique is also an example of personality types. Trait theories look at individuals not so much in terms of extremes of one type or another but as blends of many different characteristics that individuals have to a greater or lesser extent.</p>
                        <p>Allport differentiated between individual and common traits. A term trait was reserved for common traits and a new term personal disposition was introduced for individual trait. The implication is that a trait may be shared by a number of individuals. According to Allport, a specific act is always the product of many determinants not only of lasting sets, but also of momentary pressures on the person and in the situation. It is the repeated occurrence of acts that allow one to make necessary reference of traits and personal dispositions later on Allport distinguished traits and types in terms of the extent to which they are tailored to the individual. Allport maintained that each of us has a personal disposition made up of a cardinal, central and secondary traits. A cardinal trait is so dominant that it colours virtually every aspect of a person's behaviour and attributes. Central traits are handful of characteristic tendencies that we would ordinarily use to describe a person. The secondary traits are displayed by us from time-to-time, but are not strong enough to be regarded as integral parts of our personality.</p>
                        <p>Cattell assumes that there are natural elements of personality, which can be discovered using the technique of multivariate analysis. Cattell began his researches by taking trait names used in everyday language to describe human behaviour. He then rated individuals on the trait description and inspection of the ratings suggesting that about 40 basic dimensions are involved. The 16 first order or primary factors, which make up 16 PF questionnaires, have been most intensively considered by Cattell and his associates. These factors are called 'source traits'. We all have same traits but to different degrees and in this way, no two individuals are exactly alike.</p>
                        <p>Eysenck (1990) stated that each type is made up of a set of personality characteristics. Three major personality types or dimensions have been listed by Eysenck, namely extroversion, neuroticism and psychoticism. For example people who fit Eysenck's extroverted type are said to be characterised as sociable, lively and excitable. Each one of these characteristics can be broken into a habitual response, which can further be broken down to specific responses within specific situations. This progression from broad to specific responses made Eysenck's approach into a hierarchical theory.</p>
                        <p><strong>The big Five:</strong> There are five basic dimensions, theorised to underlie the many traits used to described human behaviour, known as big five. Each of the dimensions is bipolar, one of the ends of the dimension describes the 'high' pole and the opposite end describes the 'low' pole. These five dimensions are-</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Openness to experience:</strong> creative intellectual and open minded vs. simple, shallow and unintelligent.</li>
                            <li><strong>Conscientiousness:</strong> organised responsible and cautious vs. careless frivolous, irresponsible.</li>
                            <li><strong>Extroversion:</strong> talkative, energetic and assertive vs. quite reserved and shy.</li>
                            <li><strong>Agreeableness:</strong> sympathetic, kind and affectionate vs. cold, quarrelsome and cruel.</li>
                            <li><strong>Neuroticism:</strong> emotionally stable, calm and contented vs. anxious, unstable and temperamental.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The big five theory is a comprehensive descriptive system. This approach accommodates many scientific approaches to personality. These five factors have been included in a personality assessment instrument, the NEO-pi (Caprara et al 1993). This inventory has been used to study personality characteristic in clinical and research studies (Costa and McCrae, 1992).</p>
                        
                        <h3>Social Learning Theories</h3>
                        <p>The social learning approach to personality has derived its main impetus from the behavioural movement in psychology and partly from dissatisfaction with trait approaches. Behavioural psychologists take quite a different approach. Generally speaking, they see personality development as being a set of learned responses. Thus, according to BF Skinner, you became who you are primarily because that is what your social environment has conditioned you to be.</p>
                        <p>Skinner believes that behaviour is, above all else, lawful. By this he means that your actions (and hence your thoughts and emotional responses) are predictable because they are primarily under the control of external, measurable influences. You do not eat because you are "hungry", but rather because you have been conditioned to eat in the presence of certain environmental stimuli. Indeed, "hunger" has no meaning to Skinner because it refers to a subjective "inner state" rather than to an objective set of behaviours. Your "psychic energy" comes not from dynamic forces working deep within your unconscious mind, but from external inputs.</p>
                        <p>Skinner rejects not only all intrapsychic aspects of personality development, but most biological influences as well. Innate reflexes are always modified by experience. If you wish to study personality development, you should focus entirely on how a given society trains its children. For if you change the pattern of "parenting behaviours" in a culture, Skinner believes, you will completely alter the personalities of children reared in that culture. Social learning theories, especially that of Bandura and Walters postulated that all learning need not be direct (see Chapter 5). Imitation according to Bandura and Walters, plays a prominent role in learning. We try to imitate what we observe especially, when we identify with certain models in our environment. The selection of a model again depends on the age, sex, motives, etc. For example A child usually takes mother as a model. They have also pointed out how wrong models could set bad examples to the individual.</p>
                        <p>Situational determinants of behaviour have also been considered in social learning approach. Situations by themselves do not evoke any behaviour but it is given a meaning by the person. Different situations have their own meanings to people. Thus, situations influence one's behaviour in unique manner, on the basis of one's previous learning experience. To summarise, the social learning viewpoint places a great emphasis on the importance of learning and situations in personality. Human behaviour is only a resultant of person, situation variables and their interaction.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Humanistic Approach</h3>
                        <p>A number of theorists have focussed on the concept of 'self' in personality. Self has two distinct sets of feelings. One set has to do with people's attitude about themselves, their self concept and second set relates to the processes by which the individual copes, remembers, thinks and plans. Self concept are central to humanistic theories. Carl Rogers and Abraham Maslow are two most influential humanistic theorists.</p>
                        <p>Rogers believes we are born with no self-concept, and no self-but we do have an innate urge to become fully functioning and actualised people. At birth, all we have is a confusing set of sensory impressions, physiological processes, and motor activities. Rogers calls this sum total of our experience the phenomenal field. As we mature, the outside world imposes a kind of order or logic onto this field. And, as we become aware of this logic, our self emerges and differentiates itself from the phenomenal field. The self is thus the conscious portion of experience.</p>
                        <p>Rogers believes you are most likely to run into developmental problems when society wants you to become something that conflicts with your own internal values or standards. If you yield to the demands of society too much, your psychological experience is distorted and your self-concept suffers accordingly. Most of your experiences are unconscious, i.e. below the threshold of awareness. But you can bring almost any experience above threshold if you merely give the experience a name or a label. That is, you make an unconscious experience conscious by developing word-symbols that allow you to describe (and hence think about) the experience. If a particular event threatens your self concept, then you may refuse to symbolise this even in words or thoughts. But if you cannot tolerate some of your own behaviours, you will have problems achieving full actualisation because you are continually hiding some of your own values or motivations from conscious expression.</p>
                        <p>When you can accept yourself completely, you become what Rogers's calls a fully functioning individual. You are open to all experience and you defend against nothing. You are aware of both your faults and your virtues, but you have a high positive regard for yourself. And, most of all, you maintain happy and humane relationships with others.</p>
                        <p>Abraham Maslow took his ideas about human behaviour from studying highly creative and psychologically healthy people. Maslow assumed these individuals had achieved a high degree of self-fulfillment or they would not have been so prominent and demonstrated such leadership. By determining the similarities among the members of this noted group, he arrived at the characteristics of a truly "self-actualised" person.</p>
                        <p>Most psychoanalytical theories focus on what can go wrong during the developmental years. That is, they emphasise the possibility of sickness, not the probability of success. Maslow's approach is different, for he looks primarily at the healthy side of human nature. As we noted in Chapter 8, Maslow has created a hierarchy of needs, of which self-actualisation is the highest. Maslow acknowledges the strength of our physiological instincts, but sees them as being "basic needs" easily satisfied in most civilised societies. Our drives for food and sex are part of a more impelling intrapsychic urge-an active "will toward health"-that drives us up the developmental ladder toward self-actualisation.</p>
                        <p>Humanistic theories emphasise the importance of people's subjective attitudes feelings and beliefs, especially with regard to self. Theories of this type are often criticised for their heavy reliance on subjective self report data but such data can provide one with respectable insights into people.</p>

                        <p>The idea that personality traits and psychological characteristics play a role in the aetiology of physical disease has its roots in medicine and philosophy before Descartes. Early physicians believed that intense emotions could produce imbalances in bodily function, culminating in various forms of physical pathology. In the first half of this century, the role of chronic emotional conflicts in the aetiology of physical disorders was emphasised. Based on observations of clinical groups, correlations between particular diseases and personality types were reported, and striking psychological similarities among patients suffering from the same organic disease were described. These similarities were formulated and linked to specific disorders such as coronary heart disease (CHD), peptic ulcer, and asthma. Later trait approaches suggested that certain dispositions, such as giving up, depression, and inability to express feelings were related to general susceptibility to illness. Recent studies suggest that epidemiological evidence for a link between Type A and CHD is no longer unequivocal. A number of studies have quantified the degree of coronary artery disease present in patient, undergoing coronary angiography and have correlated disease severity with measures of Type A behaviour. Patients with Type A personality were likely to have severe coronary artery disease in comparison to Type B patients. However, subsequent studies found that Type A was not associated with extensive coronary artery disease.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Behaviour Patterns and Coronary Heart Disease</h3>
                        <p>Behaviour patterns and its relationship to health has been described in our ancient Indian system of medicine, Ayurveda. The fundamentals for prevention of disease and promotive health care were related to the following tenets:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Achaar (conduct)</li>
                            <li>Vichaar (thought)</li>
                            <li>Vyavahaar (interpersonal dealings)</li>
                            <li>Ahaar (nutrition).</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>These four tenets are components of personality and variations in these cause illness both physical and mental. While some of you would not agree that there seems to be an apparent relationship between physical health and our actions, but in all cultures it has been observed that the spiritual component energises and helps in coping with stress. A relaxed mind is certainly more productive than an agitated and tensed one. Tension and stress may lead to wrong decisions, thus to prevent and control stress relaxation exercises should be practiced (Wasir 1995).</p>
                        <p>Considerable attention has been devoted to the study of "coronary-prone" behaviour patterns, and two general patterns have been identified. The first consists of negative, disturbing emotions such as life dissatisfaction, anxiety and depression. Given generally fairly high correlations between these dysphonic characteristics seems reasonable to incorporate them into the broad rubric of "neuroticism". A second example of a "coronary prone behaviour" conceptualisation is the Type A behaviour pattern, which is the most extensively researched psychosocial risk factor of CHD. Individuals with the Type A behaviour pattern are characterised by action emotion complex, struggle to achieve more in short time, autonomous, status conscious, power hungry, inpatience, freefloating hostility. These individuals are intensely ambitious, competitive, short tempered and have time urgency. In contrast, type B individuals are relatively relaxed and easy-going.</p>
                        <p>Type A can be assessed by the structured interview in which individuals are asked to indicate how they usually respond in situations that is likely to elicit competitiveness, impatience and hostility in certain individuals. The evaluation of Type A is primarily based on speech stylistics, such as loudness and explosiveness, content of the answers. A number of questionnaires for assessing Type A exist; the Jenkins Activity Survey (JAS) (Jenkins, 1976) is the most commonly used. Studies that have correlated various Type A measures with other psychological scales. Self report measures correlate more highly with negative emotional states. In a classical study known as the Framingham Heart Study (Haynes, Feinleib and Kannel, 1980) an adhoc scale was used to measure Type A behaviour. Individuals who were classified as Type A were more likely to have developed CHD at the follow up eight years later than were Type B subjects. The framingham scale predicted the development of myocardial infarction alone, angina alone and myocardial infarction with angina.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Type A and Physiological Reactivity</h3>
                        <p>Since associations between Type A and ischaemic heart disease cannot be explained solely by the standard coronary risk factors, research has attempted to determine physiologic mechanisms linking Type A to disease. Most explanations for this link suggest that behaviours exhibited by Type A individuals are accompanied by sympathetic neuroendocrine and cardiovascular responses, which might promote the development of coronary atherosclerosis or precipitate its clinical symptoms of ischaemic heart disease.</p>
                        <p>The results of this study suggest that there may be an underlying psychobiological or "constitutional" basis for Type A behaviour in cardiac patients. The impatience, hostility and speech patterns exhibited by Type A patients with manifest disease may, in part, reflect underlying sympathetic nervous system hyperactivity. This view is different from, but not necessarily contradictory with, the idea that Type A appraisals or behaviours produce elevated sympathetic responses. If Type A is a consequence of sympathetic hyperactivity, then Type A behaviour might be suppressed by treatment techniques that decreased sympathetic responsiveness. Beta-blockers such as propranolol are commonly used to treat cardiovascular disorders. These drugs antagonise certain sympathetic nervous system responses that would otherwise be activated by epinephrine. These responses occur primarily in organs such as the heart, and in smooth muscle of the blood vessels and lungs.</p>

                        <p>Personality has been of great clinical importance, as you would recall that no two patients even with a similar disease are same. The reactions to the illness have been found to be related to personality. An extrovert and an introvert may react differently to the restrictions imposed by illness. Someone with poor self-concept and selfesteem may feel further threatened by an illness as it produces feeling of failure to meet the demands of coping with illness. On the other hand, an individual habitual of using defense mechanism of projection may tend to blame others for his illness and find faults with the hospital system. The way a patient construes illness in general, and his own in particular, in relation to other aspects of life, will determine his response to it; an individual's strength of achievement motivation may be significant in relation to any disability threatening his career; that a sensation seeker would find any degree of sensory deprivation from illness particularly stressful; that those whose locus of control is internal may be vulnerable to the dependence on others often entailed by illness. Thus an understanding of patient's personality can help the physicians in providing specific treatment strategies. For example, when you realise that the patient X is taking secondary gains from her illness and thus is not showing any improvement, then providing attention to the healthy behaviour and ignoring illness behaviour would help the patient to recover soon.</p>
                        <p>From a more psychiatric standpoint, some knowledge of a person's 'normal' or 'previous' personality can be important in order to detect changes, which may have occurred as a consequence of disease either organic or psychological and also to assess the degree of recovery from such illness. An individual's personality will also 'colour' the clinical picture of any psychiatric disorder that he develops, so that it will never be identical with that of another patient. According to Eysenck the personality type determined the nature of illness for example, introverts are more prone to depression, anxiety, schizophrenia. The extroverts are more prone to disorders like somatoform and hypomania. Similarly personality has influence on the psychophysiological disorders. Studies have tried to correlate personality patterns of individuals with disorders such as irritable bowel symptoms, ulcerative colitis, headaches, etc.</p>
                        <p>There are some people whose personalities depart, in various ways, from the norm to such an extent that they experience difficulties themselves, resulting in anxiety or depression, or cause difficulties to others in their attempts to cope with the normal pressures and responsibilities of life; they may therefore be diagnosed as having a personality disorder.</p>
                        <p>Personality disorders themselves are classified into a number of types in a way that is generally quite different from that of the personality theories we have been considering. The definitions of the various personality disorders are essentially derived from clinical experience often being seen as personality 'equivalents' of particular psychiatric disorders (e.g. the 'schizoid' personality and schizophrenia, the 'hysterical' personality and hysteria).</p>
                        <p>Personality has been correlated with the studying skills. As a student you would be interested in knowing that certain personality characteristic predict greater academic success. Introverted boys and extroverted girls generally perform better in the academic performances. Since personality also influences which is interactional abilities hence in a working environment like hospitals where teamwork of multiple disciplines is required, understanding of personality is of greater relevance.</p>

                        <p>Personality is a stable characteristic way a person feels and behaves in a whole variety of situations. Different psychologists view personality differently but many agree to the view that it is an interaction between the behaviour and a given situation. Character and temperament though different are terms used synonymous with personality.</p>
                        <p>Every child is born with certain potentialities. The determinants, which shape personality, are viewed from different perspectives. A distinction is drawn between biological influences, i.e. genetically determined and environmental influences determined by family, school, peer group and culture.</p>
                        <p>Personality has been studied in a number of ways by different theorists. These are psychodynamic theoretic by Freud, Jung, Adler and Erikson. According to Freud the interaction between the id, ego and superego results in personality development. Various defense mechanisms help to reduce stress and anxiety. The type and trait theories classify individuals according to types like introvert, extrovert and traits are personal dispositions. The traits can be cardinal, central and secondary. The big five factor theory includes five basic traits which broadly cover different traits given by all other theorists. The social learning theories emphasise role of learning and environmental situation in personality development. According to Humanistic theorists, self-concept, self-esteem and self-actualisation are related to success.</p>
                        <p>Early, physician believed that intense emotions could produce imbalances and bodily function, culminating in various forms of physical pathology.
