                        <p>Motivation means 'to move' and is defined as an internal process that provides energy for behaviour and directs it towards a specific goal. Motive in a person helps to infer, explain and predict his behaviour. Motivation is a general term for all the processes involved in starting directing and maintaining physical and psychological activities, it can be understood by studying the underlying urges, wants, needs, desires and goals. Drive refers to biological motivation like hunger. Motives refer to psychological and social needs that are assumed to be learned through personal experience.</p>
                        <h3>Indicators of Motivation</h3>
                        <p>The following are some of the measurable qualities and events that indicate motivation underlying behaviour:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The more motivated an organism is, the higher will be its level of activity.</li>
                            <li>Strong motivation increases an individual's rate of learning.</li>
                            <li>Motivation enables one to attain a higher level of performance.</li>
                            <li>Once learned, a motivated response will be more resistant to extinction.</li>
                            <li>Being motivated in one task can disrupt efforts in other activities.</li>

                        <span class="heading-text">Models of Motivation</span>
                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Various models have been proposed to understand motivation. Some of the important models are drive and homeostatic model.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Drive Model</h3>
                        <p>It is assumed that each organism is born with or later develops a variety of biological needs. A need is something that is required physiologically, for example, the need for food, water, and the elimination of bodily wastes. When a sufficient amount of time passes during which a need is not satisfied, a relevant drive is aroused. Subjectively, we decide that we are hungry or thirsty and are directed to act in order to overcome the unpleasant state.</p>
                        <p>Once the individual is in a high drive state, there is a readiness to respond to external stimuli that are related to the aroused drive. These stimuli are known as incentives. When our drives are activated, we move toward such incentives as the food or water, in the refrigerator or the kitchen. Much of our behaviour is directed by incentives. An incentive may be thought of as an appropriate object or activity for satisfying a need. Once the incentive has been obtained, the individual engages in consummatory behaviour. That is, he eats or drinks. Such activity satisfies the need in question and is said to be the goal of the motivated behaviour. Obtaining such a goal reduces the aroused drive, and this drive reduction acts as a reward or positive reinforcement. Once a need is satisfied, the organism becomes relatively inactive again. The general cycle of events is illustrated in Figure 8.1. It may be seen, then, that motivation energises the organism to seek an appropriate goal by approaching relevant incentives. Motivation also accounts for the tendency to be persistent in this behaviour until the need is satisfied.</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_11_10_5e89b0eccc8308b427a9g-079-1.jpg" alt="A circular diagram illustrating the Drive Cycle: Need leads to Drive, which leads to Incentive, then to Goal, then back to Need." class="content-image">

                        </figure>
                        <p>Within this general model, drive is often said to be a stimulus for behaviour. That is, when a need is unsatisfied, various internal stimuli are activated, and these stimuli lead to responses. Any strong, persistent stimulus can have properties to be a drive for example, a very brightlight or an unpleasant loud noise will cause an individual to close his or her eyes or cover his or her ears, and if possible to move away from the annoying stimulus. In such instances, there is no need deprivation in the usual sense but rather an external stimulus that acts as a drive. It has been suggested that individuals act to avoid intense external stimulation are motivated by the 'need to avoid pain'.</p>
                        
                        <h3>The Homeostatic Model</h3>
                        <p>Homeostasis refers to the regulatory process that impels us to eat when we are hungry and to stop eating when we have had enough, to drink when we are thirsty and to stop drinking when that need is satisfied, and so on. There is a natural tendency toward balance that serves to keep our internal environment at a relatively constant state with respect to the various needs.</p>
                        <p>Both the drive model and the homeostatic model are based on a common assumption, namely that an organism when aroused strives to return to a quiet, stable state. A more inclusive view suggests that drive induction and drive reduction can each be reinforcing under appropriate circumstances.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Anxiety as a drive</h4>
                        <p>The concept of anxiety as a drive was based on the assumption that this is a relatively stable characteristic in which individuals differ. Anxiety has been classified as a trait and as a state. Trait anxiety is considered as a personality variable. Those who were anxious would be expected to experience anxiety in a variety of situations. State anxiety refers to a temporary condition of arousal in response to particular situations. For example, even if you are not a particularly anxious person (trait), you might feel very upset as you sit in a dentist's waiting room (state).</p>
                        <p>It has been proposed that individuals who are characteristically anxious and tense must ordinarily experience a higher drive level than calm, placid individuals. If so, those high in anxiety should, when compared with those low in anxiety, demonstrate greater response strength with respect to various habits. As an example of such effects, consider what happens when an experienced driver sees a small child suddenly coming in front of his car. The well-learned, wellpracticed habit of stepping on the brake is much stronger than any competing habit, so it is very likely to occur. If such a driver were extremely anxious, the braking response would be even more likely to occur-more quickly and with greater force. Imagine the same situation with someone who is just learning to drive. Many new habits are being learned, and they are about of equal strength. If a child dashes in front of the car, a new driver may be equally inclined to step on the brake, step on the accelerator, or honk the horn. If that person were highly anxious, it would only complicate matters since all of the responses (both appropriate and inappropriate) would be strengthened by such a drive state. Extremely bright individuals do well even if they are anxious. Those who are extremely dull do badly even if their anxiety is low. In the middle range, though, it is clear that highly anxious students do less well on exams, obtain lower grades and are more likely to leave school (Spielberger, 1966). Students with high anxiety can be helped by assessing the severity of anxiety and then providing therapy to reduce their anxiety (see Chapter 20).</p>
                        
                        <h3>Humanistic Model</h3>
                        <p>Some theorists have proposed more complex system of categorising needs. Abraham Maslow (1970) has classified motivation into a hierarchy consisting of seven separate needs. As shown in Figure 8.2, these range from the most necessary requirements for survival to the most important expressions of the human potential. Let us look briefly at each of the five levels.</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_11_10_5e89b0eccc8308b427a9g-080-1.jpg" alt="Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs, shown as a pyramid with Physiological needs at the base, followed by Safety, Belonging and Love, Esteem, Cognitive, Aesthetic, and Self-actualisation at the top." class="content-image">
                            <figcaption>Fig. 8.2: Hierarchy of needs</figcaption>
                        </figure>
                        <p><strong>Physiological needs:</strong> These are the primary motives that serve to keep the individual alive and to permit the continuation of the species.</p>
                        <p><strong>Safety needs:</strong> In addition to mere survival, there is the need to avoid pain, to obtain bodily comforts, and to be free from fear and insecurity. These are said to be powerful, lower-order needs.</p>
                        <p><strong>Need to belong and to love:</strong> The higher-order needs begin with the desire to obtain security by means of identification with a group? For this reason, we seek to identify with our families, with our school, our organisation, our religion, our nation, our race, and so forth. Somehow, we feel better about ourselves as individuals when we are able to find our roots in a larger body of people, i.e. experience love. Besides, having a lower-order need for sexual release, we have a higher-order need for the feelings of affection and love - both to give and to receive. Establishing at least a loving relationship with one individual.</p>
                        <p><strong>Esteem needs:</strong> Each of us wants to feel that he is a worthwhile individual who counts for something. This includes the feeling of competence or mastery of the environment, and also the need to accomplish and achieve. In addition, self-esteem is said to be highest if we can be independent and free.</p>
                        <p><strong>Cognitive needs:</strong> Individuals have an innate need to make sense of various aspects of their external environment. This forms the need for knowledge and understanding.</p>
                        <p><strong>Aesthetic needs:</strong> These constitute the needs for order and beauty, which individuals strive for in their lives and external environment.</p>
                        <p><strong>Self-actualisation needs:</strong> The highest of all needs are met if an individual can achieve selfactualisation. This is a rather complex concept involving the need to know all that we can, about ourselves and about the world around us, the need to create and to appreciate beauty, and the tendency to be a spontaneous and innerdirected achiever.</p>
                        <p>In Maslow's view, each of us would progress smoothly up this hierarchy as each set of lower needs is met. We would each become secure, creative 'self-actualisers'. However, harsh environmental conditions can force people to spend their entire lives working very hard just to meet the lower-order needs.</p>
                        <p>In addition, changes in the solution can very quickly propel an individual back down the hierarchy. Many times, a person will have a lowerorder need that is not met, and higher-order needs will be ignored as the person is strongly motivated to eat, to obtain sexual gratification, or to find a bathroom. There also can be a serious disruption of one's life that can force a total concentration on the basic needs. For example, a painful illness or some natural or man-made disaster can turn even the most creative, self-actualised person into an individual concerned only with safety and survival. In the recent past many well-established Kashmiri immigrants both intellectuals and businessmen were seen to be having such basic survival problems.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Social Cognitive Model</h3>
                        <p>Social cognitive model of motivation share the concept that human motivation comes not from objective realities but from our subjective interpretation of them. You often experience that if you think that achieving a particular goal is important for you then under any circumstances you work to reach that goal. That means what we do is controlled by what we think is responsible for causing our action, what we believe we can do and anticipate the outcome of our efforts. Social cognitive model gives importance to higher mental processes that control motivation rather than physiological arousal or biological mechanism. Locus of control is another concept given by Julian Rotter to understand social learning model. According to this model an individual will engage in a given behaviour is determined by two factors. One is expectations of attaining a goal and the other is the personal value of that goal. Expectations of a future occurrence are based on our past experience, which helps in developing a personal sense of locus of control. Often we find that student's who are poor in studies do not have motivation to study because they do not anticipate a positive outcome of their studies. Locus of control can be internal or external. When a person thinks the outcome of our actions can be controlled by our efforts that is internal control. On the contrary, if one believes that the outcome is controlled by external factors for example, a student thinks that his poor marks are due to teacher's bias that is called external control.</p>

                        <span class="heading-text">Classification of Motives</span>
                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Needs are often an important component in studying motivation. They are classified into primary and secondary motives, the primary or physiological necessities are: hunger, thirst, a desire for sex, temperature regulation, sleep, pain avoidance and need for oxygen. The secondary or learned, acquired desires are: achievement, power, affiliation, aggression, autonomy, nurturance and play. The secondary motives are also called as social motives because they are learned in social groups, in the family, in the school, and with peer group. The social motives are general, persisting characteristics of a person and they differ in strength from individual-toindividual because they are learned. This classification of motives is a useful one, but the distinction can become somewhat blurred. That is, learned appetites and aversions influence the satisfaction of primary motives, and the satisfaction of secondary motives can become closely tied to biological processes. For example, does your desire to earn money involve the instrumental use of money to buy something basic such as food? Is it used instead to buy some product that would provide you instant popularity in the hostel? Or, is the money to be acquired purely for its own sake, because you have learned to enjoy a huge bank balance. It seems that much of what we do can be identified as a mixture of primary and secondary motivation.</p>
                        <h3>Hunger Motive</h3>
                        <p>While most of us take for granted the daily activity of eating, food means more than fuel for the body with symbolic associations. Food may symbolise love, social bonding, and the display of affluence. The way we eat may reflect our attitudes toward our families, our society, and ourselves.</p>
                        <p>How does our body tell us we need food? We are more likely to feel the stirrings of appetite, but very poor persons have the pangs of a body depleted by hunger. In either case, however, the underlying mechanism is probably the same. A basic signal for hunger is the presence of stomach contractions. When the stomach is empty, contractions occur and are sensed. More recently the research in this field has indicated that levels or rates of use of dissolved nutritive substances circulating in the blood are crucial for the activation of feeding. Low level of glucose (sugar) in the blood is now believed to be an important cause in the initiation of hunger motivation. Hypothalamus is also involved in hunger motivation, as indicated by some experiments. However we all are aware that hunger motivation is not entirely governed by the internal stimulation. A host of external factors are also responsible in initiating hunger motivation.</p>
                        <h3>Achievement Motive</h3>
                        <p>People are very different from one another in their desire to compete and to win at whatever they undertake. It has been proposed that differences reflect variations in the learned motive to achieve (Atkinson, 1977). Achievement is taskoriented behaviour that allows the individual's performance to be evaluated according to some internally or externally imposed criterion. Achievement motivation can be seen in many areas of human endeavour such as school, job, sports or art performance such as painting, singing, dancing. Achievement motivation is learned, children copy from their parents and other important persons in their lives. The expectations of the parents from their children are important in development of this motivation. It has been found that high achievers generally have high achieving mothers.</p>
                        <p>Achievement motive has been associated with the behaviour. High achievement oriented behaviour expresses in many ways such as, persistence, taking challenges, high aspirations, constant need for feedback and control over the environment. These individuals are generally most successful in their profession provided their need for competition is not very strong.</p>
                        <h3>Aggression Motive</h3>
                        <p>An aggression is intended to hurt someone or something. In most places aggression leads to violence, destructive action against people or property. At other times the aggressive impulse is confined to competition, verbal attack, or some other expression of hostility short of physical injury. When we talk about aggression, then, we are talking about behaviour that the doer engages in with the intention of doing harm. It could be in the form of verbal attack, physical injury, violence or destructive action against people or property only.</p>
                        <p>Hormones and chemicals do not produce aggressive behaviour itself. What they do is to lower our threshold for expression of aggression. Very often aggression is the response to frustration (the thwarting of some goal directed behaviour), insults, and negative evaluations. Frustration does not always bring about aggression; however, it is likely to lead to aggression only when it is intense and unexpected or arbitrary. You are less likely to become angry when you are refused a job if you had not counted on getting it and if you think the interview was fair. Furthermore, frustrated individuals are not likely to become aggressive, no matter how angry they get, unless the stage is set for aggression. This stage setting may consist of cues for aggression, such as an atmosphere that promotes violence (communal riots, setting fire to religious places), the presence of weapons that remind you how they can be used to hurt someone, or a previous dislike for the person who frustrated you (Berkowitz, 1967).</p>
                        <p>Children learn from an early age that calling people names is almost sure to make them angry, and laboratory researchers have confirmed the aggression-eliciting power of insults by acting rudely toward subjects, sometimes questioning their intelligence. Negative evaluation given by teachers has often resulted in frustration in the students.</p>
                        <p>How do we learn to be aggressive? We learn aggressive behaviour from the people around us. Parents usually teach their children not to hit other children especially smaller children, and other adults. But when parents themselves behave aggressively, they become role models for their children. Parents exert a great deal of influence over children's aggressiveness. One major study found that the parents of children who were aggressive in school were less nurturant and accepting, punished their children for aggression at home, and, in general, gave them little support (Eron, 1980).</p>
                        <p>We learn aggression from television serials. At present there are many programmes both meant for adults and children like WWF in which children see lots of aggression and violence. Later they try to imitate these aggressive stunts. While some people argue that viewing aggression or even acting it out to a limited degree helps to drain off aggressive energy. But acting aggressively is likely to make someone more, rather than less, aggressive. And the bulk of the research on viewing aggression indicates that children who watch a lot of television learn that we live in a society that condones aggression in many situations, and they learn what to do when they feel aggressive themselves (Bandura, 1973). But when parents let their children know that violence is not an acceptable means of settling disputes, then watching TV does not lead to more aggression.</p>

                        <p>Most psychologists believe that a basic motivational system underlies exploratory behaviour and curiosity and arousal are related in important ways. Anyone who has ever spent much time in the company of a three year old knows that human beings are very curious creatures from a very early age. We want to know about everything in our lives-why people act as they do, why events occur, how things work, what is on the other side of a hill, a mountain, and an ocean. To satisfy our curiosity we begin as infants to touch, to put new objects in our mouths. As we grow older, we continue to process the information that comes in through all our senses, we explore our surroundings, we ask questions, we study, we think. We seem to do many things for no intrinsic reward other than satisfying our curiosity.</p>

                        <p>You would have experienced some time in your life that you have to choose one between two attractive offers, both of them being motivating to some degree. Motivation researchers have classified such competing motives into the following four categories.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Approach approach conflicts</strong> occur when you are simultaneously attracted to two desirable outcomes or activities, as in a situation when you are trying to decide which of two good courses you should take up for career.</li>
                            <li><strong>Avoidance avoidance conflicts</strong> arise when you are repelled by two or more undesirable outcomes or activities. Suppose there is a required course in computers that you have to take and that clashes with your most important clinical posting or clashes with your exam time. Still, you know that if you want to graduate, you have to choose one of these unwanted alternatives.</li>
                            <li><strong>Approach avoidance conflicts</strong> come up when a single option has both positive and negative elements. Suppose you are asked to speak to a group that can be influential in helping you to get a good job, but you are terrified of speaking in public. In this kind of conflict, individuals sometimes adopt unhealthy means to combat anxiety.</li>
                            <li><strong>Multiple approach avoidance conflicts</strong> are the ones we most often face in life. These involve situations in which several options exist, with each one containing both positive and negative elements. Not surprisingly, these are the hardest to resolve, and the most stressful.</li>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>There can be two major applications of knowledge of motivation to clinical field. First, it can be of help in understanding the wide range of behaviours of patients in relation to their illness and treatment. Psychological response of patients to their disabling illness is likely to differ according to the degree of dependency or dominance needs of the patient. Second, it is concerned with the problems, which arise directly from abnormalities of drives of their goals. The aggressive drive appears to be expressed to a pathological degree in some individuals, who may thereby be a danger to others a so-called aggressive psychopath. Sexual deviations occur in which the aim of the sex drive departs to varying degrees from the usual goal of heterosexual intercourse, sometimes with an admixture of aggression as in sado-masochism. Such abnormalities are seen in patients having psychological disorders. One of the explanations for such behaviour is based on approachavoidance model where, possibly owing to earlier experience, the 'normal' sexual object is both attractive and frightening, so that either an intermediate position between approach and avoidance is chosen, (e.g. voyeurism or indecent exposure) or a less aversive object (e.g. small girls instead of adult women).</p>
                        <p>Importance of motivation is of prime importance in psychiatric disorders. Schizophrenia, a common feature, particularly in the later stages of a chronic illness, is a loss of motivation so that the patient becomes apathetic and generally inactive. Current trends of treatment are focussed on enhancing motivation in these patients. Seligman (1975) has given a concept of' Learned Helplessness', which has been applied to aetiology of depressive disorders. Learned helplessness means that the depressed person is convinced that he is out of control, nothing he can do would make any difference in changing an important feature of his life. Since they believe they can't do anything to change a situation, they don't have any motivation even to try. Learned helplessness is a traumatic experience as one who feels powerless to escape from stressful situations often gives up and die. Learned helplessness is also reported at times by patients with chronic illness, elderly and institutionised persons.</p>
                        <p>Other disorders of motivation are found in such conditions as alcohol and drug dependence and over-eating leading to obesity. Since these disorders are on the increase thus shall be discussed at length later in this section. Motivation for apparently self-injurious behaviour can be understood in terms of the needs that it satisfies or the rewards that it brings-though often in the short term. The child who repeatedly gets into trouble, through 'misbehaviour' knowing fully well that he will be punished, may be motivated (though without being aware of it) by the fact that only by so doing will he receive more attention from others.</p>
                        <p>The degree of control exerted over the overt expression of basic drives-such as sex and aggression may be weakened by organic disease affecting the functioning of the brain. The first signs of such disease may sometimes be the appearance of behaviour quite 'out of character for the individual. Such a change of personality may therefore, be an important in dictation for clinical assessment for neurological disease.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Motivational Basis of Addictive Behaviour</h3>
                        <p>Alcoholism is a condition in which heavy drinking interferes with an individual's ability to function effectively in dealing with other people and in working. Similar problems are also present in patients with drug addiction. There has been a great deal of research directed to discover the way in which we acquire this powerful and often dangerous motive. Three major factors seem to be involved.</p>
                        <p>First, there are the basic learning processes that underlie the acquisition of any motive. If an individual grows up in a society in which adults drink whenever they want to celebrate something and whenever they want to relax and have fun, such activity clearly is associated with positive feelings. Individuals tend to model their behaviour after that of others. Experimental subjects have been found to drink more when exposed to a stranger who drinks heavily than when the stranger is a light drinker or does not drink at all. In addition, by adolescence there are often strong peer pressures to drink.</p>
                        <p>Second, in addition to external sources of rewards for drinking, alcohol itself can provide a powerful reinforcement. It is a depressant drug that acts on the central nervous system to bring feelings of relaxation and reduced anxiety. The fact that a few drinks can very quickly relieve tension and fears means that drinking is easily learned as a method of dealing with stress.</p>
                        <p>Third, 'alcoholic' individuals may have a special physiological weakness that results in a craving for alcohol. Several biological differences between alcoholics and nonalcoholic have been identified. For example, problem drinkers feel less physical pain when they consume alcohol, but social drinkers actually feel more pain after a few drinks. The fact that it is possible to breed animals that drink alcohol readily while others of the same species avoid it suggests that a genetic factor is involved.</p>
                        <p>A complex combination of cultural, psychological, and physiological factors contributes to drinking behaviour and to alcoholism.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Eating Disorders</h3>
                        <p>Raju aged 12, weighing 88 kgs was referred from endocrinology OPD. All his investigations were normal; no physiological or endocrinological cause for his abnormal weight could be elicited. During psychological assessment his father's motive to get the child's name in Guiness Book of World Record was noted. Through this he wanted to get a large amount of money. Father always reported that the child has normal appetite and a small amount of food was given to him, but in reality the child was always overfed. This is an example of motivation for one type of problem related to eating. In India obesity has always been present but was not considered a problem. Now with awareness about its harmful effects, as it prevents a normal life and is a menace to health, people have become concerned about it and more and more people are seeking treatment for obesity.</p>
                        <p>It is not uncommon to find that the excessive intake is due to actual feelings of hunger than to eating, becoming associated with needs other than the food itself to reduce feelings of anxiety or unhappiness, for example in a depressed state people tend to eat more.</p>
                        <p>Two other kinds of eating disorders, which seem to have become more common in recent years, especially among young women, are anorexia nervosa, a form of self-starvation that can actually lead to death, and bulimia, in which an individual regularly eats vast quantities of food and then purges the body of them either by induced vomiting or laxative use.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Losing Weight by Applying Motivational Principles</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Eat only at one place at regular times: This will help you cut down on snacking, by limiting the number of places and times that have associations with eating.</li>
                            <li>Eat slowly: This helps you get the most pleasure from the least amount of food, helps you fool yourself into thinking you are eating more than you actually are, and gives your body time to give you feedback on when you have had enough.</li>
                            <li>Do not do anything else while you are eating such as reading or watching television, so that you can concentrate on your food and be more responsive to your body's internal cues.</li>
                            <li>Reduce the availability of fattening foods. If you cannot resist seine high calorie food of your choice, do not bring them home. If you buy nuts, buy them with their shells on so you will have to expend more effort to eat them, you will eat less.</li>
                            <li>Allow for some variety in your diet, if you deprive yourself of all the foods you love, you will binge when you get the chance so it is better to incorporate a small serving of high-calorie food into your menu plan instead of avoiding it completely. However, since people eat more food when faced with a large variety, limit your meals to a few basic dishes instead of wide choice.</li>
                            <li>Avoid fatty and rich-tasting foods as the look; smell, and taste seem to stimulate the appetite.</li>
                            <li>Eat in the company of other people who are moderate eaters themselves, you will be inclined to eat more moderately when other people are witnesses to what you eat. Also you will be able to guide your intake by theirs.</li>
                            <li>Use small serving plates; food heaped on a small plate looks more than the same amount on a large plate. Take advantage of this visual illusion to fool you into eating less.</li>
                            <li>Incorporate exercise into your daily schedule. Aside from the direct expenditure of energy in the activity itself, exercise seems to reduce appetite. Programmes that combine dieting, changes in behaviour, and exercise result in more weight loss than any one of these changes alone. The most effective exercise schedules include sessions of at least 20 minutes each, three times a week, of activities that are strenuous enough to expend 300 calories per session or to raise the heart rate to 60 to 70 per cent of its maximum (Thompson et al 1982). This generally means like swimming, running, bicycling, dancing, or some other kind of aerobic activity (requiring high consumption of oxygen for a sustained period of time) rather than a more static exercise like weight lifting or sit-ups.</li>

                        <p>Motivation is the force that energies and gives direction to behaviour and that underlies the tendency to persist. According to drive model, once the individual is in high drive state, there is a readiness to respond to external stimuli that are related to the arousal drive. Once the incentive is achieved that satisfies the drive. Among the models, the homeostatic model discusses a natural tendency of the body towards maintaining balance that serves to keep our internal environment at a relatively constant state with respect to various needs.lt proposes that individuals who are characterised anxious and tense must ordinarily experience a high drive level than calm, placid individuals. Maslow has given humanistic model of motivation, wherein five stages are given namely-physiological, safety needs, belongingness, esteem needs and self-actualisation. The cognitive social model emphasises on the expectations an individual has about himself to reach to goal and the meaning of that goal for the individual. Locus of control can be internal (conditions are within the control of the person) or external (Conditions are controlled by other people or situations).</p>
                        <p>Motives are classified as primary motive, the physiological secondary motive, the learned or acquired desires. A low level of glucose in blood does not only indicate hunger motives but also include symbolic content of the food as love and sharing. People are different from one another in their desire to compete and win at whatever they undertake. Achievement motivation may be learned, there may be a dominant pattern with high achieving motives and is also associated with individual's behaviour as being persistent, challenging, high aspirant, etc.</p>
                        <p>Aggression motive is inclusive of the behaviour that the doer engages with an intention of doing harm in form of verbal attack, physical injury, violence or destructive action against people or property. Very often aggression is a response to intense frustration. We learn to be aggressive by observing our parents, the attitudes prevalent in the society and by observing television. Most psychologists' believe that a basic motivational system underlies exploratory behaviour and curiosity and arousal being related in important ways.</p>
                        <p>Frustration is the result of conflict between the competing motives. The conflicts are classified as: approach- approach, approach - avoidance, avoidance - avoidance, and multiple approach - avoidance conflict.</p>
                        <p>The shady of motivation has two major clinical applications: firstly, it can be of help in understanding the wide range of behaviours of patients in relation to their illness and treatment. Secondly, it is concerned with the problems, which arises directly from abnormalities of drives (sexual deviations and aggression). Motivation enhancement is becoming an important aspect in all treatments regimens as it relates to compliance. The outcome of some treatment intervention depends to some degree on the motivation of the patient.</p>
