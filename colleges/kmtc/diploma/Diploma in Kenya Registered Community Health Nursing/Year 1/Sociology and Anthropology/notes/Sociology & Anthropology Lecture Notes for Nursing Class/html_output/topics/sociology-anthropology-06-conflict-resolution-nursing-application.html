                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h4>Introduction</h4>
                        <p>In this section you will study conflict resolution and the negotiation process. As you have already noted, the society assigns different status to individuals according to their roles. Following these differences in status, there is bound to be tension between persons with high status and those with lower status.</p>
                        <p>For example, there may be a conflict between a matron in charge of a ward and a group of nurses over the allocation of various duties in the ward. Some nurses may feel that some of their colleagues always get lighter duties in the shift such as drug administration and conducting rounds, while they are left to do the rest of the work like bed making, distributing bedpans and such like duties. The group that feels discriminated against may even threaten to take their complaints to the Hospital's Chief Nurse if they are not addressed. The matron then has to come up with a quick solution to this conflict before it reaches the Chief Nurse. One option for the Matron would be to call a meeting of all the nurses in order to come up with an agreement that both sides are happy with. Once an agreement is reached, it should be written down and signed by all present.</p>
                        <p>A general principle of resolving conflict is acknowledging the needs of each group and reaching a compromise for both. Remember that conflicts will always occur where there are power relationships, for example, employee/employer, student nurse/nursing officer in charge, parents/children and many more. This may be because of different roles and needs (see section three on social stratification).</p>
                        
                        <h4>Objectives</h4>
                        <p>By the end of this section you will be able to:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Define conflict</li>
                            <li>Identify factors that may contribute to conflicts</li>

                        <h3>Conflict</h3>
                        <p>Conflict is a person's struggle with him/herself, another person, or a thing. It is a problem or disagreement and results in a situation that needs resolution. Conflict is present in every person's life. According to Powler, conflict is defined as a fight, a struggle with others or groups, also as a collision or clashing of opposed principles. It is inescapable. However, conflict can be dealt with creatively, if a person has the right tools.</p>
                        
                        <h4>What is Conflict Resolution?</h4>
                        <p>Conflict resolution is the process of finding a way to manage or solve a problem. There are several methods of conflict resolution. Some result in win-lose solutions, while others can be win-win. Through programs like peer mediation, children learn to go for the win-win solution!</p>
                        
                        <h4>Situations That May Lead to Conflict</h4>
                        <p>Factors that may contribute to conflict are varied. Here are some examples of the situations where conflict may arise:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>During the process of adjustment to forced change</li>
                            <li>When various groups are not in agreement</li>
                            <li>When some societal groups feel left out when new agreements are being implemented</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h3>Conflict Resolution Styles</h3>
                        <p>There are many different ways of resolving conflict. The three most common ways are fight, flight and flow.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Fight</h4>
                        <p>In a fight, two or more people are aggressive with one another. Fighting can be done with words, weapons or fists. Following a battle of some description there will be a winner and a loser, or both may lose.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Flight</h4>
                        <p>In a flight situation, one party walks away from the conflict. The problem is left unresolved and there may be a winner and a loser. Common 'flight' language includes 'never mind', 'just forget it' and 'whatever'.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Flow</h4>
                        <p>In a flow situation both people walk away from the conflict satisfied with the solution which they have reached together. Conflict resolution encourages everyone to 'go with the flow' and create solutions!</p>
                        
                        <h3>Skills to Resolve Conflict Peacefully</h3>
                        <p>The first thing you need is a willingness to work toward a win-win solution. Then there are several helpful skills to guide you through the process:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Be an active listener</li>
                            <li>Look and listen for the other person's feelings</li>
                            <li>Look for anger cues and triggers</li>
                            <li>Maintain good eye contact</li>
                            <li>Use a calm voice</li>
                            <li>Make sure you have 'cooled down' before trying to work things out</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h3>Resolving Conflicts at a Government Level</h3>
                        <p>There are several ways of resolving conflicts at the government level. You will look at each of these in detail.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Appointing a Commission</h4>
                        <p>A commission is a group of people, usually professionals in a certain field who are selected to look into a problem more keenly, so as to come up with a solution. One example is if the prices of basic items continue rising, the government may establish a commission to look into the effect of this increase on workers' wages. The commission/committee is given the mandate to suggest ways to improve the workers' wages, actual remuneration, perhaps to suggest possible sources of funding and ways of handling future government/workers conflict.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Elections to Change the Leaders</h4>
                        <p>On some occasions due to strained relationships between the current government and populace, an election may be called. In this case the population may elect a new government with new political leaders of their choice. When this happens, the masses feel that they have picked their choice of leaders, thereby averting conflict.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Meeting with Concerned Persons</h4>
                        <p>At times in the work place, conflict may arise between the in-charge persons and other staff members. One of the ways to avert this misunderstanding is to call a meeting where all stakeholders are invited. This provides for an opportunity to speak out, discuss and agree on solutions to be effected by all. Mediators may also be chosen to represent one of the parties. In this way, harmony in the work place is restored.</p>

                        <h3>The Negotiation Process</h3>
                        <p>The process of negotiation consists of three important phases.</p>
                        
                        <h4>The Information Phase</h4>
                        <p>During this phase, you should collect and evaluate information on all factors that will have an effect on the negotiation. Work out a defensive plan to protect sensitive information that the opposition is likely to inquire about. Decide whether the negotiations will be carried out by yourself or an agent.</p>
                        
                        <h4>The Competitive Phase</h4>
                        <p>The bargaining begins during this phase. You should decide who should go first on particular issues. Support your position on an appropriate rationale and actively manage the concession process.</p>
                        
                        <h4>The Cooperative Phase</h4>
                        <p>It is important to understand that, ultimately, cooperation is a worthy and necessary stage in the negotiation process. While acknowledging that negotiations are inherently competitive, it helps to remember the following:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Be cooperative.</li>
                            <li>Do not use threats.</li>
                            <li>Assess the value of your position accurately.</li>
                            <li>Be willing to share information.</li>
                            <li>Approach negotiations in an objective, fair, trustworthy manner.</li>
                            <li>Seek agreement in the open exchange of information.</li>
                            <li>Get a settlement that is fair to both sides.</li>
                        </ul>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h4>Introduction</h4>
                        <p>In this section you will see how to apply the information and knowledge you have just learned on sociology and anthropology to your job. It is important to understand why nurses need to study sociology and anthropology. Nursing involves caring for people and the nursing proffesional is a specialised member of the community that plays a key role in how the society functions as a whole.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Objectives</h4>
                        <p>By the end of this section you will be able to:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Describe the relevance of sociology and anthropology to nursing</li>
                            <li>Describe application of sociology and anthropology in the nursing profession</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h3>The Relevance of Sociology and Anthropology to Nursing</h3>
                        <p>Over time, sociologists and anthropologists have deepened our knowledge of the influence and interactions of such variables as social class, race, age, cultural and social contexts in determining health status on individuals and communities. They have provided a body of rich data and have posited different conceptual schemes and hypotheses to explain some of the epidemiological findings on social factors and health.</p>
                        <p>The importance of social factors in the etiology of health cannot be over emphasised. Studies have directed attention on the importance of social science (including sociology and anthropology) concepts and methods in the study of health and illness. For example, the health status of an individual, including life expectancy and prevalence of chronic disease and disability, is related to marital status, social supports, as well as simple health habits such as hours of sleep and physical activities.</p>
                        <p>Although social and behavioural scientists have long stressed the importance of cultural factors in people's health behaviour in perceiving symptoms, seeking health care, adhering to medical regimens and responding to health promotion programs - they are now directing attention to the role of cultural factors in determining health status. This forms rationale for community based public health interventions. Different disciplines are now contributing to the growing body of knowledge of the relationship between society and health.</p>
                        <p>It is useful for nurses to study sociology and anthropology because it enables them to appreciate that individuals behave in a unique way. It is important to understand that every patient will react in a different manner when under stress. The nurse should recognise this and specifically tailor the nursing process to the individual patient, in order to assess, plan and implement nursing care that will suit the particular needs of the patient. Additionally, the nurse should always remember that individuals are part of a wider community, and try to involve all significant members of the family in the management of the patient.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h3>The Influence of Sociology and Anthropology on Nursing Skills</h3>
                        <p>In the process of interacting with patients, the application of sociological concepts and knowledge facilitates delivery of professional skills of nurses, as they will acknowledge the influences and interactions of such variables as social background and cultural contexts. During this contact period, you should use your observation skills to assess the patient's style of dressing, use of language, age and accompanying relatives. All these observations will provide additional background information for the patient's history.</p>
                        <p>As you take a detailed history from the patient, you will be in a position to inquire about specific points unique to them. For example, a Somali girl is brought to your ward accompanied by her parents and older brother. Start by greeting the parents, then the patient. If you are familiar with the language use it when greeting them, make them comfortable by offering chairs and explaining that you need to take detailed history then continue. By doing this, the family and the patient feel accepted and welcomed, and this may make it easier for you to gather all necessary details and record them for sharing information.</p>
                        
                        <h4>How Sociology and Anthropology Influences Nursing Skills</h4>
                        <p>Equipped with sociological and anthropological knowledge nurses should remember that humans are social beings whose physical environment plays an important role. You should be aware of the patient's surroundings, type of housing, ventilation systems, the availability of water and sanitation. You should also be aware of their social background, for example, relationships with the family and spiritual group members and psychological factors, for example if they are grieving, coping with the spouse and/or work. All these factors will influence the health of your patient. These facts should be confirmed with a significant family member or guardian where possible. The information you collect during this process will help the health team in planning immediate and follow-up care. In addition, it will enable you to provide care that centres on the patient and family members, and in so doing you will be in a position to positively influence the patient's health seeking behaviour.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Professional Socialisation</h4>
                        <p>Sociology assists all nurses in the process of professional socialisation and adaptation. As a nurse, you may have joined the profession straight from school. At that time, you were required to undergo a prescribed training process in order to learn the ways of the profession. Then you qualified and now you are a recognised nurse. This whole process is referred to as professional socialisation, that is, you learnt to behave and function as a nurse.</p>
                        <p>On your part you have had to adapt to the world of nursing, patients, shift duties, examination instructors and being involved with other team members. You have also had to maintain the rules and regulations governing nursing practices as recorded by the Nursing Council of Kenya. You joined the 'family' of the nursing profession. Studying sociology and anthropology helps you understand how to fit in with this family in order to meet the health needs of all humans.</p>
