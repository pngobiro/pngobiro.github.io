                        <p>In this section, you will cover how societies are differentiated. In every society, there are those who take the lead, for example, the elders, chiefs, successful farmers, teachers, lecturers, managers, business tycoons and so on. The difference between those who lead and those who are led may result from factors relating to gender, age and social roles. For example, in some cultures older men are viewed with higher regard than young men, women and children in that order. This is the traditional type of differentiation common in Africa (Peil 1977). In addition, in every society some people are identified as senior and others junior. In the nursing profession, there are similar relationships, for example, the matron and staff nurse. Each is assigned special roles and obligations according to their respective authority.</p>

                        <h3>Social Stratification</h3>
                        <p>The basic idea of social stratification is a series of layers, rather as one bolt of cloth might be piled on top of another. It was developed in European society to explain clashes between the old aristocracy of landed wealth, the new industrial capitalists and the workers, over political and economic power and cultural dominance. Stratification is the organisation of society resulting in some members having more and others having less. Social stratification is thus defined as a process ranking members of society according to wealth, prestige and power. This definition mainly applies in European communities where defined explanation is acceptable. In African societies, members are ranked according to sex, age, ethnic origin and occupation (Peil 1977).</p>

                        </figure>
                        
                        <h4>Social Stratification in African Society</h4>
                        <p>Other definitions of social stratification include the arranging of members of a society into a pattern of superior and inferior ranks, which is perhaps determined by their birth, wealth, power, education, and so on. It can also be said to be the way societies are organised, for example, into clans, castes, chiefdoms, or states within a society.</p>
                        <p>Systems of social inequity exist in all human societies. This assertion emphasises two features that are basic for analysis of social inequalities and equalities.</p>
                        <p>Firstly, the inequalities, no matter what their origin, appear in a social context. Biological differences, real or presumed, may be used as a basis for social stratification, but biology alone does not make a social difference. It is more likely that biology is invoked as a rationale to support established social inequalities. When social definitions with respect to equality change, so do the biological justifications that are used.</p>
                        <p>Secondly the equalities are systematic. They are organised into patterns that are recognised and accepted by most, but not all, members of the society. Social differences are interlaced in the dominant values of a society; the inequalities are justified by the very beliefs that regulate a society and give it continuity.</p>
                        <p>A stratification system has both a moral/cultural base and a structural base. Each culture has some view of an admirable person against which individuals may measure their own and others' conduct, an ideal that people try to live up to. This may be generalised or specified as behaviour that is expected of holders of certain roles, for example, a father. Stratification arises from the division of labour, whereby certain roles are admired more than others. Members of the society are valued according to the roles they fill and also according to the way the role is carried out.</p>
                        <p>Much more attention is usually paid to the structural aspect of stratification (the processes for allocating people to roles and the societal structure which results) than to the cultural aspect (beliefs about how and why people are allocated and the justice or injustice of the process). Some roles are held to be important, but are in fact given to less able people or are poorly rewarded.</p>

                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_11_10_bae4641a724bfa5682acg-12-1.jpg" alt="A diagram showing an individual at the center with radiating lines pointing to different roles they hold, like father, citizen, employee, and club member." class="content-image">
                        </figure>

                        <h3>Theories of Stratification</h3>
                        <h4>The Functional Theory of Stratification</h4>
                        <p>The functional theory of stratification holds that a society, through its members, makes certain decisions about the allocation of desirable roles. Choice is limited by the number of these roles and the number of people available to perform them. The rewards attached to various roles (wealth, prestige or power) are justified by the service to society involved (especially to societal survival) and the rarity of the abilities needed to fill them.</p>

                        <h4>The Conflict Theory of Stratification</h4>
                        <p>The conflict theory of stratification draws largely on the writings of Karl Marx, though adjustments have been necessary to adapt in the changing nature of twentieth century capitalism. Marx saw society as divided into two major groups (capitalists and proletarians or workers) who are inevitably in conflict. Whereas Marx was particularly concerned only with the economic or market hierarchy, which he termed class, Max Weber suggested that people are also stratified according to status (prestige or lifestyle) and power. These three hierarchies may be closely related, but this is not necessarily so. Marx assumed that those with a high economic position would also have power, but rich businessmen often have less power than higher civil servants on moderate salaries; clergymen and teachers usually have higher status than either wealth or power - though this was more likely some time back.</p>

                        <h3>Status</h3>
                        <p>Another way of ranking society members is according to their status. Status can be defined as any position within the stratification system. This definition says nothing about the basis for status in a stratification system. Thus a particular status or position can be high or low on the basis of the property, prestige or power (or all three) associated with that position. There are two types of status.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Ascribed Status</h4>
                        <p>This is explained as grouping of individuals according to their social position, for example, by virtue of one's age, sex or position of birth (indicates that the holder of this position was born within or inherited a given status in society). Ascribed status is a position based on who you are not what you can do.</p>
                        <p>A good example of ascribed status can be found in India, where the caste system is practised. Members of the upper caste do not in any way interact with those of the lower caste or the untouchables. Members of the upper caste are usually well educated, while those of the lower caste are poor with limited opportunities and are usually manual workers. These two caste level societies do not intermarry (Joseph 1986). This system is also known as a closed system of social stratification.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, when a society uses ascriptive status rules, people are placed in status positions because of certain traits beyond their control such as family background, race, sex or place of birth.</p>

                        <h4>Achieved/Acquired Status</h4>
                        <p>Achieved status is a position gained on the basis of merit or achievement. This is defined as the position in society earned through the individual's efforts or choice, for example, being a father, mother, nurse or a teacher.</p>

                        <h4>Introduction</h4>
                        <p>What is the outcome of social stratification? Some positive results do occur in the case of open systems that appreciate one's changing status, for example, acquired/achieved status. In Kenya individuals who pursue education to college and university are viewed as being of a higher status than those who are schooled up to primary and secondary levels respectively. Therefore, the daughter of a peasant farmer who pursues her education to the level of a graduate nurse, will have uplifted herself and her parents, thereby acquiring higher status for herself and at times, her parents, this is social mobility. In this section you are going to study social mobility.</p>

                        <h4>Objectives</h4>
                        <p>By the end of this section you will be able to:</p>

                        <h3>Social Mobility</h3>
                        <p>The ability to move up or down the social level is referred to as social mobility. The amount of mobility in a society depends on two factors. First, the rules governing how people gain or keep their position may make mobility difficult or easy. Secondly, whatever the rules, structural changes in society can influence mobility. Social mobility occurs in an open social system while closed systems offer no room for any movement.</p>

                        <h3>Types of Social Mobility</h3>
                        <p>There are two types of social mobility:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Vertical social mobility</li>
                            <li>Horizontal social mobility</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>You will look at these types in more detail.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Vertical Social Mobility</h4>
                        <p>This refers to the ability of the individual to move up the social ladder, thereby raising their social status and role. It also refers to any upward or downward change in the absolute or relative rank of an individual or group. An example of this would be the nurse, who joins the profession as a community nurse and, by increasing their knowledge through in-service education, acquires the new position of a professor in nursing.</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_11_10_bae4641a724bfa5682acg-13-1.jpg" alt="A diagram illustrating vertical social mobility, showing arrows pointing up and down a social ladder with figures on different rungs." class="content-image">
                        </figure>
                        <p>Vertical mobility is often inferred from occupational mobility, and the inference is generally justified because the position of the individual in a pattern of inequality largely depends on their occupation. The change in status between father and son is called intergenerational mobility whereas changes during the individual's work life are known as intragenerational or career mobility. In Africa, intergenerational mobility of females is usually made by comparing the occupations of her father and her husband. For instance, the daughter of a skilled worker who marries a professional man is considered upwardly mobile. Some of the conditions that affect intergenerational mobility include differences between parents and offspring. Thus, if a parent occupies an important position requiring high capacity, their children, if they are less capable are likely to be downwardly mobile. In the same way, children who are more capable than their parents are likely to be upwardly mobile, especially in open class societies.</p>
                        <p>Another condition affecting mobility rates is population change where in industrial and industrialising societies, greater population expansion at the lower levels than at the higher levels contributes to upward mobility.</p>
                        <p>Changes in occupational structure can also affect mobility. Changes in the amount of inequality, in the proportion of people at each social level, and in the relative rewards and resources attached to different social positions are not merely a matter of individuals changing their positions within the system of stratification.</p>

                        <h4>Horizontal Social Mobility</h4>
                        <p>This refers to the type of social mobility where the individual maintains the same status. It is also defined as an alteration of position with no significant movement up or down in the system of social stratification, for example a general nurse who trains as a midwife but has no change in salary. This nurse maintains the same status although their role may have changed.</p>
                        <p>Certain characteristics can affect the individual's chances of moving up the social ladder.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Community Size:</strong> This is where a large community often results in greater economic differences. This is more apparent in larger cities and thus may be more likely to impart incentives to lower level children.</li>
                            <li><strong>Number of Siblings:</strong> Number of siblings is where an only child or children having one sibling have the best chance of being upwardly mobile.</li>
                            <li><strong>Mother Dominance:</strong> Mother dominance is where the strong mother family seems to be more conducive to upward mobility than the egalitarian or father-dominant family.</li>
                            <li><strong>Late Marriage:</strong> Late marriage, as it has been argued that early marriages encourage downward mobility whereas late marriages encourage upward mobility.</li>
                            <li><strong>Few Children:</strong> Few children, where upwardly mobile couples tend to have fewer children than immobile couples in the social levels into which they move.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h3>Other Types of Social Mobility</h3>
                        <p>There are two other types of social mobility based on different classification systems:</p>
                        <h4>Structural Mobility</h4>
                        <p>Structural mobility is social mobility that results from changes in the distribution of statuses in society. Structural mobility occurs regardless of the rules governing status.</p>
                        <h4>Exchange Mobility</h4>
                        <p>Mobility that is not structural is called exchange mobility. The word exchange indicates a trade-off. In exchange mobility, some people rise to fill positions made available because other people have fallen in the status system. There is little exchange mobility when the ascriptive status rule operates, but if status depends on achievement, there is a fair amount of such movement. Many children of talented and ambitious parents do not inherit the talent or ambition that earned their parents a high rank. Conversely, many children of low status parents are more talented and ambitious than their parents.</p>

                        <h3>Application</h3>
                        <p>As nurses you are the main health care providers to various groups of people. Therefore, in line with the nursing code of ethics, you will have to provide health care services to people of whichever status in society. This enables the nurse to provide the basic health care that people deserve.</p>
                        <p>The role of the nurse can be related to that of the anthropologist who has to live, stay and work with the particular group. Just like the anthropologist, the nurse may have to live, stay and work with a particular group or a particular community or society and hence learn and understand all their ways of social life.</p>

                        <h4>Definition of a Society</h4>
                        <p>A society is defined as a group of people who interact together, within a specified territory and have a unique culture, for example, the Nubians living in the Kibera slums of Nairobi, the Maasai who live in parts of Loitokitok/Kajiado District in Kenya and Pokomo society living along Tana River in Tana River District (Peil 1977).</p>
                        
                        <h4>Definition of a Community</h4>
                        <p>The term 'community' refers to a small group of people who are part of a larger society. For example, the Masai community in Nairobi form part of a larger society that lives in Kajiado District. While in Nairobi, however, this community sticks together and helps one another as necessary.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h3>The Concept of Social Mobilisation</h3>
                        <p>The concept of social mobilisation emerged from the recognition that a genuine participatory approach to development is essential for success and sustainability. Civil society participation in development efforts is therefore increasingly recognised by development agencies and governments. They are seen as essential for promoting good governance improving responsiveness of national policies and programmes to citizens' needs and ensuring transparency and accountability in policy making and implementation processes.</p>
                        <p>Genuine participation of citizens however, goes beyond dialogue with or contracting a few non-governmental organisations. It must engage all citizens (women and men, in their various capacities, socio-economic status, affiliations and locations) beyond elections to active participation in making decisions that affect their lives. Engaging people requires efforts and mechanisms that can empower all, but most especially the disadvantaged members of society, to participate effectively in development processes.</p>
                        <p>Social mobilisation is an approach and tool that enables people to organise for collective action, by pooling resources and building solidarity required to resolve common problems and work towards community advancement. It is a process that empowers women and men to organise their own democratically self-governing groups or community organisations which enable them to initiate and control their own personal and communal development, as opposed to mere participation in an initiative designed by the government or an external organisation.</p>
                        <p>Effective social mobilisation goes beyond community organisations, harnessing the potential and efforts of government, non-governmental sector and citizens to work towards sustainable social, economic and political development. The benefits of social mobilisation to community organisations and its impact locally and nationally can be best sustained within an enabling political, policy and regulatory environment and where mechanisms for linking experiences and lessons at the community level to policy are developed.</p>

                        <h3>The Key Elements of Social Mobilisation</h3>
                        <p>From worldwide experience there are four basic elements of social mobilisation.</p>
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li>
                                <strong>Organisational Development</strong>
                                <p>Organisational development is a process in which community members and, especially the poor, form their own groups or organisations based on common development interests and needs that are best served by organising themselves as a group. 'Before one becomes a member of a Community Based Organisation (CBO), the individual struggles against a harsh environment. Once they are organised in a broad-based group, the individual has the leverage with which to address and tackle problems which they could not have done alone' (Pandey 2002).</p>
                                <p>Organisations can be created with a specific focus (for example, a tenants' association, a credit union or cooperative) or as broad-based, multipurpose groups or community organisations with an overall aim to improve the situation of their members and the community in which they live. Organisations with a holistic focus are more inclusive of the poor, (who have a much broader array of needs), and can be effective vehicles for poverty alleviation, community-wide development and establishing strong links with local government. Mobilisation can start with small groups, as the first step for participation in larger community-wide organisations, which are in some cases, associations of small groups. In other cases, community organisations mobilise the poorer members of their organisations into small groups in order for them to work on alleviating their poverty. In both cases, the larger organisations serve as a support network for small groups and an important link to local government (Atwood 2001) and external organisations that provide various forms of services and support (for example microfinance, marketing, business development support, and so on).</p>
                                <p>In countries with a longer history of civic engagement, social mobilisation can involve working with existing community organisations to boost their capacity and power in engaging with government and other actors in addressing their common needs and promoting their interests. So whilst the basic principles of social mobilisation are universal, the approaches used must be appropriate and relevant to the local context.</p>
                                <p>Lessons learned have indicated the following factors as essential in promoting effective organisational development:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Homogeneity to the extent possible is an important and essential factor for group or organisational survival.</li>
                                    <li>Building organisations that are operated on democratic principles, based on a group or organisational constitution. The constitution would often reflect the objectives of the organisation and the norms, values and principles which govern the way the group functions. Promoting norms and values such as tolerance, inclusion, cooperation, equality and good practices early in the building process of an organisation fosters commitment and prevents diversion of the organisation into activities that can destruct the common good.</li>
                                    <li>Building leadership capacity within the organisation - beyond one individual to several members, to avoid dependency and capture.</li>
                                    <li>Building incentives into the early stages of development to create interest among community members for organising, especially in communities that are very passive or sceptical about organising.</li>
                                    <li>Ensuring an inclusive approach (involving all or most community members) in the social mobilisation activities to promote equal opportunities and prevent conflict. A community organisation must leave room for new membership.</li>
                                    <li>Promoting self-reliance, especially of the poor members of the organisation which would in turn enhance their ability to participate in the organisation's affairs on an equal basis.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Capital Formation for Development through Community Savings</strong>
                                <p>Capital formation (through mobilisation of savings) enhances a community organisation's power to realise its full potential. 'Savings generated by individual members are the assets of the community organisation and are the first step towards their self-reliance' (Pandey 2002).</p>
                                <p>Accumulated savings can be used for internal credit with interest, to enable individual members to engage in income generation activities whilst at the same time, accumulating the organisation's capital base. They can also be used for enterprise development at the community level. Savings can serve as the basis for access to external services, for example, micro-finance. They can also form the basis for community organisations' contribution to local development initiatives, which is essential in localities, where government capacities to address all social needs of a community are very limited.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Training for Human Resource Development</strong>
                                <p>Community members can maximise their potential not only by organising themselves but also by upgrading their existing skills to better manage new inputs and establish effective links with local government and other actors. The Change Agent (for instance, the organisation or individual facilitating the social mobilisation process) can support direct training, exchange visits and other capacity building activities based on needs identified by the members of the community organisations. These can cover organisational development, leadership, savings and credits programmes, agriculture, natural resource management, and other key areas. Local human resource development can best be promoted when trained individuals take up the responsibility to train other community members.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Socio-economic Development</strong>
                                <p>Socio-economic development initiatives are a great incentive for community members to organise themselves. It is important, therefore, that an initiative which includes social mobilisation provides support in the form of matching grants or access to credit, marketing and other services that will lead to tangible improvements in social economic conditions within the community. The process of identifying community priorities, participatory planning, implementing and monitoring of community projects and managing partnerships with local government, private sector and other actors helps not only to improve local conditions but also to empower people and their organisations. If well facilitated, this process can result in increased institutional capacity, enhanced social status and voice (especially for disadvantaged people, including women, the poor and youth). These results in turn motivate people to remain organised as they begin to enjoy the benefits of collective action and recognise its potential to create or influence change in their communities.</p>

                        <h3>Facilitating the Process of Social Mobilisation</h3>
                        <p>Whilst there are grassroots or social movements that have emerged from within communities, the isolation, poverty and resulting passivity or powerlessness of citizens, particularly in rural areas in developing countries, calls for external support at the initial stages of the process of social mobilisation.</p>
                        <p>In practice, social mobilisation is usually an element within a broader strategic framework or development programme/initiative. Since such programmes or initiatives are time bound (in most cases due to donor funding cycles), a clear exit strategy is needed right at the beginning of the initiative, to ensure that the national capacities are created for replication and sustainability. Experience in Central Asia suggests a minimum donor commitment of five years (with gradual withdrawal) and continuous commitment of central and local government to supporting social mobilisation initiatives.</p>
                        <p>In countries with limited experience of social mobilisation, a combination of international and national community mobilisers brings to bear international experience and local knowledge which are both essential factors for success.</p>
                        <p>Selection of the right people for this work is critical - emphasising good attitudes, behaviour and the ability for one to work on an equal basis with community members is critical. Knowledge of participatory development concepts and approaches is essential but can be gained through an effective training strategy.</p>

                        <h3>The Benefits of Social Mobilisation</h3>
                        <p>The benefits of social mobilisation are listed below, you will look at each in more detail.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Poverty Alleviation</li>
                            <li>Promoting Democratic Governance</li>
                            <li>Environment</li>
                            <li>Conflict Prevention</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4>Poverty Alleviation</h4>
                        <p>Social mobilisation is an important tool in the poverty alleviation process, as it enables communities and the poor themselves to engage actively in solving their own problems and effectively tackling poverty in its multidimensional form. The principles of social mobilisation ensure equity, hence issues of gender based, racial and ethnic based discrimination are most likely addressed.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Promoting Democratic Governance</h4>
                        <p>Experience shows that poverty and bad governance mutually reinforce each other, as they foster exclusion of citizens from decision making processes, lack of access to basic services, lack of opportunity, dependency, and limit availability of public goods. Social mobilisation must be institutionalised within government for it to be effective. This would encourage participation in decision making, build capacity for participatory planning, build a common vision on development and ensure transparency. Institutionalisation of such efforts can only be effective if a decentralised system of governance, including fiscal decentralisation, is in place and functional. Social mobilisation can facilitate tripartite leadership at the local level, making civil society more effective as a third and legitimate partner in development.</p>
                        <p>Creating demand for good governance through social mobilisation must be complemented with increased capacity of the local government to manage and effectively respond to this demand and improve its governance practices. Capacity building efforts must therefore target civil society organisations (including CBOs, elected representatives, etc.) and government.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Environment</h4>
                        <p>By organising people to better manage their natural resources and fight against practices and organisations that degrade the environment through promoting appropriate legal, regulatory and institutional frameworks and policy dialogue.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Conflict Prevention</h4>
                        <p>As people prepare to address common problems, and to collectively improve their socioeconomic conditions in an equitable, democratic and transparent manner, possibility of conflict can be significantly reduced.</p>

                        <h4>Conclusion</h4>
                        <p>Social mobilisation is an approach that empowers people to participate actively in development processes - through their own local initiatives and through well informed and constructive dialogue at the policy level. It is an essential tool for mobilising and engaging isolated, passive and poor members of society, hence its popularity with poverty reduction and decentralised governance programmes worldwide. Its effectiveness depends to a large extent on the appropriateness of the approaches used within a given cultural, socio-economic and political environment. On the whole, it is an effective tool for building a well informed, proactive and strong civil society, making it a valuable partner for government and the private sector in shaping national development that is equitable and sustainable.</p>
