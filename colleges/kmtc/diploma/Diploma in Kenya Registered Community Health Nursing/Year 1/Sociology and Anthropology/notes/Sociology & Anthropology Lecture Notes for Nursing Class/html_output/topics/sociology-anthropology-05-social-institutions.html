                        <h4>Introduction</h4>
                        <p>Social institutions are organs, which perform some of the functions that benefit society, for example, the government and schools. Each society should have social institutions for survival. In this section you will look at the differences and relationships in social institutions, associations and other institutions.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Objectives</h4>
                        <p>By the end of this section you will be able to:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Define a social institution</li>
                            <li>Describe a family institution</li>
                            <li>Describe the educational institution</li>
                            <li>Describe the religious institution</li>

                        <h3>Associations and Institutions</h3>
                        <h4>What is an Association?</h4>
                        <p>Associations are official (formal) groups set up for a special purpose, for example, a hospital that provides health care. An association should have a name, prescribed location and a record of rules and regulations to govern its functions. Members of the association have a recognised social structure with specific status and rules. For example, members of a hospital team include the senior nurse, the doctor and administrator in charge. Each of these in charge oversee the activities of the respective qualified specialists.</p>
                        
                        <h4>What is an Institution?</h4>
                        <p>Institutions are organisations, or mechanisms of social structure, governing the behaviour of two or more individuals. Institutions are identified with a social purpose and permanence, transcending individual human lives and intentions, with the making and enforcing of rules governing human behaviour. As structures and mechanisms of social order among humans, institutions are one of the principal objects of study in the social sciences, including sociology, political science and economics. Institutions are a central concern for law, the formal regime for political rule making and enforcement.</p>
                        <p>Having seen the difference between associations and institutions, you will now look at the various institutions briefly.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h3>The Family</h3>
                        <p>The definition of the family, which is the basic unit of social structure, can vary greatly from time to time and from culture to culture. How a society defines family and the functions it asks families to perform, are by no means constant. However, for the purpose of this study you shall define the family as a universal human institution in a small kinship structured group with the key function of nurturing the socialisation of the newborn.</p>
                        <p>There has been much recent discussion of the nuclear family, which consists only of parents and children, but the nuclear family is by no means universal. In pre-industrial societies, the ties of kinship bind the individual both to the family of orientation, into which one is born, and to the family of procreation, which one finds at marriage and which often includes one's spouse's relatives. The nuclear family also may be extended through the acquisition of more than one spouse (polygamy), or through the common residence of two or more married couples and their children or of several generations connected in the male or female line. This is called the extended family.</p>
                        <p>The primary functions of the family are reproductive, economic, social and educational. It is through their kin (also variously defined) that children first absorb the culture of their group. Some family institutions include gender, marriage, parenthood and kinship. All these institutions are basic to society because they provide and protect new members, and without them the society would disappear. The bundle of relationships that have come to be identified with the family vary within and between societies.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Kinship Relationship</h4>
                        <p>This consists of parents and children. Kinship implies ties of blood (biological kinship), descent (jural or legal kinship) and marriage (affiliation). People descended from a common ancestor are referred to as cognatic kin or cognates; those who become kin through marriage are affinal kins or affines. As a basic principle of social organisation, kinship gives a person his place in society; he is the son of X and grandson of Y.</p>

                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_11_10_bae4641a724bfa5682acg-27-1.jpg" alt="A family tree diagram illustrating kinship relationships, showing connections between grandparents, parents, and children." class="content-image">
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_11_10_bae4641a724bfa5682acg-27-2.jpg" alt="A diagram representing an extended family, showing multiple generations including grandparents, parents, children, aunts, and uncles living together." class="content-image">
                        </figure>

                        <h4>Extended Family</h4>
                        <p>This is the type of family that consists of several generations of relatives all living together or near each other. The relationship is based on birth or marriage, for example, auntie, in-laws, grandparents and so on.</p>

                        <h3>Functions of the Family</h3>
                        <aside class="callout note" role="note">
                             <p><strong>Can you list at least two functions of the family?</strong></p>
                        </aside>
                        <p>According to George Peter Murdock (1983), the four primary functions of the family are sexual relationships, economic cooperation among members, reproduction and the educational function by which he meant the socialisation of infants and children.</p>
                        <p>There are other functions of the family some of which you will now cover together with the primary functions.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Control of Sexual Behaviour</h4>
                        <p>When a man and a woman marry, they are expected to have a sexual relationship with each other. It is only in marriage that sexual behaviour should be practised. It is within the marital setting that sex is legitimised. This functions to control illegitimate sex and indecencies such as incest, child abuse, rape, and risk of contracting Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs) like syphilis and gonorrhea and HIV/AIDS.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Nurturing Children</h4>
                        <p>Couples are expected to have children and nurture them. Primary socialisation also takes place within the family. If mothers have jobs outside the house, house helps and other family members (such as grandparents and older siblings) are engaged to continue with this function of nurturing the child while the mother is away.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Protection</h4>
                        <p>The family should provide basic needs to its members, for example, food, shelter, clothing and health care.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Education</h4>
                        <p>Even today, children are taught at home, for example, social skills such as table manners, washing hands after visiting the toilet and before eating and so on. Parents are expected to continue showing an interest in their child's learning throughout school life.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Legal Function</h4>
                        <p>The parents give a child the birth right as confirmed by the provision of a birth certificate by the government officials. They also have other rights that they should give to the child such as the right to an education, the right to basic needs such as clothing, food and shelter among others.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Spiritual Function</h4>
                        <p>The family instils sense of religious beliefs and thoughts in their children. This could be the traditional African religious belief or the modern belief in one God worshipped in churches, mosques or synagogues.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h3>Educational Institutions</h3>
                        <p>Education is the deliberate instruction through which a society's social and technical skills are acquired (Casper Odegi Awuondo, 1993). It is a lifelong process that begins as soon as a child is conceived. What happens to the mother during pregnancy affects the child's personality development and learning process.</p>
                        <p>There are two aspects of education: formal and informal.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Formal education</strong> is acquired through formally established institutions of learning. Learning takes place within these while following the laid down curricula of education.</li>
                            <li><strong>Informal education</strong> takes place in informal places, for example, the work place, recreational place, among peer groups, in the church or other religious settings. Informal education also takes place during political rallies, voting and wedding ceremonies.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <aside class="callout note" role="note">
                            <p><strong>What are the Functions of Education?</strong></p>
                        </aside>

                        <h4>Secondary Socialisation</h4>
                        <p>One of the functions of school is to offer secondary socialisation to children. As various teachers tutor them, children not only gain knowledge but also assimilate the values instilled to them by their teachers.</p>
                        <h4>Custodial Functions</h4>
                        <p>Schools take charge of children as learning takes place. This provides parents with freedom to work without distraction. While at school, children are protected from playing dangerous games, for example, playing along the road, throwing stones at each other and so on.</p>
                        <h4>Cultural Transmission</h4>
                        <p>The communication of received beliefs and understandings is a major function of formal education. Education is especially relied on in societies that are culturally self-conscious. Awareness of a cultural heritage is usually associated with concern that traditional values and cultural 'mysteries' will be lost if no one has special knowledge of them. While cultural transmission tends to emphasise respect for tradition, values of criticism and inquiry may be passed on as well as conservative values.</p>
                        <h4>Social Integration</h4>
                        <p>Formal education is a major agency for transforming a heterogeneous and potentially divided community into one bound together by a common language and a sense of common identity</p>
                        <h4>Innovation</h4>
                        <p>To some degree, even the most tradition-bound educational institution is a source of innovation because the teacher is called on to apply their wisdom or expertise to new situations. Early innovations were often accidental and unanticipated, perhaps the result of religious rather than practical intent.</p>
                        <h4>Selection and Allocation</h4>
                        <p>In traditional society, when only a few select members of the community were educated, the school played a smaller role to that of family membership in determining the student's ultimate role and status. However, under the conditions of mass education, the school system takes over the job of screening and allocating status. How the individual performs in school and the course of study they choose often determines their future occupation, income and prestige</p>
                        <h4>Personal Development</h4>
                        <p>Formal education communicates skills and perspectives that cannot readily be gained through other socialising experiences. The school is also often a place of transition from a highly personal to a more impersonal world and habits such as punctuality may be learned here.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h3>Religious Institutions</h3>
                        <p>Paul Taylor (1996) presents a minimal definition of religion as a belief. Durkheim (1912) defines religion as 'a unified system of beliefs and practices relative to sacred things, that is to say, things set apart and forbidden - beliefs and practices which unite into one single moral community ...all those who adhere to them.' Religion is as old as humankind. Sociologists have noted that in different societies religious beliefs and practices are different. As important as the universality of religion is, it has remarkable diversity.</p>
                        <aside class="callout note" role="note">
                            <p><strong>What are the Foundations of Religion?</strong></p>
                        </aside>
                        <p>Religion has its foundations in the nature of human personality as well as in the requirements of social solidarity. They are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Overcoming fear and anxiety to the extent that our world is dangerous and unpredictable, people must endure and try to overcome specific fears and more general anxiety and hence the need for religion.</li>
                            <li>Self-justification and the quest for ultimate meaning. We seek an organising principle that will validate our most important strivings and make sense of our sufferings.</li>
                            <li>The search for transcendence. Most human experiences are routine and do not evoke strong emotions or strange feelings but there are circumstances that lift us out of ourselves and in which we seem to transcend our everyday self which some religions do through dance.</li>
                            <li>Celebration of human powers and achievements. Many religious beliefs and activities reflect pride and exultation rather than humility and despair.</li>
                            <li>Making the world comprehensible. In all societies, some effort is made to explain and interpret our environment and religion tries to do this too.</li>
                            <li>Supporting social norms and values. By adding divine sanction to human values, religion buttresses the norms of society and unites its adherents into a moral community, whose members feel a deep common bond because they share a belief in what is normally true.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Having covered these, you shall now look at the various functions of religion.</p>
                        <h4>Functions of Religious Institutions</h4>
                        <p>Religious institutions perform several functions.</p>
                        <h5>Unity of Group Members</h5>
                        <p>This happens when members have a common creative belief. For example, in traditional religion, all community members would take part in a religious ceremony. Men would take the lead as the high priest and medicine men made sacrifices when appearing before their gods. By doing so the calamity, be it famine or drought, was resolved. In modern day, religion has the same unifying function.</p>
                        <h5>Humanitarian</h5>
                        <p>Religious organisations usually provide emergency care during disasters, like floods, earthquakes, fires and wars. Organisations such as the Red Cross have their origin from religious organisations for the provision of emergency care.</p>
                        <h5>Reduction of Stress</h5>
                        <p>Religion provides explanation for things inconceivable by the human mind, such as why people die, or what happens after death. This explanatory function serves to alleviate anxiety. Religion also helps members cope with anxiety due to togetherness among most of its members. Religion also helps to meet the psychological and counselling needs of people with chronic or terminal conditions. Some people even consult their religious leaders to pray for healing.</p>
                        <p>There are many more functions of religion. Next, you shall look at political institutions.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h3>Political Institutions</h3>
                        <p>As you studied earlier, historically in African families the man took the leadership role. However, as a result of population increase amongst other social changes, the family as an institution was unable to continue with its political/leadership functions. More and more people moved away from their kinsmen in search of basic needs and work. The control system of the family was weakened gradually. This led to the formation of political institutions such as governments in order to create and enforce laws so as to maintain functions. The government rules its people through various styles of leadership. The three styles of leadership are:</p>
                        <h4>Autocratic (Authoritarian)</h4>
                        <p>This type of leader controls all the power to make and enforce laws and they assume all responsibility for the actions. This method is used when the leader tells their employees what they want done and how they want it done, without allowing them to participate in the decision making process. They elect themselves into a leadership position. Examples include leaders like Babangida of Nigeria and Adolf Hitler in Germany. This type of leader achieves a lot of power by allowing only political parties that support him and any resistance is stopped using force.</p>
                        <p>The authoritarian method is sometimes appropriate under particular conditions. When you have all the information to solve the problem, you are short on time, and your employees are well motivated, you may use an authoritarian style. Some people think that this style includes yelling, using demeaning language, and leading by threats and abuse of power. This is not the authoritarian style. It is an abusive, unprofessional style of leadership!</p>
                        <p>If you have the time and you want to gain more commitment and motivation from your employees, you should use the participative style.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Democratic (Participative)</h4>
                        <p>This style involves the leader, including one or more employees in the decision making process (determining what to do and how to do it). However, the leader is the final decision making authority. Using this style is not a sign of weakness. It is a sign of strength that your employees will respect. A democratic type of government always aims at being responsible to the needs of the common people who elected it.</p>
                        <p>The participative style is normally used when you have some of the information and your employees have some of the information. This allows them to become part of the team and allows you to make a better decision.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Laissez-faire (Delegative, Free-reign)</h4>
                        <p>In this style, the leader allows the employees to make the decision. However, the leader is still responsible for the decisions that are made. This is used when employees are able to analyse the situation and determine what needs to be done and how to do it. You cannot do everything! You must set priorities and delegate certain tasks.</p>
                        <p>You will now cover the functions of government.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Functions of Government</h4>
                        <p>For the smooth running of a large society, governments carry out three main functions.</p>
                        <h5>Maintenance of Social Order</h5>
                        <p>The government has the responsibility of keeping social order. In order to fulfil this function, the government enacts laws, which it enforces. It also identifies law enforcement agents who ensure that citizens abide by the laws. Those who do not abide by the laws are arrested and charged in a court of law and may either be fined or jailed. Examples of the law enforcement agents are police officers, magistrates, health officers and prison wardens.</p>
                        <h5>Coordination of Essential Services</h5>
                        <p>Similar to a family unit, the government has to coordinate various activities useful for the effective functioning of the society. To meet this need, the government establishes ministries, each of which has specific activities it is responsible for. In Kenya, nursing services are under the Ministry of Health while education is under the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology. The head of each ministry is a Minister and the technical head is the Permanent Secretary.</p>
                        <h5>Protection of all Citizens</h5>
                        <p>In order to fulfil the function of maintaining security, armed forces are developed to meet these needs.</p>
                        <p>You have covered some of the leadership styles and functions of the government. On a microlevel, it is important to understand the functions of the local government. These include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Providing democratic and accountable government for local communities</li>
                            <li>Ensuring the provision of services to communities in a sustainable manner</li>
                            <li>Promoting social and economic development</li>
                            <li>Promoting a safe and healthy environment</li>
                            <li>Encouraging the involvement of communities and community organisations in the matters of local government</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>You will now learn about one more social institution, the health institution.</p>

                        <h3>Health Care Institutions</h3>
                        <p>In order for the society to meet its health needs, various health care institutions are established. In Kenya there are several types of health care institutions with different functions, as you will now see.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Traditional Medicine</h4>
                        <p>Many African societies had traditional healers, whose indigenous knowledge of folk medicine was respected. They used herbs and some practised magic and divination as they strived to meet the health needs of their clients. Today, fewer people subscribe to services of traditional healers. They mainly provide emotional and social treatment for illness such as mental illness, bereavements and disasters.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Private Health Facilities</h4>
                        <p>These are health facilities owned and/or run by religious and private organisations. They are popular in areas without government health facilities.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Public Health Facilities</h4>
                        <p>These are government-run health facilities and are present in most parts of the country. In Kenya, health facilities are classified according to their structure (mainly size and catchment population) and by extension, their functions. The facilities range from national hospital, provincial general hospital, district hospital, subdistrict hospital, health centre to dispensary. The largest hospital in Kenya is the Kenyatta National Hospital. It serves as a teaching, research and national referral hospital. Many nurses, doctors, pharmacists, laboratory technologists and other health professionals have trained here.</p>
                        <p>In each provincial and district headquarters, there is a general hospital that receives all patients referred from the health centre and district hospitals. All provincial and some district hospitals are also involved in the training of nurses, clinical officers and laboratory technologists. They also conduct continuing education for their health workers.</p>
                        <p>In the location and subdivision unit of administration there are health centres and dispensaries respectively. Nurses and clinical officers run these. They offer basic health services to the immediate neighbourhood. Each refers its patients either to district or provincial hospitals.</p>
                        <p>For further details on the management of health care services refer to unit four of this module.</p>
