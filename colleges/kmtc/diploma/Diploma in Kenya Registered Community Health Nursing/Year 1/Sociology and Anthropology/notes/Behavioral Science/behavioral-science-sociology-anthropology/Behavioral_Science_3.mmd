\section*{Module outcome}
- The learner will be able to apply knowledge of sociology and anthropology in delivery of health services

\section*{Module Competence:}
- This module is designed to enable the learner apply knowledge of sociology and anthropology in assisting patients / clients to promote health, prevent illness, manage and rehabilitate patients.

- social stratification ,social change, social mobility, social institutions, family, religion
- peace building, conflict resolution, negotiation
- socio-cultural beliefs and practices affecting health
- The term 'sociology' can be traced to Auguste Comte in 1837. He combined the Latin word for society (socio) with the Greek word for science (logy) thus identifying an area of study that pertained to the science of society.
- Sociology is the study of social life, social change, and the social causes and consequences of human behaviour

Sociology is about people. It is about how people interact and why they behave as they do.

According to Akinsola (1983) sociology is explained as a social science that deals with the organisation of societies, people's patterns of behaviour within the social structure, and how these social structures are arranged in the society.

Anthropology is divided primarily into physical anthropology and cultural anthropology.

Anthropology is the classification and analysis of humans and their society, descriptively, culturally, historically, and physically. Its unique contribution to studying the bonds of human social relations has been the distinctive concept of culture.

It has also differed from other sciences concerned with human social behaviour (especially sociology) in its emphasis on data from non-literate peoples and archaeological exploration.

\section*{AUGUSTE COMTE (Cont...)}
- He lived during the years following the French revolution.
- He was keen to establish sociology as a science and he arrogantly saw it as the "queen of the sciences"
- His followers wore jackets with buttons at the back so that other people had to button or unbutton them. This involved some form of social interactions.

\section*{Cont...}
- He described three stages of historical development:
a. Stage 1
- This is where the human mind is ruled by religions, myths, superstitions and delusions.
- This is the primitive stage which is not regarded as possible today.
- However, a few pockets of this is found in some African societies where gods are still worshipped.

\section*{Cont...}

\section*{STAGE 2}
- It was marked by philosophical thinking in the society.
- Each individual started thinking beyond his family but more on a collective order e.g. state.

\section*{STAGE 3}
- This is when man reached rational and scientific level of thinking and action.
- It is called positive or scientific stage.

\section*{II. Karl Max (1818-1883)}
- Reviewed/criticized capitalism and promoted socialism.
- He described the concept of class and the social relationship.
- He described two classes:
- The proletariat - poor/working class and,
$\square$ the Bourgeoisie - ruling class who owned production.
$\square$ He stated that a gap exists between the two groups (the proletariat and the bourgeoisie).

\end{tabular}

\section*{Cont...}
- Karl Max argued that:
$\square$ Power belonged to the masses and must be seized by them through use of force and have socialist societies where there is public ownership of property.
$\square$ The relationship between the two classes is characterized by struggle, conflict and tension.
$\square$ Class conflict is inevitable where there is private ownership of land.
- Karl Max theory was used to organize states such as Russia, Ethiopia and Tanzania

\section*{III. MAX WEBER - 1864-1920}
- He believed that man could determine his destiny by his beliefs, values and ideas, but not economic forces.
- He described the value which derives from discipline and denial in the pursuit of one's goal.
- He came up with some related statements in "inner worldly ascetism" e.g. any legal occupation is good in the sight of God.
- Profit made from legal occupation is legitimate.
(austere person - somebody who is self-denying and lives with minimal material comforts)

\section*{IV. EMILE DURKHEIM - (1858-1917)}
- He was the first professor of Sociology
- He was keen in to demonstrate that sociology was a science.
- He believed e.g. that social phenomena can be measured and that even if it is not possible to undertake laboratory experiments with human beings corporative studies which serve a similar purpose can be undertaken.

\section*{Cont...}
- He succeeded in showing that suicide rates differ very significantly between social groups (even though suicide is personal),
$\square$ e.g. that members of some religious groups are more prone to suicide than others.
- He found that suicide rates are co-related to social factors such as loneliness and economic well being.

\section*{Others}
- Piel (1977) explained how relationships between individuals or groups function, and how changing circumstances and relationships influence these.
$\square$ E.g.: A family = School child + college student + father + mother: a social system \& if any one of them is affected, then the whole family is disturbed.

\section*{Terminolgy}
- Norms-standards that govern behaviour in roles. Socially accepted patterns of behaviour
- Mores- stronger social norms receiving severe punishment e.g. adultery
- Laws- written socially confirmed rules and regulations of conduct which are punishable
- Sanctions-form of direct social control that uses rewards and punishment to encourage conformity to social norms
- Role. involves relationships between people, patterns of behaviour and rights and duties associated with a particular position. Everyone has more than one role
- Values -usually inferred from observed behaviour.
- Folkways-customary practices that are considered appropriate behaviour but are not rigidly enforced.
- Socialization-the process by which new members of a society are taught to participate in that society learn their roles and develop a self image.
- Stratification-a pattern where scarce resources,such as wealth income,and power are distributed unequally among the members of a society

- Re socialization-a process occurring in social institutions designed to undo the effects of previous socialization and teach an individual new and different beliefs and attitudes and behavior pattern
- Anomie-a situation in which social norms either do not exist or have become ineffective
- Acculturation-a process in which immigrant minority group are expected to adopt the dominant culture of the host county

\hline
\end{tabular}

\section*{Anthropology}
- It is the classification and analysis of humans and their society, descriptively, culturally, historically and physically
- It relies on data from non literate people.

\section*{Man and culture}
- Aristotle the ancient Greek philosopher declared long time ago that man I a social animal, he who does not need society should be either a beast or an angel! A man is a product of group life, it is the group that socializes him.it is the group life that will make a man a coward or a self sacrificing hero..a law abiding citizen or a criminal,it is this mansociety relationship that forms the central theme of sociological inquiry.
- The relationship between man and society is one of the most profound problems we have to tackle, it takes us to a more fundamental question of relation between the individual and society. The question is what do we owe each other?
- 1.man depends on society

Is observed that everyone breathe, live and work
- like millions around them.in the society and individual is surrounded and encompassed by culture, a societal force, he conforms to norms, occupy statuses and play roles within the society. Social life is an intrinsic need for man.emotional,material and intellectual developments are impossible without society.
- There two theories that explain the relationship between man and society
- 1.thesocial contract theory
- 2.the organismic theory of society
- According to the social contract theory all men are born free and equal. Individuals precedes society. Society came into existence because of an agreement entered into by individuals. the main proponents of this theory are Thomashobbes,John locke and J Rousseau
- A\} thomas hobbes(1588-1679) he was an english thinker,he opined that society came into being as a means for the protection of men against the consequences of their own nature. He claims that man was solitary,poor,nasty,brutish and short. Man in his state of nature was not at all social, he says that all men were selfish,cunning,egoistic, brutal,as.
- these things become intolerable men entered in to a contract to ensure security and certainty of life and property. The agreement was each for all and all for each.
- B) john locke

He was an english philosopher, he believed that man in his natural state enjoys liberty,freedom.but there was no sytem of law and justice. hence corruption and degeneration of man upset him.
- There was an ill condition full of fears and continual danger,in order to get rid of this fear.man entered in to social social contract.this led to governmental contract in order to releive the ill condition.
- J.J. Rousseau(1712-1778) , a french writer in his book "the social contract" wrote that man in his state of nature was a "noble savage" he was leading a life of primitive simplicity and idyllic hapinness, he was unaware of wrongs and rights.
- As populaion grew these things disapeared property institutionsdestroyed equality.man thought of mine and thine thuscame rich and rich led to war,conflict and murdes,this led to emergent of soiety according to him..
- TASK 1

Read about the criticism levelled against the social contact theory. -read about the organismic theory and its limitations.
- Man lives as member of a social group,isolated he ceases to exist,we depend on society not livelihood,but for life itself society not only controls our movements but structures of society become the structures of our own consciousness
- SOCIETY.

Society is one of the most inclusive concepts in sociological literature.
- Definations:
- maclver and page,society is a sysstem of of usages and procedures of authority and mutual aid of many groupings and divisions of controls of human behavior and liberties,this complex system is the web of social relationships and its always changing.
- G.D.H COLE, society is the complex of organized associations and instittions within community.

- 6.absract- society is intangible, we can only conceive it and understand its existence, society is not a thing but a process of associating.
- 7.system of control-human behavior needs certain checks o keep it within certain limits, so that healthy social life is a continued. Society has its own way of social control.
- 8.complex-society and human behavior are both complex
- 9.cooperation and division of labour

\section*{SOCIALIZATION PROCESS}
- Socialization is the process of earning group norms, habits and ideals
- the things that a child needs to know in order to function as a confirmed member of society.
- The following factors are important in this process
- 1.imitation-coping the acts of others, either consciously or unconsciously,spontanoeus or deliberate, through this a child learns social behavior patterns, children have great capacity to imitate they do it indiscriminately
- 2.suggestion-this is a process of communication in which the suggested i.e. a is accepted without logical grounds a child lacks the ability to think and reason hence highly suggestible.
- 3.identification-as the child grow they begin to identify with the people around them, and these are usually things that satisfy the child's need.as the child grows the areas of identification inceases
- 4.language-languge is the medium of expression, in the beginning the child utters meaningless words but gradually the skill of language is acquired. Thus in the process of learning, language is important.
- Phases or forms of socialization
- 1.primary socialization
- 2.anticipatory socialization
- 3.Secondary socialization.
- 4.developmental socialization
- 5.re socialization
- Primary socialization-takes place in infancy and childhood, it's the most crucial stage of socialization. The basic behavior pattern of a child is learnt at this stage.
- The child internalizes many of the socially accepted values,attitudes, beleifs, and behavior patterns of his culture. This stagee has three sub stages
- 1-the oral-where child builds up definite expectations about feeding time, and learns to signal pressing needs for care.
- 2- the anal stage begins more or less after a year of infancy
- Here the child is trained to take care of themselves such as toilet training.
- 3-the oedipal stage begins roughly from the fourth year and goes up to puberty, all the roles prescribed according to sex are internalized by the child. The child identifies with the social roles.
- Secondary socialization starts from the latter stage of childhood up to maturity. Socialization is a continuous process that takes place throughout the individuals life.
- Anticipatory socialization, is learning that is described towards a persons future role anticipatory socialization makes the individual expect their own participation in a social situation by watching how others would behave in that situation.
- Developmental socialization-as the individual grow he changes and moulds themselves according to the standards and the needs of the society.he identifies himself with the society,also
- it is a process by which a person is introduced to be part of society into which one was born and learns its culture.
- Primary socialization - learnt from parents and extended family on acceptable behaviour.
- Secondary socialization - from peers(age mates), school, neighbours and by watching adults.
- other agents of socialization- the family, media such as Television, newsprint

\section*{Agents of socialisation}
- Family- primary
- Social institutions- schools, religious organisations, government and hospitals
- Peers, school friends and neighbours
- Electronic and printed media- books, magz, journals, tv, radio, computer etc

\section*{Aims of Socialisation:}
1. To instil discipline (for example, don't walk in front of a moving car).
2. To develop aspirations and ambitions (for example, I want to be a nun, rock star, great sociologist).
3. To develop skills (for example, reading, driving and so on).
4. To enable the acquisition of social roles (for example, male, student and so on).

\section*{Other forms of classification}

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline Natural Socialisation & Planned Socialisation \\
\hline Natural socialisation occurs when infants and youngsters explore, play and discover the social world around them. & Planned socialisation occurs when other people take actions designed to teach or train others - from infancy on. \\
\hline Natural socialisation is easily seen when looking at the young of almost any mammalian species (and some birds). & Planmed socialisation is mostly a human phenomenon; and all through history, people have been making plans for teaching or training others. \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

Positive socialisation is the type of social learning that is based on pleasurable and exciting experiences. We tend to like the people who fill our social learning processes with positive motivation, loving care, and rewarding opportunities.

Negative socialisation occurs when others use punishment, harsh criticisms or anger to try to 'teach us a lesson'; and often we come to dislike both negative socialisation and the people who impose it on us.
Deliberate socialisation refers to the socialisation process whereby, there is a deliberate and purposeful intent to convey values, attitudes, knowledge, skill and so on.
Examples of deliberate socialisation include
School situation and Parents telling a child to always say 'please'

\section*{The Concept of Social Mobilisation}
- Social mobilisation is an approach and tool that enables people to organise for collective action, by pooling resources and building solidarity required to resolve common problems and work towards community advancement.
- It empowers women and men to organise their own democratically self-governing groups or community organisations which enable them to initiate and control their own personal and communal development, as opposed to mere participation in an initiative designed by the government or an external organisation

\section*{The Key Elements of Social Mobilisation}

\section*{Organisational Development}
- Organisational development is a process in which community members and, especially the poor, form their own groups or organisations based on common development interests and needs that are best served by organising themselves as a group.
- Capital Formation for Development through Community Savings
- Capital formation (through mobilisation of savings) enhances a community organisation's power to realise its full potential. 'Savings generated by individual members are the assets of the community organisation and are the first step towards their self-reliance' (Pandey 2002).
- Accumulated savings can be used for internal credit with interest, to enable individual members to engage in income generation activities whilst at the same time, accumulating the organisation's capital base.
- Training for Human Resource Development
- Community members can maximise their potential not only by organising themselves but also by upgrading their existing skills to better manage new inputs and establish effective links with local government and other actors.
- Socio-economic Development
- Socio-economic development initiatives are a great incentive for community members to organise themselves.

\section*{The Benefits of Social Mobilisation}
- Poverty Alleviation
- Promoting Democratic Governance
- Environmental conservation

\section*{Theories of social change}

\section*{Evolution and Differentiation}

Early sociologists were concerned chiefly with the origins of society and the transformations necessary to reach the type of society that people are now experiencing. Since Darwin's ideas of biological evolution were gaining acceptance at this time, the theory of societal evolution also became popular. Theories of structural differentiation take humankind somewhat further than the evolutionism from which they are derived. The basic idea is that as societies develop, they become characterised by increased separation and specialisation.

Equilibrium and Conflict

The equilibrium and conflict theory maintains that the basic function of any society is to maintain equilibrium (stability, order) and eliminate conflicts that may arise in the process of change. Conflict may arise mainly during the process of adjustment to forced change, when consensus is imperfect or among people who were inadequately socialised so that they do not fully share the consensus of the majority. The equilibrium theory is better for explaining gradual, long-term change such as the Industrial Revolution and changes applying to the society as a whole, than in accounting for the more sudden political revolution and smaller endogenous changes where conflict often plays an obvious part.

\section*{Modernisation}

The modernisation theory assumes that change is synonymous with improvement of social conditions, for the benefit of societies. Modernisation is the process by which agricultural societies were transformed into industrial societies. Modernisation theorists tend to see only the front end of the process of social change (what the modern society should look like) and ignore the traditional end of the process. Nevertheless, some attention must be given to modernisation theories because they are so prevalent and because they alert us to ways of examining long-term change.

\section*{HOW TO INITIATE SOCIAL CHANGE}
- Create awareness-
- Evoke desire for change
- Impact skills by showing them how to attain the goal
- Be optimistic
- Support and facilitate the change
- Stimulate them/ inspire them e.g. through a reward
* Get feedback.

\section*{Types of social change}
- Evolution
- The term evolution refers to slow or gradual change, which occurs with very low human effort, with almost unnoticeable changes in social structure. Examples are language, marriage patterns, child rearing practices and so on.
- Revolution
- This term refers to a rapid and deliberate change, which can radically change a society's way of doing things. Revolutions are planned for a specific purpose and are initiated by direct human action. For example, the Russian revolution and in East Africa, the Ugandan revolution that brought a new political system under President Idi Amin.
$\bullet$
- Reform
- This term refers to a deliberate effort by humans to alter the society's way of doing things. Reforms apply lesser force than revolutions and their effects are much more extensive than revolution. An example is the changes that occurred when Kenya's educational system switched from the 7-4-2 to the 8-4-4 system of education. These changes have influenced the whole education institution in this country so that all institutions of higher learning have had to re-do their curriculum. In addition, other colleges and universities, which accepted Kenyan students based on the old 7-4-2 system, have also re-adjusted their entry requirements to cater for the new system. You must have noticed this widespread type of social change.

\section*{Process of change}

\section*{SOCIAL STRATIFICATION}
- It is process which ranks members of society according to wealth, prestige, power, sex, age and ethnic origin
- In African societies, members are ranked according to sex, age, ethnic origin and occupation (Peil 1977).
Status may be: ascribed/born with e.g Prince
Achieved/acquired.eg President

\section*{Social stratification}
- Stratification is the process by which the individuals and groups are ranked more or less enduring hierarchy of status.
- Difference is the law of nature., every society is stratified in one way or the other.no two individuals are exactly alike.diverstity and inequality are inherent in every society. Hence human society is stratified everywhere.

\section*{The Conflict Theory of Stratification}
draws largely on the writings of Karl Marx, he saw society as divided into two major groups (capitalists and proletarians or workers) who are inevitably in conflict. Whereas Marx was particularly concerned only with the economic or market hierarchy, which he termed class, Max Weber suggested that people are also stratified according to status (prestige or lifestyle) and power. These three hierarchies may be closely related, but this is not necessarily so. Marx assumed that those with a high economic position would also have power, but rich businessmen often have less power than higher civil servants on moderate salaries; clergymen and teachers usually have higher status than either wealth or power - though this was more likely some time back.

\section*{Characteristics of social stratification.}
- Its social-biological traits do not determine social superiority or inferiority until they are socially recognized and given importance. For example a manager is chosen on the basis of their education,training, skills, experience and personality.
- Its universal-the difference between rich and poor is found everywhere
- Stratification is ancient-it has been around for ages-
- Its diverse in its form-its not uniform,it differs from region to region
- Its consequential-these are life chances and life styles.

Chances refers to thins like,infant mortality,physicl and mental illness, longevity,divorce,disertion.life chances are not voluntary
- Lifestyles are,mode of houses,education,recreation means,relationship between parents and children
- Functions of stratification
- -provides for the placement and motivation of individuals to effect he performance of their necessary social duties.
- -provides a system of rewards and inducements to members for carrying for carrying out various duties associated with various posts
- The rewards usually economic,prestige,leisure are built into the social positions so that being unequal they result in inequality of positions.
- Stratification sets apart the various positions of
- A society in a hierarchy of statuses levels that regulate the relationship between the people within a society.
