                        <h4>Three Fundamental Characteristics</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Powerlessness:</strong> It is rare for people to foresee what will happen tomorrow due to the realization of the fact that we are not in control of everything and the limit situation comes at death.</li>
                            <li><strong>Contingency:</strong> All that humankind has cannot last forever</li>
                            <li><strong>Scarcity:</strong> In common day experience, there is never always enough to circulate around among people.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>

                    <h3>Negative Functions of Religion</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Religion could lead to the denial and overlooking of certain social practices or functions thus, obstructing accommodation of new cultures</li>
                        <li>Since religion is full of superstitions it could sometimes promote fanaticism, intolerance, and superstition.</li>
                        <li>Religion could be a possible source of revolutionary movement or tendency in many communities</li>
                        <li>Religion creates differences among adherents which could arise from different doctrinal values.</li>
                        <li>Religion could make the poor complacent so that they are not engaged in productive work. Thus, resulting into laziness among its members.</li>
                        <li>Religion may lead to cannibalism and human sacrifice.</li>
                        <li>Religion could also lead to mutilation and destruction of some parts of the body so as to act as a permanent mark or self-identification.</li>
                        <li>Religion allows everything to be practiced. For example in Christianity, there is the continued practice of forgiveness and receptiveness which result in repeated vices in life.</li>
                        <li>Religion could make a faithful adherent to be passive in many aspects so that he/she could ask very few questions or none at all in challenging situations.</li>
                        <li>Religion leads to mental confusion among some adherents. For example in the careless usage of baptismal names for self-identification and the concept of salvation.</li>

                    <h2>Early Background and Branches of Anthropology</h2>
                    
                    <h3>Early Background of Anthropology</h3>
                    <p>Anthropology traces its roots to ancient Greek historical and philosophical writings about human nature and the organization of human society. In the book History, Herodotus described the culture of various people of the Persian Empire, which the Greeks conquered during the first half of 400 B.C.</p>

                    <h3>When did Anthropology start?</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>These are conditions of life with which people today must contend, but they have their origins in processes that began in the 16th Century and accelerated in the 19th Century.</li>
                        <li>Institutionally anthropology emerged from natural history (expounded by authors such as Buffon)</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Who is the father of anthropology?</h3>
                    <p>Franz Boas who gave modern anthropology its rigorous scientific methodology, patterned after the natural sciences and it was Boas who originated the notion of culture as learned behaviors.</p>

                    <h3>What are the four types of anthropology?</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Cultural anthropology:</strong> focuses on the social lives of living communities</li>
                        <li><strong>Archaeology:</strong> studies past cultures by excavating sites where people lived</li>
                        <li><strong>Biological:</strong> focuses on evolution, genetics and primatology</li>
                        <li><strong>Linguistics:</strong> verbal and non-verbal communication</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h3>Five branches of anthropology</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Physical anthropology:</strong> (biological anthropology) scientific discipline concerned with the biological and behavioral aspects of human beings, their extinct hominid ancestors and related non-human primates, particularly from an evolutionary perspective.</li>
                        <li><strong>Linguistic anthropology:</strong> the interdisciplinary study of how language influences social life</li>
                        <li><strong>Socio-cultural anthropology:</strong> study of society and culture while often interested in cultural diversity and universalism.</li>
                        <li><strong>Ethnology:</strong> the study of characteristics of different people and the differences and relationships between them.</li>
                        <li><strong>Archaeological anthropology:</strong> It's concerned with the study of the extinct cultures of man.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h3>Importance of studying anthropology</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Allows humans to study the interaction between other humans and the world</li>
                        <li>As it covers a vast amount of knowledge about humans, it is an aid for many other disciplines</li>
                        <li>It helps us understand ourselves hence, understand anything else</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h2>Human Needs</h2>
                    
                    <h3>Define Needs</h3>
                    <p>A need is something required for a safe, stable and healthy life (e.g. air, water, food and shelter)</p>

                    <h3>Distinguish between needs and wants</h3>
                    <p>Needs are something you must have in order to live. On the other hand wants are something that you wish to have so as to add comfort in your life.</p>
                    <p>Needs represent the necessities while wants indicate desires. Needs are important for the human being survival.</p>

                    <h3>What does basic human needs mean?</h3>
                    <p>The state of having an accurate and sufficient amount of a hot or cold drink, food, an income and a form of housing that meets the current need and priority of a being.</p>

                    <h3>Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs</h3>
                    <p>This is a motivational theory comprising of five tier model of human needs, often depicted as hierarchical levels within a pyramid.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Needs lower down in the hierarchy must be satisfied before the individual can attend to needs higher up</li>
                        <li>From the bottom of the hierarchy upwards, the needs are physiological, safety, love and belonging, self-esteem and self-actualization.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <div class="image-container">
                        <img src="assets/images/maslow-hierarchy.jpg" alt="Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs pyramid diagram showing five levels: physiological needs at bottom, then safety, love/belonging, esteem, and self-actualization at top" loading="lazy">

                    </div>

                    <h3>Deficiency needs vs. Growth needs</h3>
                    <p>The five stage model can be divided into deficiency needs and growth needs. The first four levels are referred to as deficiency needs (D-needs), and the top level is known as growth or being needs (B-needs).</p>
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Deficiency needs</strong> arise due to the deprivation and are said to motivate people when they are unmet. Also the motivation to fulfill such needs will become stronger the longer the duration they are denied (e.g. the longer a person goes without food, the more hungry they will become)</li>
                        <li>When a deficit need has become satisfied it will go away and our activities become habitually directed towards meeting the next set of needs that we have yet to satisfy these then become our salient need.</li>
                        <li>However <strong>growth needs</strong> continue to be felt and may even be stronger once they have been engaged</li>
                        <li>Growth needs do not stem from a lack of something, but rather from a desire to grow as a person</li>
                        <li>Once these needs have been reasonably satisfied, one may be able to reach the highest level (self-actualization)</li>
                        <li>Everybody is capable and has the desire to move up the hierarchy towards a level of self-actualization, unfortunately, progress is often disrupted by a failure to meet a lower level need. Life experiences like divorce and loss of a job may cause an individual to fluctuate between levels of the hierarchy.</li>
                        <li>Therefore not everyone will move through the hierarchy in a uni-directional manner but may move back and forth between the different types of needs.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Frustration(s)</h3>

                    <h4>Definition</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Refers to strategies which people use unconsciously to safeguard themselves against threats to personality, self or ego</li>
                        <li>Unconscious methods by which the ego distorts reality to protect itself from anxiety, confusion and frustration</li>
                        <li>An unconscious psychological mechanism that reduces anxiety arising from unacceptable or potentially harmful stimuli. Defense mechanisms may result in healthy or unhealthy consequences depending on the circumstances and frequency with which the mechanism is used.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Common Defense Mechanisms</h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Denial:</strong> It's the most common defense mechanism</li>
                        <li><strong>Projection:</strong> A psychological defense mechanism in which people attribute characteristics they find unacceptable in themselves to another person (false accusation)</li>
                        <li><strong>Repression:</strong> Unsavory thoughts, painful memories or irrational beliefs can upset one</li>
                        <li><strong>Displacement:</strong> Shifting the feelings about person onto another. A man who has had a bad day at the office comes home and yells at his wife and children is displacing his anger from workplace onto his family</li>
                        <li><strong>Regression:</strong> Leads to the temporary or long term reversion of the ego to an earlier stage of development rather than handling unacceptable impulses in a more adaptive way</li>
                        <li><strong>Rationalization:</strong> Making an excuse for a mistake or failure</li>
                        <li><strong>Sublimation:</strong> Socially unacceptable impulses/ideas are transformed into socially acceptable actions or behavior, possibly resulting in a long term conversion of the initial impulse</li>
                        <li><strong>Reaction formation:</strong> Is a defense mechanism in which emotions and impulses which are anxiety producing are mastered by exaggeration</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h4>Causes of Defense Mechanism</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>To avoid punishment/consequences</li>
                        <li>To seek attention from others</li>
                        <li>To solicit favors/rewards</li>
                        <li>For ego defense</li>
                        <li>To hide or block remembering of emotional threatening feelings/experiences</li>
                        <li>To justify behavior</li>
                        <li>To deny that the effects have already taken place</li>
                        <li>To avoid psychological tension, discomfort, conflict</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Importance of Defense Mechanism</h4>
                    <p>They safeguard the mind against feelings and thoughts that are too difficult for the conscious mind to cope with. In some instances defense mechanisms are thought to keep inappropriate/unwanted thoughts and impulses from entering the conscious mind.</p>

                <section id="counselling" class="section">
                    <h2>Counselling</h2>
                    
                    <p>It's the process that involves a trained counsellor helping an individual to find ways to work through and understand their problems.</p>

                    <h3>Guidance</h3>
                    <p>This is the advice or information meant to solve a problem or conflict and is mainly given by someone's authority. Guidance is normally less personal and is mainly engineered by the counsellor.</p>

                    <h3>Importance of guidance and counselling</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Identifying and dealing with challenges</strong> by helping one get insights into the origin and development of psychological and emotional challenges and cope up with possible interventions for elimination of them.</li>
                        <li><strong>Being realistic in life:</strong> it increases self-awareness and self-confidence in individuals in order to bring about required change, increasing the holding (retention) power in schools and making realistic plans and goals.</li>
                        <li><strong>Identifying potential:</strong> it helps students to exploit their talents so as to choose, prepare for, and enter and progress in careers in accordance with their ambitions.</li>
                        <li><strong>Adjusting to challenges in life:</strong> G/C helps to improve the self-image of individuals so that they make better adjustments to their situations in life by engaging in proper use of leisure time, minimizing the incidences of indiscipline and achieving the best of life tasks.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h3>Ethics and Principles</h3>
                    <p>Ethics govern the way of doing things in a given field. In counselling the ethics and principles outline the rules that guide the guidance and counselling practice and include:</p>
                    
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Client autonomy:</strong> the counselor needs to explain to the client that the counselling is voluntary and have a right to free and informed consent.</li>
                        
                        <li><strong>Confidentiality:</strong> this is the ability to keep secrets. The counselor should not divulge any information given to him/her by the client to a third party without the consent of the counselee. If any disclosure are to be made, the counselor must seek the consent of the client. However, there are some instances when confidentiality can be broken. These include:
                            <ul>
                                <li>When a counselee poses a danger to others or himself/herself</li>
                                <li>When the client is under the age of 18 years and is a victim of rape, incest or child abuse</li>
                                <li>When the counselor determines that the client needs medical attention or hospitalization</li>
                                <li>When information is made an issue in a court of law</li>
                                <li>When client request their records to be released to themselves or a third party</li>
                                <li>When a client is suicidal, such client will talk about committing suicide, give away prized possessions, take unnecessary risks, be preoccupied with death and dying etc.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        
                        <li><strong>Dual relationship in counselling:</strong> instances where the counsellor assumes two or more roles i.e. therapist/supervisor/teacher. This is however discouraged as it may derail objectivity and so any professional counsellor should avoid a dual relationship.</li>
                        
                        <li><strong>Touching as a part of the client/counsellor relationship:</strong> erotic contact with the client is unethical. Counsellors should be sensitive to situations where touching is likely to be counterproductive. Sexual intimacy between counsellor and client is both unethical and unprofessionally inappropriate and should not be practiced by counsellors. If such feelings manifest themselves during a counselling relationship then it is important for the counsellor to terminate the services. This way the counsellor will be acting professionally and keeping to the ethics of counselling.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h3>Qualities of a good counsellor</h3>
                    <ol type="a">
                        <li>Ability to understand a problem</li>
                        <li>Uses a variety of counselling techniques. This will depend on the situation and the nature of the specific problem. The counsellor therefore should identify what method works for a specific person with a specific problem.</li>
                        <li>A good role model: they should practice what they profess</li>
                        <li>Empathetic: be sensitive to the client's beliefs, values, inner conflicts and afflictions as well as be able to communicate feelings by word and gestures to the client. In other words the counsellor should have the ability to feel with the client without belittling their feelings.</li>
                        <li>Respectful: a client's solution to his/her issue should be respected by the counsellor as long as they are not posing any threat to the client's life or others.</li>
                        <li>Non-judgmental: should display unconditional positive regard to all their clients, regardless of who they are, what they have, their beliefs, attitudes, race, color, career or economic background</li>
                        <li>A good listener: be able to hear exactly what is being said verbally, as well as observe the message being communicated through non-verbal cues such as gestures and other body languages.</li>
                        <li>Self-conscious: be aware of their life that they have not dealt with. This is because counsellors who are struggling with their own insecurities or unresolved issues are likely to be of optimal use to the client.</li>
                        <li>Genuine or sincere: be faithful and honest. He/she should not live in pretense but needs to strive to live a fairly open life.</li>
                        <li>Maintain healthy boundaries: should not get infused to the life of the client. This way the counsellor will not create dependency on the part of the client and unethical practices like erotic touching and intimacies will not be developed.</li>
                        <li>Have a sense of humor: this helps in defusing tension, anxiety and uncertainties thus, putting the client at ease.</li>
                        <li>Knowledgeable: should be knowledgeable in human growth and development.</li>
                        <li>Ability to stay calm and composed even if the situation sounds unbearable.</li>
                        <li>Accommodative: should allow clients to express their feelings in whichever way they like. E.g. they can maintain silence, shout, yell or use angry words. The counsellor should not stop them freely expressing themselves.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h3>Types of counselling</h3>
                    <ol>

                    <h4>1. Individual counselling/psychotherapy/talk therapy or treatment</h4>
                    <p>Clients work one by one with a trained mental clinician in a safe, caring and confidential environment.</p>

                    <h5>Reasons for individual counselling</h5>
                    <ol type="a">
                        <li>Provides the client with a situation of complete confidentiality.</li>
                        <li>Provides the opportunity for a trusting and close relationship between the client and the counsellor.</li>
                        <li>It's beneficial for a client who may find it difficult to share information when other people other than the counsellor are present either because they are shy or feel as if they are the only ones experiencing the problem.</li>
                        <li>It caters for individual learning differences especially for the clients whose learning capacity has been affected by their state of mind.</li>
                        <li>It's very helpful to clients who have problems that emanate from themselves rather than problems caused by external forces.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h4>2. Group counselling</h4>
                    <p>This is a situation in which the counsellor works with several people in a session. These people have similar challenges and sharing of experiences during the session is very therapeutic. It can be used in cases like sexual abuse, rape, abortion, alcoholism, problems with self-image, self-esteem, trauma, family conflicts and marital problems.</p>

                    <h4>3. Crisis counselling</h4>
                    <p>It's a mental, psychological problem that affects the wellbeing (functioning) of a person, e.g. strikes in schools, colleges, universities, wars, sudden death of parent, spouse, child, divorce, rape, unwanted pregnancy, floods, accidents and other related problems.</p>

                    <h4>4. Preventive counselling</h4>
                    <p>The aim is to stop the counselee from getting involved in something negative or destructive, e.g. HIV negative pupils, students, adults can be counselled to know how to prevent themselves from the virus.</p>

                    <h4>5. Career counselling</h4>
                    <p>Its mentoring/coaching on issues related to an individual's career to help them make the right choice about their career.</p>

                    <h4>6. Developmental counselling</h4>
                    <p>It's the counselling that follows the actual child development stages of life e.g. the child on toileting and hygiene. Pre-teens can be counselled on body changes and their sexuality and preparation for marriage.</p>

                    <h3>Stages of the counselling process</h3>
                    <p>Counselling is not a one day event. It's a process that takes some time and continues in stages that include relationship building, defining the problems, establishing goals, working towards goal achievement and follow-up strategies.</p>

                    <h4>Counselling process</h4>
                    
                    <h5>Step 1: Attending/relationship building</h5>
                    <p>This is the time the counsellor and the counselee draw a contract on how to work together.</p>

                    <h5>Step 2: Defining of the problem or responding</h5>
                    <p>Counsellor's role at this step is to help the counselee see their blind spots and once seen, prioritize their issues. The client leads the way and the counsellor uses his/her expertise to find out whether the presented issue is the real or underlying problem. Clients are helped to work on issues and opportunities that make a difference.</p>

                    <h5>Step 3: Goal setting</h5>
                    <p>Counsellor helps the counselee to develop a range of goals and the client is helped to see the situation he/she would like to be in. Clients are also empowered to choose sensible possibilities and turn them into goals that need to be accomplished. The set goals aim at reducing the crisis, afflictions or the pain of the counselee.</p>

                    <h5>Step 4: Counselling intervention</h5>
                    <p>At this stage the counsellor helps discuss several strategies for implementing their goals, they can be asked to state where they want to go and how they hope to get there. A plan of action is then prepared to help the client tackle the problem. If the goal to be achieved is complicated, then the action plan can be divided into a number of interrelated outcomes for realistic accomplishments. The role of counsellor is purely to facilitate.</p>

                    <h5>Step 5: Termination of counselling</h5>
                    <p>This is the final stage of counselling and marks the close of the relationship.</p>
                    <p>This is the counsellor and the client ending the therapeutic alliance. The termination stage can be as important as the initial stage in that it is the last interaction many clients will have with the counsellor.</p>

                    <h5>Reasons leading to termination</h5>
                    <ol>
                        <li>When the counsellor-client relationship has failed to provide warmth, security and trust for a fully effective counselling experience.</li>
                        <li>Inadequate definition of the problem areas, leaving the client with vague ideas of the needed changes.</li>
                        <li>Selection of inappropriate goals and plans of action, which leaves the client frustrated and discouraged</li>
                        <li>When the client refuses or resists the recommended therapeutic interventions by the counsellor.</li>
                        <li>Ineffective translation of action plan into behavior changes</li>
                        <li>Unexpected or uncontrollable problems that are external to the counselling process, like financial constraints.</li>
                        <li>Client/counselor transferring to a far place.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h5>Step 6: Follow-up step</h5>
                    <p>Follow up is necessary for the counsellor to find out if the set goals are well implemented by the client. This is also meant to find if the client needs any referral.</p>
                    <p>It is also necessary to see to it that the client's problem does not recur or the patient does not relapse.</p>
