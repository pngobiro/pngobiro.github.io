                        <p>Institutions are organisations, or mechanisms of social structure, governing the behaviour of two or more individuals. Institutions are identified with a social purpose and permanence, transcending individual human lives and intentions, with the making and enforcing of rules governing human behaviour. As structures and mechanisms of social order among humans, institutions are one of the principal objects of study in the social sciences, including sociology, political science and economics. Institutions are a central concern for law, the formal regime for political rule making and enforcement.</p>

                        <p>The definition of the family, which is the basic unit of social structure, can vary greatly from time to time and from culture to culture. How a society defines family and the functions it asks families to perform, are by no means constant.</p>

                        <p>When a man and a woman marry, they are expected to have a sexual relationship with each other. It is only in marriage that sexual behaviour should be practised. It is within the marital setting that sex is legitimised. This functions to control illegitimate sex and indecencies such as incest, child abuse, rape, and risk of contracting Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs) like syphilis and gonorrhea and HIV/AIDS.</p>

If mothers have jobs outside the house, house helps and other family members (such as grandparents and older siblings) are engaged to continue with this function of nurturing the child while the mother is away.</p>

                        <p>Even today, children are taught at home, for example, social skills such as table manners, washing hands after visiting the toilet and before eating and so on. Parents are expected to continue showing an interest in their child's learning throughout school life.</p>

                        <p>The parents give a child the birth right as confirmed by the provision of a birth certificate by the government officials. They also have other rights that they should give to the child such as the right to an education, the right to basic needs such as clothing, food and shelter among others.</p>

                        <p>One of the functions of school is to offer secondary socialisation to children. As various teachers tutor them, children not only gain knowledge but also assimilate the values instilled to them by their teachers.</p>

                        </ul>
                        <p>Schools take charge of children as learning takes place. This provides parents with freedom to work without distraction. While at school, children are protected from playing dangerous games, for example, playing along the road, throwing stones at each other and so on.</p>

                        </ul>
                        <p>The communication of received beliefs and understandings is a major function of formal education. Education is especially relied on in societies that are culturally self-conscious. Awareness of a cultural heritage is usually associated with concern that traditional values and cultural 'mysteries' will be lost if no one has special knowledge of them. While cultural transmission tends to emphasise respect for tradition, values of criticism and inquiry may be passed on as well as conservative values.</p>

                        </ul>
                        <p>Formal education is a major agency for transforming a heterogeneous and potentially divided community into one bound together by a common language and a sense of common identity</p>

                        </ul>
                        <p>To some degree, even the most tradition-bound educational institution is a source of innovation because the teacher is called on to apply their wisdom or expertise to new situations.</p>
                        <p>Early innovations were often accidental and unanticipated, perhaps the result of religious rather than practical intent.</p>

                        </ul>
                        <p>In traditional society, when only a few select members of the community were educated, the school played a smaller role to that of family membership in determining the student's ultimate role and status. However, under the conditions of mass
                        education, the school system takes over the job of screening and allocating status. How the individual performs in school and the course of study they choose often determines their future occupation, income and prestige</p>

                        </ul>
                        <p>Formal education communicates skills and perspectives that cannot readily be gained through other socialising experiences. The school is also often a place of transition from a highly personal to a more impersonal world and habits such as punctuality may be learned here.</p>

                        </ul>
                        <p>This happens when members have a common creative belief. For example, in traditional religion, all community members would take part in a religious ceremony.</p>

                        </ul>
                        <p>Religious organisations usually provide emergency care during disasters, like floods, earthquakes, fires and wars..</p>

                        <p>Religion provides explanation for things inconceivable by the human mind, such as why people die, or what happens after death. This explanatory function serves to alleviate anxiety. Religion also helps members cope with anxiety due to togetherness among most of its members.</p>

                    </h2>
                     <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The control system of the family was weakened gradually. This led to the formation of political institutions such as governments in order to create and enforce laws so as to maintain functions. The government rules its people through various styles of leadership.</p>
                        <p>The three styles of leadership are:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                             <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">Autocratic (Authoritarian)</span></li>
                             <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">Democratic (Participative)</span></li>
                             <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">Laissez-faire (Delegative, Free-reign)</span></li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Autocratic (Authoritarian)</h3>
                        <p>This type of leader controls all the power to make and enforce laws and they assume all responsibility for the actions. This method is used when the leader tells their employees what they want done and how they want it done, without allowing them to participate in the decision making process. They elect themselves into a leadership position</p>

                        <h3>Democratic (Participative)</h3>
                        <p>This style involves the leader, including one or more employees in the decision making process (determining what to do and how to do it). However, the leader is the final decision making authority.</p>

                        <h3>Laissez-faire (Delegative, Free-reign)</h3>
                        <p>In this style, the leader allows the employees to make the decision. However, the leader is still responsible for the decisions that are made. This is used when employees are able to analyse the situation and determine what needs to be done and how to do it.</p>

                        <h3>Functions of Government</h3>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">1.</span><span class="item-text">Maintenance of Social Order</span></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The government has the responsibility of keeping social order. In order to fulfil this function, the government enacts laws, which it enforces. It also identifies law enforcement agents who ensure that citizens abide by the laws.</p>
                         <ul class="enhanced-list" start="2">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">2.</span><span class="item-text">Coordination of Essential Services</span></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Similar to a family unit, the government has to coordinate various activities useful for the effective functioning of the society. To meet this need, the government establishes ministries, each of which has specific activities it is responsible for. In Kenya, nursing
                        services are under the Ministry of Health while education is under the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology.</p>
                         <ul class="enhanced-list" start="3">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">3.</span><span class="item-text">Protection of all Citizens</span></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>In order to fulfil the function of maintaining security, armed forces are developed to meet these needs.</p>
                        <p>You have covered some of the leadership styles and functions of the government. On a micro-level, it is important to understand the functions of the local government. These include:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">Providing democratic and accountable government for local communities</span></li>

                        <h3>Traditional Medicine</h3>
                        <p>Many African societies had traditional healers, whose indigenous knowledge of folk medicine was respected. They used herbs and some practised magic and divination as they strived to meet the health needs of their clients. Today, fewer people subscribe to services of traditional healers. They mainly provide emotional and social treatment for illness such as mental illness, bereavements and disasters.</p>

                        <h3>Private Health Facilities</h3>
                        <p>These are health facilities owned and/or run by religious and private organisations. They are popular in areas without government health facilities.</p>

                        <h3>Public Health Facilities</h3>
                        <p>These are government-run health facilities and are present in most parts of the country. In Kenya, health facilities are classified according to their structure (mainly size and catchment population) and by extension, their functions. The facilities range from national hospital, provincial general hospital, district hospital, sub-district hospital, health centre to dispensary. The largest hospital in Kenya is the Kenyatta National Hospital. It serves as a teaching, research and national referral hospital. Many nurses, doctors, pharmacists, laboratory technologists and other health professionals have trained here.</p>
