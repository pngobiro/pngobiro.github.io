                        <p>Sociology is the study of social life, social change, and the social causes and consequences of human behaviour. Sociologists investigate the structure of groups, organisations, and societies, and how people interact within these contexts. Since all human behaviour is social, the subject matter of sociology ranges from the intimate family to the hostile mob; from organised crime to religious cults; from the divisions of race, gender, and social class to the shared beliefs of a common culture; and from the sociology of work to the sociology of sports.</p>

                        <p>Sociology is about people. It is about how people interact and why they behave as they do. Whether you look at a family, a business, or a sporting event, you are looking at something that sociology is involved with. No matter what you do in your personal and professional life or where you go, you can use sociology.</p>
                        <p>Sociological research contributes to our understanding of individuals, groups, organisations, communities and societies. Practising sociologists conduct or assist in problem solving interventions on all of these levels.</p>

                        <p>The medical sociology helps to identify and study social groups in their activities of maintaining and preserving health, alleviating or curing diseases.</p>
                        <p>Medical sociology is concerned with the social facets of health and illness, social function of health institutions and organizations, the relationship of health care delivery to other social systems and social behavior of health personnel and consumers of health care.</p>
                        <p>The sociology of medicine deals with organization's role, relationships, norms, values and beliefs of medical practice as a form of human behavior. Here, the social processes that occur in a medical setting are studied. Thus, sociology of medicine is research and analysis of medical environment from a sociological perspective.</p>
                        <p>Thus, in short medical sociology covers the following aspects of public health:</p>
