                        <p>Culture is defined as the totality of socially transmitted behaviour patterns, arts, beliefs, institutions, and all other products of human work and thought.

                        <h3>Non-material Culture</h3>
                        <p>There are four various forms of non-material culture, they are listed below.</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                             <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">Language</span></li>

                        </ul>

                        <h4>Language</h4>
                        <p>Language refers to the pattern of spoken or written words used by a particular society in order to communicate. The mother tongue refers to the language of one's parents.</p>
                        <div class="table-container">
                            <table class="content-table">
                                <thead>

                            </table>
                        </div>

                        <h4>Mores</h4>
                        <p>Mores are explained as social norms, which emphasise the expected moral behaviour for societal members. If an individual breaks the mores, the individual receives severe punishments. Some examples of mores are: do not lie, do not steal or destroy other's property and so on. All society members are expected to obey the mores or else they receive punishment.</p>

                        <h4>Norms</h4>
                        <p>Norms are defined as socially accepted patterns of behaviour. You should note that norms differ from society to society. They may include children respecting parents and older people in society, as demonstrated by a young person offering an older person a seat in a bus and so on.</p>

                        <h4>Laws</h4>
                        <p>Laws are written, socially confirmed rules and regulations of conduct, which if violated,
                        are punishable. Laws are enforced by a socially identified agency. For an example of medically related laws, refer to module four, unit one, section two on the mental health act.</p>

                        <h3>Material Culture</h3>
                        <p>material culture is defined as the part of culture that includes physical things in any society. Examples of material culture include the type of clothing used, ornaments such as necklaces, bangles, and earrings, kitchenware, type of houses and many more. Akinsola also explains that the importance of identifying material culture relates to how these items are used by individuals in the society. For example, among the Agikuyu people, women and girls learnt to use pots for cooking and gourds for serving food and storing liquids such as milk.</p>
                        <p>In modern days, nurses are expected to learn how to use computers, new types of blood pressure machines, digital thermometers and others in order to improve the health care they provide. In addition, they are expected to provide nursing care to persons of varying cultural ethnic background. For further details refer to the module one, unit one on professionalism.</p>

                        <h3>Food Taboos</h3>
                        <p>Outbreaks of malnutrition among children in this country may not only be associated with lack of food but also with culture patterns affecting food. For example, in some parts of Kenya, children and women are not given eggs in the belief that the child will learn to be a thief when grown up or that a mother feeding on eggs may harm her unborn baby. Instead, the eggs are reserved for the men to eat or to be sold at the market.</p>

                        <h3>Overcrowding</h3>
                        <p>When several family members live in congested homes with a low standard of hygiene, this may contribute to poor health. This mainly occurs in urban centres, where a family may rent one room, which serves as the kitchen, bedroom and dining room.</p>
                        <p>There may be communal water but often there is none, and in such cases the family has to buy water or fetch it from a stream. Under such living conditions children suffer from diarrhoea, intestinal worms and sometimes malnutrition.</p>
                        <p>Due to the increased expenses associated with hospital care, parents may decide to take their child to traditional medicine men.</p>

                        <h3>An Example of the Effects of Cultural Beliefs on the Diet of the Somalis</h3>

                        </ul>

                        <h3>Effects of Cultural Beliefs on the Diet</h3>
                        <p><em>(Note: This seems like a repeated/misplaced heading from the MMD. The following points continue the Somali diet example.)</em></p>

                        <h4>Breastfeeding</h4>
                        <p>It is culturally important for Somali mothers to breastfeed their babies. Not doing so is seen as a sign of poor mothering. Somali children are breastfed until they are two years old, or until the mother becomes pregnant again</p>

                        <h4>Bottle Feeding</h4>
                        <p>In both urban and rural areas, when babies are one year old, most drink from a glass or cup without their parent's help. Bottles are difficult to keep clean and are not usually used.</p>

                        <h4>Teething</h4>
                        <p>Somalis associate teething with diarrhoea, fever, nausea, and vomiting. Children usually begin teething when they are between nine months and one year old, although it can
                        occur as early as four months. Those who get their teeth earlier are thought to have more difficulties. A soothing oil is sometimes placed on the gums to calm teething children, but pacifiers are not used.</p>
