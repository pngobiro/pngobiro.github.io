                        <p>Socialisation refers to the development of the individual from infancy upwards; it is intertwined with the educational system, whether through formal education in schools, through non-formal programmes, or through informal education such as family upbringing.</p>
                        <p>Human infants are born without any culture. They must be transformed by their parents, teachers, and others into cultural and socially adept animals.</p>
                        <p>The general process of acquiring culture is referred to as socialisation. During socialisation, we learn the language of the culture we are born into as well as the roles we are to play in life.</p>
                        <p>Socialisation is important in the process of personality formation.</p>
                        <p>Successful socialisation can result in uniformity within a society.</p>

                    </h2>
                     <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Having defined the socialisation process you will now identify the parts that make up the socialisation process.</p>
                        <p>The socialisation process is made up of two parts:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                             <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">Primary socialisation</span></li>
                             <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">Secondary socialisation</span></li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Primary Socialisation</h3>
                        <p>This is the type of socialisation that starts from infancy with parents and other family members who are in close contact with the young one. The mother plays an active role in bonding with her infant. As the child advances in age, they are taught the expected roles according to age and sex. In due course children will learn how to dress, use the toilet facilities, and feed themselves and so on. In the traditional African family, parents and the extended family members were involved in socialising the child.</p>

                        <h3>Secondary Socialisation</h3>
                        <p>This takes us outside the home with playmates in the neighbourhood, at school and with other community agents, for example, religious forums. According to Peil (1977), rearing children in an urban area of western Africa is very much the same as in the countryside.</p>
                        <p>As these children continue their education through primary, secondary and college levels, they come into contact with several social groupings, all of which are in a position to influence their behaviour</p>
                        <p>During adolescence, the youth often confide in their peers. They no longer feel compelled to express their needs to the parents. When this happens, it is possible for the youth to imitate negative behaviours from their peers, behaviour which is often contrary to their parents' expectations. On the other hand, youths who move to boarding secondary schools may get secondary socialisation from their teachers, who become their new parent figures and role models. The youth of today often develop their own pattern of language for communication, known as sheng in Nairobi, that parents and teachers are unableto communicate in.</p>

                        <h3>Natural and Planned Socialisation</h3>
                        <div class="table-container">
                            <table class="content-table">

                                    <tr><td>Natural socialisation occurs when infants and youngsters explore, play and discover the social world around them.</td><td>Planned socialisation occurs when other people take actions designed to teach or train others - from infancy on.</td></tr>
                                    <tr><td>Natural socialisation is easily seen when looking at the young of almost any mammalian species (and some birds).</td><td>Planned socialisation is mostly a human phenomenon; and all through history, people have been making plans for teaching or training others.</td></tr>

                        </div>
                        <p>Both natural and planned socialisation can have good and bad features: It is wise to learn the best features of both natural and planned socialisation and weave them into our lives.</p>

                        <h3>Positive Socialisation</h3>
                        <p>Positive socialisation is the type of social learning that is based on pleasurable and exciting experiences. We tend to like the people who fill our social learning processes with positive motivation, loving care, and rewarding opportunities. Negative socialisation occurs when others use punishment, harsh criticisms or anger to try to 'teach us a lesson'; and often we come to dislike both negative socialisation and the people who impose it on us.</p>

                        <h3>Mixed Positive and Negative Socialisation</h3>
                        <p>There are all types of mixes of positive and negative socialisation; and the more positive social learning experiences we have, the happier we tend to be - especially if we learn useful information that helps us cope well with the challenges of life. A high ratio of negative to positive socialisation can make a person unhappy, defeated or pessimistic about life.</p>

                        <h3>Deliberate Socialisation</h3>
                        <p>Deliberate socialisation refers to the socialisation process whereby, there is a deliberate and purposeful intent to convey values, attitudes, knowledge, skill and so on.</p>
                        <p>Examples of deliberate socialisation include</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">School situation</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">Parents telling a child to always say 'please'</span></li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Unconscious Socialisation</h3>
                        <p>Unconscious socialisation occurs as a result of spontaneous interaction, with no purposeful or deliberate attempt on the part of anyone involved to train or educate and so on. An example of unconscious socialisation is, for example, when a child learns how to use vulgarity by observing a parent caught up in a frustrating traffic situation. Having covered the various types and classifications of socialisation, you will now cover the agents of socialisation.</p>

                     <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The primary agents of socialisation make the deepest impression on the personality of the child because they provide the first training. The other agents must, therefore, compete for attention on the already established framework.</p>

                        <h3>Family</h3>
                        <p>The family is made up of parents, children and close relatives. These are the primary agents of socialisation who influence the child's behaviour and attitudes within the society. You will study more on the family in section four on social institutions.</p>

                        <h3>Social Institutions</h3>
                        <p>These are explained as social organisations each with a specific function (Akinsola 1983). Examples of social institutions are the</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">Family</span></li>

                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">Religious organisations</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">Government and hospitals.</span></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Each of these social institutions is organised to offer a service to community members.</p>
                        <p>When a child enters school they start experiencing secondary socialisation through the teachers, schoolmates and the school environments.</p>

                        <h3>AGENTS OF SOCIOLIZATION</h3>
                        <p><em>(Note: This seems like a repeated/misplaced heading from the MMD. The following content continues listing agents.)</em></p>

                        <h3>Peers, School Friends and Neighbours</h3>
                        <p>The peers, schoolmates and neighbours that a child spends most of their waking hours with also become major agents. Children have friends whom they want to be similar to. However, sometimes what their peers tell them may not conform with what the parents are telling them and so they have to make a decision between the two. The decision made depends on the strength of the foundation laid by the parents.</p>

                        <h3>Electronic and Printed Media</h3>
                        <p>These include books, magazines, journals, television, radio, computer (internet) and others. A child may begin to emulate what they are seeing on television and may act negatively if they are not able to filter the good and the bad based on earlier teachings. This can have both positive and negative influences on the child or even an adult. Generally, it can be seen that various socialising agents encountered by an individual may support each other by promoting the same goals, or they may provide contradictory advice.</p>
