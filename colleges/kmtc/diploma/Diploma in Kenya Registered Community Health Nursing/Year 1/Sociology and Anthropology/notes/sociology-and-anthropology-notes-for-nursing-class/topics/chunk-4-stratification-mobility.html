                     <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Another way of ranking society members is according to their status. Status can be defined as any position within the stratification system. This definition says nothing about the basis for status in a stratification system. Thus a particular status or position can be high or low on the basis of the property, prestige or power (or all three) associated with that position.</p>
                        <p>There are two types of status.</p>

                        <h3>Ascribed Status</h3>
                        <p>This is explained as grouping individuals according to their social position, for example, by virtue of one's age, sex or position of birth (indicates that the holder of this position was born within or inherited a given status in society). Ascribed status is a position based on who you are not what you can do.</p>
                        <p>A good example of ascribed status can be found in India, where the caste system is practised. Members of the upper caste do not in any way interact with those of the lower caste or the untouchables. Members of the upper caste are usually well educated, while those of the lower caste are poor with limited opportunities and are usually manual workers. These two caste level societies do not intermarry (Joseph 1986). BY BIRTH</p>

                        <h3>Achieved/Acquired Status</h3>
                        <p>Achieved status is a position gained on the basis of merit or achievement. This is defined as the position in society earned through the individual's efforts or choice, for example, being a father, mother, nurse or a teacher.</p>

                        <h3>Social Mobility</h3>
                        <p>The ability to move up or down the social level is referred to as social mobility. The amount of mobility in a society depends on two factors. First, the rules governing how people gain or keep their position may make mobility difficult or easy.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, whatever the rules, structural changes in society can influence mobility. Social mobility occurs in an open social system while closed systems offer no room for any movement.</p>

                        <h3>Types of Social Mobility</h3>
                        <p>There are two types of social mobility:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">Vertical social mobility</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">Horizontal social mobility</span></li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Vertical Social Mobility</h4>
                        <p>The ability of the individual to move up the social ladder, thereby raising their social status and role. It also refers to any upward or downward change in the absolute or relative rank of an individual or group. An example of this would be the nurse, who joins the profession as a community nurse and, by increasing their knowledge through in-service education, acquires the new position of a professor in nursing.</p>

                        <h4>Horizontal Social Mobility</h4>
                        <p>This refers to the type of social mobility where the individual maintains the same status. It is also defined as an alteration of position with no significant movement up or down in the system of social stratification, for example a general nurse who trains as a midwife but has no change in salary. This nurse maintains the same status although their role may have changed.</p>

                        <h3>Certain characteristics can affect the individual's chances of moving up the social ladder.</h3>
                        <h4>Community Size</h4>
                        <p>This is where a large community often results in greater economic differences. This is more apparent in larger cities and thus may be more likely to impart incentives to lower level children.</p>

                        <h4>Number of Siblings</h4>
                        <p>Number of siblings is where an only child or children having one sibling have the best chance of being upwardly mobile.</p>

                        <h4>Mother Dominance</h4>
                        <p>Mother dominance is where the strong mother family seems to be more conducive to upward mobility than the egalitarian or father-dominant family.</p>

                        <h4>Late Marriage</h4>
                        <p>Late marriage, as it has been argued that early marriages encourage downward mobility whereas late marriages encourage upward mobility.</p>

                        <h4>Few Children</h4>
                        <p>Few children, where upwardly mobile couples tend to have fewer children than immobile couples in the social levels into which they move.</p>

                        <h3>Other Types of Social Mobility</h3>
                        <p>There are two other types of social mobility based on different classification systems:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">Structural Mobility</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">Exchange Mobility</span></li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Structural Mobility</h4>
                        <p>Structural mobility is social mobility that results from changes in the distribution of statuses in society. Structural mobility occurs regardless of the rules governing status.</p>

                        <h4>Exchange Mobility</h4>
                        <p>Mobility that is not structural is called exchange mobility. The word exchange indicates a trade-off. In exchange mobility, some people rise to fill positions made available because other people have fallen in the status system.</p>
                        <p>Many children of talented and ambitious parents do not inherit the talent or ambition that earned their parents a high rank. Conversely, many children of low status parents are more talented and ambitious than their parents.</p>

                        <h3>Application</h3>
                        <p>As nurses you are the main health care providers to various groups of people. Therefore, in line with the nursing code of ethics, you will have to provide health care services to people of whichever status in society. This enables the nurse to provide the basic health care that people deserve.</p>

                        <h4>Poverty Alleviation</h4>
                        <p>Social mobilisation is an important tool in the poverty alleviation process, as it enables communities and the poor themselves to engage actively in solving their own problems and effectively tackling poverty in its multi-dimensional form. The principles of social mobilisation ensure equity, hence issues of gender based, racial and ethnic based discrimination are most likely addressed.</p>

                        <h4>Promoting Democratic Governance</h4>
                        <p>Experience shows that poverty and bad governance mutually reinforce each other, as they foster exclusion of citizens from decision making processes, lack of access to basic services, lack of opportunity, dependency, and limit availability of public goods. Social mobilisation must be institutionalised within government for it to be effective. This would encourage participation in decision making, build capacity for participatory planning, build a common vision on development and ensure transparency.</p>

                        <h4>Environment</h4>
                        <p>By organising people to better manage their natural resources and fight against practices and organisations that degrade the environment through promoting appropriate legal, regulatory and institutional frameworks and policy dialogue.</p>

                        <h4>Conflict Prevention</h4>
                        <p>As people prepare to address common problems, and to collectively improve their socio-
                        economic conditions in an equitable, democratic and transparent manner, possibility of conflict can be significantly reduced.</p>
