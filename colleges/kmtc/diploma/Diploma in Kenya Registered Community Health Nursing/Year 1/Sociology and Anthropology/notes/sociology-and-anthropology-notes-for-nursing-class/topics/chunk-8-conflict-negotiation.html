                     <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Conflict is a person's struggle with him/herself, another person, or a thing. It is a problem or disagreement and results in a situation that needs resolution. Conflict is present in every person's life.</p>

                        <h3>What is Conflict Resolution?</h3>
                        <p>Conflict resolution is the process of finding a way to manage or solve a problem. There are several methods of conflict resolution. Some result in win-lose solutions, while others can be win-win. Through programs like peer mediation, children learn to go for the win-win solution!</p>

                        <h3>Situations That May Lead to Conflict</h3>
                        <p>Factors that may contribute to conflict are varied. Here are some examples of the situations where conflict may arise:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">During the process of adjustment to forced change</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">When various groups are not in agreement</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">When some societal groups feel left out when new agreements are being implemented</span></li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Conflict Resolution Styles</h3>
                        <p>There are many different ways of resolving conflict. The three most common ways are fight, flight and flow.</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                             <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">Fight</span></li>
                             <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">Flight</span></li>
                             <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">Flow</span></li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Fight</h4>
                        <p>In a fight, two or more people are aggressive with one another. Fighting can be done with words, weapons or fists. Following a battle of some description there will be a winner and a loser, or both may lose.</p>

                        <h4>Flight</h4>
                        <p>In a flight situation, one party walks away from the conflict. The problem is left unresolved and there may be a winner and a loser. Common 'flight' language includes 'never mind', 'just forget it' and 'whatever'.</p>

                        <h4>Flow</h4>
                        <p>In a flow situation both people walk away from the conflict satisfied with the solution which they have reached together. Conflict resolution encourages everyone to 'go with the flow' and create solutions!</p>

                        <h3>Skills to Resolve Conflict Peacefully</h3>
                        <p>The first thing you need is a willingness to work toward a win-win solution.</p>
                        <p>Then there are several helpful skills to guide you through the process:</p>

                    </h2>
                     <div class="content-card">
                        <p>There are several ways of resolving conflicts at the government level. You will look at each of these in detail.</p>

                        <h3>Appointing a Commission</h3>
                        <p>A commission is a group of people, usually professionals in a certain field who are selected to look into a problem more keenly, so as to come up with a solution. One example is if the prices of basic items continue rising, the government may establish a commission to look into the effect of this increase on workers' wages. The commission/committee is given the mandate to suggest ways to improve the workers'
                        wages, actual remuneration, perhaps to suggest possible sources of funding and ways of handling future government/workers conflict.</p>

                        <h3>Elections to Change the Leaders</h3>
                        <p>On some occasions due to strained relationships between the current government and populace, an election may be called. In this case the population may elect a new government with new political leaders of their choice. When this happens, the masses feel that they have picked their choice of leaders, thereby averting conflict.</p>

                        <h3>Meeting with Concerned Persons</h3>
                        <p>At times in the work place, conflict may arise between the in-charge persons and other staff members. One of the ways to avert this misunderstanding is to call a meeting where all stakeholders are invited. This provides for an opportunity to speak out, discuss and agree on solutions to be effected by all. Mediators may also be chosen to represent one of the parties. In this way, harmony in the work place is restored.</p>

                     <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The process of negotiation consists of three important phases.</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                             <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">The Information Phase</span></li>

                        </ul>

                        <h3>The Information Phase</h3>
                        <p>During this phase, you should collect and evaluate information on all factors that will have an effect on the negotiation. Work out a defensive plan to protect sensitive information that the opposition is likely to inquire about. Decide whether the negotiations will be carried out by yourself or an agent.</p>

                        <h3>The Competitive Phase</h3>
                        <p>The bargaining begins during this phase. You should decide who should go first on particular issues. Support your position on an appropriate rationale and actively manage the concession process.</p>

                        <h3>The Cooperative Phase</h3>
                        <p>It is important to understand that, ultimately, cooperation is a worthy and necessary stage in the negotiation process. While acknowledging that negotiations are inherently competitive, it helps to remember the following:</p>
