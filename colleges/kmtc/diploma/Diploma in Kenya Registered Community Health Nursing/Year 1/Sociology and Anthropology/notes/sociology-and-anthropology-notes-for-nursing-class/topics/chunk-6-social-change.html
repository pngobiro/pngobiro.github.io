                        <p>Social change is the transformation of culture and social institutions over time. All societies experience change in their social structure and culture over time, explanations of the causes and nature of this change have been part of the sociologist's task from the beginning of this discipline. Societies change because they are in contact with other societies. As a result the ideas, norms and institutions spread from one society to another.</p>

                     <div class="content-card">
                        <h3>Evolution and Differentiation</h3>
                        <p>Early sociologists were concerned chiefly with the origins of society and the transformations necessary to reach the type of society that people are now experiencing. Since Darwin's ideas of biological evolution were gaining acceptance at this time, the theory of societal evolution also became popular. Theories of structural differentiation take humankind somewhat further than the evolutionism from which they are derived. The basic idea is that as societies develop, they become characterised by increased separation and specialisation.</p>

                        <h3>Equilibrium and Conflict</h3>
                        <p>The equilibrium and conflict theory maintains that the basic function of any society is to maintain equilibrium (stability, order) and eliminate conflicts that may arise in the process of change. Conflict may arise mainly during the process of adjustment to forced change, when consensus is imperfect or among people who were inadequately socialised so that they do not fully share the consensus of the majority. The equilibrium theory is better for explaining gradual, long-term change such as the Industrial Revolution and changes applying to the society as a whole, than in accounting for the more sudden political revolution and smaller endogenous changes where conflict often plays an obvious part.</p>

                        <h3>Modernisation</h3>
                        <p>The modernisation theory assumes that change is synonymous with improvement of social conditions, for the benefit of societies. Modernisation is the process by which agricultural societies were transformed into industrial societies. Modernisation theorists tend to see only the front end of the process of social change (what the modern society should look like) and ignore the traditional end of the process. Nevertheless, some attention must be given to modernisation theories because they are so prevalent and because they alert us to ways of examining long-term change.</p>

                     <div class="content-card">
                        <p>You have already studied what social change is, that is, an alteration of what makes the society and its relationships. There are three ways in which society changes and you will now cover each of these in detail.</p>

                        <h3>Evolution</h3>
                        <p>The term evolution refers to slow or gradual change, which occurs with very low human effort, with almost unnoticeable changes in social structure. Examples are language, marriage patterns, child rearing practices and so on.</p>

                        <h3>Revolution</h3>
                        <p>This term refers to a rapid and deliberate change, which can radically change a society's way of doing things. Revolutions are planned for a specific purpose and are initiated by direct human action. For example, the Russian revolution and in East Africa, the Ugandan revolution that brought a new political system under President Idi Amin.</p>

                        <h3>Reform</h3>
                        <p>This term refers to a deliberate effort by humans to alter the society's way of doing things. Reforms apply lesser force than revolutions and their effects are much more extensive than revolution. An example is the changes that occurred when Kenya's educational system switched from the 7-4-2 to the 8-4-4 system of education.</p>

                        <span class="heading-text">How Does Social Change Occur?</span>
                    </h2>
                     <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Social change takes place when people choose to modify their environment. The changes occur mainly when existing cultural patterns are altered either due to innovations or when new ideas are introduced into the society.</p>
                        <p>Another change, involves technological advances. For example, a few years ago, people were using the landline telephone to pass messages. Today landlines are being gradually replaced by mobile phones. The mobile phone is convenient because one can communicate wherever they are. In health care facilities, it is now possible to quickly reach a health care provider, for example, the consultant to attend to a very sick patient, which decreases the chances of mortality.</p>
                        <p>These are just a few examples of social changes that have occurred in our country in the last few decades.</p>

                        <h3>Process of Change</h3>
                        <p>There are two processes under which social change occurs. These are diffusion and innovation. You will cover each of these individually.</p>

                        <h4>Diffusion</h4>
                        <p>Diffusion is defined as a process of change involving the selection and adoption of cultural items from another society. The diffusion of culture can be a one-way or a twoway process. For example in Kenya, people have accepted the western way of dress while some of them have adopted our way of dressing such as the Maasai 'shukas' and the Waswahili 'kikois'.</p>

                        <h4>Innovation</h4>
                        <p>Innovation is the second type of change process and is defined as the process of introducing new items to the society. The innovations come in two forms, known as inventions and discoveries.</p>

                        <h5>Inventions</h5>
                        <p>Inventions refer to existing culture items, which are recombined to form a new item that did not exist before, for example vaccines, intravenous drugs, mobile phones and so on.</p>
                        <p>When the society accepts these inventions, they affect change. For example, the invention of vaccines against childhood diseases has led to a reduction in infections and better health of the children.</p>

                        <h5>Discovery</h5>
                        <p>A discovery involves finding things that already exist, for example, archaeological findings such as cooking wares and implements, which are then preserved in museums. You will now cover the basic steps of implementing change in our health set up.</p>

                        </div>
                         <div class="column-right">
                            <h3>Knowledge/Awareness</h3>
                            <p>An obvious first step is that people must:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">Know there is a problem.</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">Know there is a practical, viable solution or alternative. This is important. People are practical and they will always demand clear, simple, feasible road maps before they start a journey to a strange place.</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">Identify the personal costs of inaction and the benefits of action in concrete terms that people can relate to, that is, allow them to 'own' the problem.</span></li>
                            </ul>

                            <h3>Desire</h3>
                            <p>Change involves imagination. People need to be able to visualise a different, desirable future for themselves. Desire is an emotion, not a kind of knowledge</p>

                            <h3>Skills</h3>
                            <p>Skills allow you to easily visualise the steps required to reach the goal. People often learn skills best by seeing someone else perform them. The best way to do this is to break the actions down into simple steps and use illustrations to make visualisation easy.</p>

                            <h3>Optimism (or Confidence)</h3>
                            <p>This is the belief that success is probable or inevitable. Strong political or community leadership is probably an important ingredient of optimism.</p>

                            <h3>Facilitation</h3>
                            <p>People are busy with limited resources and few choices. They may need outside support in the form of accessible services, infrastructure and support networks that overcome practical obstacles to carrying out the action.</p>

                            <h3>Stimulation</h3>
                            <p>An inspiration to do something has many times happened in a collective context. This is a kind of inspirational mass conversion, which is based on our human social instincts,
                            like the mass meeting where a personal commitment is made. You need to instil this in your team members. The stimulation could be an imminent threat (like a cost increase), a special offer or competition (based on self-interest), or, better still, some communally shared event, which galvanises action (for example, a public meeting or a festival).</p>

                            <h3>Feedback and Reinforcement</h3>
                            <p>It is always important to get feedback at the end of the day and know whether the change was approved or not and gain perceptions and views on the area of that change.</p>

                        <p>Social change influences health in a complex way. Health status is changing with the development of societies, but it is not invariably for the better.</p>

                        <h3>Industrialisation</h3>
                        <p>Social change caused by industrialisation leads to mismanagement of natural resources, excessive waste production and associated environmental conditions that affect health. Environmental quality is an important direct and indirect determinant of human health. Poor environmental quality is directly responsible for around $25\%$ of all preventable illhealth in the world today, with diarrhoeal diseases and acute respiratory infections heading the list. Other diseases such as malaria, schistosomiasis, other vector-borne diseases, chronic respiratory diseases and childhood infections are also strongly influenced by adverse environmental conditions.</p>
                        <p>Lack of basic sanitation, poor water supply and poor food safety contribute greatly to diarrhoeal disease mortality and morbidity. In addition, the incidence, severity and distribution of vector-borne diseases are affected substantially by human activities such as water and agricultural developments and by urbanisation.</p>

                        <h3>Population</h3>
                        <p>Due to innovations in the provision of health care such as vaccines, availability of drugs, increase in the number of health workers and health care facilities, mortality rate has decreased compared to that of the early 20th century. This has resulted in pressure on available public health care facilities that offer services to increasing populations. Also social change brought about by population increase leads to cumulative effects of:</p>

                        <h3>Education</h3>
                        <p>Today, many people in Kenya have had basic education. Further, due to easy access to the internet through cyber cafes, more and more Kenyans are becoming better informed about their health and the various treatment alternatives available. As a result, nurses and other health professionals have to strive to keep informed and up to date by achieving higher levels of education in order to meet professional needs and demands for quality care by an informed public.</p>
