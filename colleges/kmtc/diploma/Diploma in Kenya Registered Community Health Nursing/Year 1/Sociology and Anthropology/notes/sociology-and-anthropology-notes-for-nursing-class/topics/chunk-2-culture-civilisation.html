                        <p>The child is born into a society and learns its culture in the process of growing up. For each individual, there is a specific culture that is the social heritage of a particular society at a given time. The sense of time is an example. Africans are culturally and socially conditioned to divide days and years into regularised patterns. Even with many of us now owning watches there are still marked differences between 'African time' and 'European time'. Punctuality has not yet acquired a cultural value for many Africans.</p>

The areas where the medical anthropologists do research are :</p>

                        </ul>
                        <p>Another definition states that medical anthropology is concerned with the biocultural understanding of man and his works in relation to health and medicine. Medical anthropology studies the relationship between human evolution and disease in the past, the biological and cultural determinants of disease, health and health care, the basis and effectiveness of traditional health care systems and suggests ways to integrate modern medicine into traditional societies.</p>
                        <p>Cultural diversity within a society and if boundaries can be drawn around certain groups, they may be referred to as subcultures. The subculture would incorporate sets of beliefs, norms and customs among others.</p>
                        <p>Language is also especially important to culture because it allows human beings to express their symbols and meanings in a way, which can be understood by others. Language must be learned. A child growing up with animals would have no language just as it would have no other culture. It is the main means of passing on the cultural heritage. It allows the development of abstract principles in science and morality, which would be impossible without it.</p>

                     <div class="content-card">
                        <h3>Role</h3>
                        <p>A society can be seen as a system of roles, each of which involves relationships between people, patterns of behaviour and rights and duties associated with a particular position. Everyone has more than one role. For example, you may be a son or a daughter, a student, a friend, a citizen, and so on. You also have other kinship, economic, political, religious and recreational roles.</p>

                        <h3>Values</h3>
                        <p>Values are usually inferred from observed behaviour. If a person regularly associates with certain people, it can be assumed that they value this relationship</p>

                        <h3>Norms</h3>
                        <p>Norms are the standards that govern behaviour in roles. They are societal expectations of what is normal. Sometimes, they have been formalised as law, but most norms are less formal
                        early sociologist, divided norms into folkways, mores and laws or stateways:</p>

                        <h4>Folkways</h4>
                        <p>Folkways are customary practices that are considered appropriate behaviour but are not rigidly enforced. For example, if one builds their house in a somewhat different shape from the others, they may be considered eccentric or an individualist but people will not be particularly bothered by their behaviour.</p>

                        <h4>Mores</h4>
                        <p>Mores are subject to strong sanctions because they are considered much more important to the welfare of the society. For instance, wives should be faithful to their husbands and not commit adultery. Mores also include taboos, for example, certain communities are not allowed to eat certain animals.</p>

                        <h4>Laws or Stateways</h4>
                        <p>Laws on the other hand, may be customary or enacted. When the chiefs or elders hold court to deal with disputes over land or wives, they are enforcing customary law based on tradition and public opinion about norms</p>

                        <h3>INSTITUTION</h3>
                        <p>An institution may be defined as an enduring complex of norms, roles, values and sanctions embracing a distinct segment of human life. When certain patterns of behaviour have become a well-established part of the social structure, it can be said they are institutionalised.</p>
                        <p>The family and kinship institutions are basic to social relations as they give every member of the society a place at birth and are essential for the continuance of the society.</p>

                        <h3>Social Group and Community</h3>
                        <p>Social groups is fundamental to sociology because patterns of interpersonal behaviour are often structured by membership in one or more groups.</p>
                        <p>The word group may refer set of people that the speaker wants to treat as a unit. The role of social groups in forcing institutional change or change in personal behaviour, or the way various social groups together form the building blocks of the society.</p>

                        <h4>Community</h4>
                        <p>Usually implies some idea of locale, frequent social interaction and close ties between members of a group. These ties may be based on kinship, common occupation and so on, as long as they are sufficiently important to provide the members of the community with common interest and goals.</p>
