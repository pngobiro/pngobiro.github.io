\section*{INTRODUCTION TO SOCIOLOGY AND ANTHROPOLOGY}

Sociology is the study of social life, social change, and the social causes and consequences of human behaviour. Sociologists investigate the structure of groups, organisations, and societies, and how people interact within these contexts. Since all human behaviour is social, the subject matter of sociology ranges from the intimate family to the hostile mob; from organised crime to religious cults; from the divisions of race, gender, and social class to the shared beliefs of a common culture; and from the sociology of work to the sociology of sports.

\section*{What is Sociology?}

Sociology is about people. It is about how people interact and why they behave as they do. Whether you look at a family, a business, or a sporting event, you are looking at something that sociology is involved with. No matter what you do in your personal and professional life or where you go, you can use sociology.

Sociological research contributes to our understanding of individuals, groups, organisations, communities and societies. Practising sociologists conduct or assist in problem solving interventions on all of these levels.

Role of Medical Sociology in Public Health: The medical sociology helps to identify and study social groups in their activities of maintaining and preserving health, alleviating or curing diseases.

Medical sociology is concerned with the social facets of health and illness, social function of health institutions and organizations, the relationship of health care delivery to other social systems and social behavior of health personnel and consumers of health care.

The sociology of medicine deals with organization's role, relationships, norms, values and beliefs of medical practice as a form of human behavior. Here, the social processes that occur in a medical setting are studied. Thus, sociology of medicine is research and analysis of medical environment from a sociological perspective.

Thus, in short medical sociology covers the following aspects of public health:
i. Social determinants and distribution of disease
ii. Attitudes and behavior of individuals and also individuals in group settings towards health and illness and this in turn decides their concept of health and illness, health seeking behavior and their level of acceptance towards modern form of medicine, their perceived health needs and their acceptance or rejection of various health programs.
iii. It also studies the social environment of medicine and helps to design the curricula of trainings for health personnel.
iv. It also studies the relationship between health provider and consumer, and thus decides the preference of consumer for a particular type of service as well as compliance of the
consumer to the physician's advice. v. It studies the medical organizations in structural and functional manner.

\section*{Culture and Civilisation}

Definition of culture, social scientists include everything passed down by human society except its biology. This consists of language and technology, laws and customs, beliefs and moral standards.

The child is born into a society and learns its culture in the process of growing up. For each individual, there is a specific culture that is the social heritage of a particular society at a given time. The sense of time is an example. Africans are culturally and socially conditioned to divide days and years into regularised patterns. Even with many of us now owning watches there are still marked differences between 'African time' and 'European time'. Punctuality has not yet acquired a cultural value for many Africans.

\section*{Role of Medical Anthropology in Public Health}

Medical anthropology is the cross cultural study of medical systems and the study of bio-ecological and socio-cultural factors that influence the incidence of health and disease now and throughout human history. The areas where the medical anthropologists do research are :
- human evolution,
- anatomy,
- paediatrics,
- epidemiology,
- mental health,
- drug abuse,
- definition of health and disease,
- training of medical personnel,
- medical bureaucracies,
- hospital organization and operations,
- the doctor patient relationship and
- process of bringing scientific medicine to users of traditional medicine.

Another definition states that medical anthropology is concerned with the biocultural understanding of man and his works in relation to health and medicine. Medical anthropology studies the relationship between human evolution and disease in the past, the biological and cultural determinants of disease, health and health care, the basis and effectiveness of traditional health care systems and suggests ways to integrate modern medicine into traditional societies.

Cultural diversity within a society and if boundaries can be drawn around certain groups, they may be referred to as subcultures. The subculture would incorporate sets of beliefs, norms and customs among others.

Language is also especially important to culture because it allows human beings to express their symbols and meanings in a way, which can be understood by others. Language must be learned. A child growing up with animals would have no language just as it would have no other culture. It is the main means of passing on the cultural heritage. It allows the development of abstract principles in science and morality, which would be impossible without it.

\section*{Role}

A society can be seen as a system of roles, each of which involves relationships between people, patterns of behaviour and rights and duties associated with a particular position. Everyone has more than one role. For example, you may be a son or a daughter, a student, a friend, a citizen, and so on. You also have other kinship, economic, political, religious and recreational roles.

\section*{Values}

Values are usually inferred from observed behaviour. If a person regularly associates with certain people, it can be assumed that they value this relationship

\section*{Norms}

Norms are the standards that govern behaviour in roles. They are societal expectations of what is normal. Sometimes, they have been formalised as law, but most norms are less formal
early sociologist, divided norms into folkways, mores and laws or stateways:

\section*{Folkways}

Folkways are customary practices that are considered appropriate behaviour but are not rigidly enforced. For example, if one builds their house in a somewhat different shape from the others, they may be considered eccentric or an individualist but people will not be particularly bothered by their behaviour.

\section*{Mores}

Mores are subject to strong sanctions because they are considered much more important to the welfare of the society. For instance, wives should be faithful to their husbands and not commit adultery. Mores also include taboos, for example, certain communities are not allowed to eat certain animals.

\section*{Laws or Stateways}

Laws on the other hand, may be customary or enacted. When the chiefs or elders hold court to deal with disputes over land or wives, they are enforcing customary law based on tradition and public opinion about norms

\section*{INSTITUTION}

An institution may be defined as an enduring complex of norms, roles, values and sanctions embracing a distinct segment of human life. When certain patterns of behaviour have become a well-established part of the social structure, it can be said they are institutionalised.

The family and kinship institutions are basic to social relations as they give every member of the society a place at birth and are essential for the continuance of the society.

\section*{Social Group and Community}

Social groups is fundamental to sociology because patterns of interpersonal behaviour are often structured by membership in one or more groups.

The word group may refer set of people that the speaker wants to treat as a unit. The role of social groups in forcing institutional change or change in personal behaviour, or the way various social groups together form the building blocks of the society.

\section*{Community}

Usually implies some idea of locale, frequent social interaction and close ties between members of a group. These ties may be based on kinship, common occupation and so on, as long as they are sufficiently important to provide the members of the community with common interest and goals.

\section*{SOCIALISATION PROCESS}

\section*{The Socialisation Process}

Socialisation refers to the development of the individual from infancy upwards; it is intertwined with the educational system, whether through formal education in schools, through non-formal programmes, or through informal education such as family upbringing.
Human infants are born without any culture. They must be transformed by their parents, teachers, and others into cultural and socially adept animals.
The general process of acquiring culture is referred to as socialisation. During socialisation, we learn the language of the culture we are born into as well as the roles we are to play in life.
Socialisation is important in the process of personality formation.
Successful socialisation can result in uniformity within a society.

\section*{Aims of Socialisation:}
1. To instil discipline (for example, don't walk in front of a moving car).
2. To develop aspirations and ambitions (for example, I want to be a nun, rock star, great sociologist).
3. To develop skills (for example, reading, driving and so on).
4. To enable the acquisition of social roles (for example, male, student and so on).

\section*{Parts of the Socialisation Process}

Having defined the socialisation process you will now identify the parts that make up the socialisation process.

The socialisation process is made up of two parts:
- Primary socialisation
- Secondary socialisation

\section*{Primary Socialisation}

This is the type of socialisation that starts from infancy with parents and other family members who are in close contact with the young one. The mother plays an active role in bonding with her infant. As the child advances in age, they are taught the expected roles according to age and sex. In due course children will learn how to dress, use the toilet facilities, and feed themselves and so on. In the traditional African family, parents and the extended family members were involved in socialising the child.

\section*{Secondary Socialisation}

This takes us outside the home with playmates in the neighbourhood, at school and with other community agents, for example, religious forums. According to Peil (1977), rearing children in an urban area of western Africa is very much the same as in the countryside.

As these children continue their education through primary, secondary and college levels, they come into contact with several social groupings, all of which are in a position to influence their behaviour

During adolescence, the youth often confide in their peers. They no longer feel compelled to express their needs to the parents. When this happens, it is possible for the youth to imitate negative behaviours from their peers, behaviour which is often contrary to their parents' expectations. On the other hand, youths who move to boarding secondary schools may get secondary socialisation from their teachers, who become their new parent figures and role models. The youth of today often develop their own pattern of language for communication, known as sheng in Nairobi, that parents and teachers are unableto communicate in.

\section*{Natural and Planned Socialisation}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline Natural Socialisation & Planned Socialisation \\
\hline Natural socialisation occurs when infants and youngsters explore, play and discover the social world around them. & Planned socialisation occurs when other people take actions designed to teach or train others - from infancy on. \\
\hline Natural socialisation is easily seen when looking at the young of almost any mammalian species (and some birds). & Planned socialisation is mostly a human phenomenon; and all through history, people have been making plans for teaching or training others. \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

Both natural and planned socialisation can have good and bad features: It is wise to learn the best features of both natural and planned socialisation and weave them into our lives.

\section*{Positive Socialisation}

Positive socialisation is the type of social learning that is based on pleasurable and exciting experiences. We tend to like the people who fill our social learning processes with positive motivation, loving care, and rewarding opportunities. Negative socialisation occurs when others use punishment, harsh criticisms or anger to try to 'teach us a lesson'; and often we come to dislike both negative socialisation and the people who impose it on us.

\section*{Mixed Positive and Negative Socialisation}

There are all types of mixes of positive and negative socialisation; and the more positive social learning experiences we have, the happier we tend to be - especially if we learn useful information that helps us cope well with the challenges of life. A high ratio of negative to positive socialisation can make a person unhappy, defeated or pessimistic about life.

\section*{Deliberate Socialisation}

Deliberate socialisation refers to the socialisation process whereby, there is a deliberate and purposeful intent to convey values, attitudes, knowledge, skill and so on.

Examples of deliberate socialisation include
- School situation
- Parents telling a child to always say 'please'

\section*{Unconscious Socialisation}

Unconscious socialisation occurs as a result of spontaneous interaction, with no purposeful or deliberate attempt on the part of anyone involved to train or educate and so on. An example of unconscious socialisation is, for example, when a child learns how to use vulgarity by observing a parent caught up in a frustrating traffic situation. Having covered the various types and classifications of socialisation, you will now cover the agents of socialisation.

\section*{Agents of Socialisation}

The primary agents of socialisation make the deepest impression on the personality of the child because they provide the first training. The other agents must, therefore, compete for attention on the already established framework.

\section*{Family}

The family is made up of parents, children and close relatives. These are the primary agents of socialisation who influence the child's behaviour and attitudes within the society. You will study more on the family in section four on social institutions.

\section*{Social Institutions}

These are explained as social organisations each with a specific function (Akinsola 1983). Examples of social institutions are the

Family
Schools
Religious organisations
Government and hospitals.
Each of these social institutions is organised to offer a service to community members.
When a child enters school they start experiencing secondary socialisation through the teachers, schoolmates and the school environments.

\section*{AGENTS OF SOCIOLIZATION}

\section*{Peers, School Friends and Neighbours}

The peers, schoolmates and neighbours that a child spends most of their waking hours with also become major agents. Children have friends whom they want to be similar to. However, sometimes what their peers tell them may not conform with what the parents are telling them and so they have to make a decision between the two. The decision made depends on the strength of the foundation laid by the parents.

\section*{Electronic and Printed Media}

These include books, magazines, journals, television, radio, computer (internet) and others. A child may begin to emulate what they are seeing on television and may act negatively if they are not able to filter the good and the bad based on earlier teachings. This can have both positive and negative influences on the child or even an adult. Generally, it can be seen that various socialising agents encountered by an individual may support each other by promoting the same goals, or they may provide contradictory advice.

\section*{STRATIFICATION}

\section*{Objectives}
- Define social stratification
- Identify the types of social stratification

\section*{Social Stratification}

The arranging of members of a society into a pattern of superior and inferior ranks, which is perhaps determined by their birth, wealth, power, education, and so on. It can also be said to be the way societies are organised, for example, into clans, castes, chiefdoms, or states within a society.

Systems of social inequity exist in all human societies.

\section*{EXAMPLE OF STRATIFICATION}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_21_5c366d9087c49b361d8ag-13.jpg?height=562&width=781&top_left_y=1248&top_left_x=252)

\section*{Status}

Another way of ranking society members is according to their status. Status can be defined as any position within the stratification system. This definition says nothing about the basis for status in a stratification system. Thus a particular status or position can be high or low on the basis of the property, prestige or power (or all three) associated with that position.

\section*{There are two types of status.}

\section*{Ascribed Status}

This is explained as grouping individuals according to their social position, for example, by virtue of one's age, sex or position of birth (indicates that the holder of this position was born within or inherited a given status in society). Ascribed status is a position based on who you are not what you can do.

A good example of ascribed status can be found in India, where the caste system is practised. Members of the upper caste do not in any way interact with those of the lower caste or the untouchables. Members of the upper caste are usually well educated, while those of the lower caste are poor with limited opportunities and are usually manual workers. These two caste level societies do not intermarry (Joseph 1986). BY BIRTH

\section*{Achieved/Acquired Status}

Achieved status is a position gained on the basis of merit or achievement. This is defined as the position in society earned through the individual's efforts or choice, for example, being a father, mother, nurse or a teacher.

\section*{SOCIAL MOBILITY}

\section*{Objectives}

By the end of this section you will be able to:
- Define social mobility
- Identify the types of social mobility
- Define social mobilisation
- Identify its benefits in the community

\section*{Social Mobility}

The ability to move up or down the social level is referred to as social mobility. The amount of mobility in a society depends on two factors. First, the rules governing how people gain or keep their position may make mobility difficult or easy.

Secondly, whatever the rules, structural changes in society can influence mobility. Social mobility occurs in an open social system while closed systems offer no room for any movement.

\section*{Types of Social Mobility}

There are two types of social mobility:
- Vertical social mobility
- Horizontal social mobility

\section*{Vertical Social Mobility}

The ability of the individual to move up the social ladder, thereby raising their social status and role. It also refers to any upward or downward change in the absolute or relative rank of an individual or group. An example of this would be the nurse, who joins the profession as a community nurse and, by increasing their knowledge through in-service education, acquires the new position of a professor in nursing.

\section*{Horizontal Social Mobility}

This refers to the type of social mobility where the individual maintains the same status. It is also defined as an alteration of position with no significant movement up or down in the system of social stratification, for example a general nurse who trains as a midwife but has no change in salary. This nurse maintains the same status although their role may have changed.

\section*{Certain characteristics can affect the individual's chances of moving up the social ladder.}

\section*{Community Size}

This is where a large community often results in greater economic differences. This is more apparent in larger cities and thus may be more likely to impart incentives to lower level children.

\section*{Number of Siblings}

Number of siblings is where an only child or children having one sibling have the best chance of being upwardly mobile.

\section*{Mother Dominance}

Mother dominance is where the strong mother family seems to be more conducive to upward mobility than the egalitarian or father-dominant family.

\section*{Late Marriage}

Late marriage, as it has been argued that early marriages encourage downward mobility whereas late marriages encourage upward mobility.

\section*{Few Children}

Few children, where upwardly mobile couples tend to have fewer children than immobile couples in the social levels into which they move.

\section*{Other Types of Social Mobility}

There are two other types of social mobility based on different classification systems:

\section*{Structural Mobility}

Structural mobility is social mobility that results from changes in the distribution of statuses in society. Structural mobility occurs regardless of the rules governing status.

\section*{Exchange Mobility}

Mobility that is not structural is called exchange mobility. The word exchange indicates a trade-off. In exchange mobility, some people rise to fill positions made available because other people have fallen in the status system.

Many children of talented and ambitious parents do not inherit the talent or ambition that earned their parents a high rank. Conversely, many children of low status parents are more talented and ambitious than their parents.

\section*{Application}

As nurses you are the main health care providers to various groups of people. Therefore, in line with the nursing code of ethics, you will have to provide health care services to people of whichever status in society. This enables the nurse to provide the basic health care that people deserve.

\section*{What is the difference between a community and a society?}

\section*{Definition of a Society}

A society is defined as a group of people who interact together, within a specified territory and have a unique culture,

\section*{Definition of a Community}

The term 'community' refers to a small group of people who are part of a larger society.

\section*{The Benefits of Social Mobilisation}

The benefits of social mobilisation are listed below, you will look at each in more detail.
- Poverty Alleviation
- Promoting Democratic Governance
- Environment
- Conflict Prevention

\section*{Poverty Alleviation}

Social mobilisation is an important tool in the poverty alleviation process, as it enables communities and the poor themselves to engage actively in solving their own problems and effectively tackling poverty in its multi-dimensional form. The principles of social mobilisation ensure equity, hence issues of gender based, racial and ethnic based discrimination are most likely addressed.

\section*{Promoting Democratic Governance}

Experience shows that poverty and bad governance mutually reinforce each other, as they foster exclusion of citizens from decision making processes, lack of access to basic services, lack of opportunity, dependency, and limit availability of public goods. Social mobilisation must be institutionalised within government for it to be effective. This would encourage participation in decision making, build capacity for participatory planning, build a common vision on development and ensure transparency.

\section*{Environment}

By organising people to better manage their natural resources and fight against practices and organisations that degrade the environment through promoting appropriate legal, regulatory and institutional frameworks and policy dialogue.

\section*{Conflict Prevention}

As people prepare to address common problems, and to collectively improve their socio-
economic conditions in an equitable, democratic and transparent manner, possibility of conflict can be significantly reduced.

\section*{CULTURAL, BELIEFS, PRACTICES, SOCIAL CHANGES AND EFFECTS ON HEALTH}

\section*{Objectives}
- Define culture
- Identify the components of culture
- Describe the elements of culture
- List the characteristics of a culture
- Define cultural beliefs and practices
- Explain selected cultural beliefs and practices that affect health of mankind

\section*{WHAT IS CULTURE?}

Culture is defined as the totality of socially transmitted behaviour patterns, arts, beliefs, institutions, and all other products of human work and thought. Culture is defined as a group of learned values or acquired beliefs that a person copies from other persons with whom they interact. It may also be defined as all that members of a societal group teach one another.

\section*{Components of Culture}

The two components of culture are:
- Non-material culture - these are things that are observed through the behaviour of societal members.
- Material culture - these are the physical things in society.

\section*{Non-material Culture}

There are four various forms of non-material culture, they are listed below.

\section*{Language}

Language refers to the pattern of spoken or written words used by a particular society in order to communicate. The mother tongue refers to the language of one's parents.
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline Cultural group & Language \\
\hline \hline Maasai & Masai \\
\hline \hline Agikuyu & Kikuyu \\
\hline Luo & Dholuo \\
\hline \hline Giriama & Giriama \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\section*{Mores}

Mores are explained as social norms, which emphasise the expected moral behaviour for societal members. If an individual breaks the mores, the individual receives severe punishments. Some examples of mores are: do not lie, do not steal or destroy other's property and so on. All society members are expected to obey the mores or else they receive punishment.

\section*{Norms}

Norms are defined as socially accepted patterns of behaviour. You should note that norms differ from society to society. They may include children respecting parents and older people in society, as demonstrated by a young person offering an older person a seat in a bus and so on.

\section*{Laws}

Laws are written, socially confirmed rules and regulations of conduct, which if violated,
are punishable. Laws are enforced by a socially identified agency. For an example of medically related laws, refer to module four, unit one, section two on the mental health act.

\section*{Material Culture}
material culture is defined as the part of culture that includes physical things in any society. Examples of material culture include the type of clothing used, ornaments such as necklaces, bangles, and earrings, kitchenware, type of houses and many more. Akinsola also explains that the importance of identifying material culture relates to how these items are used by individuals in the society. For example, among the Agikuyu people, women and girls learnt to use pots for cooking and gourds for serving food and storing liquids such as milk.

In modern days, nurses are expected to learn how to use computers, new types of blood pressure machines, digital thermometers and others in order to improve the health care they provide. In addition, they are expected to provide nursing care to persons of varying cultural ethnic background. For further details refer to the module one, unit one on professionalism.

\section*{Elements of Culture}

The elements of culture include:
- Material life
- Language
- Social interactions
- Religion
- Education
- Values

\section*{What are the main characteristics of culture?}

The main characteristics of culture are that:
- It is learned
- It is shared
- It is an adaptation
- It is a dynamic system changing constantly

\section*{Cultural Beliefs}

A cultural belief is a personal conviction and disposition to retain and abandon actions taking into account values of one's own culture. Cultural beliefs may pertain to child rearing or housing

Certain disease specific and It has even been noted that health services may be underutilised and health and child care instructions may be ineffective or ignored in traditional and transitional societies where people's ideas and behavioural patterns conflict with the knowledge being passed to them

\section*{SOME CULTURAL BELIEFS}

\section*{Food Taboos}

Outbreaks of malnutrition among children in this country may not only be associated with lack of food but also with culture patterns affecting food. For example, in some parts of Kenya, children and women are not given eggs in the belief that the child will learn to be a thief when grown up or that a mother feeding on eggs may harm her unborn baby. Instead, the eggs are reserved for the men to eat or to be sold at the market.

\section*{Overcrowding}

When several family members live in congested homes with a low standard of hygiene, this may contribute to poor health. This mainly occurs in urban centres, where a family may rent one room, which serves as the kitchen, bedroom and dining room.

There may be communal water but often there is none, and in such cases the family has to buy water or fetch it from a stream. Under such living conditions children suffer from diarrhoea, intestinal worms and sometimes malnutrition.

Due to the increased expenses associated with hospital care, parents may decide to take their child to traditional medicine men.

\section*{An Example of the Effects of Cultural Beliefs on the Diet of the Somalis}
- Camel milk is believed to be the best of all milks.
- Eating chicken injected with hormones is believed to be bad for the human heart and to contribute toward being fat.
- Breastfeeding women believe that tea increases milk production and therefore they increase their consumption of tea, which is usually very much sweetened with sugar. Women in the educated groups have reported not liking the idea of pumping breast milk, for fear of disfigurement.

\section*{Effects of Cultural Beliefs on the Diet}

\section*{Breastfeeding}

It is culturally important for Somali mothers to breastfeed their babies. Not doing so is seen as a sign of poor mothering. Somali children are breastfed until they are two years old, or until the mother becomes pregnant again

\section*{Bottle Feeding}

In both urban and rural areas, when babies are one year old, most drink from a glass or cup without their parent's help. Bottles are difficult to keep clean and are not usually used.

\section*{Teething}

Somalis associate teething with diarrhoea, fever, nausea, and vomiting. Children usually begin teething when they are between nine months and one year old, although it can
occur as early as four months. Those who get their teeth earlier are thought to have more difficulties. A soothing oil is sometimes placed on the gums to calm teething children, but pacifiers are not used.

\section*{SOCIAL CHANGE}

\section*{Objectives}
- Define the term social change
- Explain the theories of social change
- Describe the three types of social change
- Explain the process of social change
- Explain the steps in social change
- Describe how social changes affect people's health

\section*{Social Change}

\section*{What is Social Change?}

Social change is the transformation of culture and social institutions over time. All societies experience change in their social structure and culture over time, explanations of the causes and nature of this change have been part of the sociologist's task from the beginning of this discipline. Societies change because they are in contact with other societies. As a result the ideas, norms and institutions spread from one society to another.

\section*{Theories of Change}

\section*{Evolution and Differentiation}

Early sociologists were concerned chiefly with the origins of society and the transformations necessary to reach the type of society that people are now experiencing. Since Darwin's ideas of biological evolution were gaining acceptance at this time, the theory of societal evolution also became popular. Theories of structural differentiation take humankind somewhat further than the evolutionism from which they are derived. The basic idea is that as societies develop, they become characterised by increased separation and specialisation.

\section*{Equilibrium and Conflict}

The equilibrium and conflict theory maintains that the basic function of any society is to maintain equilibrium (stability, order) and eliminate conflicts that may arise in the process of change. Conflict may arise mainly during the process of adjustment to forced change, when consensus is imperfect or among people who were inadequately socialised so that they do not fully share the consensus of the majority. The equilibrium theory is better for explaining gradual, long-term change such as the Industrial Revolution and changes applying to the society as a whole, than in accounting for the more sudden political revolution and smaller endogenous changes where conflict often plays an obvious part.

\section*{Modernisation}

The modernisation theory assumes that change is synonymous with improvement of social conditions, for the benefit of societies. Modernisation is the process by which agricultural societies were transformed into industrial societies. Modernisation theorists tend to see only the front end of the process of social change (what the modern society should look like) and ignore the traditional end of the process. Nevertheless, some attention must be given to modernisation theories because they are so prevalent and because they alert us to ways of examining long-term change.

\section*{Types of Social Change}

You have already studied what social change is, that is, an alteration of what makes the society and its relationships. There are three ways in which society changes and you will now cover each of these in detail.

\section*{Evolution}

The term evolution refers to slow or gradual change, which occurs with very low human effort, with almost unnoticeable changes in social structure. Examples are language, marriage patterns, child rearing practices and so on.

\section*{Revolution}

This term refers to a rapid and deliberate change, which can radically change a society's way of doing things. Revolutions are planned for a specific purpose and are initiated by direct human action. For example, the Russian revolution and in East Africa, the Ugandan revolution that brought a new political system under President Idi Amin.

\section*{Reform}

This term refers to a deliberate effort by humans to alter the society's way of doing things. Reforms apply lesser force than revolutions and their effects are much more extensive than revolution. An example is the changes that occurred when Kenya's educational system switched from the 7-4-2 to the 8-4-4 system of education.

\section*{How Does Social Change Occur?}

Social change takes place when people choose to modify their environment. The changes occur mainly when existing cultural patterns are altered either due to innovations or when new ideas are introduced into the society.

Another change, involves technological advances. For example, a few years ago, people were using the landline telephone to pass messages. Today landlines are being gradually replaced by mobile phones. The mobile phone is convenient because one can communicate wherever they are. In health care facilities, it is now possible to quickly reach a health care provider, for example, the consultant to attend to a very sick patient, which decreases the chances of mortality.

These are just a few examples of social changes that have occurred in our country in the last few decades.

\section*{Process of Change}

There are two processes under which social change occurs. These are diffusion and innovation. You will cover each of these individually.

\section*{Diffusion}

Diffusion is defined as a process of change involving the selection and adoption of cultural items from another society. The diffusion of culture can be a one-way or a twoway process. For example in Kenya, people have accepted the western way of dress while some of them have adopted our way of dressing such as the Maasai 'shukas' and the Waswahili 'kikois'.

\section*{Innovation}

Innovation is the second type of change process and is defined as the process of introducing new items to the society. The innovations come in two forms, known as inventions and discoveries.

\section*{Inventions}

Inventions refer to existing culture items, which are recombined to form a new item that did not exist before, for example vaccines, intravenous drugs, mobile phones and so on.

When the society accepts these inventions, they affect change. For example, the invention of vaccines against childhood diseases has led to a reduction in infections and better health of the children.

\section*{Discovery}

A discovery involves finding things that already exist, for example, archaeological findings such as cooking wares and implements, which are then preserved in museums. You will now cover the basic steps of implementing change in our health set up.

\section*{The Seven Steps of Social Change (The Seven Doors)}

This model helps to identify which elements are already being fulfilled so resources can be concentrated on the gaps. The seven elements are listed across the top of each door; knowledge, desire, skills, optimism, facilitation, stimulation and reinforcement.

\section*{Knowledge/Awareness}

An obvious first step is that people must:
- Know there is a problem.
- Know there is a practical, viable solution or alternative. This is important. People are practical and they will always demand clear, simple, feasible road maps before they start a journey to a strange place.
- Identify the personal costs of inaction and the benefits of action in concrete terms that people can relate to, that is, allow them to 'own' the problem.

\section*{Desire}

Change involves imagination. People need to be able to visualise a different, desirable future for themselves. Desire is an emotion, not a kind of knowledge

\section*{Skills}

Skills allow you to easily visualise the steps required to reach the goal. People often learn skills best by seeing someone else perform them. The best way to do this is to break the actions down into simple steps and use illustrations to make visualisation easy.

\section*{Optimism (or Confidence)}

This is the belief that success is probable or inevitable. Strong political or community leadership is probably an important ingredient of optimism.

\section*{Facilitation}

People are busy with limited resources and few choices. They may need outside support in the form of accessible services, infrastructure and support networks that overcome practical obstacles to carrying out the action.

\section*{Stimulation}

An inspiration to do something has many times happened in a collective context. This is a kind of inspirational mass conversion, which is based on our human social instincts,
like the mass meeting where a personal commitment is made. You need to instil this in your team members. The stimulation could be an imminent threat (like a cost increase), a special offer or competition (based on self-interest), or, better still, some communally shared event, which galvanises action (for example, a public meeting or a festival).

\section*{Feedback and Reinforcement}

It is always important to get feedback at the end of the day and know whether the change was approved or not and gain perceptions and views on the area of that change.

\section*{SOCIAL CHANGES AFFECTING HEALTH}

Social change influences health in a complex way. Health status is changing with the development of societies, but it is not invariably for the better.

\section*{Industrialisation}

Social change caused by industrialisation leads to mismanagement of natural resources, excessive waste production and associated environmental conditions that affect health. Environmental quality is an important direct and indirect determinant of human health. Poor environmental quality is directly responsible for around $25 \%$ of all preventable illhealth in the world today, with diarrhoeal diseases and acute respiratory infections heading the list. Other diseases such as malaria, schistosomiasis, other vector-borne diseases, chronic respiratory diseases and childhood infections are also strongly influenced by adverse environmental conditions.

Lack of basic sanitation, poor water supply and poor food safety contribute greatly to diarrhoeal disease mortality and morbidity. In addition, the incidence, severity and distribution of vector-borne diseases are affected substantially by human activities such as water and agricultural developments and by urbanisation.

\section*{Population}

Due to innovations in the provision of health care such as vaccines, availability of drugs, increase in the number of health workers and health care facilities, mortality rate has decreased compared to that of the early 20th century. This has resulted in pressure on available public health care facilities that offer services to increasing populations. Also social change brought about by population increase leads to cumulative effects of:
- Inadequate and hazardous shelter
- Overcrowding
- Lack of water supply and sanitation
- Unsafe food
- Air and water pollution
- High accident rates

All of these factors impact heavily on the health of a society.

\section*{Education}

Today, many people in Kenya have had basic education. Further, due to easy access to the internet through cyber cafes, more and more Kenyans are becoming better informed about their health and the various treatment alternatives available. As a result, nurses and other health professionals have to strive to keep informed and up to date by achieving higher levels of education in order to meet professional needs and demands for quality care by an informed public.

\section*{SOCIAL INSTITUTIONS}

\section*{Introduction}

Social institutions are organs, which perform some of the functions that benefit society, Objectives

By the end of this section you will be able to:
- Define a social institution
- Describe a family institution
- Describe the educational institution
- Describe the religious institution
- Describe the political institution
- Describe the health care institution

\section*{What is an Institution?}

Institutions are organisations, or mechanisms of social structure, governing the behaviour of two or more individuals. Institutions are identified with a social purpose and permanence, transcending individual human lives and intentions, with the making and enforcing of rules governing human behaviour. As structures and mechanisms of social order among humans, institutions are one of the principal objects of study in the social sciences, including sociology, political science and economics. Institutions are a central concern for law, the formal regime for political rule making and enforcement.

\section*{The Family}

The definition of the family, which is the basic unit of social structure, can vary greatly from time to time and from culture to culture. How a society defines family and the functions it asks families to perform, are by no means constant.

The primary functions of the family
- Are reproductive,
- Economic
- social and educational

Some family institutions include gender, marriage, parenthood and kinship. All these institutions are basic to society because they provide and protect new members, and without them the society would disappear..

\section*{Kinship Relationship}

This consists of parents and children.
Kinship implies ties of blood (biological kinship), descent (jural or legal kinship) and marriage (affiliation). People descended from a common ancestor are referred to as cognatic kin or cognates; those who become kin through marriage are affinal kins or

\section*{Extended Family}

This is the type of family that consists of several generations of relatives all living together or near each other. The relationship is based on birth or marriage, for example, auntie, in-laws, grandparents and so on.

\section*{Institutions}

\section*{Functions of the Family}

\section*{1. Control of Sexual Behaviour}

When a man and a woman marry, they are expected to have a sexual relationship with each other. It is only in marriage that sexual behaviour should be practised. It is within the marital setting that sex is legitimised. This functions to control illegitimate sex and indecencies such as incest, child abuse, rape, and risk of contracting Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs) like syphilis and gonorrhea and HIV/AIDS.

\section*{2.Nurturing Children}

Couples are expected to have children and nurture them. Primary socialisation also takes place within the family. If mothers have jobs outside the house, house helps and other family members (such as grandparents and older siblings) are engaged to continue with this function of nurturing the child while the mother is away.

\section*{3.Protection}

The family should provide basic needs to its members, for example, food, shelter, clothing and health care.

\section*{4.Education}

Even today, children are taught at home, for example, social skills such as table manners, washing hands after visiting the toilet and before eating and so on. Parents are expected to continue showing an interest in their child's learning throughout school life.

\section*{5.Legal Function}

The parents give a child the birth right as confirmed by the provision of a birth certificate by the government officials. They also have other rights that they should give to the child such as the right to an education, the right to basic needs such as clothing, food and shelter among others.

\section*{6.Spiritual Function}

The family instils sense of religious beliefs and thoughts in their children. This could be the traditional African religious belief or the modern belief in one God worshipped in churches, mosques or synagogues.

\section*{Educational Institutions}

There are two aspects of education: formal and informal.
- Formal education is acquired through formally established institutions of learning. Learning takes place within these while following the laid down curricula of education.
- Informal education takes place in informal places, for example, the work place, recreational place, among peer groups, in the church or other religious settings. Informal education also takes place during political rallies, voting and wedding ceremonies.

\section*{What are the Functions of Education?}

\section*{1.Secondary Socialisation}

One of the functions of school is to offer secondary socialisation to children. As various teachers tutor them, children not only gain knowledge but also assimilate the values instilled to them by their teachers.

\section*{2.Custodial Functions}

Schools take charge of children as learning takes place. This provides parents with freedom to work without distraction. While at school, children are protected from playing dangerous games, for example, playing along the road, throwing stones at each other and so on.

\section*{3.Cultural Transmission}

The communication of received beliefs and understandings is a major function of formal education. Education is especially relied on in societies that are culturally self-conscious. Awareness of a cultural heritage is usually associated with concern that traditional values and cultural 'mysteries' will be lost if no one has special knowledge of them. While cultural transmission tends to emphasise respect for tradition, values of criticism and inquiry may be passed on as well as conservative values.

\section*{4. Social Integration}

Formal education is a major agency for transforming a heterogeneous and potentially divided community into one bound together by a common language and a sense of common identity

\section*{5. Innovation}

To some degree, even the most tradition-bound educational institution is a source of innovation because the teacher is called on to apply their wisdom or expertise to new situations.

Early innovations were often accidental and unanticipated, perhaps the result of religious rather than practical intent.

\section*{5.Selection and Allocation}

In traditional society, when only a few select members of the community were educated, the school played a smaller role to that of family membership in determining the student's ultimate role and status. However, under the conditions of mass
education, the school system takes over the job of screening and allocating status. How the individual performs in school and the course of study they choose often determines their future occupation, income and prestige

\section*{6.Personal Development}

Formal education communicates skills and perspectives that cannot readily be gained through other socialising experiences. The school is also often a place of transition from a highly personal to a more impersonal world and habits such as punctuality may be learned here.

\section*{Religious Institutions}
`a unified system of beliefs and practices relative to sacred things, that is to say, things set apart and forbidden - beliefs and practices which unite into one single moral co

\section*{What are the Foundations of Religion?}

Religion has its foundations in the nature of human personality as well as in the requirements of social solidarity. They are:
- Overcoming fear and anxiety to the extent that our world is dangerous and unpredictable, people must endure and try to overcome specific fears and more general anxiety and hence the need for religion.
- Self-justification and the quest for ultimate meaning. We seek an organising principle that will validate our most important strivings and make sense of our sufferings.
- The search for transcendence. Most human experiences are routine and do not evoke strong emotions or strange feelings but there are circumstances that lift us out of ourselves and in which we seem to transcend our everyday self which some religions do through dance.
- Celebration of human powers and achievements. Many religious beliefs and activities reflect pride and exultation rather than humility and despair.
- Making the world comprehensible. In all societies, some effort is made to explain and interpret our environment and religion tries to do this too.
- Supporting social norms and values. By adding divine sanction to human values, religion buttresses the norms of society and unites its adherents into a moral community, whose members feel a deep common bond because they share a belief
in what is normally true.

\section*{Functions of Religious Institutions}

\section*{1.Unity of Group Members}

This happens when members have a common creative belief. For example, in traditional religion, all community members would take part in a religious ceremony.

\section*{2. Humanitarian}

Religious organisations usually provide emergency care during disasters, like floods, earthquakes, fires and wars..

\section*{3. Reduction of Stress}

Religion provides explanation for things inconceivable by the human mind, such as why people die, or what happens after death. This explanatory function serves to alleviate anxiety. Religion also helps members cope with anxiety due to togetherness among most of its members.

\section*{4. Political Institutions}

The control system of the family was weakened gradually. This led to the formation of political institutions such as governments in order to create and enforce laws so as to maintain functions. The government rules its people through various styles of leadership.

The three styles of leadership are:

\section*{Autocratic (Authoritarian)}

This type of leader controls all the power to make and enforce laws and they assume all responsibility for the actions. This method is used when the leader tells their employees what they want done and how they want it done, without allowing them to participate in the decision making process. They elect themselves into a leadership position

\section*{Democratic (Participative)}

This style involves the leader, including one or more employees in the decision making process (determining what to do and how to do it). However, the leader is the final decision making authority.

\section*{Laissez-faire (Delegative, Free-reign)}

In this style, the leader allows the employees to make the decision. However, the leader is still responsible for the decisions that are made. This is used when employees are able to analyse the situation and determine what needs to be done and how to do it.

\section*{Functions of Government}

\section*{1.Maintenance of Social Order}

The government has the responsibility of keeping social order. In order to fulfil this function, the government enacts laws, which it enforces. It also identifies law enforcement agents who ensure that citizens abide by the laws.

\section*{2.Coordination of Essential Services}

Similar to a family unit, the government has to coordinate various activities useful for the effective functioning of the society. To meet this need, the government establishes ministries, each of which has specific activities it is responsible for. In Kenya, nursing
services are under the Ministry of Health while education is under the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology.

\section*{3.Protection of all Citizens}

In order to fulfil the function of maintaining security, armed forces are developed to meet these needs.

You have covered some of the leadership styles and functions of the government. On a micro-level, it is important to understand the functions of the local government. These include:
- Providing democratic and accountable government for local communities
- Ensuring the provision of services to communities in a sustainable manner
- Promoting social and economic development
- Promoting a safe and healthy environment
- Encouraging the involvement of communities and community organisations in the matters of local government

\section*{Health Care Institutions}

\section*{Traditional Medicine}

Many African societies had traditional healers, whose indigenous knowledge of folk medicine was respected. They used herbs and some practised magic and divination as they strived to meet the health needs of their clients. Today, fewer people subscribe to services of traditional healers. They mainly provide emotional and social treatment for illness such as mental illness, bereavements and disasters.

\section*{Private Health Facilities}

These are health facilities owned and/or run by religious and private organisations. They are popular in areas without government health facilities.

\section*{Public Health Facilities}

These are government-run health facilities and are present in most parts of the country. In Kenya, health facilities are classified according to their structure (mainly size and catchment population) and by extension, their functions. The facilities range from national hospital, provincial general hospital, district hospital, sub-district hospital, health centre to dispensary. The largest hospital in Kenya is the Kenyatta National Hospital. It serves as a teaching, research and national referral hospital. Many nurses, doctors, pharmacists, laboratory technologists and other health professionals have trained here.

\section*{CONFLICT RESOLUTION AND NEGOTIATION PROCESS}

\section*{Objectives}

By the end of this section you will be able to:
- Define conflict
- Identify factors that may contribute to conflicts
- Explain the steps used in conflict resolution
- Describe the negotiation process

\section*{CONFLICT}

Conflict is a person's struggle with him/herself, another person, or a thing. It is a problem or disagreement and results in a situation that needs resolution. Conflict is present in every person's life.

\section*{What is Conflict Resolution?}

Conflict resolution is the process of finding a way to manage or solve a problem. There are several methods of conflict resolution. Some result in win-lose solutions, while others can be win-win. Through programs like peer mediation, children learn to go for the win-win solution!

\section*{Situations That May Lead to Conflict}

Factors that may contribute to conflict are varied. Here are some examples of the situations where conflict may arise:
- During the process of adjustment to forced change
- When various groups are not in agreement
- When some societal groups feel left out when new agreements are being implemented

\section*{Conflict Resolution Styles}

There are many different ways of resolving conflict. The three most common ways are fight, flight and flow.

\section*{Fight}

In a fight, two or more people are aggressive with one another. Fighting can be done with words, weapons or fists. Following a battle of some description there will be a winner and a loser, or both may lose.

\section*{Flight}

In a flight situation, one party walks away from the conflict. The problem is left unresolved and there may be a winner and a loser. Common 'flight' language includes 'never mind', 'just forget it' and 'whatever'.

\section*{Flow}

In a flow situation both people walk away from the conflict satisfied with the solution which they have reached together. Conflict resolution encourages everyone to 'go with the flow' and create solutions!

\section*{Skills to Resolve Conflict Peacefully}

The first thing you need is a willingness to work toward a win-win solution.

Then there are several helpful skills to guide you through the process:
- Be an active listener
- Look and listen for the other person's feelings
- Look for anger cues and triggers
- Maintain good eye contact
- Use a calm voice
- Make sure you have 'cooled down' before trying to work things out

\section*{Resolving Conflicts at a Government Level}

There are several ways of resolving conflicts at the government level. You will look at each of these in detail.

\section*{Appointing a Commission}

A commission is a group of people, usually professionals in a certain field who are selected to look into a problem more keenly, so as to come up with a solution. One example is if the prices of basic items continue rising, the government may establish a commission to look into the effect of this increase on workers' wages. The commission/committee is given the mandate to suggest ways to improve the workers'
wages, actual remuneration, perhaps to suggest possible sources of funding and ways of handling future government/workers conflict.

\section*{Elections to Change the Leaders}

On some occasions due to strained relationships between the current government and populace, an election may be called. In this case the population may elect a new government with new political leaders of their choice. When this happens, the masses feel that they have picked their choice of leaders, thereby averting conflict.

\section*{Meeting with Concerned Persons}

At times in the work place, conflict may arise between the in-charge persons and other staff members. One of the ways to avert this misunderstanding is to call a meeting where all stakeholders are invited. This provides for an opportunity to speak out, discuss and agree on solutions to be effected by all. Mediators may also be chosen to represent one of the parties. In this way, harmony in the work place is restored.

\section*{The Negotiation Process}

The process of negotiation consists of three important phases.

\section*{The Information Phase}

During this phase, you should collect and evaluate information on all factors that will have an effect on the negotiation. Work out a defensive plan to protect sensitive information that the opposition is likely to inquire about. Decide whether the negotiations will be carried out by yourself or an agent.

\section*{The Competitive Phase}

The bargaining begins during this phase. You should decide who should go first on particular issues. Support your position on an appropriate rationale and actively manage the concession process.

\section*{The Cooperative Phase}

It is important to understand that, ultimately, cooperation is a worthy and necessary stage in the negotiation process. While acknowledging that negotiations are inherently competitive, it helps to remember the following:
- Be cooperative.
- Do not use threats.
- Assess the value of your position accurately.
- Be willing to share information.
- Approach negotiations in an objective, fair, trustworthy manner.
- Seek agreement in the open exchange of information.
- Get a settlement that is fair to both sides.
