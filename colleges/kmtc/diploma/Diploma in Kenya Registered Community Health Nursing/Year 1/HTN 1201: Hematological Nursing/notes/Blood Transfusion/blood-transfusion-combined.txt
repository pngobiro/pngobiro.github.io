\section*{INTRODUCTION}
$\square$ Blood transfusion is the process of transferring blood or blood based products from one individual into the circulation system of another person.
-This is referred to as homologous transfusion.
- In autologous transfusion the donor and recipient is the same person.
$\square$ Earlier transfusions used whole blood but current practice uses only deficient blood components separately (component therapy).
$\square$ The history of practice of blood transfusion can be traced as way back as $15^{\text {th }}$ century.
$\square$ It has evolved through a lot of controversies and sometimes ridiculous experiences into a specialized medical science of today; eg.
- Giving blood orally.
- Transfusion of animal blood to human.
-Transfusion of milk.
- Direct transfusion from donor's vein to recipient's vein, etc).

\section*{INTRODUCTION}

Some of the landmarks in the development of modern transfusion science include:
- Description of blood circulatory system by Harvey in $17^{\text {th }}$ century.
- Discovery of ABO blood groups in 1901
- Discovery of anticoagulants in 1910s (sodium citrate) and refrigeration to prolong blood storage.
- Soviet Union set up first national blood bank in 1930s.
- Discovery of Rhesus group system in 1940 as major cause of transfusion reactions.
- ...Some of the landmarks...
- Discovery of Acid-Citrate-Dextrose (ACD) solution in 1940s to help reduce amount of anticoagulant needed to preserve blood.
- Introduction of plastic bags to replace glass bottles in 1950.
${ }^{-}$Adoption of WHO policy of voluntary blood donation in 1975.
- Introduction of CPDA-1 anticoagulant in 1979 to increase shelf life to 35 days.
- Emergence of HIV in 1980s brought up new challenges in management of blood transfusion services.

\section*{KENYAN BLOOD TRANSFUSION POLICY}
$\square$ Kenya is a signatory to World Health Assembly Resolution (WHA 28.72) of 1975 and Regional Commonwealth Ministers of Health Resolution of 1989 which requires:
-Each member state to develop a comprehensive, well coordinated blood transfusion service, based on voluntary, non-remunerated blood donation.
-Each member state to make provision for safe blood to the people a national priority.

\section*{...KENYAN BLOOD TRANSFUSION POLICY}
$\square$ In different countries the mandate to coordinate national blood transfusion services are entrusted to specific organizations, eg. Red Cross, Red Crescent, AABB , etc.
${ }^{\square}$ In Kenya this mandate has been given to National Blood Transfusion Services (NBTS):
- It is a unit under National Public Health Laboratories Services (NPHLS).

\section*{KENYAN BLOOD TRANSFUSION POLICY}

The GOAL of NBTS is to provide safe blood whenever it is needed, through creating a strong, efficient, and self sustaining national blood transfusion service capable of meeting all the needs of the country.

\section*{KENYAN BLOOD TRANSFUSION POLICY}

NBTS is managing the blood transfusion program through:
- National Blood Transfusion Centre (NBTC), located in Nairobi.
- Regional Blood Transfusion Centres (RBTC), located in Mombasa, Embu, Nyeri, Nakuru, Eldoret and Kisumu.
- Satellite Centres-Naivasha, Eldama-Ravine, Kericho, Kisii, etc.
- Primary Hospital Blood Banks-though being discouraged/phased out.
${ }^{\square}$ The STRATEGY of NBTS to fulfill its mandate include the following:
- Proper organizational structures of the blood transfusion services.
- Recruitment of safe blood donors.
- Screening of units of blood for Transfusion Transmissible Infections (TTIs).
- Ensuring appropriate clinical use of blood and blood products;
- eg. issue transfusion guidelines.

\section*{BLOOD DONOR RECRUITMENT}
$\square$ The following are the different types of blood donors (sources):
- Family / replacement donors - donate blood for a specific/ known recipient.
- Voluntary / unpaid donors-donate blood to be given to whoever needs it.
- Commercial / paid donors-donate blood in exchange for money or favours.
- Autologous donors-donate blood for his / her anticipated use / need.

\section*{...BLOOD DONOR RECRUITMENT}

Criteria for qualification as a blood donor are:
$\square$ Healthy individual: normal BP and Pulse, not on medications, no history of exposure to TTIs.
- Age: 16 to 65 years.
$\square$ Weight: 50 kg and above (45-50 kg may be allowed in exceptional circumstances).
$\square$ Haemoglobin level: $12.5 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dl}$ and above (for Autologous $10 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dl}$ and above).
$\square$ Donated blood last not less than 3 months ago (in special circumstances 2 months interval may be allowed).
$\square$ Willing to declare his/her health status both present and past.

\section*{...BLOOD DONOR RECRUITMENT}

Safe Donor: That person who knows that she/he is at a low risk of TTIs and is willing to give blood voluntarily on a regular basis.

\section*{Advantages:}
- Are not under pressure to give blood therefore are more likely to meet the national criteria for low risk donors.
- Are willing to donate blood on a regular basis which is important in maintaining adequate supply of blood.
- Are at low risk of TTIs because they have been educated about the importance of safe blood and are screened each time they attend to give blood.
- Are more likely to respond to an appeal for blood donation during an emergency because they have already expressed commitment to voluntary blood donation.

\section*{BLOOD COLLECTION, PROCESSING AND STORAGE}

Methods of blood donations are:
$\square$ Whole blood donation (commonest):
- All blood components are collected together.
$\square$ Apheresis donation:
Only required component(s) is/are donated /collected.
- Uncommon and requires expensive equipment.

\section*{BLOOD COLLECTION}
$\square$ Donor is screened to ensure normal criteria set for low risk donors is met:
- verbal interview.
through questionnaire.
$\square$ After disinfecting the skin:
- wide bore needle (G.18) is inserted into a forearm vein.
- blood is collected by gravity through the connecting tubing into a plastic bag containing anticoagulant.

\section*{BLOOD COLLECTION}
$\square$ Commonly used anticoagulant:
- CPDA-1 (Citrate Phosphate Dextrose with Adenine).
- Previously it was ACD and CPD (Acid Citrate Dextrose \& Citrate Phosphate Dextrose).
$\checkmark$ CPDA-1 preserves blood for 35 days while ACD and CPD do it for 21 days.
${ }^{\square}$ When SAGM (Sodium Adenine Glucose Mannitol) solution is added to CPDA-1 blood can be preserved for up to 42 days.

\section*{...BLOOD COLLECTION}

Actions of ingredients of anticoagulant solutions:
$\square$ Citrate:- Prevents coagulation by chelating calcium.
$\square$ Dextrose :- Supports ATP generation by glycolytic pathway.
$\square$ Sodium di-phosphate :- Prevents fall in pH .
$\square$ Adenine :- Synthesizes ATP, increases level of ATP, and extends the shelf life of red blood cells to 35 days.

\section*{...BLOOD COLLECTION}
$\square$ Each donation is 450 mls to 500 mls .
- Half filled bags are normally discarded.
The donated blood is immediately placed in a transport box which is maintained at a temperature of +20 to +24 degrees Celsius for not more than 6 to12 hours.

\section*{BLOOD PROCESSING}

Testing /laboratory screening for TTI:
${ }^{-}$HIV (1 \&2)
$\square$ Hepatitis B virus (HBV)
$\square$ Hepatitis C virus (HCV)
$\square$ VDRL for Treponema pallidum (Syphilis)
$\square$ Others : Malaria, Chaga's disease (T. cruzi), Leishmaniasis, CMV (Cytomegalovirus)
Blood Grouping:
- ABO
$\square$ Rhesus

\section*{...BLOOD PROCESSING}

Separation of Whole Blood (Hct 40\%) into blood components:
$\square$ Packed Red Blood Cells (PRBC) :-
- 250 mls adult packs (Hct 70\%).
- 125 mls paediatric packs (Hct 70\%).
$\square$ Platelets :- 50 mls packs.
$\square$ Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFP) :-
- 220 mls; contains all coagulation factors.
$\square$ Cryoprecipitate :-
- 15mls; has fibrinogen, factor VIII, XIII and von Willebrand.

\section*{BLOOD STORAGE}

Whole blood and blood components are required to be maintained at specific temperatures (cold chain) for them to be useful when transfused.
$\square$ Whole blood :-
Stored at +2 to +8 deg. C :-
*Up to 21 days in ACD or CPD.
*Up to 35 days in CPDA-1.
*Up to 42 days when SAGM is added to CPDA-1.

\section*{BLOOD STORAGE}
$\checkmark$ Packed Red Blood Cell :-
${ }^{-}+2$ to +8 deg. $C$ and duration as for whole blood.
$\square$ Plasma :-
${ }^{>}+2$ to +8 deg. $C$ for up to 5 days.
minus-18 deg. C or below for up to 5 years.
$\square$ Fresh Frozen Plasma :-
minus-18 deg. C or below for up to 1 year.
$\square$ Platelets Concentrate :-
- Room Temp. with agitation for up to 5 days.
${ }^{\square}$ Cryoprecipitate :- minus-18 deg. C for up to 1 year.

\section*{AUTOLOGOUS BLOOD DONATION}

Donation can be done as whole blood or by apheresis in one of the following ways:
$\square$ Pre-operative:
- Blood is drawn before a planned surgery and stored until needed.
$\square$ Intra-operative haemodilution:
- Blood is collected at the start of surgery and then infused during or at the end of the procedure.
- Blood salvage:
- Blood is salvaged from the surgical field and infused during or after the surgical procedure.

\section*{...AUTOLOGOUS BLOOD DONATION}

Advantages Autologous blood donation:
$\square$ Prevents transmission of TTIs.
$\square$ Prevents blood transfusion reactions.
- Provide reassurance to donor-recipient.
$\square$ To stockpile rare blood groups.
Disadvantages of Autologous blood donation:
- Adverse reaction to donation.
$\square$ Unnecessary loss of blood units if operation is postponed or transfusion is not needed.
${ }^{\square}$ Increased work load to blood bank: ie needs special labeling and storage facilities.

\section*{THE FUTURE}

Due to increased demand for blood which outstrips the supply:
$\square$ Blood Substitutes (artificial blood or blood surrogates) are being developed.
- Being used to fill fluid volume and/or carry oxygen and other blood gases in the cardiovascular system.
- The preferred and more accurate terms are :-
- Volume expanders for inert products.
- Oxygen therapeutics for oxygen carrying products

\section*{THE FUTURE}

Volume expanders: -
$\square$ Inert and merely increase blood volume.
- Crystalloids: eg. Ringer's lactate, normal saline, D5W
- Colloids:-eg. Haemacel, Dextran, Voluven, Gelofusin.

Oxygen therapeutics: -
$\square$ Mimic human blood's oxygen transport ability.
- Per fluorocarbon based: eg. Oxygent, Oxycyte, Perftoran, etc.
- Haemoglobin based: eg. Hemopure, Oxyglobin, PolyHeme, Dextran-Haemoglobin, etc.

\section*{Stem Cell: -}
$\square$ Recently the scientific community has begun to look at the possibility of using stem cells as a means of producing an alternative source of transfusable blood.

\section*{SPECIAL CONCERN}
$\square$ Jehovah's Witnesses cannot accept donor packed red cells, platelets, white cells or plasma, and cannot accept autologous or cell-cycled intraoperative transfusion.
$\square$ The sect leadership used to be militantly antiimmunization, anti-germ theory, and anti transplantation as well.

DR. GEORGE MUGENYA MBCHB, M.MED, FCS (ECSA)

\section*{INDICATIONS OF BLOOD TRANSFUSION}
$\square$ Blood should be transfused only when required to save a life.
- When a clinician prescribes a transfusion it is to achieve one of the following:
- Restore patient's circulating blood volume.
- Increase the blood oxygen carrying capacity of the body.
- To supply lost, inadequate or missing plasma coagulation other factors.
- Supply platelets or granulocytes.
- Dilute or remove from circulation any toxic substances as happens in exchange transfusion.

\section*{INDICATIONS OF BLOOD TRANSFUSION}
$\square$ Indications for transfusion will vary from patient to patient.
$\square$ In Kenya the majority of transfusions are for treatment of anaemia.
- The component of choice for this indication is PRBC.
- Some indications for blood transfusion have changed since advent of component therapy:
- eg. restoration of circulating blood volume have been replaced with the use of plasma expanders (ie. colloids and crystalloids).
- Component therapy is transfusion of specific parts (components) of blood, instead of whole blood.

\section*{BLOOD COMPONENTS AVAILABLE IN KENYA}

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|}
\hline Component & Composition & volume & Indications \\
\hline Whole Blood & RBC( Hct 40\%), Plasma, Platelets, WBC & 450 mls & Increase both red cell mass and volume. Platelets, WBC and coagulation factors inadequate or non-functional \\
\hline Packed Red Cells & RBC (Hct 70\%), reduced plasma, platelets and WBC & 250 mls & Increase red cell mass in symptomatic anaemia \\
\hline Paediatric Packed Red Cells & RBC (Hct 70\%), reduced plasma, platelets and WBC & 125 mls & Increase red cell mass in symptomatic anaemia \\
\hline Platelets & Platelets ( $>5.5 \mathrm{x} 10^{10}$ /unit), some RBC and WBC & 50 mls & Bleeding due to thrombocytopaenia \\
\hline Fresh Frozen Plasma & Fresh Plasma ( contains all coagulation factors) & 220 mls & Treatment of some coagulation disorders; Warfarin overdose \\
\hline Cryoprecipitate & Fibrinogen, Factor VIII and XIII, von Willebrands Factor & 15 mls & Deficiency of fibrinogen, Factor VIII, von Willebrands \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\section*{COMPONENT THERAPY}
$\square$ Advantages of Component Therapy:
- The patient receives only the specific blood component needed.
- More than one patient can be served by one blood donor.
- Each component can be stored under optimal conditions for its individual use.
NB:
- Kenyan annual blood requirement is 380,000 units but only 124,000 units are collected annually.

GUIDELINES FOR THE APPROPRIATE
USE OF BLOOD AND BLOOD
PRODUCTS
Guidelines for:
- Red Blood Cell Transfusion.

Plasma (FFP) Transfusion.
- Platelet Transfusion.

Clinical transfusion procedures.

\section*{RED BLOOD CELL TRANSFUSION GUIDELINES}
1. Acute and Perioperative Blood Loss:
$\square$ Evaluate the patient for risk of ischemia.
- Estimate blood loss:
- If 15-30\% => Give volume expanders in young health persons.
- If 30-40 \%=> Rapid volume replacement.
=>RBC is likely needed.
- If > 40\% => Life threatening.
=>Requires rapid volume replacement.
=>Requires RBC transfusion.

\section*{...RED BLOOD CELL TRANSFUSION GUIDELINES}
... Acute and Perioperative Blood Loss:
$\square$ Monitor vital signs:
- Tachycardia and hypotension not corrected with volume expanders => RBC needed.
$\square$ Measure haemoglobin:
- If $\mathrm{Hb}>10 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dl}$ : RBC rarely needed.
- If $\mathrm{Hb}<5 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dl}$ : RBC usually needed.
${ }^{-}$If $\mathrm{Hb} 5-10 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dl}$ with co-morbidity conditions:
- RBC may be needed depending on additional clinical condition.

\section*{...RED BLOOD CELL TRANSFUSION GUIDELINES}

\section*{Dr kibaru}
${ }^{-}$In severe anaemia give blood transfusion to
- A) All children with a heamatocrit of less than 12 or Hb of less than $4 \mathrm{gm} / \mathrm{dl}$

Pocket book of hospital care for children, guidelines for management of common illnesses with limited resources WHO
${ }^{\circ} \mathrm{B}$ ) Less severely anaemic haematocrit of $13 \%-18 \% \mathrm{Hb} 4-6 \mathrm{gm} / \mathrm{dl}$ with any of the following clinical features
- Clinically detectable dehydration
- Impaired level of consciousness
- Heart failure
${ }^{-}$Deep and laboured breathing
- very high parasitaemia (more than 10\% of red cells with parasites)
${ }^{\circ}$ C) Acute loss when $20-30 \%$ of total volume has been lost or bleeding is continuing
${ }^{\circ}$ D) Septic shock
${ }^{\circ}$ E) To provide plasma and platelets for clotting factors
F) Exchange transfusion in neonates

\section*{RED BLOOD CELL TRANSFUSION}
${ }^{\circ}$ Red blood cells (RBCs) are transfused to increase the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood and, in turn, to maintain satisfactory tissue oxygenation
${ }^{\circ}$ If the estimated blood loss is $>25 \%$ of the circulating blood volume ( $>17 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{kg}$ )and the patient's condition remains unstable, RBC transfusions may be indicated

In acutely ill children with severe pulmonary disease requiring assisted ventilation, it is common practice to maintain the hemoglobin level close to the normal range

With chronic anemia, the decision to transfuse RBCs should not be based solely on blood hemoglobin levels because children compensate well and may be asymptomatic despite low hemoglobin levels.

Patients with iron-deficiency anemia are often treated successfully with oral iron alone,
-even at hemoglobin levels of $<5 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dL}$.

Factors other than hemoglobin concentration to be considered in the decision to transfuse RBCs include:
the patient's symptoms, signs, and functional capacities
- the presence of cardiorespiratory, vascular, and central nervous system disease
- the cause and anticipated course of the anemia
alternative therapies are not available

\section*{In chronic anaemia}
$\stackrel{*}{*}$ It is important to balance the detrimental effects of anemia on growth and development
vs the potential toxicity associated with repeated transfusions..

\section*{RBC transfusion in neonates}
all neonates experience a decline in circulating RBC mass caused both by physiologic factors
in sick premature infants, by phlebotomy blood losses.
In healthy term infants, the nadir hemoglobin value rarely falls to $<11 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dL}$ at an age of $10-12 \mathrm{wk}$.
$\star$ This "physiologic" drop in RBCs does not require transfusions.
the decline occurs earlier and is more pronounced in premature infants
the mean hemoglobin concentration falls to approximately $8 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dL}$ in infants of $1.0-1.5 \mathrm{~kg}$
$\star$ birthweight and to $7 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dL}$ in infants weighing <1.0 kg at birth
. Most infants with birthweight of <1.0 kg need RBC transfusions.
nadir hemoglobin values of premature infants are lower coz of relatively diminished plasma EPO level in response to anemia

\section*{The mechanisms responsible for low plasma EPO levels are}
is the reliance of preterm infants on the liver as the primary site of EPO production during the first few wk of life.
- The liver is less responsive than the kidneys to anemia and tissue hypoxia.

Preterm infants exhibit a sluggish EPO response to falling hematocrit values.
- Low plasma EPO levels provide a rationale for the use of recombinant EPO in the treatment of anemia of prematurity.
- Proper doses of EPO and iron effectively stimulate neonatal erythropoiesis

\section*{$\checkmark$ Stable neonates do not require RBC transfusion, regardless of their blood hemoglobin level}
$\checkmark$ unless they exhibit clinical problems attributable to anemia.

\section*{The RBC product of choice}
is the standard suspension of RBCs separated from whole blood by centrifugation and resuspended in an anticoagulant/preservative storage solution at a hematocrit value of approximately 60\%.

The usual dose is $10-15 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{kg}$
N.B.
* transfusion volumes vary greatly, depending on clinical circumstances (continued vs arrested bleeding, hemolysis).

For neonates
Preference a packed RBC concentrate (hematocrit of 70-90\%).

Either is infused slowly (over $2-4 \mathrm{hr}$ ) at a dose of approximately $15 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{kg}$.

Because of the small quantity of extracellular fluid given at these relatively high hematocrit values and the slow rate of transfusion, the type of RBC anticoagulant/preservative solution used does not pose risks for premature infants.

\section*{Guidelines for Pediatric Red Blood Cell Transfusions INFANTS WITHIN THE FIRST 4 MO OF LIFE}
- Hemoglobin of $<13.0 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dL}$ and severe pulmonary disease
- Hemoglobin of $<10.0 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dL}$ and moderate pulmonary disease
- Hemoglobin of $<13.0 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dL}$ and severe cardiac disease
- Hemoglobin of $<10.0 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dL}$ and major surgery
- Hemoglobin of $<8.0 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dL}$ and symptomatic anemia

\section*{CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS}

Acute loss of $>25 \%$ at circulating blood volume
- Hemoglobin of $<8.0 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dL}$ in the perioperative period

Hemoglobin of $<13.0 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dL}$ and severe cardiopulmonary disease
Hemoglobin of $<8.0 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dL}$ and symptomatic chronic anemia

Hemoglobin of $<8.0 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dL}$ and marrow failure

\section*{TRANSFUSION PROCEDURE}
${ }^{\circ}$ In severe anaemia ,If packed cells are available give $10 \mathrm{mls} / \mathrm{kg}$ over 3-4 hours
${ }^{\circ}$ Preferred over whole blood if not fresh whole blood $20 \mathrm{mls} / \mathrm{kg}$ over 3-4 hours
${ }^{-}$Check respiratory rate and pulse rate every 15 min if rise is noted transfuse slowly
${ }^{-}$If evidence of overload occurs give frusemide $1-2 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$

\title{
- If after transfusion no increment of Hb transfuse again
}

\section*{- In malnourished child give packed cells $10 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{kg}$ or whole blood $10 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{kg}$}
${ }^{-}$N.B. Do not repeat transfusion in malnutrition

\section*{Platelet transfusion}
- Guidelines for platelet (PLT) support of children and adolescents with quantitative and qualitative PLT disorders are similar to those for adults
where the risk of life-threatening bleeding after injury or occurring spontaneously can be related to the severity of thrombocytopenia
${ }^{\checkmark}$ PLT transfusions should be given to patients with PLT counts of $<50 \times 10^{9} / \mathrm{L}$ when they are bleeding or are scheduled for an invasive procedure.
$\checkmark$ Studies of patients with thrombocytopenia resulting from bone marrow failure indicate that spontaneous bleeding increases markedly when PLT levels fall to $<20 \times 10^{9} / \mathrm{L}$, if serious complications (infection, organ failure, clotting abnormalities, or anemia) are present.
-In this setting, prophylactic PLT transfusions are given to maintain a PLT count of $>20 \times 10^{9} / \mathrm{L}$.
- PLT transfusions may be given to maintain relatively high PLT counts in situations of DIC, sepsis, active bleeding or need for invasive procedure
$\stackrel{*}{*}$ In Qualitative PLT disorders, PLT transfusions are justified only if significant bleeding occurs.
* Because inherited PLT dysfunction is long term and repeated transfusions may lead to alloimmunization and refractoriness, prophylactic PLT transfusions are rarely justified, unless an invasive procedure is planned
a bleeding time of $>$ twice the upper limit of laboratory normal or an abnormal result may be taken as diagnostic evidence of PLT dysfunction
bleeding time or any other laboratory test result is poorly predictive of hemorrhagic risk or the need to transfuse PLTs.

Alternative therapies, particularly desmopressin acetate, should be considered to avoid PLT transfusions.
- Antiplatelet medications (nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs) should be avoided in these patients.
> $\stackrel{*}{*}$ In neonates, hemostasis is quantitatively and qualitatively different from that in older Children

$\Leftrightarrow$ Approximately $25 \%$ of neonates treated in ICU exhibit blood PLT counts of $<150 \times 10^{9} / \mathrm{L}$ at some time during admission
pathogenetic mechanisms are
accelerated PLT destruction
diminished PLT production

The goal of most PLT transfusions is to raise the PLT count to $>50 \times 10^{9} / \mathrm{L}$ and to increase that for neonates to $>100 \times 10^{9} / \mathrm{L}$.

\section*{Dose $10 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{kg}$}

"PLTs $<100 \times 10^{9} / \mathrm{L}$ and clinically unstable
-PLTs at any count, but with PLT dysfunction plus bleeding or an invasive procedure

Fresh Frozen Plasma Transfusions
-FFP is transfused to replace clinically significant deficiencies of plasma proteins for which more highly purified concentrates are not available
- Requirements for FFP vary with the specific factor being replaced, but a starting dose of $15 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{kg}$
-Transfusion of FFP for the treatment of deficiencies of clotting factors II, V, X, and XI.
- Deficiencies of factor XIII and fibrinogen are treated with cryoprecipitate.

> Transfusion of FFP is not recommended for the treatment of patients with severe hemophilia A or B or for factor VII deficiency because safer factor VII, VIII, and IX concentrates are available.
* FFP is used for rapid reversal of the effects of warfarin

Transfusion of FFP in patients with chronic liver disease and prolonged clotting times is not recommended unless bleeding is present or an invasive procedure is planned because correction of the clotting factor deficiencies is brief.
