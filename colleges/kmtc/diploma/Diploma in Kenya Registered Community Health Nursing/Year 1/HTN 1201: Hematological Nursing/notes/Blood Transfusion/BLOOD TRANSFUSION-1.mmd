\section*{INTRODUCTION}
$\square$ Blood transfusion is the process of transferring blood or blood based products from one individual into the circulation system of another person.
-This is referred to as homologous transfusion.
- In autologous transfusion the donor and recipient is the same person.
$\square$ Earlier transfusions used whole blood but current practice uses only deficient blood components separately (component therapy).
$\square$ The history of practice of blood transfusion can be traced as way back as $15^{\text {th }}$ century.
$\square$ It has evolved through a lot of controversies and sometimes ridiculous experiences into a specialized medical science of today; eg.
- Giving blood orally.
- Transfusion of animal blood to human.
-Transfusion of milk.
- Direct transfusion from donor's vein to recipient's vein, etc).

\section*{INTRODUCTION}

Some of the landmarks in the development of modern transfusion science include:
- Description of blood circulatory system by Harvey in $17^{\text {th }}$ century.
- Discovery of ABO blood groups in 1901
- Discovery of anticoagulants in 1910s (sodium citrate) and refrigeration to prolong blood storage.
- Soviet Union set up first national blood bank in 1930s.
- Discovery of Rhesus group system in 1940 as major cause of transfusion reactions.
- ...Some of the landmarks...
- Discovery of Acid-Citrate-Dextrose (ACD) solution in 1940s to help reduce amount of anticoagulant needed to preserve blood.
- Introduction of plastic bags to replace glass bottles in 1950.
${ }^{-}$Adoption of WHO policy of voluntary blood donation in 1975.
- Introduction of CPDA-1 anticoagulant in 1979 to increase shelf life to 35 days.
- Emergence of HIV in 1980s brought up new challenges in management of blood transfusion services.

\section*{KENYAN BLOOD TRANSFUSION POLICY}
$\square$ Kenya is a signatory to World Health Assembly Resolution (WHA 28.72) of 1975 and Regional Commonwealth Ministers of Health Resolution of 1989 which requires:
-Each member state to develop a comprehensive, well coordinated blood transfusion service, based on voluntary, non-remunerated blood donation.
-Each member state to make provision for safe blood to the people a national priority.

\section*{...KENYAN BLOOD TRANSFUSION POLICY}
$\square$ In different countries the mandate to coordinate national blood transfusion services are entrusted to specific organizations, eg. Red Cross, Red Crescent, AABB , etc.
${ }^{\square}$ In Kenya this mandate has been given to National Blood Transfusion Services (NBTS):
- It is a unit under National Public Health Laboratories Services (NPHLS).

\section*{KENYAN BLOOD TRANSFUSION POLICY}

The GOAL of NBTS is to provide safe blood whenever it is needed, through creating a strong, efficient, and self sustaining national blood transfusion service capable of meeting all the needs of the country.

\section*{KENYAN BLOOD TRANSFUSION POLICY}

NBTS is managing the blood transfusion program through:
- National Blood Transfusion Centre (NBTC), located in Nairobi.
- Regional Blood Transfusion Centres (RBTC), located in Mombasa, Embu, Nyeri, Nakuru, Eldoret and Kisumu.
- Satellite Centres-Naivasha, Eldama-Ravine, Kericho, Kisii, etc.
- Primary Hospital Blood Banks-though being discouraged/phased out.
${ }^{\square}$ The STRATEGY of NBTS to fulfill its mandate include the following:
- Proper organizational structures of the blood transfusion services.
- Recruitment of safe blood donors.
- Screening of units of blood for Transfusion Transmissible Infections (TTIs).
- Ensuring appropriate clinical use of blood and blood products;
- eg. issue transfusion guidelines.

\section*{BLOOD DONOR RECRUITMENT}
$\square$ The following are the different types of blood donors (sources):
- Family / replacement donors - donate blood for a specific/ known recipient.
- Voluntary / unpaid donors-donate blood to be given to whoever needs it.
- Commercial / paid donors-donate blood in exchange for money or favours.
- Autologous donors-donate blood for his / her anticipated use / need.

\section*{...BLOOD DONOR RECRUITMENT}

Criteria for qualification as a blood donor are:
$\square$ Healthy individual: normal BP and Pulse, not on medications, no history of exposure to TTIs.
- Age: 16 to 65 years.
$\square$ Weight: 50 kg and above (45-50 kg may be allowed in exceptional circumstances).
$\square$ Haemoglobin level: $12.5 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dl}$ and above (for Autologous $10 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dl}$ and above).
$\square$ Donated blood last not less than 3 months ago (in special circumstances 2 months interval may be allowed).
$\square$ Willing to declare his/her health status both present and past.

\section*{...BLOOD DONOR RECRUITMENT}

Safe Donor: That person who knows that she/he is at a low risk of TTIs and is willing to give blood voluntarily on a regular basis.

\section*{Advantages:}
- Are not under pressure to give blood therefore are more likely to meet the national criteria for low risk donors.
- Are willing to donate blood on a regular basis which is important in maintaining adequate supply of blood.
- Are at low risk of TTIs because they have been educated about the importance of safe blood and are screened each time they attend to give blood.
- Are more likely to respond to an appeal for blood donation during an emergency because they have already expressed commitment to voluntary blood donation.

\section*{BLOOD COLLECTION, PROCESSING AND STORAGE}

Methods of blood donations are:
$\square$ Whole blood donation (commonest):
- All blood components are collected together.
$\square$ Apheresis donation:
Only required component(s) is/are donated /collected.
- Uncommon and requires expensive equipment.

\section*{BLOOD COLLECTION}
$\square$ Donor is screened to ensure normal criteria set for low risk donors is met:
- verbal interview.
through questionnaire.
$\square$ After disinfecting the skin:
- wide bore needle (G.18) is inserted into a forearm vein.
- blood is collected by gravity through the connecting tubing into a plastic bag containing anticoagulant.

\section*{BLOOD COLLECTION}
$\square$ Commonly used anticoagulant:
- CPDA-1 (Citrate Phosphate Dextrose with Adenine).
- Previously it was ACD and CPD (Acid Citrate Dextrose \& Citrate Phosphate Dextrose).
$\checkmark$ CPDA-1 preserves blood for 35 days while ACD and CPD do it for 21 days.
${ }^{\square}$ When SAGM (Sodium Adenine Glucose Mannitol) solution is added to CPDA-1 blood can be preserved for up to 42 days.

\section*{...BLOOD COLLECTION}

Actions of ingredients of anticoagulant solutions:
$\square$ Citrate:- Prevents coagulation by chelating calcium.
$\square$ Dextrose :- Supports ATP generation by glycolytic pathway.
$\square$ Sodium di-phosphate :- Prevents fall in pH .
$\square$ Adenine :- Synthesizes ATP, increases level of ATP, and extends the shelf life of red blood cells to 35 days.

\section*{...BLOOD COLLECTION}
$\square$ Each donation is 450 mls to 500 mls .
- Half filled bags are normally discarded.
The donated blood is immediately placed in a transport box which is maintained at a temperature of +20 to +24 degrees Celsius for not more than 6 to12 hours.

\section*{BLOOD PROCESSING}

Testing /laboratory screening for TTI:
${ }^{-}$HIV (1 \&2)
$\square$ Hepatitis B virus (HBV)
$\square$ Hepatitis C virus (HCV)
$\square$ VDRL for Treponema pallidum (Syphilis)
$\square$ Others : Malaria, Chaga's disease (T. cruzi), Leishmaniasis, CMV (Cytomegalovirus)
Blood Grouping:
- ABO
$\square$ Rhesus

\section*{...BLOOD PROCESSING}

Separation of Whole Blood (Hct 40\%) into blood components:
$\square$ Packed Red Blood Cells (PRBC) :-
- 250 mls adult packs (Hct 70\%).
- 125 mls paediatric packs (Hct 70\%).
$\square$ Platelets :- 50 mls packs.
$\square$ Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFP) :-
- 220 mls; contains all coagulation factors.
$\square$ Cryoprecipitate :-
- 15mls; has fibrinogen, factor VIII, XIII and von Willebrand.

\section*{BLOOD STORAGE}

Whole blood and blood components are required to be maintained at specific temperatures (cold chain) for them to be useful when transfused.
$\square$ Whole blood :-
Stored at +2 to +8 deg. C :-
*Up to 21 days in ACD or CPD.
*Up to 35 days in CPDA-1.
*Up to 42 days when SAGM is added to CPDA-1.

\section*{BLOOD STORAGE}
$\checkmark$ Packed Red Blood Cell :-
${ }^{-}+2$ to +8 deg. $C$ and duration as for whole blood.
$\square$ Plasma :-
${ }^{>}+2$ to +8 deg. $C$ for up to 5 days.
minus-18 deg. C or below for up to 5 years.
$\square$ Fresh Frozen Plasma :-
minus-18 deg. C or below for up to 1 year.
$\square$ Platelets Concentrate :-
- Room Temp. with agitation for up to 5 days.
${ }^{\square}$ Cryoprecipitate :- minus-18 deg. C for up to 1 year.

\section*{AUTOLOGOUS BLOOD DONATION}

Donation can be done as whole blood or by apheresis in one of the following ways:
$\square$ Pre-operative:
- Blood is drawn before a planned surgery and stored until needed.
$\square$ Intra-operative haemodilution:
- Blood is collected at the start of surgery and then infused during or at the end of the procedure.
- Blood salvage:
- Blood is salvaged from the surgical field and infused during or after the surgical procedure.

\section*{...AUTOLOGOUS BLOOD DONATION}

Advantages Autologous blood donation:
$\square$ Prevents transmission of TTIs.
$\square$ Prevents blood transfusion reactions.
- Provide reassurance to donor-recipient.
$\square$ To stockpile rare blood groups.
Disadvantages of Autologous blood donation:
- Adverse reaction to donation.
$\square$ Unnecessary loss of blood units if operation is postponed or transfusion is not needed.
${ }^{\square}$ Increased work load to blood bank: ie needs special labeling and storage facilities.

\section*{THE FUTURE}

Due to increased demand for blood which outstrips the supply:
$\square$ Blood Substitutes (artificial blood or blood surrogates) are being developed.
- Being used to fill fluid volume and/or carry oxygen and other blood gases in the cardiovascular system.
- The preferred and more accurate terms are :-
- Volume expanders for inert products.
- Oxygen therapeutics for oxygen carrying products

\section*{THE FUTURE}

Volume expanders: -
$\square$ Inert and merely increase blood volume.
- Crystalloids: eg. Ringer's lactate, normal saline, D5W
- Colloids:-eg. Haemacel, Dextran, Voluven, Gelofusin.

Oxygen therapeutics: -
$\square$ Mimic human blood's oxygen transport ability.
- Per fluorocarbon based: eg. Oxygent, Oxycyte, Perftoran, etc.
- Haemoglobin based: eg. Hemopure, Oxyglobin, PolyHeme, Dextran-Haemoglobin, etc.

\section*{Stem Cell: -}
$\square$ Recently the scientific community has begun to look at the possibility of using stem cells as a means of producing an alternative source of transfusable blood.

\section*{SPECIAL CONCERN}
$\square$ Jehovah's Witnesses cannot accept donor packed red cells, platelets, white cells or plasma, and cannot accept autologous or cell-cycled intraoperative transfusion.
$\square$ The sect leadership used to be militantly antiimmunization, anti-germ theory, and anti transplantation as well.
