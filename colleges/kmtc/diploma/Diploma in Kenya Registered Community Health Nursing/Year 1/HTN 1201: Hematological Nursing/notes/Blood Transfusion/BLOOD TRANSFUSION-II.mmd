\section*{INDICATIONS OF BLOOD TRANSFUSION}
$\square$ Blood should be transfused only when required to save a life.
- When a clinician prescribes a transfusion it is to achieve one of the following:
- Restore patient's circulating blood volume.
- Increase the blood oxygen carrying capacity of the body.
- To supply lost, inadequate or missing plasma coagulation other factors.
- Supply platelets or granulocytes.
- Dilute or remove from circulation any toxic substances as happens in exchange transfusion.

\section*{INDICATIONS OF BLOOD TRANSFUSION}
$\square$ Indications for transfusion will vary from patient to patient.
$\square$ In Kenya the majority of transfusions are for treatment of anaemia.
- The component of choice for this indication is PRBC.
- Some indications for blood transfusion have changed since advent of component therapy:
- eg. restoration of circulating blood volume have been replaced with the use of plasma expanders (ie. colloids and crystalloids).
- Component therapy is transfusion of specific parts (components) of blood, instead of whole blood.

\section*{BLOOD COMPONENTS AVAILABLE IN KENYA}

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|}
\hline Component & Composition & volume & Indications \\
\hline Whole Blood & RBC( Hct 40\%), Plasma, Platelets, WBC & 450 mls & Increase both red cell mass and volume. Platelets, WBC and coagulation factors inadequate or non-functional \\
\hline Packed Red Cells & RBC (Hct 70\%), reduced plasma, platelets and WBC & 250 mls & Increase red cell mass in symptomatic anaemia \\
\hline Paediatric Packed Red Cells & RBC (Hct 70\%), reduced plasma, platelets and WBC & 125 mls & Increase red cell mass in symptomatic anaemia \\
\hline Platelets & Platelets ( $>5.5 \mathrm{x} 10^{10}$ /unit), some RBC and WBC & 50 mls & Bleeding due to thrombocytopaenia \\
\hline Fresh Frozen Plasma & Fresh Plasma ( contains all coagulation factors) & 220 mls & Treatment of some coagulation disorders; Warfarin overdose \\
\hline Cryoprecipitate & Fibrinogen, Factor VIII and XIII, von Willebrands Factor & 15 mls & Deficiency of fibrinogen, Factor VIII, von Willebrands \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\section*{COMPONENT THERAPY}
$\square$ Advantages of Component Therapy:
- The patient receives only the specific blood component needed.
- More than one patient can be served by one blood donor.
- Each component can be stored under optimal conditions for its individual use.
NB:
- Kenyan annual blood requirement is 380,000 units but only 124,000 units are collected annually.

GUIDELINES FOR THE APPROPRIATE
USE OF BLOOD AND BLOOD
PRODUCTS
Guidelines for:
- Red Blood Cell Transfusion.

Plasma (FFP) Transfusion.
- Platelet Transfusion.

Clinical transfusion procedures.

\section*{RED BLOOD CELL TRANSFUSION GUIDELINES}
1. Acute and Perioperative Blood Loss:
$\square$ Evaluate the patient for risk of ischemia.
- Estimate blood loss:
- If 15-30\% => Give volume expanders in young health persons.
- If 30-40 \%=> Rapid volume replacement.
=>RBC is likely needed.
- If > 40\% => Life threatening.
=>Requires rapid volume replacement.
=>Requires RBC transfusion.

\section*{...RED BLOOD CELL TRANSFUSION GUIDELINES}
... Acute and Perioperative Blood Loss:
$\square$ Monitor vital signs:
- Tachycardia and hypotension not corrected with volume expanders => RBC needed.
$\square$ Measure haemoglobin:
- If $\mathrm{Hb}>10 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dl}$ : RBC rarely needed.
- If $\mathrm{Hb}<5 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dl}$ : RBC usually needed.
${ }^{-}$If $\mathrm{Hb} 5-10 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dl}$ with co-morbidity conditions:
- RBC may be needed depending on additional clinical condition.

\section*{...RED BLOOD CELL TRANSFUSION GUIDELINES}
2. Chronic Anaemia:
$\square$ Transfuse only to decrease symptoms and to minimize risk ( $\mathrm{Hb}<5 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dl}$ ).
- Do not transfuse above $\mathrm{Hb} 5 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dl}$ unless patient is symptomatic.
$\square$ Treat nutritional and mild blood loss anaemia with specific therapeutic agents as indicated (iron, folic acid, B12, etc.).
$\square$ Use specific strategies for sickle cell disease and thalassaemia.

\section*{RED BLOOD CELL TRANSFUSION GUIDELINES}
3. Transfusion in sickle cell disease:

When develop cardio-respiratory symptoms from severe anaemia.
- When develop symptoms for anaemia due to:

Aplastic crisis.
$\checkmark$ Splenic sequestration.
Accelerated haemolysis (haemolytic anaemia or sickle crisis).
$\square$ Pre-operative preparation for most types of surgery.
- Chronic transfusion
$\square$ Prevention of recurrent occlusive stroke ( $<30 \% \mathrm{HbS}$ )
$\checkmark$ Selected sickle cell pregnancy complications eg. recurrent foetal loss.

\section*{...RED BLOOD CELL TRANSFUSION GUIDELINES}
4. Anaemia in Pregnancy:
$\square$ In pregnancy:
- Maternal plasma volume increases by $40 \%$.
- Red blood cell mass increases by 25\%.
- Blood loss during vaginal delivery is 500 mls .
- 1000 mls is lost during caesarean section.
- The blood loss is usually well tolerated, hence does not require transfusion.
$\square$ Blood transfusion should be considered for pregnant women with Hb less than $5 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dl}$ who become symptomatic with dyspnoea, shock or orthostatic hypotension.

\section*{...RED BLOOD CELL TRANSFUSION \\ GUIDELINES}
...Anaemia in Pregnancy:
$\square$ Blood should be ordered and made available for immediate transfusion in case of haemorrhage during delivery for pregnant women with Hb less than $7 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dl}$.
- Blood transfusion is not indicated in anaemic women who are clinically stable after delivery.
- Pregnant women with Hb less than $10 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dl}$ should receive ferrous sulphate 200 mg ( 60 mg elemental iron) three times a day throughout pregnancy.

\section*{...RED BLOOD CELL TRANSFUSION GUIDELINES}
5. Paediatric RBC Transfusion:
${ }^{\square}$ If Hb is $<4 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dl}$ transfuse.
${ }^{\square}$ If Hb is $>4 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dl}$ and $<5 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dl}$ :
- Transfuse when signs of respiratory distress or CCF are present.
- If patient is clinically stable, monitor closely and treat the cause of anaemia.

\section*{...RED BLOOD CELL TRANSFUSION GUIDELINES}

\section*{...Paediatric RBC Transfusion:}
If Hb is $>5 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dl}$ transfusion is usually not necessary.
- Consider transfusion in cases of shock or severe burns.
- Otherwise treat the cause of anaemia.
Transfuse with 10 to $15 \mathrm{mls} / \mathrm{kg}$ of PRBC or $20 \mathrm{mls} / \mathrm{kg}$ of whole blood.
- In the presence of profound anaemia or very high malaria parasitaemia, a higher amount may be needed.

\section*{...RED BLOOD CELL TRANSFUSION GUIDELINES}
6. Neonatal RBC Transfusion:
$\square$ Total blood volume for:
- Full term baby is $85 \mathrm{mls} / \mathrm{kg}$.
- Pre-term baby 100-105 mls/kg .

\section*{...RED BLOOD CELL TRANSFUSION GUIDELINES}
...Neonatal RBC Transfusion:
- Transfuse with 10-15 mls/kg PRBC for:
- Acute blood loss of > 10 \% of blood volume.
- Haemoglobin $<7 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dl}$.
- Haemoglobin $<8 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dl}$ in new born with apnoea, bradycardia, tachycardia, tachypnoea, or decreased vigour.
- Haemoglobin of $<12 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dl}$ with:
- Moderate to severe respiratory distress.
- Severe congenital heart disease.
- Absence of weight gain for 7 days with no other explanation.

\section*{PLASMA (FFP) TRANSFUSION}
- FFP must be ABO-compatible with recipient's red blood cells.
- FFP is indicated:
- Coagulation abnormalities and microvascular bleeding with prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time greater than 1.5 times the mid-range normal reference value.
- For treatment of bleeding due to multiple coagulation factor deficiencies.
Massive transfusion with coagulation abnormalities.
Bleeding due to warfarin therapy.
- FFP should not be used when a coagulopathy can be corrected with vitamin K .

\section*{PLATELET TRANSFUSION}

ABO-compatibility should be insured for all patients.
$\square$ Rhesus compatibility for women in child bearing age.
$\square$ Each unit of platelet concentrate increases platelet count in adult by $7-10,000 / \mathrm{mm} 3$.
- 4 to 8 units of platelets concentrate are usually pooled to make an adult dose for severe thrombocytopaenia.
- Surgical and obstetrical patients with microvascular bleeding:
- Often require platelet transfusion when platelet count is less than $50,000 / \mathrm{mm} 3$.
- Rarely require transfusion if the platelet count is greater than $100,000 / \mathrm{mm} 3$.

\section*{CLINICAL TRANSFUSION PROCEDURES}

Transfusion Steps:
1. Assess the patient's need for blood transfusion.
2. Complete a request form accurately and legibly. Including:
I. Patient identification.
II. Reason for transfusion.

\section*{...Transfusion Steps:}
4. Send blood sample and request form to the laboratory.
5. Collect or receive blood or blood products from laboratory.
6. Check the identity of patient and blood product by checking:
1. Patient's name (from patient's records and ask the patient: * use at least 3 names).
2. Hospital number and ward number.
7. Confirm blood or plasma is compatible by checking the blood group on patient's notes and label on blood bag.
8. Check expiry date of blood or plasma.

\section*{CLINICAL TRANSFUSION PROCEDURES}

16. Report any adverse reactions immediately to the laboratory.

\section*{TRANSFUSION COMPLICATIONS}

\section*{Transfusion Reactions:}
$\square$ Although transfusion can be life-saving therapy, it can result in many adverse effects.
- Approximately 1\% of all transfusions lead to some type of adverse reaction.
- Majority of transfusion reactions are mild and can be managed without having to stop the transfusion.
$\square$ The most common cause of serious haemolytic transfusion reaction is administration of ABO incompatible blood which may require immediate stoppage of transfusion

\section*{TRANSFUSION COMPLICATIONS}

Transfusion Reactions:
Some of the common and serious types of transfusion reactions are:
1. Immunological reactions:
$\square$ Red cells-haemolysis (immediate or delayed).
$\square$ White cells-febrile reactions, pulmonary infiltrates.
