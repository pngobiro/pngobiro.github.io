                        <p>Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML), also known as Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia, is a myeloproliferative disorder characterized by increased proliferation of the granulocytic cell line without the loss of their capacity to differentiate. This results in a high number of granulocytes and their immature precursors in the peripheral blood.</p>
                        <p>CML is an acquired abnormality involving the hematopoietic stem cell. Its hallmark is a specific cytogenetic aberration known as the <strong>Philadelphia chromosome</strong>. This is a reciprocal translocation between the long arms of chromosomes 9 and 22, denoted as <strong>t(9;22)</strong>.</p>
                        <p>This translocation relocates the <strong>abl</strong> oncogene from chromosome 9 to the <strong>BCR</strong> (Breakpoint Cluster Region) on chromosome 22. The resulting <strong>BCR/ABL fusion gene</strong> encodes a chimeric protein with strong tyrosine kinase activity, which leads to uncontrolled cell proliferation and the development of CML.</p>
                        <p>CML accounts for 20% of all adult leukemias and typically peaks between the ages of 40-50 years. Increased incidence has been reported among individuals exposed to radiation.</p>

                        <p>The disease generally progresses through three distinct phases:</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">1. Chronic Phase</h3>
                        <p>Most patients are diagnosed in this phase. It is characterized by splenomegaly and leukocytosis with few symptoms. The WBC count is usually controlled with medication. This phase can last for several years, especially with modern therapies.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">2. Accelerated (or Transitional) Phase</h3>
                        <p>This phase may last for several months and signals disease progression. It is characterized by poor control of blood counts, worsening anemia, and an increase in peripheral blast cells (≥15%), promyelocytes (≥30%), or basophils (≥20%). Bone pain and fever may occur. Survival in this phase is typically 1-2 years.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">3. Blast Crisis (Acute Phase)</h3>
                        <p>This final phase is similar to acute leukemia, with 30% or more blasts in the bone marrow and peripheral blood. Skin or tissue infiltration can also occur. Survival is typically 3-6 months. In two-thirds of cases, the blasts are myeloid; in one-third, they are lymphoid.</p>

                            <li><strong>Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors (TKIs):</strong> The cornerstone of CML therapy. <strong>Imatinib mesylate (Gleevec)</strong> was the first and directly inhibits the BCR/ABL protein's tyrosine kinase activity.

                            <li><strong>Hydroxyurea:</strong> An oral myelosuppressive agent used to control high WBC counts and achieve hematologic remission, often before starting a TKI.</li>
                            <li><strong>Busulfan:</strong> An older alkylating agent, now rarely used due to its side effects and difficulty in controlling counts.</li>
                            <li><strong>Interferon Alfa:</strong> Was a standard of care before TKIs, capable of inducing cytogenetic remission in some patients.</li>
                            <li><strong>Bone Marrow Transplant (BMT):</strong> A potentially curative option, considered for young patients with a matched sibling donor.</li>
                            <li><strong>Leukapheresis:</strong> A procedure to rapidly lower dangerously high WBC counts to alleviate symptoms of leukostasis.</li>

                        <p>Lymphoid blast crisis is treated with chemotherapy regimens used for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (e.g., vincristine, daunorubicin, prednisone).</p>
