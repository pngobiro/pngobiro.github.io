                        <p><strong>DEFINITION.</strong> This are conditions whereby there is abnormal bleeding due to impairment of hemostasis (cessation of bleeding). Hemostasis is achieved by the following processes.</p>
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li><strong>Vessel constriction: (vasoconstriction)</strong> when blood vessel endothelium is injured, the blood vessel usually constrict e.g. small capillaries and arteries</li>
                            <li><strong>Clumping of platelets - platelets plug formation or clot.</strong> Platelets adhere to the collagen tissue lying underneath the endothelium exposed during injury, and also to one another. This helps to plug the opening & bleeding stops if the injury was minimal.</li>
                            <li><strong>Blood coagulation. The chemical clotting</strong> This is the process involving a series of enzymatic reactions leading to the conversion of suitable fibrinogen to a fibrinogen clot. This mechanism can be triggered by two independent routes, namely
                                <ol type="i">

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">i) Extrinsic pathway</h3>
                        <p>A tissue factor (iii) usually released from a damage cell with calcium and factor (vii). This (iii, vii,& ca) activate factor (x). Then this becomes Activated factor (xa).</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">ii) Intrinsic pathway</h3>
                        <p>Following injury of a blood vessel, factor xii is activated with the injured blood surface to xiia. This activates factor xi to xia. This xia activates factor ix giving factor ixa. Factor ixa, vii & a phosphate lipid activate factor x giving xa. Xa together with calcium and phospholipids activates factor ii giving iia. iia activates factor i i.e. fibrinogen, giving fibrin. Factor iia and calcium activates factor xiii to xiiia. Xiiia stabilizes fibrin giving stable fibrin clot. This fibrin strands are laid on the platelet plug formed earlier forming a mesh, and binding together an injured tissue.</p>

                        <p>Plasminogen becomes activated into plasmin which digests fibrin giving soluble fibrin degradation products.</p>
                        <p>Bleeding disorder or impairment of blood coagulation can result from defects in any of the following factors that contribute to homeostasis:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>platelets</li>

                            <li>vascular integrity</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>the number of circulating platelets can be reduced ( thrombocytopenia) or the platelet function can be impaired (thrombocytopathia). The impairement of blood coagulation can result from deficiencies of one or more of the known blood clotting factors. Deficiencies can also arise from defective synthesis ie in liver disease or Vit K deficiency, inherited diseases such as( hemophiliaor vonwillebrand disease) or increased consumption of the clotting factors ie in DIC.</p>

It results in reduced platelet adhesions.vwf is a cofactor for the procoagulant factor viii, a defect in vwf will result in both platelet dysfunction and coagulopathy. There is mild to severe form. Because the vwf carries factor viii Its deficiency may also be caused by reduced levels of factor viii, resulting in defective clot formation.</p>

                        <p>This is a disorder in the haemostatic sequence characterized by wide spread intravascular coagulation and bleeding, its not a primary disease but occurs as a complication of a wide variety of conditions. It begins with massive activation of coagulation sequence as a result of unregulated generation of thrombin, resulting in systemic formation of fibrin, the levels of all the major anticoagulants are reduced, the generation of micro thrombin results in vessel occlusion and tissue ischemia, multiple organ failure may come in. clot formation consumes all the available coagulation proteins and platelets and severe bleeding occurs.t The normal hemostatic mechanism are altered so that a massive amount of tiny clots in the micro circulation. The platelets and clotting factors are consumed to form the micro thrombin thus coagulation fails, thus excessive clotting leads to excessive bleeding.</p>
