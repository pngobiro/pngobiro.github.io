                         <h4>Definitions</h4>
                         <p>A group of malignant disorders of the haematopoietic tissues characteristically associated with increased numbers of white blood cells in the Bone Marrow and /or peripheral blood. It's a malignant disease/cancer of the blood cells characterized by unregulated proliferation of one cell type: the WBCs. The malignant cells are derived from precursor myeloid or lymphoid tissue cells.</p>
                         <p>The WBCs develop from stem cells in the bone marrow. Leukemia results when the process of maturation from stem cells to white blood cells go awry and produces a cancerous change, the change often involve a rearrangement of pieces of chromosomes: the cells complex genetic material. Because the chromosomal rearrangement disturbs the normal control of cell division the affected cell multiply without restraint becoming cancerous. They ultimately occupy the bone marrow, replacing the cells that produce normal blood cells. Thus there is;</p>
                         <ul>
                            <li>- Failure of maturation of WBC.</li>
                            <li>- Proliferation of cells which do not mature leads to accumulation of useless cells and congestion in BM at the expense of normal cells.</li>
                            <li>- This proliferation eventually spills into the blood.</li>
                            <li>- Normal immature cells should not exceed 5%.</li>
                         </ul>
                         <p>The course of the disease may vary from a few days or weeks to many years, depending on the type. Leukemia is the most common cause of cancer in children and adolescents.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Pathophysiology of acute leukemia</h3>
                        <p>Although acute leukemia is rapidly growing tumors, normal bone marrow progenitors grow at an even more rapid rate. The principal pathogenesis problem in acute leukemia is a block in differentiation. This leads to the accumulation of immature leukemic blasts in the bone marrow, which suppress the function of normal hematopoietic stem cells by physical displacement and other poorly understood mechanisms, eventually bone marrow failure results, which accounts for the major clinical manifestations of acute leukemia. Thus, the therapeutic goal is to reduce the leukemic clone sufficiently to allow normal hematopoiesis to resume.</p>

                        <p>The acute leukaemias have the following characteristics:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Abrupt stormy onset: Most patients present within 3 months of the onset of symptoms.</li>
                            <li>Symptoms related to depression of normal marrow function: These include fatigue, pallor, dyspnoea, weakness (mainly due to anaemia), fever (reflecting infections resulting from the absence of mature leukocytes), Bleeding disorders (petechiae, ecchymoses, epistaxis, gum bleeding, purpura, bruises, prolonged bleeding) secondary to thrombocytopenia (low platelets).</li>
                            <li>Bone pain and tenderness: These result from marrow expansion and infiltration of the sub periosteum.</li>
                            <li>Generalized lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, and hepatomegaly: These reflect dissemination of the leukemic cells, and are more pronounced in ALL than in AML due to infiltration.</li>
                            <li>Central nervous system manifestations: These include headache, vomiting, irritability and nerve palsies resulting from meningeal spread of leukemic cells; (Leukemic meningitis. these features are more common in children than in adults and are more common in ALL than AML.</li>
                            <li>Infection and fever resulting from too few normal white blood cells.</li>
                            <li>Gum hypertrophy due to infiltration.</li>
                            <li>Chloromas : soft tissue masses in the skin or orbit due to infiltration by tumors.</li>

                         <p>Aim of treatment is to destroy leukemic clone of cells without destroying the residual normal stem cell compartment from which repopulation of the hematopoietic tissues will occur and to give supportive care. There are four general types of therapy;</p>
                         <ol>
                            <li>Chemotherapy where a combination of drug are used.</li>
                            <li>Bone marrow transplant.</li>
                            <li>Radiotherapy</li>

                         </ol>
                         <h4>There are three phases of chemotherapy treatment</h4>
                         <h5>1. Remission induction</h5>
                         <p>-This is the initial phase, where destruction of the bulk of tumour occurs.<br>-Severe BM hypoplasia occurs, requiring intensive support with in-patient care.<br>-The aim is to reduce blast cells to less than 5% in BM with normal peripheral film. The drugs used include Vincristine and Glucocorticoids (Predinsolone, Dexamethasone) with addition of one or two agents</p>
                         <h5>2. Remission consolidation/Intensification phase</h5>
                         <p>Since patients in remission induction phase still harbor leukemic cells, further systemic treatment is required to prevent or delay leukemic relapse. This is usually completed within the first 6-12 months after induction. It involves the introduction of new, non-cross-resistant drugs and drug combinations selected for different and often synergistic mechanisms of action to reduce the risk of emergence of drug resistance.</p>
                         <h5>3. Remission maintenance</h5>
                         <p>- If the pt is still in remission after consolidation phase a period of maintenance therapy is given consisting of a repeating cycle of drug administration usually up to 3 years. During maintenance therapy the patient still remain at risk of infection. Fever in children who are receiving chemotherapy must be evaluated and treated aggressively, especially if the patient is either neutropenic or has a central venous access device.</p>

                        <p>Probable cure of AML has been achieved with BMT after successful remission in induction phase. Bone marrow is a semi solid substance within the bones where blood cells such as WBCs, RBCs and platelets are manufactured from the hematopoietic stem cells (HSC). During BMT it's the HSCs which are transplanted to replace the damaged or the diseased cells in the bone marrow with the cells of a normal person. This is called an Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant (HSCT). Bone marrow transplant/ stem cell transplant is performed after a high dose of chemotherapy or radiation. The donor must have the same genetic makeup as the patient ie from the family member (brother or sister).</p>

The fragment from chromosome 9 that joints the BCR carries the Abelson oncogenes, which form a chimeric gene with the remains of BCR. This chimeric gene codes for a 210 kDa protein with tyrosine kinase enzyme, which plays a causative role in the disease.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h4>The disease has three phases</h4>
                        <p>The phases are based mainly on the number of immature WBCs (blasts) in the bone marrow.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Chronic phase - a period of variable length.</strong><br>The patients may be generally be asymptomatic but without proper treatment then patient progress to accelerated phase within 4 years. Has slow onset with non- specific symptoms ie weakness and weight loss.<br>- This is responsive to treatment and is easily controlled.<br>- It is essentially a benign neoplasm.<br>- Fewer than 10% of the cells in the blood and bone marrow are blast cells (immature blood cells). Patients have mild symptoms and usually respond well to treatment. Presents with leukocytosis.</li>
                            <li><strong>Accelerated phase - short phase 6-12 months.</strong><br>During this phase more and more immature granulocytes enter the blood stream and bone marrow. Its characterized by enlarged spleen, anaemia and progressive abdominal fullness and discomfort. Signs and symptoms include: low grade fever, night sweats, bone pain and weight loss coz of rapid proliferation and hypermetabolism of the leukemic cells. Bleeding and easily Bruising may arise from the dysfunctional platelets. Blood samples have 15% or more but fewer than 30% blasts, very low counts of Platelets, Basophils make upto 20% or more of the blood.<br>- Patient not responsive to TREATMENT<br>- Not easily controlled</li>
                            <li><strong>Blast crisis phase (acute phase) the terminal phase characterized by increasing no. of myeloid cells.</strong><br>Symptoms become more pronounced and splenomegally may become more pronounced. There is infiltration in the skin, lymph nodes, bones and central nervous system. Blood samples have 20% or more blasts (high blast count) Large clusters of blasts are seen in the bone marrow and are spread to tissues and organs beyond the bone marrow. Patients presents with fever, poor appetite and weight loss.<br>- Refractory to TREATMENT relapse<br>- Main cause of death in majority of patients.<br>- Patients' survival is determined by detection timing of blast phase which cannot be predicted.<br>- The disease transforms into acute leukemia in either AML 70% or ALL 30%.</li>

These are diverse group of solid tumours composed of neoplastic lymphoid cells that vary with respect to molecular features, genetics, clinical presentation and treatment. They start in lymph nodes but can involve lymphoid tissues and spleen. The lymphatic system carries a specialized type of white blood cells called lymphocytes through a network of tubular channels (lymph vessels) to all parts of the body including the bone marrow. Scattered throughout this network are collections of lymph nodes/ lymph glands.</p>

                            <li>- The Histological Hallmark of Hodgkin's disease is the presence of Reed Sternberg cells, which are large malignant lymphoid cells of B cell origin. This is a specialized form of lymphoma that features the presence of an abnormal cell called a Reed-Sternberg cell.</li>
                            <li>- They are often present in small numbers but surrounded by a large number of reactive T-cells, plasma cells, and Eosinophils.</li>
                            <li>- Four types are recognized from the appearance of R-S cells and the surrounding reactive cells.</li>

                        <p>The WHO classification proposed classifying Hodgkin lymphoma into two major categories: nodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphoma and classic Hodgkin lymphoma. Nodular lymphocyte- predominant Hodgkin lymphoma represents only a small portion of all cases of Hodgkin lymphoma and is a unique form that generally exhibits a nodular growth pattern. Classic Hodgkin lymphoma is characterized by clonal proliferation of typical mononuclear Hodgkin cells and multinucleated Reed-Sternberg cells. Pathological classification of Hodgkin's Lymphoma is as follows:-</p>

                            <li>- A personal or family history of lymphoma or other prior hematopoietic malignancy, use of radiation therapy, immunosuppressive agents, chemotherapy, organ transplantation, and other underlying diseases should be obtained</li>
                            <li>- Relevant infections include HIV-I, HTLV-I, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), hepatitis C, Borrelia bergdorferi (B. afzellii species), and perhaps also hepatitis B virus</li>
                            <li>- Specific disorders associated with the development of NHL include connective tissue diseases (e.g. lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, Sjogren's syndrome), immunodeficiency disorders, mixed cryoglobulinemia, Castleman's disease, and inflammatory bowel disease treated with azathioprine/6-mercaptopurine.</li>
                            <li>- An occupational history should be obtained, as exposure to certain agricultural pesticides and Agent Orange have been implicated in the development of NHL</li>
                            <li>- Specific illnesses which are risk factors for the development of gastrointestinal lymphoma include: Crohn's disease gastrointestinal nodular lymphoid hyperplasia, Helicobacter pylori-associated chronic gastritis and Celiac disease</li>
                            <li>- Systemic complaints (B symptoms) : About 40 percent of patients with NHL present with systemic complaints of: Fever - temperature >38°C, Weight loss - unexplained loss of >10 percent of body weight over the past six months, Sweats - the presence of drenching night sweats</li>
                            <li>- These complaints are of importance in determining prognosis</li>
                            <li>- Less frequent presenting systemic complaints of fatigue, malaise, and pruritus occur in fewer than 10 percent of patients.</li>
                            <li>- The presence of bone pain or gastrointestinal symptoms may indicate extranodal involvement in these areas</li>
                            <li>- Fever of unknown origin: Fever of unknown origin (FUO) refers to a prolonged febrile illness without an established etiology despite intensive evaluation and diagnostic testing.</li>
                            <li>- Historically, the most common causes of FUO have been infection, connective tissue diseases, and malignancy.</li>
                            <li>- NHL, especially one of the aggressive or highly aggressive variants, is a common cause of FUO due to malignancy.</li>
                            <li>- Lymphadenopathy: More than two-thirds of patients with NHL present with peripheral lymphadenopathy.</li>

                        <p>- Staging system - The Ann Arbor staging system developed in 1971 for Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) was adapted for staging non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHLs)<br>- This staging system focuses on the number of tumor sites (nodal and extranodal), location, and the presence or absence of systemic ("B") symptoms</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Stage I</strong> refers to NHL involving a single lymph node region (stage I) or a single extralymphatic organ or site (stage IE)</li>
                            <li><strong>Stage II</strong> refers to two or more involved lymph node regions on the same side of the diaphragm (stage II) or with localized involvement of an extralymphatic organ or site (stage IIE)</li>
                            <li><strong>Stage III</strong> refers to lymph node involvement on both sides of the diaphragm (stage III), or with localized involvement of an extralymphatic organ or site (stage IIIE) or spleen (stage IIIS), or both (stage IIIES)</li>
                            <li><strong>Stage IV</strong> refers to the presence of diffuse or disseminated involvement of one or more extralymphatic organs (e.g. liver, bone marrow, lung), with or without associated lymph node involvement The presence or absence of systemic symptoms should be noted with each stage designation.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <ol type="i">
                            <li>Radiotherapy in stage I disease.</li>
                            <li>Chemotherapy- chlorambucil is mainly used -only to improve the quality of life, otherwise there is no cure.</li>
                            <li>Monoclonal antibody Therapy -Humanized monoclonal antibody to target surface Antigen on tumour cells and deliver cytotoxic drugs or radiotherapy or induce tumour cell apoptosis directly. Such antibodies targeted to low grade lymphoma cells have been shown to induce durable clinical response in up to 60% of patients.</li>
                            <li>Transplantation<br>-Autologous stem cell transplantation are in progress.<br>-However no conclusive results have been made so far.</li>

                            <li>Chemotherapy<br>- CHOP regime remains the mainstay of therapy i.e. cyclophosphamide (C) 500 mg/m<sup>2</sup>, +or- Doxorubucin (Adriamycin) (H) 50 mg/m<sup>2</sup>, Vincristine (Oncovin) (O) 1 mg/m<sup>2</sup>, prednisolone (P) 1-2 mg/kg.<br>- Given in mg/SA<br>- Given in courses</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Start 3 weeks interval for 6 courses.</p>
                        <h5>(ii) Radiotherapy</h5>
                        <p>This is indicated in:-</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>-A few stage I patients without bulgy disease may be suitable for radiotherapy.</li>
                            <li>-Residual localized site of bulky disease after chemotherapy.</li>
                            <li>-Spinal cord and other compressing symptoms.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h5>(iii) Transplantation</h5>
                        <p>-Autologous stem cell transplant have been tried, though still not monoclonal Antibody therapy.<br>-This is used in combination with CHOP regime to enhance results.</p>
