                            <li><strong>RBC (Erythrocytes)</strong> the most numerous of the three cellular components. Makes up almost half of the blood volume. They are filled with hemoglobin which enables them to carry oxygen from the lung to body tissues and then carry carbon dioxide from the tissues to the lungs.</li>
                            <li><strong>WBC (Leukocytes)</strong> they are fewer in no. compared to the RBC to the ratio of about 1:660 (WBC: RBC). There are 5 main types:
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Neutrophils:</strong> (granulocytes) they contain enzyme-filled granules. Are the most prevalent white blood cell type. They protect the body against bacterial and fungal infections and ingest foreign debris. Two types are band (immature) and segmented (mature).</li>
                                    <li><strong>Lymphocytes:</strong> T- lymphocytes which help protect against viral infections and can detect and destroy some cancer cells. B-lymphocytes which develop into cells that produce antibodies.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Monocytes:</strong> ingest dead or damaged cells and provide immunologic defenses to many infective organisms.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Eosinophils:</strong> kill parasites, destroy cancer cells and are involved in allergic responses.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Basophils:</strong> also participate in allergic responses.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Platelets (thrombocytes)</strong> are cell-like particles smaller than red or white blood cells. They help in stopping bleeding. They gather at a bleeding where they are activated. Once activated they become sticky and clamp together to form a plug that helps seal the blood vessel and stop bleeding. They release substance that helps promote clotting.</li>

                        <p><strong>HAEMATOPOIESIS.</strong> This is the process of blood cell production. (haemopoiesis). The formation and maturation of blood cells.</p>
                        <p>In early foetal life, blood is synthesized in several tissues such as the liver, spleen, thymus and the lymph nodes. Later, before birth, formation of blood starts in the bone marrow. At birth, blood formation takes place in every bone. In adult life, $RBC$ production is confined to the end of long bones (red bone marrow) and also to the flat bones e.g. Ribs, iliac bones, sternum, vertebrae and some white blood cells are produced in lymphatic tissues (lymph nodes and spleen and the thymus) All peripheral blood cells are derived from a single stem cell- the Primitive cells.</p>

The basophilic normoblast further develops into reticulocytes. The reticulocytes nucleus is lost & the cell is usually small in size. It then matures into an adult blood cell within three days. After which there is mature $RBC$ in circulation. (Erythrocyte)</p>
                        <p>The red blood cell has no nucleus. Its shape is a biconcave disc. They contain the protein hemoglobin which gives them the ability to carry oxygen.</p>

                        <p>Other vitamins include, riboflavin. Elements - zinc, copper, pyridoxine. Hormones - androgen, for formation of the $RBC$.</p>
                        <p>Low oxygen levels in the body increase the RBC production by increasing the formation of glycoprotein, erythropoietin by the kidneys, erythropoietin stimulates the RBM to produce more RBC. When oxygen levels in the blood decreases the production of erythropoietin increases which increase RBC production. The increased NO. of RBC leads to increased oxygen transportation and delivery of oxygen to the tissues. Later the erythropoietin production reduces thus production reduces and vice versa. Life span 120 days then they die.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p><em>Haemostasis: is a sequence of responses that stops bleeding. Damage of the vasculature quickly leads to massive bruising and, if unrepaired, leads to extreme blood loss and consequently organ failure. Haemostasis, the physiological processes that stop bleeding, is critical for human health. The coagulation system is remarkably complex in both structure and function. Many proteins are involved, produced by different cell types of the body, with both inactive and active forms regulated in a fine balance.</em></p>
                        <p>The coagulation system provides for immediate activation when there is blood loss that needs to be stemmed but also confines its activity to the site of blood loss. The haemostatic system includes blood platelets, endothelial cells, and plasma coagulation factors, which work together to rapidly form a haemostatic plug in an injured blood vessel.</p>
                        <p>Whenever a vessel is severed or ruptured, haemostasis is achieved by several mechanisms: (1) vascular constriction, (2) formation of a platelet plug, (3) formation of a blood clot as a result of blood coagulation, and (4) eventual growth of fibrous tissue into the blood clot to close the hole in the vessel permanently.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">1. Vascular constriction.</h3>
                        <p>Immediately after a blood vessel has been cut or ruptured, the trauma to the vessel wall itself causes the smooth muscle in the wall to contract; this instantaneously reduces the flow of blood from the ruptured vessel. The contraction results from local myogenic spasm, local autacoid factors from the traumatized tissues and blood platelets, and lastly nervous reflexes.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">2. Formation of platelet plug.</h3>
                        <p>If the cut in the blood vessel is very small-indeed, many very small vascular holes do develop throughout the body each day-the cut is often sealed by a platelet plug, rather than by a blood clot.</p>
                        <p>Platelet repair of vascular openings is based on several important functions of the platelet itself. When platelets come in contact with a damaged vascular surface, especially with collagen fibers in the vascular wall, the platelets themselves immediately change their own characteristics drastically. They begin to swell; they assume irregular forms with numerous irradiating pseudopods protruding from their surfaces; their contractile proteins contract forcefully and cause the release of granules that contain multiple active; they become sticky so that they adhere to collagen in the tissues and to a protein called von Willebrand factor that leaks into the traumatized tissue from the plasma; they secrete large quantities of ADP; and their enzymes form thromboxane A2. The ADP and thromboxane in turn act on nearby platelets to activate them as well, and the stickiness of these additional platelets causes them to adhere to the original activated platelets. Therefore, at the site of any opening in a blood vessel wall, the damaged vascular wall activates successively increasing numbers of platelets that themselves attract more and more additional platelets, thus forming a platelet plug. This is at first a loose plug, but it is usually successful in blocking blood loss if the vascular opening is small. Then, during the subsequent process of blood coagulation, fibrin threads form. These attach tightly to the platelets, thus constructing an unyielding plug.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">3. Clot formation.</h3>
                        <p>The clot is composed of a meshwork of fibrin fibers running in all directions and entrapping blood cells, platelets, and plasma. The fibrin fibers also adhere to damaged surfaces of blood vessels; therefore, the blood clot becomes adherent to any vascular opening and thereby prevents further blood loss.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">4. Clot retraction.</h3>
                        <p>Within a few minutes after a clot is formed, it begins to contract and usually expresses most of the fluid from the clot within 20 to 60 minutes. The fluid expressed is called serum because all its fibrinogen and most of the other clotting factors have been removed; in this way, serum differs from plasma. Serum cannot clot because it lacks these factors. Platelets are necessary for clot retraction to occur. Therefore, failure of clot retraction is an indication that the number of platelets in the circulating blood might be low. Furthermore, platelets entrapped in the clot continue to release pro-coagulants substances, one of the most important of which is fibrinstabilizing factor, which causes more and more cross-linking bonds between adjacent fibrin fibers. As the clot retracts, the edges of the broken blood vessel are pulled together, thus contributing still further to the ultimate state of haemostasis.</p>
                        <p>Aspirin and other NSAIDs irreversibly inhibit platelet cyclo-oxygenase and impair platelet function. They inhibit vasoconstriction and platelet aggregation by blocking the synthesis of thromboxane A2.</p>
