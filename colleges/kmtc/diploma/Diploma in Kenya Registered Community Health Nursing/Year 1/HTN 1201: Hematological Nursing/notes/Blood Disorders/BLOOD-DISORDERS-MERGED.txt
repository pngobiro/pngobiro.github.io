\section*{BLOOD DISORDERS}
- Blood biology
- Anaemia
- Bleeding disorders
- WBC disorders
- Leukaemia
- Blood transfusion.
- Plasma cell disorders
- Lymphomas

\section*{BLOOD BIOLOGY.}

DEF: Blood is a combination of liquid, cells and cell like particles that goes through the arteries, capillaries and veins - delivering oxygen and other essential nutrients to tissues and carrying away carbon dioxide and other wastes from tissues.

\section*{Blood production.}
(i) In the bone marrow.
(ii) Reticuloendothelia system.

Liver and spleen during embryological development.
(iii) And during sickness.

\section*{Functions of blood.}

\section*{Primary function.}
(i) Transportation of various substances and
(ii) Exchange of materials in and out of tissues.

\section*{Secondary functions.}
- Cellular metabolism.
- Homeostasis of fluid volume.
- Homeostasis of PH.
- Homestasis of body temperature and depends against micro-organisms.

\section*{Blood volume.}

The average volume in a 70 kg in an adult male is around 5 litres.
Blood is composed of plasma and cells.
Plasma is the fluid portion of blood.
When plasma is allowed to clot the fluid part is called Serum.
It has the same components as plasma except the clotting factors.
Cells contain 45\% of the total blood volume.
Plasma contains 55\% of the total blood volume.

\section*{Blood cells.}
- Red blood cells are erythrocytes.
- White blood cells are leucocytes.
- Platelets are the thrombocytes.

\section*{1. ERYTHROCYTES. (RED BLOOD CELLS)}
- Are the most numerous.
- The mature RBC have no nucleus.
- They are biconcave in shape.
- Do not contain organelles like ribosomes and mitochondria.
- In males they are 5.5 million $\mathrm{mm} /$ cube.
- In females they are 4.8 million $\mathrm{mm} /$ cube.
- In diameter 8 UM (Micrometer).

Is so flexible that can pass easily through the capillaries as small as 2.8 um in diameter.
Anaemia can be classified according to their sizes, microcytic, normocytic and microcytic.

\section*{Production.}

They are produced in the bone marrow i.e. ribs, sterum, pelvis.
The adult bone marrow produces 175 billion encythrocytes 70 billion leukocytes and 175 billion thrombocytes daily.

\section*{Destruction.}

Fragmentation occurs in the capillaries of the liver, spleen and bone marrow Life span is 120 days.

\section*{2. LEUKOCYTES. (WHITE BLOOD CELLS).}

Are of five types either granular or non-granular.

\section*{Granular.}
(a) Neutrophilis.
(b) Eosinophilis
(c) Basophilis

\section*{Non-granular.}
(a) Lymphocytes.
(b) Monocytes.

Neutrophilis are most prevalent and defends the body against fungus and bacteria. Are $1^{\text {st }}$ to arrive at site of infection within one hour.

Eosinophilis kill parasites e.g. worm and other cancer cells.
Basophilis are elevated during allergic conditions.
Lymphocytes - T-Lymphocytes - cellular immunity - (delayed allergic reactions).
B - Lymphocytes - humoral immunity.
T- Lymphocytes derived from thymus.
B-Lymphocytes from bone marrow.

T-cells - During transplant and during destruction of tumor cells.
B-cells - differentiate into plasma cell, which produces antibodies called the Immunoglobulin's which normally destroy the foreign materials.

Monocytes are used in phagocytes. Produce the macrophages. Are 5\% of total leukocytes.

Population of leukocytes 5-10 thousand mm/cube.
3. PLATELETES. (THROMBOCYTES).

Used for blood clotting or homeostasis.
Formed in bone marrow and spleen.
Lifespan is 10 days.
Amount 15-450 thousand/mm cube.

\section*{BLOOD PLASMA}
$90 \%$ of plasma is water and $10 \%$ is plasma.
Proteins Albumins, fibrinogen, globulins.

\section*{Blood cells formation (Hematopoiesis)}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_16_bdcdc2df5e4eaba3f3f5g-04.jpg?height=424&width=1435&top_left_y=1325&top_left_x=230)

Precursor of RBC are pro-ecythrocytes which differentiate into reticulocytes (immature RBC) which produces mature RBC.

Precursor of WBC is called Myeloblast which differentiate into myelocytes (Immature WBC) which gives rise to the granular WBC - Neutrophilis, Eosinophilis, and Basophile. Processor of platelets is megataryplasts which differentiate into megakaryocytes which gives rises to thrombocytes.

\section*{ANAEMIA.}

Is a condition where the number of RBC or HB levels is below normal.

\section*{Causes.}
1. Excessive bleeding.
2. Decreased production caused by iron deficiency, Vit Biz deficiency, Vitamin C deficiency, Follic acid deficiency and chronic illness.
3. Increased destruction of Red Blood Cells caused by spleenomegally, mechanical damage of Red blood cells, autoimmune reactions, haemoglobin abnormalities, hereditary factors, G6PD deficiency, sickle cell diseases.
1. Anaemia due to excessive bleeding.

Is the most common cause of anaemia and there is haemodilution.
Massive blood loss lead to hypotension and hypo-oxygenation.

\section*{Clinical features.}
- Thirst.
- Fainting.
- Sweating
- Weak rapid pulse.
- Rapid breathing.
- Orthostatic hypotension.
- Shortness of breath (dyspnoea)
- Fatigue.

NB. Rapid loss of atleast $1 / 3$ of blood is fatal.

\section*{Management}
- Stop the bleeders.
- Blood transfusion.
- Raise foot of the bed.
- Fluid replacement i.e. saline, ringers lactate etc.
- Give, ion and folates for chronic conditions.
- Give oxygen.
2. Anaemia caused by decreased Red blood cell production.

There is decrease in nutrients needed in ecythropoiesis.
Nutrients needed are iron, Vit B12 and folic acid ,Vit C, riboflavin, copper and erythropoietin.
(i) Iron Deficiency Anaemia.

Causes.
- Through blood loss.
- In infants and children dietary deficiency.
- Chronic loss e.g. Ca stomach, which cannot be adequately replaced by diet.
- Pregnant women as the fetus needs iron for growth.

Factors leading to decreased absorption of iron.
- Vegetable fibres.
- Foods with phosphates e.g. beans (always soak beans before cooking to remove phytate)
- Antacids reduces absorption of iron e.g. actals.

Clinical features.
- Fatigue.
- Shortness of breath.
- Activity intolerance.
- Pica
- Glossitis - tongue irritation. And very smooth.
- Koilonychias - spoon like deformity on the finger nails.
- Cheillosis - cracks at the sides of the mouth.

\section*{Diagnosis.}
- Clinical manifestation.
- Lab investigation - (full hemogram)
- Bone marrow studies.(Biopsy)

NB: Vit $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ and folic acid deficiency all lead to megaloblastic anaemia.

In both cases the WBC and platelets are abnormally large.

\section*{(ii) VITAMIN $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ DEFICIENCY.}
- Also called Pernicious Anaemia (Vit B12 is absorbed in the ileum (last part of small intestines.).
- Vit $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ must combine with intrinsic factors which are produced in the stomach for absorption to occur.
- $\quad$ Vit $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ is stored in the liver.

\section*{Causes of Vit B12 Deficiency.}
- Lack of intrinsic factors (proteins produced in the stomach for specific functions).
- Certain diseases e.g. chrohns disease, abnormal bacterial growth which is not conducive.
- Surgery of the stomach and the ileum.

\section*{Clinical features.}
- Night blindness.
- Sore tongue
- Weight loss.
- Darkened skin.
- Decreases intellectual activity.
- Nervous system pathology i.e. tingling, numbness of extremities.

\section*{Diagnosis.}
- Full haemogram.
- Gastric analysis.

\section*{Management. (specific)}

Replacement of Vit B12 i.e. by injection that is given of life.
Any other management for anaemia.

\section*{(iii) Folic acid deficiency anaemia.}

It is caused by lack of folic acid. It also called megaloblastic anaemia.

\section*{Sources Folic acid}

Dark green leafy vegetables, small sweet bananas.

\section*{Other causes.}
- Epileptic drugs.
- Oval contraceptics.
- Alcohol affects folic acid metabolism thus its absorption is reduced.
- Hemodialysis.

\section*{Long term effects.}
- Congenital abnormalities in pregnancy i.e congenital abnormality e.g. spinabifida, hydrocephalus.
- In infants it causes neurologic deficiencies.
- In adults it causes anaemia (folic acid anaemia)

\section*{Diagnosis}
- Full haemogram.
- Clinical presentation/manifestation.

Management.
- Folic supplements.
- Replacement for life.
- Other management for anaemia.
(iv) Anaemia Caused by Chronic Disease.

Is due to suppression of RBC production in the bone marrow. It is also called Iron-Reutilization anaemia because iron stored in the bone marrow cannot be used by the developing red blood cells.

It is gradual and mild.

Clinical features.
Gradual anaemia attacks.

Management.
Blood transfusion.
Erythropoietin hormone - produced in the kidney and stimulates production of Red Blood cells.
3. INCREASED DESTRUCTION OF RED BLOOD CELLS.

The scavenger cells from the bone marrow, spleen and liver, detect and destroy the red blood cells and when the destruction exceeds production, hemolytic anaemia results. $N B$ : It is very uncommon.

Factors leading to hemolytic anaemia.
- Spleenomegally
- Mechanical damage of RBC
- Auto Immune reaction.
- RBC abnormality.
- Hemoglobin abnormalities.

\section*{(i) Spleenomegally}

It the enlargement of the spleen caused by many condition i.e. malaria, kalaazar etc The enlarged spleen traps and destroys the RBC and the more they are trapped the more the enlargement.

Its gradual and symptoms are very mild.

\section*{Management.}

Treat the underlying cause of splenomegally.
(ii) Mechanical damage of RBC.

It leads to microangiopathic hemolytic anaemia.
Normally RBC should migrate without injuries, however some conditions such as aneurism(weakness of blood vessel and dilatation) leads to mechanical damage of the red blood cells.

Also extreme high blood pressure.

\section*{Diagnosis}

Microscopy of the blood. (Check for damaged red blood cells).

\section*{Management.}

Identify the cause and treat it.

\section*{(iii) Auto Immune Reactions.}

This is the destruction of own red blood cells because it (body) identifies them as foreign body.

When it is directed at red blood cells it is called Auto Immune Hemolytic anaemia.

\section*{Classification of Auto Immune Hemolytic Anaemia.}

Are of two types.
- Warm, antibody hemolytic anaemia
- Cold antibody hemolytic anaemia.
- In warm antibody hemolytic anaemia the body develops auto antibody that reacts against red blood cells in high body temperatures.
- Antibodies will coat the red blood cells and the red blood cells are destroyed by scavenger cells in spleen and bone marrow.
- It's common in women than men and could lead to lymphoma, leukemia, connective tissue disease e.g. SLE or exposure to certain drugs like antihypertensive.

\section*{Symptoms of warm antibody hemolytic anaemia.}
- Spleenomegally.
- Upper left abdominal tenderness.
- Other symptoms of severe anaemia.
- Cold antibody hemolytic anaemia body reacts against red blood cells due to low temperatures.

Symptoms are mild but when exposed to cold they worsen.

\section*{Diagnosis.}

Titre test - identification of antibodies.

\section*{MANAGEMENT}
1. Identity and treat the cause
2. Use of corticosteroids and cytotoxic drugs
3. Splenectomy
4. Blood transfusion
5. Other general management of anaemia

\section*{(iv) Hemoglobin abnormalities}

\section*{Sickle cell disease}

It's an inherited condition characterized by
Sickle shaped red blood cells and chronic hemolytic anemia
In sickle cell the red blood cell contain an abnormal form of hemoglobin that reduces the amount of oxygen in the cells causing them to become Cresent shaped or sickle shaped.
The sickle shaped cell block and damage the spleen, kidney, bones and other organs. The deformed cells are fragile i.e. delicate and easy to break as they travel through the vessels leading to:-
- Severe anemia
- Mild jaundice
- Blocked blood flow
- Organ damage and death.

\section*{Clinical Features}
- Severe pain
- Anaemia
- Jaundice (destruction of RBC and the liver cannot conjugate bilirubin)

Sickle cell crisis includes:-
- Severe pain
- Fever.
- Shortness of breath after exhaustion.
- Enlarged liver
- Cardiomegally of heart murmurs
- Poor circulation of blood especially to the ankle area thus poor healing of
wounds
- Painful erection (priapism) especially for young men.

\section*{DIAGNOSIS}
- Blood microscopy
- Physical presentation especially in times of crisis
- Electrophoresis (abnormal detection of HB).

\section*{Complications}
- Severe anaemia
- Impotence
- Pulmonary hypertension
- Heart failure
- Renal failure

\section*{Prevention of sickle cell crisis}
- Avoid strenuous exercise e.g high attitudes
- Avoid dehydration
- Early treatment of infections.

\section*{Management}
- Blood transfusion
- I.V Rehydration -(dilution of clumpy blood).
- Strong analgesics like morphine
- Oxygen therapy
- Prophylactic antibiotics
- Lower body temperatures
- Bone marrow transplant
- Hydroxyurea reduces production of abnormal RBC
- Psychological counseling.

\section*{NURSING DIAGNOSIS IN ANEMIA}
1. Altered tissue perfusion related to inadequate oxygen capacity as evidenced by decreased HB and red cells.
2. Activity intolerance related to impaired oxygenation as evidenced by patients' verbalization.
3. Altered nutrition less than body requirements related to increased need for substances necessary for normal ecythropoiesis as evidenced by decreased iron in blood, decreased vit B12 etc
4. Knowledge deficit related to health status of the patient, regarding treatment plan as evidence by patient verbalization.
5. Risk of infection related to impaired immunity.
6. Risks to injury related to compromised haematological status.

\section*{BLEEDING DISORDERS}
1. THROMBOCYTOPAENIA

It is the deficiency of platelets by $\leq 30,000 / \mathrm{mm}^{3}$
(Normal $150-450 / \mathrm{mm}^{3}$ )

\section*{4 MAIN CAUSES OF THROMBOCYTOPENIA}
1. Bone marrow in effectiveness e.g. in leukemia and anaemia.
2. Spleenomegally i.e. the enlarged spleen entraps the platelets thus causing thrombocytopenia.
3. Increased use or destruction of platelets e.g. in chronic illness.
4. Platelets dilution e.g. in exchanged blood transfusion.

\section*{Clinical features}

2. Administer haematencs
3. Assess the need of oxygen if dysphoeic
4. Rx the cause of the thrombocytopoerua
5. Avoid injuries especially giving i.m injection.
6. If bone marrow ineffectiveness give erythropoietin.

\section*{2. HAEMOPHILIA.}

Is a bleeding disorder caused by deficiency of one blood clotting factors eg. fibrogen. Types of haemophilia
Haemophilia A also called classic haemophilia
Haemophilia B also called christmass disease
a) Haemophilia A (Classic)

It accounts for 80\% of all the cases
There is deficiency of clotting factor Viii (8) while
b) Haemophilia B (christmass disease)

It accounts for 20\% of all the cases. There is deficiency of clotting factor 1X (9) A Bleding pattern is similar in both cases. Both are inherited from the mother, but affects men most i.e (the mother is the carrier)

\section*{Symptoms}

There is severe bleeding which may occur without any apparent reason e.g from tooth extraction.

\section*{Diagnosis}

Blood analysis through full haemogram
The condition is diagnosed by 18 months of age.

\section*{Management}
- Blood transfusion
- Haematenics
- Avoid injuries and injections especially intramuscular.
- Follow up care.

\section*{3. DISSEMINATED INTRAVASCULAR COAGULATION (DIC)}

Also called consumption coagulopathy.

It is a condition whereby small blood clots disseminated / spread through stream thereby blocking the small bood vessels thereby depleting the clotting factors which are needed to contrl bleeding so there is no hemostatis.
It begins with excessive clotting that is stimulated by a toxic substance.

\section*{People at risk}
- Complicated obstetric surgery or during child birth.
- People with leukemia,CA stomach CA pancreases CA prostate.
- Severe bacterial infectons because of toxins leading to blood clotting.

\section*{Clinical features.}

\section*{5 LEUKAEMIA}

Leukaemia is the cancer of blood cells or bone marrow.
It is characterized by abnormal proliferation (multiplication) of blood cells usually leukocytes (white blood cells).

\section*{Causes}
- Radioactive exposure
- Viruses
- Chemicals e.g benzene
- Anticancer drugs (chemotherapy)

NB:
The leukemia cells invade the bone borrow and eventually other organs.

\section*{Classification}
1. It's classified according to how quickly they progress i.e. (a) acute or (b) Chronic.
2. Which kind of blood cells they affect? They affect the lymphocytes and myelocytes.

\section*{(a) Acute lymphocytic leukemia}
- It's a life threatening disease in which the cells that normally develops into lymphocytes i.e lymphoblast become cancerous and rapidly replace the normal cells in the bone marrow.
- It is the most common cancer in children and often affects children of age 3 to 5 years and in adolescents.

\section*{Clinical features}
- General body weakness
- Dyspnoea
- Frequent infections
- Fever
- Bone and joints pains.

Leukaemia cells in brain - present signs of increased intracranial pressure.

\section*{Diagnosis}
1. Complete blood cell count (show normal increased or decreased blood cells)
- Decreased platelets and white blood cells.
- Immature white blood cells in circulation
2. Bone marrow biopsy.

\section*{Management}
- Bone marrow transplant
- Chemotherapy/radiotherapy
- Transfusion to blood
- Erythropoietin to stimulate the bone marrow
- Antibiotics
- Prognosis- good for children between 3 to 5 years and poor for those over 20 years.
- Analgesics.

\section*{Complications}
- Anaemia
- Meningitis

\section*{(b) Chronic Lympholytic Leukaemia}
- It is characterized by a large number of cancerous mature lymphocytes and enlarged lymph nodes.
- 3/4 of those people are over 60years.
- It is common in men than women
- The number of cancerous mature lymphocytes increases fast in the lymph node, then to spleen and liver which then enlarges.

\section*{Clinical features}
- Anaemia
- Decreased levels of antibodies
- There is confused immune system such that there is destruction of red blood cells and platlets.
- Inflammation of blood vessels
- Rheumatoid arthritis
- Enlarged lymph nodes.

\section*{Management and diagnosis same as acute lymphocytic leukemia.}

\section*{Acute Myelocytic Leukemia.}
- Is a life threatening disease in which the myelocytes becomes cancerous and rapidly replace the normal cells in the bone marrow.
- It affects adults mostly.

\section*{Causes of predisposing factors.}
- Exposure to radiation
- Some cytoxic drugs

\section*{Symptoms, diagnosis and management.}
- Same as the one for chronic myelocttic leukaemia.

\section*{Chronic myelocytic leukaemia.}
- It is a disease in which the cells in the bone marrow become cancerous and produces a large number of granulocytes.
- It affects any any age and sex.
- The leukaemia cells range from very immature to mature forms.

\section*{Clinical features.}
- In early stages there are no symptoms.
- Anaemia manifestations in later stages.
- There are sensations of fullness (abdomen i.e spleenomegallly.)
- Features associated to leukocytopenia (reduced W.B.C)
- Skin nodules filled to leukaemic granulocytes.

\section*{Diagnosis}

- Bone marrow analysis
- Chromosomal analytic of white blood cells.

\section*{Management.}
- No cure supportive management to slow the progssion like-
- Bone marrow
- Blood transfusion
- Radiotherapy
- Spleenectomy

Drugs given- interferon alpha which normalizes the bone marrow.
Hrdroxurea- it's an antitoxic drug.

\section*{PLASMA CELLS DISORDERS.}
- These are conditions in which a group of plasma cells multiply excessively and produces large quantities of abnormal antibodies.
- The antibodies normally will produce calories which fight the antigens but in this case the abnormal antibodies which are produced does not protect against infections thereby normal antibody production decreases thus one becomes more vulnerable to infections.

\section*{(a) Multiple myeloma}
- This is the plasma cells cancer in which abnormal plasma cells multiplies forming tumors in the bone marrow and produces a larger quantity of abnormal antibodies that accumulate in blood or urine.
- Plasma cells tumors are common in the pelvis, spine ribs and the scalp I.e where the bone marrow is found and sometimes outside the bone i.e the lungs and the reproductive organ.
- The abnormal antibodies may end up in the kidneys and other organs leading to organ failure eg kidney failure.
- Abnormal antibodies traces in the urine are called Bence Jones proteins.

\section*{Clinical features}
- Pain in the bones
- Weakness of the bones thus easy to fracture
- Anaemia
- Recurrent infection organs failure e.g. kidney failure
- Thickness of blood viscosity interfering with the flow to the toes and fingers

\section*{Diagnosis}
- Bence Jones proteins in urine
- Bone marrow biopsy
- X-ray (scalp, pelvis, ribs)
- Full haemoglobin - there is increased ESR
- High calcium levels.

\section*{Management}
- No cure, give supportive management
- Radiotherapy
- Analgesic
- Drinking alot of fluids.
- Exercise to reduce osteoporosis
- Antibiotic
- Blood transfusion
- Chemotherapy
- Erythropoietin

\section*{Special donations procedures.}

There are 3 special donations procedures.

\section*{1. Apheresis}

The donor give sonly the specific components needed by the recipient e.g. platelets, red blood cells and the rest of blood is given back to the donor.

\section*{2. Autologous transfusion}

This is self transfusion incase of severe bleeding or when one is undergoing surgery.

\section*{3. Directed or designated donation.}

This is blood donation for a family member or friend.

\section*{CARDIOVASCULAR DISORDERS}

Symptoms of cardiac disease.
1. Severe chest pains due inadequate blood.

Supply also inadequate oxygen supply causing ishaemia.
- There are metabolic wastes which produces cramping which is painful.
2. Dysphnoe (shortness of breath)
- This is because of fluid sleeping into air spaces of the lungs leading to pulmonary oedema or congestion.
3. Light headedness and fainting due to lack of adequate blood supply to brain.
4. Palpitations - This is forceful irregular or rapid heart beat due to cardiac compensatory activity.
5. Fatigue - This is because of inadequate blood supply to the muscles especially during exercises.
Its feeling weak and tired.

\section*{CONGESTIVE CARDIAC FAILURE (CCF)}

It is severe condition in which the quantity of blood pumped by the heart each minute (cardiac output) is insufficient to meet the bodyss normal requirement for oxygen and nutrients.

There are 3 major causes of CCF.

\section*{1. Conditions that affect the heart muscles}

Coronary heart disease which interfere with normal blood supply to the cardiac muscles and myocardilis which is the infection of the heart muscle by bacteria.

\section*{2. Conditions that interfere with flow of blood between the heart chamber.}
e.g stenosis of the semi-lunar valves and stenosis of the atria ventricular valves. Abnormal emptying of the heart or back flow of blood due to insufficiently of the atrioventricular valves.

\section*{3. Conditions i.e systematic disease which cause demand of extra nutrients and oxygen e.g.}

Thyrotoxicosis,anaemia and malnutrition.

\section*{PATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF CCF}

Cardiac output is below normal range and (cardiac output is equal to heart rate $x$ stroke volume)
stroke volume- is the amount of blood ejected by a ventricle during each systolic contraction because of reduced cardiac output, the heart works hard over a period of time to meet body supply of oxygen and nutrients therefore the heart muscles become enlarged and this enlargement makes the heart to increase the cardiac output but eventually the heart is not able to function well because muscles are overstretched and overstrained and this results in decreased pumping ability and heart failure.

\section*{NOTE:compensatory mechanism of CCF}

Note: when there is reduced output there is going to be activation of sympathetic nervous system hence increasing heart rate, palpitations mechanism to compensate.

The rash (rennin angiotensin stimulating hormone)
Activated due to reduced renal blood flow hence activating (rash) system where rennin converts angiotensin 1 to angiotensin 11 where angiotensin 11.

Later hypertenhon will result.

\section*{Factors influencing cardiac output and stroke volume}
1. Heart rate: the number at time each ventricle contracts per minute.
2. Pre-load volume i.e. of blood at end of diastole i.e. heart relaxation before ventricle contraction (systole).

Frank sterlin law of the heart states that the stretching of the myocardial fibres during diastole increases the force of contract during systole.
3. After volume, the resistance against which the ventricles must pump. It's affected by systematic vascular resistance.
4. Contractility this is the systematic vascular resistance generated by the myocardium under given conditions.

\section*{Impaired cardiac functions results in -}
1. Leads to failure to empty the venous reservoir so the systemic and pulmonary venous volumes are elerated.
2. There is reduced delivery of arterial blood into arterial circulation i.e the amount of blood ejected into the aorta and pulmonary arteries are reduced.

\section*{Clinical manifestations of CCF}

There are four components of the syndrome.

\section*{1. Right sided heart failure (cor-pulmonale)}

\section*{Symptoms}
- Increased systemic venous pressure
- Jugular venous distance
- Hepatomegally
- Peripheral oedema
- There is ascites
- Shortness of breath (dyspoea)
- Excersice intolerance
- Chest discomfort.

\section*{2. Left sided heart failure}
- Elevated pulmonary venous pressure (i.e to lungs)
- Decreased cardiac output
- Breathless
- Fatigue and weakness
- Confusion
- Pulmonary oedema
- Hypotension.

\section*{3. Caridiogenic shock}

This is circulatory failure due o severe depression of the myocardial contractility in which the cardiac output is markedly depressed.

\section*{Symptoms}
- Hypotension
- Tachycardia
- Oliguria
- Impaired mentation (pt is not mentally upright)

\section*{4. Acute pulmonary oedema}
- Marked dysphoea and orthophoea
- There is expectoration of flothy sputum.
- Pallor and cyanosis
- Confusion.

\section*{Diagnosis of heart failure}
1. Through signs and symptoms (through history taking and examination)
2. Chest $x$-ray which will show cardiomegally
3. Ech (electro-cardiogram) will show abnormal electric waves.
4. Through blood studies (blood analysis) there is a cardiac enzyme found in blood
5. Urinalysis

In urine there is a cardiac enzyme.

\section*{Management of CCF}

Once there is heart failure, no complete care.

\section*{Aims}
- To promote rest and reduce the heart workload
- To increase the heart contractions to increase cardiac output.
- To remove excess fluids from the body.

\section*{In treatment of CCF there are 3 approaches}
1. To remove the underlying cause.

Through surgical intervention e.g. to repair the heart valves, removal of tumors.

\section*{Medical intervention}

Gire inotropics e.g digoxin (digitalis) to increase the contractility and force of the heart.
Diuretics-e.g lasix which reduces the venous pressure i.e. oedema.
Ace- inhibitors (angiotensin converting enzymes inhibitors) eg captopril.
This reduces peripheral pressure and after load.

Hydralazine - to lower the blood pressure.
2. Removal of precipitating factors.
- Avoid smoking
- Low salt diet
- Weight reduction
- Physical and emotional rest
- Avoid drinking alcohol.
3. Control of heart failure.
- Early treatment of infection (rheumatic heart disease)
- Frequent medical check ups
- Improve quality of life through proper diet and exercise
- Weight reduction.

\section*{Heart valve disorders.}

Triscupid valve- opens from the right autrium to the left ventricle.
Pulmonary valve - open from right ventricle into pulmonary arteries.
Bicuspid valve - opens from left atrium into the left ventricle.
Aortic valve - opens from the left ventricle into the aorta

\section*{Heart valve malfunctioning}

Valve regurgitation - leaking of blood and goes back.
Valve stenosis-failure of the valves to open adequately.

\section*{Mitral valve regurgitation.}

This is leakage of blood through the mitral valve each time the left ventricle contract.
There is leakage of blood back to the left atrium increasing the volume and pressure in the lungs.

\section*{Causes of mitral valve regurgitation.}
- Heart attack
- Rheumative fevers
- Heart tumors.

\section*{Clinical features}
- Chest pains heart murmurs
- Dull breath sounds
- Palpitations
- Artial fibrillation.

\section*{Management}
1. Surgery

Valvaplasty-or replacement
2. Giving antibiotics
3. Hire drugs for atrial fibrillation

Fibrillation- is the rapid contraction of the atrium causing irregular contraction of the atrium causing irregular contraction of the ventricles in both rhythm and force.

\section*{Mitral valve stenosis}
- Is the narrowing of the mitral valve opening that increases resistance to blood flow from the left atrium to the left ventricle.
- It always results from
- Rheumatic fever
- Congenital
- Clots obstruct the flow of blood through the valves producing the same effects as stenosis.

\section*{Signs and symptoms}
- Pulmonary oedema
- Heart failure

\section*{Prevention and management}
- Prevent rheumatic fever
- Give drugs for heart failure
- Valve replacement or repair.

\section*{Mitral valve prolapse}

The valve leaflets bulge into the left atrium during ventricular contraction, sometimes
allowing leakage of small amount of blood into the left atrium.
Its common in women than men.

\section*{Causes}

It is inherited, there is connective tissue disorder resulting in enlargement of one or both of the mitral valve leaflets.

\section*{Symptoms}
- Chest pain
- Palpitations
- Migraine headache
- Dyshoea

\section*{Prevention and management}
- Patient is advised to eliminate caffeine from diet.
- Stop smoking
- Patient should be given antibiotics before dental surgery,because they will introduce infectious agents systematically into heart valves.
- Surgery= valvo plasty.
- Drugs are calcium channel blockers.

\section*{HYPOTENSION (low blood pressure)}

This is low blood pressure of less than $80 \mathrm{~mm} / \mathrm{hg}$ i.e systolic or less than $60 \mathrm{~mm} / \mathrm{hg}$ diastolic.

\section*{Causes}
- Pregnancy
- Medications e.g diuretics, antihypertensives
- Heart problems e.g CCF
- Endocrine problems eg hypothyroidism and hypothyroidism.
- Addison disease i.e adrenal insufficiency.
- Hypoglycemia
- Dehydration i.e fluid loss
- Blood loss eg during an RTA
- Severe infection (septicemia)
- Allergic reactions (anaphylactic shock)
- Nutritional deficiency (lack of vit $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ and Follett leads to anaemia.

\section*{Clinical features.}
- Dizziness
- Blurred vision
- Fainting
- Nausea
- Cold clummy skin
- Rapid shallow breathing
- Fatigue
- Depression
- Thirst

\section*{Types of low blood pressure.}
1. Postural (orthostatic hypotension)
2. Multiple system atrophy (shy-dragger syndrome)
3. Postproudal hypotension
4. Neural mediated hypotension.

\section*{1. Postural hypotension (orthostatic)}

This is sudden drop of blood pressure when one stands up after lying down.
This type of hypotension in older adults can also affect young healthy people who stand up suddenly after sitting with their legs crossed for long periods or after doing exercises for sometime in squatting position.

\section*{2. Multiple system atrophy}
- This is due to nervous system damage
- Also called shy-dragger syndrome.
- This is progressive damage to the autonomic nervous system (ans) which control involuntary system heart rate, breathing and digestion

\section*{3. Postpraidal hypotension.}

This is low blood pressure after eating.
A large amount of blood flows to the digestive tract and your body counteracts this by increasing the heart rate and constricting sudden blood vessels to help maintain normal blood pressure but in some people mechanism fails.

\section*{4. Neutrally medicated hypotension.}

This is low blood pressure resulting from faulty brain signals.
Unlike orthostatic hypotension, it causes BP to drop after standing for longer period of time.

This affects young people.
Occurs because of a miscommunication between the heart and the brain.

\section*{Risk factors of hypotension.}

Age: post praidal and orthostatic hypotension occurs in older adults while neutrally medicated hypotension affects children and younger adults.

Medication; eg diuretics, antihypertensive.
Certain diseases e.g heart disorders and also Parkinson's disease.

\section*{Diagnosis of hypotension.}

Through monitoring of vital signs i.e BP
Through signs and symptoms.
Through blood tests i.e low HB,hypoglycaemia.
Through EEG shows irregulativities in heart rhythm.

\section*{Lifestyles and home remedies.}
- Advice people to take more water and less alcohol because alcohol stimulate diuretics to slow, take it easy when you move from a prone or sitting up position from standing position, before getting out of bed in the morning breathe deeply for a few minutes and slowly sit down before standing.
- Sleeping with your head slightly elevated.

\section*{NOTES UNDER CCF}

Two group indicators of heart diseases ccf.

\section*{1. Hemodynamic indicators.}

There is elevated nventricular and diastolic pressures
Elerated systematic and pulmonary pressure and decreased cardiac output.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_16_bdcdc2df5e4eaba3f3f5g-34.jpg?height=117&width=424&top_left_y=683&top_left_x=243)

Pulmonary -Lungs.

\section*{2. Clinical indicators}

\section*{Activated compensatory mechanism.}

In sympathetic system, there is increased heart rte and breath sounds.

In kidneys-there is fluid retention and peripheral vasoconstriction.
- Stretching of cardiac muscles and dilatation to increase the cardiac volume.
- There is myocardial hypertrophy (enlargement)
- There is accumulation of extracellular fluid which leads to oedema and there is impaired organ perfusion.

\section*{SHOCK.}

This is serious life threatening medical condition where insufficient blood flow reaches the body issues.

As the blood carries nutrients and oxygen around the body, reduced blood flow hinders the delivery of these components to the tissues and can support the tissues from functioning properly.

\section*{Stages of shock (ICPR)}

\section*{1. Initial stage.}

The hypoperfusional stage causes hypoxia leaching to the, mitochondria being unable to produce ATP and due to lack of oxygen the cell membrane becomes damaged and becomes leaky to extracellular fluid.

Celle will therefore perform anaerobic respiration therefore build up of lactic and phyric acid leading to systemic acidosis. The process of removing the compounds (lactic and pyruvic acid) by the liver requires oxygen which absent.

\section*{2. Compensatory stage.}

This is characterized by the b0ody employing physiological mechanism including hormonal and biochemical mechanisms in an attempt to reverse the condition. As a result of acidosis there will be hyperventilation in order to get rid of the carbon dioxide. The boro-receptors in the arteries detect the hypotension thus adrehaline and noradrehaline which causes vasoconstriction on with a mild increase in heart rate resulting in an increase in BP antidiuretic hormone (ADH) or vasopressin is thefore released to conserve the fluid in the kidneys.

\section*{3. Progressive or decompensating stage.}

Here the compasatory mechanisms begin to fail and because or decreased perfusion in cells, sodium ions build up within the cells while $\mathrm{K}^{+}$leaks out. as anaerobic metabolism continue increasing the body's metabolic acidosis, there will be increased hydrostatic pressure and combined with histamine release there will be leakage of fluid and proteins into the surrounding tissues. As this fluid is lost, the blood concentration and viscosity is going to increase.

\section*{4. Refractory or irreversible stage.}

At this stage, the vital organs have failed and shock can no longer be reversed. Brain damage and cell death have occurred and death will occur imminently i.e. (death is unavoidable).

Types of shock
1. Hyporolaemic shock
2. Cardiac shock
3. Distributive shock
- Septic shock
- Anaphylactic shock
- Neurogenic shock
4. Obstructive shock.

\section*{1. Hyporolaemic shock.}

This is the most common type of shock and it's based on insufficient circulatory volume.

\section*{Causes}
- Bleeding (hemorrhage)
- Severe loss of fluid
- Severe burns.

\section*{2. Cardiogenic shock.}

It's caused by the failure of the heart to pump effectively.
It can be due to the damage of heart muscle most often from a myocardial infarction.

\section*{Other causes}
- Arrhythmias
- CCF
- Cardiomyopathy i.e affects muscles of the heart e.g pericarditis and endocarditis.
- Cardiac valve problems.

\section*{3. Distributive shock}

It is same as hyporoelemic shack but here thre is an insufficient intravascular volume of blood.

\section*{TYPE}
(a) Septic shock

This is caused by an overwhelming infection leading to vasodilatation e.g gram negative bacteria e.g neiseria gonococci .E. coli,klebsiella.

The micro-organisms releases an endotoxin which causes adverse biochemical immunological and occasionally neurologically effects which are hamful to the body same appliy to the gram positive cocci also produce same exotoxins.
(b) Anaphylactic shock.

Cuased by severe analhylactic reaction to an allergen , antigen,drug or foreign protein causing the release of histamine which causes widespread vasodilation.
(c) Neurogenic shock.

It is the rarest form of shock.
It is caused by trauma to the spinal cord resulting in sudden loss of autonomic and motor reflexes below the injury level.

\section*{4. Obstructive shock}

Here the flow of blood is obstructed which impedes (prevents0 circulation and can result in circulatory arrest.
(1) Cardiac temponade

In which fluid in the pericardium prevents inflow of blood into the heart. i.e fluid in the pericardium causes pressure on the blood vessel.
(2). Constructive pericarditis.

This is whereby the pericardium shrinks and hardens thus prevents inflow of blood.

\section*{3. Tension pneumothorax.}

Through increased intrathoracic Pulmonary pressure blood flow to the heart is prevented.

\section*{4. Pulmonary embolism.}

An Emboli, thrombus prevents blood flow from lungs to the heart causing shock.

\section*{Signs and symptoms of hyporolamic shock.}
- Anxiety
- Restlessness
- Altered mental state due to decreased cerebral perfusion and hypoxia.
- Hypotension because of decreased circulatory volume.
- A rapid weak thread pulse due to decreased flow of blood combined with tachycardia.
- Cool clumpsy skin due to vasoconstriction
- Rapid and shallow respiration due to stimulation of sympathetic nervous system because of acidosis.
- Hypothermia due to decreased perfusion and evaporation of sweat.
- Thirst and dry moth due toi fluid depletion.
- Cold and mottled skin (cutis mormorata) especially in extremities due to insufficient perfusion of the skin.
- Distracted look in the eyes or staring into space often with dilated pupil.

\section*{Cardiogenic shock.}

\section*{Signs and symptoms.}

Signs are similar to hyporolemic shock but in addition there is distended jugular vein due to increase jugular venous pressure.
- There is also absent pulse due to tachy arrhythmias.

\section*{Obstructive shock.}

\section*{Signs and symptoms.}
- Also similar as hypovolemic shock
- Also there are distended jugular veins.

\section*{Distributive shock}

\section*{Signs and symptoms.}

Septic shock- its signs are similar with hyporalemic shock. But there is pyrexia or hyperthermia du to overwhelming bacterial infection.

\section*{Neurogenic s/s}

Similar to hypovolemic shock expect in skin characteristics.

\section*{Anaphylactic shock}

\section*{Signs and symptoms.}
- There are skin eruptions
- Localized oedema especially around the face.
- Weak and rapid pulse
- Breathless and cough due to the narrowing of the airways.

\section*{Management of hyporolamic shock.}
- A, B, C airway, breathing and circulation, resuscitation
- Hydrate (fluid and electrolytes conservation)
- Blood transfusion
- Inotropic agents' e.g. dopamine, increase force and pressure of the heartbeat.
- Treat the underlying shock.

\section*{Management of cardiogenic shock}
- Fluid replacement
- Keep pt warm (use blankets)
- Antidiuretics
- Use of antishock trouser -they compress the legs and concentrate blood into vital organs

\section*{Management of Distributive shock.}

\section*{Septic}
- Use of strong parental antibiotics to treat the bacterial infection.
- Supportive care e.g. use of oxygen, re-assure.

\section*{Anaphylactic mx}
- Put the pt in trendel burg position i.e. legs up and head lower than the limbs.
- Use of antidiuretics etc.

\section*{Obstructive shock mx}
- Remove the obstruction first.

\section*{Pneumothorax and haemothorax}

In these cases insert an underwater seal drainage.

\section*{Pulmonary emboli mx}
- Thrombolitics drugs.
- Embolectomy

\section*{Cardiac temponade.}

Is treated by draining fluid form the pericardial space by use of procedure called periocadiocentesis.

\section*{CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE.}
- Also called coronary heart disease or coronary atheroschlerosis.
- It is the progressive narrowing of the artery that nourishes the heart muscles.
- Often they are no symptoms but if one or more arteries become severly narrowed Angina pectoris may develop during exercise, stress or other times when the heart muscle is not getting enough blood.

\section*{Cause}

The narrowing is due to the build up of fatty pledge i.e. atheroschlerosis along the artery
walls.
These deposits are composed of cholestral and othe lipids.

\section*{Treatment}
- Give beta - blocking drugs e.g. nitrates which act by blocking the effect of sympathetic nervous system on the heart thus slowing the heart rate.
- Give calcium channel blocker by reducing the amount of calcium that enters the muscles in the coronary artery walls spasms can be prevented.
- Surgery called angioplasty and coronary bypass i.e. removing and replacement of the clogged coromy artery.
- Note: To include the nursing care management of coronary heart disease.

\section*{BLOOD DISORDERS}
- General objective
- By the end of the session the student will be able to apply knowledge , skills and attitudes to promote health , prevent illness , diagnose , manage and coordinate rehabilitation of infants and adults suffering from common blood conditions

\section*{Contents}
1. Red cell diseases
- Anaemia
- Sickle cell disease
2. White blood cell diseases
: Leukemia
* Agranulocytosis

Heamorrhagic diseases
- Purpura

Thrombocytopenia
Heamophilia
- Hypoprothrombinaemia
- Polycthaemia
- Disseminated intravascular coagulation

Objective
- By the end of the session the students will be able to explain the characteristics of common blood diseases and provide relevant nursing care.

\section*{Anaemia}
- Anaemia is a deficiency in the number or quality of red blood cells. The red blood cells carry oxygen around the body, using a particular protein called haemoglobin. Anaemia means that either the level of red blood cells or the level of haemoglobin is lower than normal.These cells are the main transporters of oxygen to the organs in the body. Symptoms like fatigue - occur because the organs aren't getting enough oxygen.

\section*{Main causes of anaemia}
- Dietary deficiency - lack of iron, vitamin B12 or folic acid in the diet.
- Malabsorption - where the body is not able to use the nutrients in the diet, caused by conditions such as coeliac disease.
- Inherited disorders - such as thalassaemia or sickle cell disease.
- Autoimmune disorders - such as autoimmune haemolytic anaemia, where the immune cells attack the red blood cells and decrease their life span.
- Chronic diseases - such as rheumatoid arthritis and tuberculosis.

\section*{Main causes of anaemia}
- Hormone disorders - such as hypothyroidism.
- Bone marrow disorders - such as cancer or infection.
- Blood loss - due to trauma, surgery, cancer, peptic ulcer, heavy menstruation, bowel cancer or frequent blood donations.
${ }^{-}$Drugs and medications - including alcohol, antibiotics, anti-inflammatory drugs or anticoagulant medications.
- Infection - such as malaria and septicaemia, which reduce the life span of red blood cells.

\section*{Signs and symptoms of anaemia}
- Pale skin
- Fatigue
- Weakness
- Tiring easily
- Breathlessness
- Frequent headaches
- Palpitations
- Becoming irritated easily

Concentration difficulties
- Cracked or reddened tongue
- Loss of appetite
- Strange food cravings

\section*{Diagnosis of anaemia}
- Medical history - of any chronic illnesses and regular medications
- Physical examination
- Blood tests - complete blood count and blood iron levels, vitamin B12, folate and kidney function tests
- Urine tests - for detecting blood in the urine
- Gastroscopy or colonoscopy
- Bone marrow biopsy
- Faecal occult blood test - examining a stool sample for the presence of blood.

\section*{Treatment of anaemia}
- Vitamin and mineral supplements - in the case of deficiency.
- Iron injections - if the person is very low on iron.
- Vitamin B12 (by injection) - required for pernicious anaemia.
- Antibiotics - if infection is the cause.
- Altering the dose or regimen of regular medications
- such as anti-inflammatory drugs, if necessary.
- Blood transfusions - if required.
- Oxygen therapy - if required.
- Surgery to prevent abnormal bleeding - such as heavy menstruation.
- Surgery to remove the spleen (splenectomy) - in cases of severe haemolytic anaemia

\section*{Anaemia caused by blood loss}

Red blood cells can be lost through bleeding, which can occur slowly over a long period of time, and can often go undetected. This kind of chronic bleeding commonly results from the following:
- Gastrointestinal conditions such as ulcers, haemorrhoids(piles), gastritis (inflammation of the stomach) and cancer of the bowel.
- use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) such as asprin, diclofenac or ibuprofen
- menstruation and childbirth in women, especially if menstrual bleeding is excessive and if there are multiple pregnancies

\section*{Anaemia caused by decreased or faulty red}
blood cell production
The body may produce too few blood cells or the blood cells may not work properly. In either case, anaemia can result. Red blood cells may be faulty or decreased due to abnormal red blood cells or a lack of minerals and vitamins needed for red blood cells to work properly. Conditions associated with these causes of anaemia include the following:
- Sickle cell anaemia
- Thalassaemia
- Iron deficiency anaemia
- Vitamin deficiency
- Bone marrow and stem cell problems
- Other health conditions

IRON DEFFICIENCY ANAEMIA
Iron deficiency anemia occurs when the body doesn't have enough iron.
${ }^{-}$Iron is important because it helps one to get enough oxygen throughout the body. The body uses iron to make heamoblobin. Hemoglobin is a part of the red blood cells. Hemoglobin carries oxygen through the body. If one does not have enough iron, the body makes fewer and smaller red blood cells. Then the body has less hemoglobin, and one cannot get enough oxygen.
- Iron deficiency anaemia occurs because of a lack of the mineral iron in the body. Bone marrow, found in the centre of the long bones in the body, needs iron to make haemoglobin, the part of the red blood cell that transports oxygen to the body's organs. Without adequate iron, the body cannot produce enough haemoglobin for red blood cells.

\section*{Causes of IDA}
- Heavy menstrual bleeding.
- One not getting enough iron in food. This can happen in people who need a lot of iron, such as small children, teens and pregnant women.
- Bleeding inside the body. This bleeding may be caused by problems such as ulcers, heamorrhoids or cancer. This bleeding can also happen with regular asprin use. Bleeding inside the body is the most common cause of iron deficiency anemia in men and in women after menopause.
- If one cannot absorb iron well in the body. This problem may occur if there is celiac or if have had part of the stomach or small intestine removed
- An iron-poor diet, especially in infants, children, teens and vegetarians

\section*{Causes of IDA}
- The metabolic demands of pregnancy and breastfeeding that deplete a woman's iron stores
- Menstruation
- Frequent blood donation
- Endurance training
- Conditions affecting the bowel, such as Chron's disease or surgical removal of part of the stomach or small intestine
- Certain drugs, foods, and caffeinated drinks

\section*{Diagnosis}
- Take medical history
- Perform a physical examination
- Order blood tests: Blood tests will not only confirm the diagnosis of anaemia but also help point to the underlying condition. Blood tests may include the following:
- Full Blood Count (FBC), which determines the number, size, volume, and haemoglobin content of red blood cells
- Blood iron level and the serum ferritin level, the best indicators of the body's total iron stores, although it can sometimes vary due to other situations
A blood film where various measurements and features of the red blood cell can be seen

Levels of vitamin B-12 and folate (folic acid). A red blood cell folate is done which is more accurate in most cases
Special blood tests to detect rare causes of anaemia, such as an immune attack on the red blood cells, red blood cell fragility, and defects of enzymes, haemoglobin and clotting
- For suspected haemolytic anaemia, where the lifespan of a red blood cell is shortened, tests are used to identify the breakdown products of red blood cells in the blood and urine Additional blood tests can be done to determine possible causes including the kidneys, liver, thyroid gland and other hormone tests

\section*{Signs and symptoms of IDA}
* Feeling weak and tire out more easily.
Feeling dizzy.
Having headaches
:Looking very pale.
Feeling short of breath.
Having trouble concentrating
Cold hands and feet Irritability
palpitations
Burning sensation in the tongue
\& Dryness in the mouth and throat

Sores at the corners of the mouth

Altered sense of touch
* Brittle hair
* Difficulty swallowing
* Inflammation or soreness of the tongue
- Unusual cravings for non-nutritive substances, such as ice, dirt or starch
-Poor appetite, especially in infants and children
- An uncomfortable tingling or crawling feeling in the legs (restless legs syndrome)
${ }^{-}$Brittle, spoon-shaped nails with vertical stripes and a tendency to fray

Treatment of iron deficiency anaemia
1. Iron supplements that contain the ferrous form of iron are recommended which the body can absorb easily. If one uses iron supplements, remember the following cautions:
- Excess iron intake can be harmful. Symptoms of iron overload include fatigue, vomiting, diarrhoea, headaches, irritability and joint problems

\section*{IDA treatment}

Iron supplements - Iron poisoning is a major cause of accidental poisoning in young children. Eating even a few tablets can prove fatal in a matter of hours. Symptoms of poisoning in a child include dizziness, confusion, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea. Seek medical help immediately
2. Good dietary sources of iron include red meat, beans, egg yolk, whole-grain products, nuts and seafood
- 3.In rare cases, the doctor may prescribe iron injections or recommend to have iron intravenously .
- 4.In extremely rare cases of life-threatening irondeficiency anaemia, treatment may involve blood transfusion.

\section*{For vitamin B-12 and folate deficiency anaemia}
- The treatment depends on the cause of the deficiency. If the body stores are depleted of vitamin B12, the doctor is most likely to prescribe vitamin B12 injections. If the vitamin B12 levels are borderline low then the doctor may try oral tablets in a high dose first to see the response
- Prevention of IDA
${ }^{-}$by eating a well-balanced diet that includes good sources of iron, vitamin B12 and folate.
- If you are a vegetarian, talk to your doctor or a nutritionist about your diet and any possible need for supplements

Fraskertheado@fudDAnutritionist if you should take vitamin C. Vitamin C makes the stomach more acidic and can improve the absorption of iron in your diet
- Decrease the consumption of caffeinated products and tea. These substances can decrease iron absorption. Other offenders include the preservative EDTA, fibre, large amounts of calcium, and the phytates found in some vegetables
- Select iron-fortified cereals and breads
- Carefully follow safety guidelines if your occupation involves work with lead-containing materials such as batteries, petroleum, and paint
- Ask the doctor or local public-health authorities about lead-testing the kitchenware you use for food or beverage preparation

Pernicious Anemia and Vitamin B-12 Deficiency Pernicious anemia is a disease where large, immature, nucleated cells (megaloblasts, which are forerunners of red blood cells) circulate in the blood, and do not function as blood cells; it is a disease caused by impaired uptake of vitamin B-12 due to the lack of intrinsic factor (IF) in the gastric mucosa. It was termed "pernicious" because before it was learned that vitamin B-12 could treat the anemia, most people that developed the disease died from it.

\section*{Causes of pernicious anaemia}
- Pernicious anemia is due to an inability to absorb vitamin B-12 (also known as cobalamin or Cbl ) from the gastrointestinal tract. Humans get vitamin B-12 from animal products; both meat and dairy products are dietary sources of vitamin B-12. The body is able to store vitamin B12 for a long time, so inadequate dietary intake must persist for years before a true deficiency of vitamin B-12 is reached
- Autoimmune disease. It is believed that the decreased absorption of vitamin B-12 from the gastrointestinal tract in pernicious anemia results from the presence of an autoantibody against intrinsic factor (IF), a protein made in the stomach that is necessary for the absorption of vitamin B-12. Normally, vitamin B-12 binds to intrinsic factor in the stomach, and this facilitates its absorption by the small intestine further along in the digestive process. Along with the autoimmune process that attacks the IF protein and lowers IF levels in stomach secretions, another autoimmune reaction against the stomach lining cells also occurs, resulting in a form of inflammation known as chronic atrophic gastritis.

Megaloblastic anemia
Megaloblastic anemia refers to an abnormally large type of red blood cell (megaloblast). Megaloblasts are produced in the bone marrow when vitamin B-12 or folic acid levels are low.
- Causes
- Megaloblastic anemia can also be caused by other disease of the bone marrow and can be a side effect of some cancer chemotherapy drugs.

Vitamin B-12 deficiency anemia
- Causes
- Causes of vitamin B-12 deficiency include surgical removal of the stomach or a portion of the stomach (total or partial gastrectomy), other gastrointestinal diseases such as celiac disease or crohn's disease, infections of the gastrointestinal tract, and poor nutrition.

\section*{Diagnosis}
- Signs and symptoms
- A full heamogram
- Blood vitamin B-12 level measurements
- Tests for the presence of auto antibodies to intrinsic factor or stomach lining cells
- Blood levels of iron and iron-binding capacity
- Folate levels (which are often reduced when vitamin B-12 levels are low)
- Blood levels of methylmalonic acid or homocytes both of which may be sensitive indicators of vitamin B-12 deficiency
- The Schilling test, a measure of how well the body can absorb vitamin B-12, is less commonly used today than in the past.
- Finally, bone marrow aspirate or biopsy may be recommended in some cases if bone marrow disorders are suspected

Treatment for pernicious anemia and vitamin B12 deficiency
- If a condition other than pernicious anemia is responsible for vitamin B-12 deficiency, treatment must also be directed at the underlying condition
- Vitamin B-12 is typically given as an intramuscular injection .An injection of 1 mg of vitamin B-12 is generally given every day for one week, followed by 1 mg every week for four weeks and then 1 mg every month thereafter

\section*{Prevention}
- The autoimmune process that causes pernicious anemia cannot be prevented. Vitamin B-12 deficiency that is caused by conditions such as other gastrointestinal diseases and gastrointestinal surgery is preventable only to the extent that these causative conditions themselves are preventable.
- Vitamin B-12 is derived from animal (for example, meat, fish, poultry, milk) sources, but vitamin B-12 deficiency in vegetarians or vegans can be prevented by the use of oral vitamin B-12 supplements. An oral dose of $100-200 \mathrm{mg}$ taken weekly is sufficient. Pregnant and nursing women who are vegetarians should take a vit B-12 supplement and inform their doctors they are vegetarians .

\section*{Sickle Cell Anemia}
- Sickle cell anemia (sickle cell disease) is a disorder of the blood caused by an inherited abnormal heamoglobin .The abnormal hemoglobin causes distorted (sickled) red blood cells. The sickled red blood cells are fragile and prone to rupture. When the number of red blood cells decreases from rupture (hemolysis), anaemia is the result. The irregular sickled cells can also block blood vessels causing tissue and organ damage and pain.

\section*{How sickle cell anemia is inherited}
- Sickle cell anemia is inherited as an autosomal (meaning that the gene is not linked to a sex chromosome) recessive condition whereas sickle cell trait is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. This means that the gene can be passed on from a parent carrying it to male and female children. In order for sickle cell anemia to occur, a sickle cell gene must be inherited from both the mother and the father, so that the child has two sickle cell genes.

\section*{Sickle cell}
${ }^{-}$The inheritance of just one sickle gene is called sickle cell trait or the "carrier" state. Sickle cell trait does not cause sickle cell anemia. Persons with sickle cell trait usually do not have many symptoms of disease and have normal hospitalization rates and life expectancies.
- When two carriers of sickle cell trait mate, their offspring have a one in four chance of having sickle cell anemia.
- The sickled red blood cells are prone to breakage (rupture) which causes a much shorter life span of these cells.
- Typically, the site of red blood cell production (bone marrow) works overtime to produce these cells rapidly, attempting to compensate for their destruction in the circulation. Occasionally, the bone marrow suddenly stops producing the red blood cells which causes a very severe form of anemia (aplastic crises)

\section*{Conditions that promote the sickling (distortion) \\ of the red blood cells in sickle cell anemia}
- Conditions which are associated with low oxygen levels, increased acidity, or low volume (dehydration)
of the blood. These conditions can occur as a result of injury to the body's tissues, dehydrating states, or anesthesia.
- Even certain organs are predisposed to lower oxygen levels or acidity, such as when blood moves slowly through the spleen, liver, or kidney. Also, organs with particularly high metabolism rates (such as the brain, muscles, and the placenta in a pregnant woman with sickle cell anemia) promote sickling by extracting more oxygen from the blood.

Sickle cell anemia diagnosis
Sickle prep_Testing is typically performed on a smear of blood using a special low-oxygen preparation
- Prenatal diagnosis (before birth) of sickle cell anemia is possible using amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling. The sample obtained is then tested for DNA analysis of the fetal cells.
- The hemoglobin electrophoresis test precisely identifies the hemoglobins in the blood by separating them

Symptoms of sickle cell anemia
- Fatigue and Anemia
- Pain Crises-Pain crises in persons with sickle cell anemia are intermittent painful episodes that are the result of inadequate blood supply to body tissues. The impaired circulation is caused by the blockage of various blood vessels from the sickling of red blood cells. The sickled red blood cells slow or completely impede the normal flow of blood through the tissues
- Dactylitis (swelling and inflammation of the hands and/or feet) and arthritis.Dactylitis is caused by injury to the bones of the affected digits by repeated episodes of inadequate blood circulation
- Bacterial Infections

\section*{s/s of sca}
- Splenic Sequestration (sudden pooling of blood in the spleen) and Liver Congestion
${ }^{-}$Lung and Heart Injury
${ }^{-}$Leg Ulcers
- Aseptic necrosis and Bone Infarcts (death of portions of bone)
- Eye Damage

Treatments of sickle cell anemia according to which of the individual features of the illness are present. In general treatment is directed at the management and prevention of the acute manifestations as well as therapies directed toward blocking the red blood cells from stacking together.
- Fatigue and Anemia

The sickled red blood cells are prone to breakage (rupture) which causes a much shorter life span of these cells . Occasionally, there can be a severe drop in hemoglobin requiring a blood transfussion to correct the anemia .

\section*{Pain Crises}
- Pain crises in persons with sickle cell anemia are intermittent painful episodes that are the result of inadequate blood supply to body tissues. The impaired circulation is caused by the blockage of various blood vessels from the sickling of red blood cells. The sickled red blood cells slow or completely impede the normal flow of blood through the tissues
- A pain crisis can be promoted by preceding dehydration, infection, injury, cold exposure, emotional stress or strenuous exercise. As a prevention measure, persons with sickle cell anemia should avoid extremes of heat and cold.

\section*{Pain crises}
- The pain typically is throbbing and can change its location from one body area to another. Bone is frequently affected. Pain crises require medications for pain and increased fluid intake.
- Hydroxyurea is a medication that is currently being used in adults and children with severe pain from sickle cell anemia. This drug acts by increasing the amount of fetal hemoglobin in the blood (this form of hemoglobin is resistant to sickling of the red blood cells). Hydroxyurea can be toxic to the bone marrow.

Daftylitisand Arthrifis dactylitis and arthritis can be reduced by anti-inflammation medications, such as iboprofen and asprin.
- Bacterial Infection
- Lung infection (pneumonia) is extremely common in children with sickle cell anemia. Vaccination against pneumococcal infection is generally recommended. Early detection and antibiotic treatment are the keys to minimizing complications.
- The liver is often firm and can become tender. Impaired liver function can result in jaundice. The gallbladder, which drains bile from the liver, can fill with gall stones .Inflammation of the gallbladder (cholecystitis) can cause nausea and vomiting and require its removal.

\section*{Splenic Sequestration and Liver Congestion}
- The spleen is commonly enlarged (splenomegaly) in younger children with sickle cell anemia. As the spleen is repeatedly injured by damage from impaired blood supply, it gradually shrinks with scarring. Impairment of the normal function of the spleen increases the tendency to become infected with bacteria. Sudden pooling of blood in the spleen (splenic sequestration) can result in a very severe anemia and death. These patients can develop shock and lose consciousness. Transfusion of blood and fluids can be critical if this occurs

Luke and Heart Iniury infarcts can lead to scarring of the lungs of children with sickle cell anemia by the time they reach adolescence'
- The heart is frequently enlarged in children with sickle cell anemia. Rapid heart rates and murmurs are common. The heart muscle can also be injured by infarcts and iron depositing in the muscle as it leaks from the ruptured red blood cells.
${ }^{-}$Leg Ulcers- This seems to be a result of the stagnant blood flow caused by the sickled red blood cells. Injury to the skin of the legs or ankles can promote skin damage and ulceration.
Oral antibiotics and topical creams are often used

\section*{Aseptic Necrosis and Bone Infarcts}

Inadequate circulation of the blood, which is characteristic of sickle cell anemia, also causes areas of death of bone tissue (bone infarction). Aseptic necrosis, or localized bone death, is a result of inadequate oxygen supply to the bone. Aseptic necrosis is also referred to as osteonecrosis.
- most common are the bones of the thighs, legs, and arms. Pain, tenderness, and disability frequently are signs of aseptic necrosis. Painful bone infarcts can be relieved by rest and pain medications.
- Aseptic necrosis can permanently damage large joints (such as the hips or shoulders), worsening of the condition can be prevented by avoiding weight bearing.

Eve Damage
Impairment of the circulation from the sickling of red blood cells results in damage to the retina (retinopathy). The result can be partial or complete blindness.
- Bleeding can also occur within the eye (retinal hemorrhage) and retinal detachment can leading to blindness.
- Preventative measures, such as laser treatments, can be used if bleeding into the eye and retinal detachment are detected early.

Qteake Firpightypones from osteoporosis, kidney damage and infection, and nervous system damage.
Osteoporosis can lead to severe pain in the back and deformity from collapse of the bony building blocks (vertebrae) of the spine. Kidney damage can lead to poor kidney function with a resulting imbalance of blood sodium and acidity.
Poor blood circulation in the brain can cause stroke,convulsions, and coma,-Transfusion of blood and fluids intravenously can be critical. Medications to reduce the chance of seizures are sometimes added.
Pripiasm an abnormally persistent erection of the penis in the absence of sexual desire, can occur in persons with sickle cell anemia. Priapism can lead to impotence

\section*{Prognosis}

The life expectancy of persons with sickle cell anemia is reduced. Some patients, however, can remain without symptoms for years, while others do not survive infancy or early childhood.
- Most patients suffer intermittent pain crises, fatigue, bacterial infections, and progressive tissue and organ damage. Impaired growth and development is the end result of the physical and emotional trauma that is endured by children with sickle cell anemia.
- Causes of death include bacterial infection (the most common cause), stroke or bleeding into the brain, and kidney, heart, or liver failure.
- Leukemia is cancers바te WAOd cells
- The bone marrow starts to make a lot of abnormal white blood cells.
- They don't do the work of normal white blood cells, they grow faster than normal cells, and they don't stop growing when they should.
- Over time, leukemia cells can crowd out the normal blood cells. This can lead to serious problems such as anaemia, bleeding, and infections. Leukemia cells can also spread to the lymph nodes or other organs and cause swelling or pain.

\section*{Types according to progression}
- It may be acute or chronic. Acute leukemia gets worse very fast and may make you feel sick right away. Chronic leukemia gets worse slowly and may not cause symptoms for years.
- It may be lymphocytic or myelogenous.Lymphocytic (or lymphoblastic) leukemia affects the lymphocytes. Myelogenous leukemia affects the myelocytes.
- The four main types of leukemia are:
- Acute lymphoblastic leukemia, or ALL.
- Acute myelogenous leukemia, or AML.
- Chronic lymphocytic leukemia, or CLL.
- Chronic myelogenous leukemia, or CML

Epidemiology
- In adults, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) are the most common leukemias. In children, the most common leukemia is acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Childhood leukemias also include acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and other myeloid leukemias, such as chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML).

Causes leukemia
- Idiopathic
- Risk factors
$\Rightarrow$ Radiation : -Atomic bomb explosions, radiotherapy,diagnostic x-rays
- Benzene-widely used in the chemical industry.

It's also found in cigarette smoke and gasoline.
- Chemotherapy
- Down syndrome
- Myelodysplastic syndrome and certain other blood disorders
- Human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I)
$\Rightarrow$ Family history

\section*{Symptoms Headaches}

Bruising or bleeding easily
* Bone or joint pains.
* A swollen or painful or discomfort in the abdomen from an enlarged spleen
Swollen lymph nodes in the armpit, neck, or groin that usually don't hurt.
- Getting Frequent infections

Feeling very tired or weak.
- Weight loss for no known reason
- Anaemia and bleeding.
- Night sweats, and unexplained fevers.

\section*{Symptoms}
- Acute leukemia: The leukemia cells can't do any of the work of normal white blood cells. The number of leukemia cells increases rapidly. Acute leukemia usually worsens quickly.
- Chronic leukemia: Early in the disease, the leukemia cells can still do some of the work of normal white blood cells. People may not have any symptoms at first. Doctors often find chronic leukemia during a routine checkup - before there are any symptoms.

\section*{Diagnosis}

Through history taking
- Physical exam
${ }^{-}$high level of white blood cells and low levels of other types of blood cells.
- Bone marrow biopsy /Bone marrow aspiration
- Cytogenetics-chromosomes of cells from samples of blood, bone marrow, or lymph nodes.
- Chest X-rays-show swollen lymph nodes

\section*{Treatment}

The options are watchful waiting, chemotherapy, targeted therapy, biological therapy, radiation therapy, and stem cell transplant or surgery.
- Biological therapy is the use of special medicines that improve the body's natural defenses against cancer.
- Side effects of chemotherapy
- Destroy blood cells, alopecia, GIT disturbance,can cause infertility.

\section*{THROMBOCYTOPENIA}

Thrombocytopenia is a lower than normal number of platelets in the blood.
- Platelet counts less than 150,000 are termed thrombocytopenia. Platelet counts greater that 450,000 are called thrombocytosis.
- Causes of thrombocytopenia
* Decreased platelet production,
*Increased platelet destruction or consumption, or
Increased splenic sequestration

Decreased platelet production to a bone marrow problem (agranulocytosis)
- Viral infections affecting the marrow for example
- Parvovirus,rubella, mumps,varicella(chickenpox), hepatitis c, epstein -barrvirus and HIV
- chemotherapy

Leukemia or cancers of the lymph nodes (lymphoma)
- Long term alcohol can cause direct toxicity of the bone marrow.
- Deficiency of vitamin B12 and folic acid

\section*{Increased platelet destruction or consumption}
- They can be divided into immune related and non-immune related causes
*Drug-induced thrombocytopenia eg sulfonamide, carbamazepine, quinine , tylenol and rifambicin, heparin
*Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura
*Rheumatologic condition, such as systemic lupus erythematosus
*Transfusion of blood, DIC, vasculatis, sepsis
*Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura
*Artificial heart valves
spenic sequestration eg cirrhosis, hepatitis, blood cancer
- Dilutional thrombocytopenia can result from severe bleeding and transfusion of several units transfused red blood cells in a short time.
${ }^{-}$Pseudothrombocytopenia due to clumping of platelets together

Symptoms of thrombocytopenia
- may have no symptoms, especially if mild
- Severe manifest as increase bleeding when a person is cut or injured or increased bleeding during menses
- Spontaneous bleeding (the inner lining of the oral cavity, gastrointestinal tract, or the nasal cavity)
- Purpura and Petechiae

Diagnosis of thrombocytopenia
- Full blood count
- Physical examination and medical history of the patient eg cancers, leukemia, family history etc
Treatment of thrombocytopenia
- largely dependent upon the cause and the severity of the condition.
- If auto-immune thrombocytopenia or ITP, steroids can be used to weaken the immune system in order to impair the attack on platelets
- In more severe cases, intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) or antibodies may also be given to slow down the immune process
- Splenectomy

Complications of thrombocytopenia
- hemorrhage and major blood loss.
- heparin induced may cause thrombosis
