\section*{Guidelines For Proper Storage:}
- Security
- Location
- Space
- Cleanliness
- Temperature regulation (cold chain, air conditioning)

\section*{IMPORTANCE OF PROPER STORAGE}
${ }^{-}$Avoids stockout/ spoilage
${ }^{\circ}$ Contraceptives issued are safe and of high quality
${ }^{\circ}$ Reduced wastage
${ }^{\circ}$ Monitors shelf life and product quality
${ }^{-}$Reduce loss of funds
${ }^{-}$Easier to select and distribute commodity
${ }^{\circ}$ Ensure disposal of expired contraceptives

\section*{Proper storage guidelines}
${ }^{\circ}$ Clean and disinfect store room regularly
${ }^{-}$Store contraceptives in a dry, well lit and well ventilated room out of direct sunlight
- Secure storeroom from water penetration
${ }^{\circ}$ Ensure fire safety equipment is available and accessible
${ }^{-}$Store cartons of condoms away from electric motors and fluorescent light

\section*{CT'D}
${ }^{\circ}$ Arrange cartons so that identification labels, expiry dates and manufacturing dates are visible
${ }^{-}$Store contraceptives in a manner accessible for FEFO ,counting and general management
${ }^{-}$Store contraceptives separately away from insecticides, chemicals, old files, office supplies and other materials
${ }^{-}$Separate and dispose off damaged or expired contraceptives without delay

\section*{First to Expire, First Out (FEFO)}
Ensures that the quality of contraceptives distributed to clients is maintained and that the contraceptives have not expired on the shelf.
Cartons with earliest expiry dates should be distributed first, cartons with the later expiry dates should not be distributed until all supplies dated earlier have been exhausted
Ensure that the cartons are clearly marked with their expiry dates in large, easy to read numbers

\section*{FIFO IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE: (FEF0)}
${ }^{\circ}$ It avoids wastage
${ }^{\circ}$ It is easier to issue contraceptives because oldest products are issued first
${ }^{\circ}$ It can create some space because expired stock gets moved out of the inventory
${ }^{\circ}$ It allows one to know when stock is in excess so that extra stock can be moved more easily to another facility where it is needed.

\section*{SHELF LIFE AND FACTORS THAT AFFECT QUALITY}

\section*{Introduction}
${ }^{-}$Shelf life is the length of time the contraceptive may be stored without affecting its usability, safety and potency
${ }^{\circ}$ If proper storage guidelines are not followed the shelf life of the contraceptive will be shortened

\section*{FACTORS THAT AFFECT SHELF LIFE}
${ }^{\circ}$ Rain
${ }^{\circ}$ Heat
${ }^{\circ}$ Sunlight
${ }^{\circ}$ Chemical damage
${ }^{\circ}$ Inadequate ventilation
${ }^{\circ}$ Fluorescent light

QUALITY ASSURANCE

${ }^{\circ}$ Colour
${ }^{-}$Number of pills
${ }^{\circ}$ Crushed pills
