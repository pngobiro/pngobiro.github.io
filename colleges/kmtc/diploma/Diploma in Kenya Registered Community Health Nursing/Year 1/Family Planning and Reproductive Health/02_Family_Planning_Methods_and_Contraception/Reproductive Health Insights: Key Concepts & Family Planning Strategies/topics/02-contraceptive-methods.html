                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Copper based devices:</strong> Release copper and work mainly by preventing fertilization.</li>
                            <li><strong>Hormone releasing devices:</strong> Release a progestin over a period of five years.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Effectiveness</h4>
                        <p>IUCD is 99% effective if used correctly and consistently.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Advantages of IUCDs</h4>

                            <li>Provides immediate protection after insertion</li>
                            <li>Long acting protection (copper based 12 years, hormone releasing 5 years)</li>
                            <li>Immediate return to fertility upon removal of the device</li>
                            <li>Copper IUCD is effective as an emergency contraceptive if inserted within 5 days after unprotected sex.</li>
