                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Sexual dysfunction is a problem that can happen during any phase of the sexual response cycle. It prevents you from experiencing satisfaction from sexual activity. The sexual response cycle traditionally includes excitement, plateau, orgasm and resolution.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Types of sexual dysfunction</h3>
                        <p>Sexual dysfunction generally is classified into four categories:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Desire disorders:</strong> lack of sexual desire or interest in sex.</li>
                            <li><strong>Arousal disorders:</strong> inability to become physically aroused or excited during sexual activity.</li>
                            <li><strong>Orgasm disorders:</strong> delay or absence of orgasm (climax).</li>
                            <li><strong>Pain disorders:</strong> pain during intercourse.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Who is affected by sexual dysfunction?</h3>
                        <p>Sexual dysfunction can affect any age, although it is more common in those over 40 because it's often related to a decline in health associated with aging.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">What are the symptoms of sexual dysfunction?</h3>

                            <li>Absent or delayed ejaculation despite enough sexual stimulation (retarded ejaculation).</li>
                            <li>Inability to control the timing of ejaculation (early, or premature, ejaculation).</li>

                            <li>Inadequate vaginal lubrication before and during intercourse.</li>
                            <li>Inability to relax the vaginal muscles enough to allow intercourse.</li>

                            <li><strong>Physical causes:</strong> Many physical and/or medical conditions can cause problems with sexual function. These conditions include diabetes, heart and vascular disease, neurological disorders, hormonal imbalances, chronic diseases such as kidney or liver failure, alcoholism and drug abuse. In addition, the side effects of some medications, including some antidepressant drugs, can affect sexual function.</li>
                            <li><strong>Psychological causes:</strong> These include work-related stress and anxiety, concern about sexual performance, marital or relationship problems, depression, feelings of guilt.</li>

                        <p>Infertility happens when a couple cannot conceive after having regular unprotected sex. It is often defined as not conceiving after 12 months of regular sexual intercourse without the use of birth control.</p>

                        <ul>

                            <li><strong>Secondary infertility</strong> is when they have previously conceived but are no longer able to conceive.</li>

                            <li><strong>Semen and sperm issues:</strong> Low sperm count, low sperm mobility, or abnormal sperm shape.</li>
                            <li><strong>Medical conditions:</strong> Testicular infection, cancer, or surgery.</li>
                            <li><strong>Overheated testicles:</strong> Caused by an undescended testicle, varicocele, use of saunas, or wearing tight clothes.</li>
                            <li><strong>Ejaculation disorders:</strong> Blocked ejaculatory ducts.</li>
                            <li><strong>Hormonal imbalance:</strong> Such as testosterone deficiency.</li>
                            <li><strong>Genetic factors:</strong> Conditions like Klinefelter's syndrome.</li>
                            <li><strong>Other factors:</strong> Mumps after puberty, hypospadias, cystic fibrosis, radiation therapy, certain medications (Sulfasalazine, anabolic steroids), illegal drugs, age (fertility falls after 40), exposure to chemicals, excess alcohol, obesity, and mental stress.</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Risk Factors:</strong> Age (ability to conceive falls around 32), smoking, alcohol, obesity, eating disorders, diet deficiencies, extreme exercise levels, STIs, exposure to chemicals, and mental stress.</li>
                            <li><strong>Medical Conditions:</strong> Ovulation disorders are the most common cause. Problems in the uterus or fallopian tubes can prevent the egg from traveling to the uterus. Previous sterilization can also be a factor.</li>
                            <li><strong>Medications and Drugs:</strong> Long-term use of NSAIDs, chemotherapy, radiation therapy near reproductive organs, and illegal drugs like marijuana or cocaine can affect fertility.</li>

                         <p>Sexual health is fundamental to the overall health and well-being of individuals, couples and families. It requires a positive and respectful approach to sexuality and sexual relationships, as well as the possibility of having pleasurable and safe sexual experiences, free of coercion, discrimination and violence.</p>
                         <h3 class="subsection-heading">Characteristics of a sexually healthy person</h3>
                         <p>A sexually healthy person understands that sexuality is a natural part of life, recognizes sexual rights, makes efforts to prevent unintended pregnancy and STIs, has access to sex education, can experience sexual pleasure, and can communicate openly about sexual health needs.</p>
                         <h3 class="subsection-heading">Importance of sexual health</h3>
                         <ol>
                            <li><strong>Education:</strong> Learning about risks, prevention, and consensual vs. non-consensual acts is crucial for making informed decisions.</li>
                            <li><strong>Sexual Safety:</strong> Refers to preventing pregnancy, STIs, and staying safe from sexual abuse or assault. Latex condoms and abstinence are the only effective methods for preventing STIs.</li>
                            <li><strong>Communication:</strong> Healthy communication with healthcare workers and sexual partners is vital. It allows for addressing risks, receiving care, and establishing respectful boundaries in relationships.</li>

                         <p>Poor sexual health can lead to unintended pregnancy, STIs, and long-term physical health consequences if infections are untreated. Being unable to communicate in sexual and romantic relationships can cause emotional pain and distress.</p>
