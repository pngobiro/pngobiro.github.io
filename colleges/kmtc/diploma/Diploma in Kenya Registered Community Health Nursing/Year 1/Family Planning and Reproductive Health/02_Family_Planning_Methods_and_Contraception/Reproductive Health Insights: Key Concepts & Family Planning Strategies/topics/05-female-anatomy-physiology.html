                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>A female's internal reproductive organs are the vagina, uterus, fallopian tubes, cervix, and ovary. External structures include the mons pubis, pudendal cleft, labia majora and minora, vulva, Bartholin's gland, and the clitoris.</p>
                        <p>The female reproductive system contains two main parts: the <strong>uterus</strong>, which hosts the developing fetus, produces vaginal and uterine secretions, and passes sperm through to the fallopian tubes; and the <strong>ovaries</strong>, which produce the female egg cell.</p>
                         <p>The vagina is attached to the uterus through the cervix, while the uterus is attached to the ovaries via the fallopian tubes. At certain intervals, the ovaries release an ovum, which passes through the fallopian tube into the uterus. Fertilization usually occurs in the oviducts.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Ovaries</h3>
                        <p>The ovaries are the ovum-producing organs of the internal female reproductive system. They secrete both estrogen and progesterone.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Physiology and Function</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Oogenesis:</strong> The ovaries are the site of gamete (egg cell) production. The developing egg cell grows within ovarian follicles. Ovulation is the process where a mature oocyte is released from the follicle.</li>
                            <li><strong>Endocrine Function:</strong> Ovaries secrete estrogen (responsible for secondary sex characteristics), progesterone (prepares the uterus for pregnancy), and testosterone (important for muscle mass, bone strength, and libido).</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Uterus</h3>
                        <p>The uterus or womb is a major female hormone-responsive reproductive sex organ. One end, the cervix, opens into the vagina, while the other is connected to one or both fallopian tubes. It is within the uterus that the fetus develops during gestation.</p>
                        <p>The reproductive function of the uterus is to accept a fertilized ovum which implants into the endometrium and derives nourishment from blood vessels which develop exclusively for this purpose.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Female Duct System (Fallopian Tubes)</h3>
                        <p>The Fallopian tubes, or oviducts, connect the ovaries to the uterus. The Fallopian tube allows passage of the egg from the ovary to the uterus. The lining of the Fallopian tubes are ciliated. Interspersed between the ciliated cells are peg cells, which produce tubular fluid that contains nutrients for spermatozoa, oocytes, and zygotes. Occasionally, the embryo implants into the Fallopian tube instead of the uterus, creating an ectopic pregnancy.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Vagina</h3>
                        <p>The vagina is the female reproductive tract and has two primary functions: sexual intercourse and childbirth. It is situated between the cervix of the uterus and the external genitalia. During sexual arousal the vagina expands in both length and width. Vaginal lubrication is provided by the Bartholin's glands near the vaginal opening and the cervix.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The vulva is the external genitalia of the female reproductive tract, situated immediately external to the genital orifice. As the outer portal of the uterus, the vulva protects its opening with the labia majora and labia minora. It also contains the opening of the female urethra.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Major structures of the vulva are:</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Mons pubis:</strong> A fleshy protuberance over the pubic bones that becomes covered with hair during puberty.</li>
                            <li><strong>Labia majora:</strong> The "large lips," which enclose and protect the other external reproductive organs. They are comparable to the scrotum in males.</li>
                            <li><strong>Labia minora:</strong> The "small lips," which lie just inside the labia majora and surround the openings to the vagina and urethra.</li>
                            <li><strong>Clitoris:</strong> A small, sensitive protrusion comparable to the penis in males. It is covered by a fold of skin called the prepuce (clitoral hood).</li>
                            <li><strong>Bartholin's glands:</strong> Located beside the vaginal opening, these glands produce a fluid (mucus) secretion.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Perineum</h3>
                        <p>The perineum is the region between the genitals and the anus, including the perineal body and surrounding structures. Perineal tears and episiotomy often occur in childbirth with first-time deliveries. The perineum is an erogenous zone for both males and females.</p>

                        <p>A mammary gland is an organ in female mammals that produces milk to feed young offspring. Mammary glands are not associated with the female reproductive tract, but develop as secondary sex characteristics in reproductive-age females.</p>
                        <p>The basic components of a mature mammary gland are the <strong>alveoli</strong>, hollow cavities lined with milk-secreting cells. Alveoli join up to form groups known as lobules, each of which has a lactiferous duct that drains into openings in the nipple. Secretory alveoli develop mainly in pregnancy, when rising levels of prolactin, estrogen, and progesterone cause further branching and development.</p>
