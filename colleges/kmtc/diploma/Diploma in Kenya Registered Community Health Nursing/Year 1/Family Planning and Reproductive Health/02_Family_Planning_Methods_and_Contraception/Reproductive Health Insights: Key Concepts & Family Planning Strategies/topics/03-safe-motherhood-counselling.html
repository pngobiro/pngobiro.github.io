                            <li><strong>Family Planning:</strong> It is necessary to ensure that individuals and couples have adequate information and services regarding FP to plan the timing, number of children, and spacing between pregnancies.</li>
                            <li><strong>Antenatal Care (ANC):</strong> ANC checkups are necessary to detect complications early and treat them as soon as possible. It is also essential to provide pregnant women with vitamin supplements, iron tablets and vaccinations.</li>
                            <li><strong>Obstetric and Newborn Care:</strong> Refers to all the care and health care level initiatives provided to the mother and newborn. Birth attendants should have the knowledge, skills, and equipment to perform a clean and safe delivery.</li>

                            <li><strong>Infections:</strong> Usually after childbirth, often due to unhygienic delivery practices.</li>
                            <li><strong>High blood pressure during pregnancy:</strong> Includes pre-eclampsia and eclampsia.</li>

                        </ul>

                            <li><strong>H - Help</strong> them to make decisions about choices of methods. Ask about their plans, what their partner prefers, and repeat information when necessary.</li>
                            <li><strong>E - Explain</strong> and demonstrate how to use the chosen method. Give supplies, explain side-effects and warning signs, and ask the client to repeat key instructions.</li>
