                        <p>Reproductive health is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity, in all matters relating to the reproductive system and to its functions and processes.</p>
                        <p>Implies that people are able to have a satisfying and safe sex life and that they have the capability to reproduce and the freedom to decide if, when and how often to do so."</p>
                        <p>The definition of Reproductive rights recognizes the basic right of couples and individuals to decide freely and responsibly.</p>
                        <p>It also includes access to information and services on safe, effective, affordable and acceptable contraceptive methods.</p>
                        <p>The establishment of a reproductive health system provides not only a solution measure to the population problem, but also contributes to the improvement of individual health , and it is based on the definition of "health as provided by the World Health Organization (WHO) in its Constitution. However, the range of reproductive health is wide and the definition and interpretation of its concept remain varied.</p>

                        <p>Reproductive health care is defined as "the entire set of methods, techniques and services that contribute to reproductive health and its well being through prevention and solution of various problems related to reproductive health." Reproductive health includes health related to sex for the purpose of individual sex and the enhancement of human relationships (sexual health), and is not simply limited to counseling and care related to reproduction and sexually transmitted infections.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">3. Reproductive Health Rights</h3>
                        <p>Reproductive rights are part of human rights which are already acknowledged in domestic laws, international documents on human rights, and other related documents agreed in the United Nations. These rights are basic right of all couples and individuals to decide freely and responsibly the number, spacing and timing of their children and to have the information and means to do so, and the right to attain the highest standard of sexual and reproductive health.</p>
                        <p>In addition, it also includes their right to make decisions concerning reproduction free of discrimination, coercion and violence, as expressed in human rights documents. The rights to use appropriate health care services so that women can enjoy safe pregnancy and delivery and couples can have the best opportunities to have healthy children are also included.</p>
