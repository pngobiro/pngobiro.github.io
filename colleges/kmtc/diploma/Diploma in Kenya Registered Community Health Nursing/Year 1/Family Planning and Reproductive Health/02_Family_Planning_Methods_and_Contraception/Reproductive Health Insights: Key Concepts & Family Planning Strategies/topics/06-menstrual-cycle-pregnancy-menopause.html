                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>During each menstrual cycle, an egg develops and is released from the ovaries. The lining of the uterus builds up. If a pregnancy doesn't happen, the uterine lining sheds during a menstrual period. Then the cycle starts again.</p>
                        <p>A woman's menstrual cycle is divided into four phases:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Menstrual phase</li>
                            <li>Follicular phase</li>
                            <li>Ovulation phase</li>
                            <li>Luteal phase</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Menstrual phase</h3>
                        <p>The menstrual phase is the first stage of the menstrual cycle. It's also when you get your period. This phase starts when an egg from the previous cycle isn't fertilized. Because pregnancy hasn't taken place, levels of the hormones estrogen and progesterone drop. The thickened lining of your uterus sheds through your vagina. On average, this phase lasts for 3 to 7 days.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Follicular phase</h3>
                        <p>The follicular phase starts on the first day of your period (so there is some overlap with the menstrual phase) and ends when you ovulate. It starts when the hypothalamus sends a signal to your pituitary gland to release follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). This hormone stimulates your ovaries to produce around 5 to 20 small sacs called follicles. The maturing follicle sets off a surge in estrogen that thickens the lining of your uterus. The average follicular phase lasts for about 16 days.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Ovulation phase</h3>
                        <p>Rising estrogen levels during the follicular phase trigger your pituitary gland to release luteinizing hormone (LH). This is what starts the process of ovulation. Ovulation is when your ovary releases a mature egg. The egg travels down the fallopian tube toward the uterus to be fertilized by sperm. The ovulation phase is the only time during your menstrual cycle when you can get pregnant. It lasts about 24 hours.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Luteal phase</h3>
                        <p>After the follicle releases its egg, it changes into the corpus luteum. This structure releases hormones, mainly progesterone and some estrogen. The rise in hormones keeps your uterine lining thick and ready for a fertilized egg to implant. If you don't get pregnant, the corpus luteum will shrink away and be resorbed. This leads to decreased levels of estrogen and progesterone, which causes the onset of your period.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Pregnancy occurs when a sperm fertilizes an egg after it's released from the ovary during ovulation. The fertilized egg then travels down into the uterus, where implantation occurs. A successful implantation results in pregnancy. On average, a full-term pregnancy lasts 40 weeks.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Symptoms of pregnancy</h3>
                        <p>Common signs and symptoms include a missed period, headaches, spotting (implantation bleeding), weight gain, heartburn, constipation, cramps, back pain, and breast changes. Morning sickness (vomiting) is also a classic early sign.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Pregnancy week by week</h3>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">First trimester (weeks 1 to 12)</h4>
                        <p>A baby grows rapidly. The fetus begins developing their brain, spinal cord, and organs. The baby's heart will also begin to beat. The probability of a miscarriage is relatively high during this trimester.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Second trimester (weeks 13 to 27)</h4>
                        <p>An anatomy scan ultrasound is typically performed to check for developmental abnormalities. You'll probably begin to feel your baby move, kick, and punch. After 23 weeks, a baby is considered "viable," meaning it could survive outside the womb.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Third trimester (weeks 28 to 40)</h4>
                        <p>Weight gain will accelerate, and you may feel more tired. The baby can now sense light and their bones are formed. As labor approaches, you may feel pelvic discomfort and experience Braxton-Hicks contractions.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Pregnancy Diet and Exercise</h3>
                        <p>A healthy pregnancy diet should include an additional 340 to 450 calories per day, focusing on complex carbohydrates, protein, vegetables, fruits, and healthy fats. Exercise is essential to keeping you fit, relaxed, and ready for labor. Good exercises for pregnancy include gentle Pilates, walking, and swimming.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Pregnancy Complications and Labor</h3>
                        <p>Underlying health conditions can increase risks. Common complications include high blood pressure, gestational diabetes, and preeclampsia. Labor is generally classified into early labor (contractions are far apart) and active labor (contractions become closer and more intense).</p>

                        <p>Menopause is the time that marks the end of your menstrual cycles. It's diagnosed after you've gone 12 months without a menstrual period. Menopause can happen in your 40s or 50s, but the average age is 51 in the United States.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Symptoms</h3>
                        <p>In the months or years leading up to menopause (perimenopause), you might experience these signs and symptoms: irregular periods, vaginal dryness, hot flashes, chills, night sweats, sleep problems, mood changes, weight gain, thinning hair, and loss of breast fullness.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Causes</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Naturally declining reproductive hormones:</strong> As you approach your late 30s, your ovaries start making less estrogen and progesterone.</li>
                            <li><strong>Surgery that removes the ovaries (oophorectomy):</strong> Causes immediate menopause.</li>
                            <li><strong>Chemotherapy and radiation therapy:</strong> These cancer therapies can induce menopause.</li>
                            <li><strong>Primary ovarian insufficiency:</strong> About 1% of women experience menopause before age 40 (premature menopause).</li>
