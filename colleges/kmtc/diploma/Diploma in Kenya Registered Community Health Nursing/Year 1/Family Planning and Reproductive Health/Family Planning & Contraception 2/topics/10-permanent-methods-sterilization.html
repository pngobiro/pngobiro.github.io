                                <li><strong>Informed Choice:</strong> The client must be informed about all other available contraceptive options, including long-acting reversible methods like IUCDs and implants.</li>
                                <li><strong>Permanence:</strong> It must be clearly understood that the procedure is permanent and generally irreversible. While reversal surgery exists, its success cannot be guaranteed and it is often expensive and difficult.</li>
                                <li><strong>Voluntary Consent:</strong> The client must sign a standard consent form voluntarily, without any coercion or incentives. They are free to change their mind at any time before the procedure. Spousal consent is not mandatory but counseling both partners is ideal.</li>
                                <li><strong>Procedure Details:</strong> Explain the procedure, its effectiveness, and possible complications or side effects.</li>
                                <li><strong>No STI Protection:</strong> Sterilization does <strong>not</strong> protect against Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs), including HIV/AIDS. If at risk, condom use is still necessary.</li>

It is a simpler, safer, and less expensive procedure than female sterilization, usually performed under local anesthesia in an outpatient setting.</p>
