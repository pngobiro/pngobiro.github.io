                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>LAM is a temporary method of family planning based on the natural lack of ovulation that results from exclusive breastfeeding. It is highly effective (98%) but only if three specific criteria are met simultaneously.</p>

                        <aside class="callout warning" role="alert">
                            <h4 class="callout-title"><span class="callout-icon"> </span>The Three Criteria for LAM</h4>
                            <p>For LAM to be effective, a woman must meet all three of these conditions:</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li><strong>Her menstrual periods have not resumed (amenorrhea).</strong></li>
                                <li><strong>The baby is exclusively or nearly exclusively breastfed on demand, day and night.</strong></li>
                                <li><strong>The baby is less than six months old.</strong></li>
                            </ol>
                            <p>If any one of these criteria is no longer met, the woman must immediately begin using another method of contraception to prevent pregnancy.</p>
                        </aside>
                         <p><strong>Benefits:</strong> LAM is safe, convenient, and has significant health benefits for both the mother (e.g., faster uterine involution) and the baby (e.g., optimal nutrition and passive immunity).</p>
                         <p><strong>Limitations:</strong> It is a temporary method, can be difficult for working mothers to maintain, and does not protect against STIs. For mothers living with HIV, counseling on the risk of transmission through breastfeeding is essential.</p>

                        <p>These methods involve tracking fertility signs to determine the fertile window.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Calendar-Based Method: Standard Days Method® (SDM)</h3>
                        <p>The SDM is a simple calendar method for women whose menstrual cycles are consistently between <strong>26 and 32 days long</strong>. It identifies a fixed fertile window from <strong>day 8 to day 19</strong> of the cycle (where day 1 is the first day of menstruation). Couples must abstain or use a barrier method during this period. Tools like CycleBeads® can help users track their cycle days.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Symptoms-Based Methods</h3>
                        <p>These methods rely on observing the physical signs of fertility.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Cervical Mucus Method (Billings Ovulation Method)</h4>
                        <p>This method involves tracking changes in the quantity and quality of cervical mucus. As ovulation approaches, estrogen causes the mucus to become clear, slippery, and stretchy (like raw egg white), a quality known as <strong>spinnbarkeit</strong>. This is the peak fertile time. After ovulation, progesterone makes the mucus become thick, sticky, cloudy, or disappear entirely. The couple avoids intercourse from the first day any mucus is observed until the evening of the fourth day after the "peak day" (the last day of fertile-quality mucus).</p>
                        
                        <h4>Basal Body Temperature (BBT) Method</h4>
                        <p>This method involves taking one's temperature at the same time every morning before any activity. After ovulation, the release of progesterone causes a slight but sustained rise in BBT (about 0.2°C to 0.5°C). This temperature shift confirms that ovulation has *already occurred*. The infertile phase begins on the evening of the third consecutive day that the temperature remains elevated. This method identifies the post-ovulatory "safe" days but does not predict ovulation in advance.</p>

                        <h4>Sympto-Thermal Method</h4>
                        <p>This is the most effective FABM as it combines multiple indicators. The user tracks both cervical mucus (to identify the start of the fertile window) and basal body temperature (to confirm the end of the fertile window). It may also include tracking other signs like cervical position or ovulation pain (mittelschmerz).</p>
                        
                        <h4>TwoDay Method® (TDM)</h4>
                        <p>This is a simplified mucus-based method. Each day, the woman asks herself two questions: "Did I note any cervical secretions today?" and "Did I note any secretions yesterday?" If the answer to either question is "yes," she considers herself fertile and should avoid unprotected sex.</p>
