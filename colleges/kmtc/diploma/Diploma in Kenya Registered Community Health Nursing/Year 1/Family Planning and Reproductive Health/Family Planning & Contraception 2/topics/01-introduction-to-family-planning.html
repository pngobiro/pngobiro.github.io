                        <p><strong>Family planning</strong> is a program to regulate the timing, number, and spacing of children in a family through the practice of contraception or other methods of birth control. It allows individuals and couples to anticipate and attain their desired number of children and the spacing and timing of their births. It is achieved through the use of contraceptive methods and the treatment of involuntary infertility.</p>
                        <p>This component of reproductive health enables couples and women to choose whether, when, or how often to reproduce, allowing them to delay a first or subsequent child and space them as desired. A woman's ability to space and limit her pregnancies has a direct impact on her health and well-being as well as on the outcome of each pregnancy.</p>
