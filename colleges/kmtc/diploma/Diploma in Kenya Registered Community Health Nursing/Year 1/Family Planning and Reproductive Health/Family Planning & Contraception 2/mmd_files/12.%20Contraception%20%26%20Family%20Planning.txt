CONTRACEPTION \& FAMIY PLANNING
}

\section*{IDEAL CONTRACEPTIVE}
' Inexpensive
' Easy and simple to use with minimum side effects
- Rapidly reversible
- Readily available
' Highly effective.?
- Can be administered by non-healthcare personnel.

\section*{Contraceptive effectiveness}
- Difficult to determine :
1. Perfect VS typical use (method failure and patient failure)
2. Correct VS incorrect use
3. long term VS short term

\section*{Pearl index}
- Method used for determination of pregnancy failure rate:

Pregnancy rate = no. of pregnancies x100women/12 months of use

\section*{classifications}
A. Natural Methods
- Periodic abstinence
- Withdrawal

Lactational Amenorrhea Method
B. Barrier Methods
C. Hormonal

D Intrauterine Devices
E.. Sterilization

\title{
HORMONAL CONTRACEPTION
}

\section*{Objectives}
$\checkmark$ Combined pills
$\checkmark$ Progestin pills (minipills)
$\checkmark$ Subdermal patches
$\checkmark$ Injections
$\checkmark$ Vaginal ring

\title{
Oral contraceptive pills
}
- World wide used
- very convenient method
- Reversible methods

\section*{Combined}
- Composition
- Combination of Estrogen \& Progesterone
- Ethinyl Estradiol (most commonly used nowadays)
- Levonorgestrel, Norethindrone, ...
- Intake
- 21 days: 1 pill/day
- Last 7 days: free

\section*{Minipills}
' Used for 28 days, no breaks
- Same time of the day

Same time of the day

\section*{Mechanism of action}

Combined : most effective method because they inhibit midcycle gonadotropin surge and prevent ovulation

Progestin only pills: don't mainly not inhibit ovulation
oth types act by -altering cervical mucus making it thick viscid and scanty
-alter endometrium so not fit for implantation
- alter ovarian responsiveness to gonadotropin stimulation

\section*{How to prevent ovulation?}
- Interfere with the release of GnRH from hypothalamus so it will suppress LH \& FSH
- In high concentration they will inhibit pituitary gland directly
- Progestin only pills don't inhibit ovulation mainly because a lower dose of progestin is used in preparations less than combine forms it is important to be taken at the same time of the day to ensure that blood level do not fall below the effective levels

\section*{Side effects}
- Mostly caused by progestin
- Nausea
- Breast tenderness
- Fluid retention
' Depression
- Headache
- acne
- Estrogen cause pigmentation and high level of estrogen may accelerate the development of gallbladder disease in young female but not increase the risk of acute cholelithiasis
- Progestin : because they are structural related to testosterone they produce androgenic effects like increase weight and acnes

\section*{Metabolic effects}

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline combined & chemical & clinical \\
\hline HDL & increase & \multirow[t]{7}{*}{$\downarrow$ cardiovascular disease?} \\

\section*{Natural methods}
- Lactational amenorrhea

Efficacy
"Advantages
Disadvantages

\section*{Barrier methods of contraception}

Two types:
1. Physical barrier methods, such as condoms, diaphragm, and cervical caps, that prevent pregnancy by blocking the entry of sperm into the upper genital tract;
2. Chemical barrier methods (spermicides) that kill or inactivate sperm on contact. ( less effective , used in combination , no STDs protection )

\section*{Barrier methods of contraception}
- easily available, reversible, and have fewer side effects than hormonal methods.
- effective and acceptable if used consistently and correctly.
- Protect against STD

\section*{Male condoms}
- It is one of the most popular mechanical barriers. Among all of the barrier methods, the condom provides the most effective protection of the genital tract from STDs. Its usage has increass because of the concern regarding the acquisition of HIV and STDs.

\section*{Male condoms}
' Increasing the efficacy :
- reservoir tip
- The addition of spermicidal
lubricant to the condom. (water-based not oilbased)
- the addition of an intravaginal spermicidal agent.

\section*{Female condoms}
- It contains 2 flexible rings. The ring at the closed end of the sheath serves as an insertion mechanism and internal anchor that is placed inside the vaginal canal. The other ring forms the external patent edge of the device and remains outside of the canal after insertion.

\section*{Female condoms}
- Mechanism of action :
- Prevents passage of sperm and infections into the vagina (protection against STDs )
" Can be inserted up to 8 hours prior to intercourse; can remain in
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_28_ab1ee0491cdec58ba20eg-36.jpg?height=788&width=954&top_left_y=679&top_left_x=1489)

èªžADAM. place up to 8 hours

\section*{Female condoms}
- Efficacy
- Pregnancy rates for the female condom range between 5 and 21 per 100 women per year. (higher than male condoms)
- To increase efficacy Simultaneous use of both the female and male condom is not recommended
- Re-use is not recommended .

\section*{Diaphragm}
- The diaphragm is a shallow latex cup with a spring mechanism in its rim to hold it in place in the vagina
* It is inserted before intercourse so that the posterior rim fits into the posterior fornix and the anterior rim is placed behind the pubic bone.
- Spermicidal cream is applied to the inside of the dome, which fits against the vaginal wall.

\section*{Diaphragm}
- It prevents pregnancy by acting as a barrier to the passage of semen into the cervix
- provides effective contraception for 6 hours.
- After intercourse, the diaphragm must be left in place for at least 6 hours.
- Effectiveness depends on the age of the user, continuity of use, and the use of spermicide along with the diaphragm. Failure rate is estimated to be $20 \%$.

\section*{Diaphragm}
- Relative Contraindications :
- Latex allergy
- Uterine prolapse
- Repeated UTIs

\section*{Diaphragm}
- Disadvantages :
- Prolonged use increase the risk of UTI
- More than 24 hours use is not recommended due to the possible risk of TSS.
- Might cause vaginal erosions if not placed properly .
- Requires a professional fitting (trained provider is needed) .

\section*{Cervical cap}
- a cup-shaped latex device that fits over the base of the cervix.
- The cap must be filled one third full with spermicide prior to insertion
- Inserted 8 hours before coitus and can be left in place for as long as 48 hours.

\section*{Cervical cap}
- Acts as both mechanical barrier to sperm and as a chemical agent with the use of spermicide .
- Pregnancy rates range between 4 and 36 per 100 women per year.
- Effectiveness depends on the parity of women due to the shape of the cervical os.
- Disadvantages : cervical erosions and vaginal spotting, risk for TSS , requires professional fitting and training for use , high failure rate , and candidates must have a history of normal results of pap smears.

\section*{Spermicides}
- consist of a base combined with either nonoxynol-9 or octoxynol
- Surfactant that destroys the sperm cell membrane
- Forms available : vaginal foams, suppositories, jellies, films, foaming tablets, and creams.

\section*{Spermicides}
- Failure rate is about $26 \%$ within the $1^{\text {st }}$ year of use.
- Advantages : ease of application, available over the counter , inexpensive and it augments the contraceptive efficacy of the cervical cap and diaphragm .
- Disadvantages : minimal protection against STDs , risk of vaginal irritation and allergic reaction.

\section*{IUD}
-IUD is the world's most widely used method of reversible birth control .
3 TYPES:
1- Inert ( no longer recommended because of painful and heavy periods).

2-Copper Releasing (paragard).

3-Progesterone Releasing (IUS):

A-Progestasert (progesterone T) 1976 2001.

\section*{Clinical uses}
- Long-term contraception
- Women with contraindications to COC
- Emergency contraceptive (1:1000 )
' menorrhagia , endometriosis, chronic pelvic pain, dysmenorrhea , anemia.

\section*{Mechanism of Action}

These mechanisms have not been defined precisely and are the subject of ongoing controversy. It has several effects on the reproductive system :
- The Mirena is intended to initially release a daily dose of 20 micrograms levonorgestral (a progestin).
- Inhibition of ovulation.
-Cervical mucus is changed to obstruct passage of sperm through the cervix.
- endometrial thinning which inhibits implantation of embryos

\section*{Absolute Contraindications}
-Pregnancy.
--Post partum puerperal sepsis
Â©-Immediately post-septic abortion
-Undiagnosed abnormal vaginal bleeding.
-Suspected gynecological malignancy.
(Cervical cancer, Endometrial cancer)
-Current STDs.
-Current PID.
-anatomical abnormalities

\section*{Sterilization}
- Sterilization :female sterilization and male vasectomy are permenant metod of contaception and highly effective
- They are generally chosen by relatively older couple who are sure that they copleted their family.
- Also individual who carry a genetic disorder may choose to be strlizer.
- $28 \%$ of reproductive age women undergo tubal ligation and $10 \%$ of men undergo vasectomy.
- Sterilization methods include:

1- Vasectomy in males.

2- Tubal Ligation in females .

\section*{Tubal Ligation}
- This involve mechanically blockage of both fallopian tube to prevent the sperm reaching and fertilizing the oocyte
- sterilization performed by
laparoscopically(under GA) or through
a suprapubic "mini-laparotomy"
- Failure rate: 0.5\%
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_28_ab1ee0491cdec58ba20eg-53.jpg?height=1646&width=2497&top_left_y=0&top_left_x=0)

\section*{Tubal Ligation}

Advantages:
- intended to be permanent
- highly effective
- safe
- quick recovery
- lack of significant long-term side effects
- cost effective

\section*{Tubal Ligation}

Disadvantage:
- possibility of patient regret
- difficult to reverse
- future pregnancy could require assisted reproductive technology (such as IVF)
- more expensive than vasectomy

\section*{Cont.}

\section*{Complication:}

A women may experienced anasthetic problem or may be damage to intra-abdominal during the procedure.

NOTE:
ectopic pregnancy can be a late complications and any sterilized women who misses her period and has symptom of pregnancy should seek medical advice.

\section*{Vasectomy}

\section*{Mechanism of action:}

Vasectomy involve division of the vas deferens on each side to prevent the release of sperm during ejaculation.
Easier than tubal ligation.

Usually done under local anesthesia.
- Failure rate: 0.1\%.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_28_ab1ee0491cdec58ba20eg-58.jpg?height=1764&width=2497&top_left_y=86&top_left_x=0)

\section*{Vasectomy}

Advantages:
- permanent
- highly effective
- safe
- quick recovery
- lack of significant long-term side effects
- cost effective; less expensive than tubal ligation

\section*{Vasectomy}

\section*{Disadvantages:}
- reversal is difficult, expensive, often unsuccessful
- not effective until all sperm cleared from the reproductive tract (may take up to 12 w )
- no protection from STDs

\section*{Cont.}

\section*{Complication of vasectomy:}

Immediately bleeding, wound infection and hematoma may occur.

At the cut of vas deferns small lump will apear as a result of a local inflammation response this is called sperm granuloma it needs surgica excision.

\section*{Cont.}

\section*{some men develop anti-sperm antibody following}

\section*{vasectomy}

\section*{WHO eligibility criteria}
1. Use method in any circumstances
2. Generally use the method
3. Use of method not usually recommended unless other more appropriate methods are not available or not acceptable
4. Method not to be used
