\section*{The Practice of Contraception}

Dr. J. A. Aswani

\section*{Objectives}
- Define Family planning
- Explain the Importance of FP
- Classify FP methods
- Explain factors that influence choice of FP methods
- Describe WHO medical eligibility criteria for FP methods
- Explain contraceptive options in the context of HIV infection

\section*{Definition}
- Component of reproductive health that enables couples and women to choose whether, when or how often to reproduce
- Enables couples to delay getting a first or subsequent child and space as per their desire
- Allows for limiting the total size of the family

\section*{Importance}
- Lies in the benefits of FP:
- Contraceptive benefits.
- Non contraceptive benefits
- Health benefits

\section*{Contraceptive benefits}
- Nations:
- Helps regulate population growth
- Matches population growth to economic growth
- Prevents poverty, crime, environmental degradation
- Families
- Limits family sizes - more resources for each member
- Individuals
- Helps delay a first or subsequent child
- Allows more relaxed sexual relations
- Children
- Allows spacing - more time to breastfeed and care for each child

\section*{Non-contraceptive benefits}
- Regulation of cycles - nearer 28 days.
- Control of menstrual cramps - anovulatory cycles
- Prevention of anemia - control of menorrhagia, amenorrhea associated with progesterone only methods
- Reduced risk of ovarian and uterine cancers - hormonal methods
- Reduction in symptoms of endometritis
- Reduced risk of symptomatic PID
- Treatment of Acne and Hirsutism - pills
- Prevention of STI's /HIV - condoms

\section*{Health benefits}
- Reduces maternal/perinatal mortality
- Prevention of high risk/too frequent pregnancies
- Reduces the incidence of abortion
- Prevention of unwanted/mistimed pregnancies
- Reduces infant HIV rates
- Prevention of unwanted/unplanned pregnancies in HIV infected women

\section*{FP Method mix}
- Barrier methods
- Oral contraceptives
- Contraceptive patches(Evra), ring (Nuvaring)
- Injectable contraceptives
- Implants
- Intrauterine devices
- Female and male sterilization
- Lactational ammenorrhoea method
- Fertility awareness based methods

\section*{Factors affecting method choice}
- Safety
- Effectiveness
- Duration of protection desired
- Side effects
- Ease of use
- Cost and access to re-supply
- Effect on breast feeding

\section*{Factors affecting method choice continued}
- Possible interaction with other medications
- Whether it prevents STI/HIV transmission or acquisition
- Whether partner involvement or negotiation are required or possible

\section*{Method effectiveness}
- Measured as pregnancy rate per 100 women (or couples) per year
- 3 levels: -
- Very effective <2
- Effective 2-9
- Somewhat effective 10-30
- Rates vary between typical use and perfect use

\section*{WHO medical eligibility criteria}
- Recommendations on the safety of using given methods in the presence of specific medical conditions/disorders
- Based on scientific evidence which is reviewed periodically by experts
- WHO groups the medical conditions into 4 categories:

\section*{Eligibility criteria contd.}

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline Category & Description & Recommendation \\
\hline 1 & Conditions do not impose any restriction on the use of contraceptive method & Use under any/all circumstances \\
\hline 2 & Conditions for which benefits of using the method generally outweigh the theoretical or proven risks & Generally use the method though careful follow-up may be required \\
\hline 3 & Theoretical or proven risks of conditions generally outweigh the benefits of using the method & Do not use method unless other more appropriate alternative is not available or acceptable \\
\hline 4 & Conditions that present unacceptable health risks if the method is used & Method not to be used under any circumstances \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\section*{WHO MEC as applied in Kenya}

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline Category & Where clinical judgement is adequate & Where clinical judgement is NOT adequate \\
\hline 1 & Use the method & Use the method \\
\hline 2 & Use the method with care close follow-up needed in some cases & Initiate method and refer the client for evaluation as soon as possible \\
\hline 3 & Help client to choose another method or use method with extreme care - ensure access to continuous monitoring & Do not use method. Refer client or help her choose an alternative method \\
\hline 4 & Do not use method & Do not use method \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\section*{MEC - examples}

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline Medical condition / characteristic & Contraceptive method & Category \\
\hline Uterine fibroids & COC's & 1 \\
\hline Anemia & IUD & 2 \\
\hline Breast feeding, less than 6 weeks post partum & DMPA & 3 \\
\hline Current breast cancer & Hormonal implants & 4 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\section*{Contraceptive options for women and couples with HIV}

Factors to consider:
- Concerns about interaction between hormonal methods and ARV's
- Need for dual protection against pregnancy and STI/HIV transmission

\section*{Drug interactions between ARV's and Hormonal methods}
- All hormonal methods are good for women with HIV
- Very effective, easy to use, reversible, suitable for short/long term use, non contraceptive benefits, serious complications rare
- Some ARV's speed up liver metabolism and may lower hormone levels
- Hormonal methods may (theoretically) affect ARV efficacy, infectivity or disease progression

\section*{Available evidence on interactions:}
- NRTI's generally have no drug interactions with COC's and DMPA
- Ritonavir boosted PI's reduce contraceptive hormone levels in blood
- No significant interaction found between NNRTI's and progestin only injectables

\section*{MEC guidelines for clients with HIV and AIDS}

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|l|l|}
\hline Method & HIV infected & AIDS & NRTI's & NNRTI's & Ritonavir PI's \\
\hline DMPA & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
\hline NETEN & 1 & 1 & 1 & 2 & 2 \\
\hline Implants & 1 & 1 & 1 & 2 & 2 \\
\hline CoC's & 1 & 1 & 1 & 2 & 3 \\
\hline IUCD Initiation & 2 & 3 & 2/3 & 2/3 & 2/3 \\
\hline IUCD continuati on & 2 & 2 & 2 & 2 & 2 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\section*{MEC guidelines for clients with HIV contd.}

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline Condoms & No restrictions. Use is encouraged to prevent STI/HIV transmission \\
\hline ECP's & No restrictions \\
\hline Sterilization & No reason to deny. Delay in case of acute HIV infection \\
\hline FAB methods & Can use if menses regular. Encourage to use condoms outside fertile period to prevent STI's/HIV \\
\hline LAM & May be used with exclusive breast feeding \\
\hline Spermicides and diaphragm & Not recommended. May increase risk of HIV transmission or super-infection \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\section*{Ways to avoid both pregnancy and STI's/HIV}
- Condoms alone
- Condoms and another FP method
- Any FP method with an uninfected partner
- Other safe forms of intimacy (without sex)
- Delay or avoid having sex

\section*{Dual method use}
- Condoms plus any other method
- Reduces:
- Risk of unintended pregnancy
- Transmission of HIV between partners
- Risk of acquiring or transmitting other STI's
- Requires ongoing support - users of other methods less likely to use condoms

\section*{Combined oral contraceptives}
- Combination of estrogen and progestin
- May be monophasic, biphasic or triphasic
- Low dose has $30-35 \mu \mathrm{~g}$ estrogen while high dose has $50 \mu \mathrm{~g}$ estrogen
- Formulation - 21 or 28 pill pack

\section*{Mechanism of action of CoC's}
- Suppression of ovulation
- May also prevent fertilization by thickening cervical mucus
- Have no effect on an already existing pregnancy

\section*{Examples of who should use COC's}

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline WHO category & conditions \\
\hline Category 1 & Menarche to 39 years, endometriosis, endometrial or ovarian cancer, uterine fibroids, family h/o breast cancer, varicose veins, irregular, heavy or prolonged bleeding; anemia; STI/PID; hepatitis \\
\hline Category 2 & $>39 \mathrm{yrs}, \mathrm{b} /$ feeding >5 months postpartum; superficial thrombophlebitis; uncomplicated diabetes; cervical cancer; unexplained pv bleeding; undiagnosed breast mass \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\section*{Examples of who should not use CoC's}

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline WHO category & conditions \\
\hline Category 3 & b/feeding between 6 wks and 5 months postpartum; non-b/feeding <21 days p/partum; hypertension ( 140-159/90-99), migraine without aura if <35 years; gall bladder disease; use of rifampicin/rifabutin. \\
\hline Category 4 & b/feeding <6 wks p/partum; hypertension (>159/>99); migraine with aura; DVT (history or acute); ischaemic heart disease or stroke; complicated diabetes; breast cancer; acute/flare hepatitis; severe liver disease/liver tumors \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\section*{Advantages}
- Highly effective, safe, easy to use, can be provided by trained non-clinical providers, pelvic exam not required for initiation
- Regulation/control of flow, pain, anemia, acne, hirsutism, endometriosis
- Prevention of ovarian, endometrial cancer, symptomatic PID

\section*{Side effects}

Depot Medroxy-progesterone acetate (DMPA)
- Commonly known as Depo-Provera
- Given as deep IM injection of 150 mg every 3 months (13 weeks)
- May be given from 2 weeks early to 4 weeks late

\section*{DMPA - Mode of action}
- Suppresses hormones responsible for ovulation
- Thickens cervical mucus to block sperm movement
- Reversible method
- Length of use does not influence return to fertility
- Takes 9-10 months to conceive after last injection

\section*{Examples of who can use DMPA}

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline WHO category & conditions \\
\hline Category 1 & Heavy smokers; b/feeding after 6wks p/partum; thyroid diseases; dysmenorrhoea; uterine fibroids; STIs/PID; use of rifampicin, rifabutin or anticonvulsants; any type of ARV drug \\

\end{tabular}

\section*{Progestin only pills (POP's)}
- Contain no estrogen
- Amount of progestin in each pill less than in COC's
- All pills in each pack are active and with same amount of progestin
- 28-35 pills per pack

\section*{POP's -contd.}
- Mechanism of action
- Partial suppression of ovulation - more pronounced in breastfeeding women

- No break between packs

\section*{Emergency contraception pills (ECPs)}
- Pills used for post-coital contraception
- May be POPs or COCs
- May be used up to 5 days post-coital but most effective when used early
- POP regimen more effective than COC
- POPs -specially formulated or regular pills
- COCs -low dose (4 pills bd); high dose (2 pills bd)

\section*{ECPs - Mechanism of action}

Depending on when in the cycle the pills are taken, they may:
- Inhibit or delay ovulation
- Affect transport of sperm or ovum inhibiting fertilization
- Prevent implantation by making the endometrium unsuitable
- Do not disrupt established pregnancy

\section*{Indications for ECPs}
- Unplanned, unprotected intercourse including rape
- Condom leakage or breakage or other barrier method failure

- Coitus after more than 4 weeks late for DMPA or 7 days late for monthly injection
- Failed withdrawal or abstinence

\section*{ECPs - What the user needs to know}
- More effective the sooner they are began
- Side effects (nausea and vomiting) may occur but less common with POP regimen
- Next menses may come a week early or late
- Do not provide pregnancy protection for future intercourse nor protect STIs/HIV

\section*{Implants}

\end{tabular}

\section*{Intrauterine Devices (IUCDs)}
- Originally plain coiled plastic devices inserted into the uterus
- Later T -shaped devices with copper wire or sleave e.g. copper-T 380A, NovaT, Multi-load.
- Latest - hormone impregnated Tdevices e.g. Progestasat, Mirena.

\section*{Mechanism of action of Copper IUCDs}
- Causes a sterile inflammatory reaction in uterine cavity

- Discuss lack of STI/HIV protection

\section*{Myths about sterilization}

\section*{Females}
- Loss of sexual desire
- Eggs build up in the body
- Menstruation as a sign of fertility
- Simple reversal by reuniting tubes

\section*{Males}
- Vasectomy being equal to castration
- Quantity of ejaculate reduced
- Loss of male physical traits or strength

\section*{Fertility Awareness based methods}
- Identify fertile window of the menstrual cycle
- Includes several days before ovulation and one day after
- Ovulation occurs close to the middle of the cycle
- Timing of the ovulation varies from woman to woman and from cycle to cycle
- Abstinence or barrier methods used during the fertile time

\section*{FAB Methods contd}
- Fertile window may be identified through:
- Observing fertility signs - (symptothermal method, cervical mucus method, Two day method)
- Monitoring cycle days - (calender method, standard days method)
- Pregnancy rates:
- Perfect use - 1-9\%; typical use - 12-25\%

\section*{Standard Days Method (SDM)}
- Appropriate for women whose cycle lies between 26 and 32 days long
- Uses cycle beads to identify their fertile days
- Users consider themselves fertile on days 8-19 of the cycle
- Effectiveness 95\% correct use, 88\% typical use
- Low cost, requires partner cooperation

\section*{Lactation amenorrhoea method}
- Temporary option
- Used by postpartum women who:
- Are less than 6 months postpartum
- Are fully or nearly fully breastfeeding
- Have no menses
- Is safe, convenient and effective
