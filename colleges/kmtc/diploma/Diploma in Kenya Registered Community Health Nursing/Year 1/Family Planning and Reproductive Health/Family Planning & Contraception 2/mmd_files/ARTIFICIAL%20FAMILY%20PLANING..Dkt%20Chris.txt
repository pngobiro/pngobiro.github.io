- Concepts and principles of counselling in Family Planning

\section*{Introduction}
$\checkmark$ Definition :Family planning is the ability of an individual or couple to decide when to have children how many children they desire in a family and how to space their children.
$\checkmark$ It is a means of promoting the health of women and families.
$\checkmark$ Family planning is part of a strategy to reduce the high maternal, infant and child mortality and morbidity.
$\checkmark$ Family planning is also a critical component of reproductive health programs.

\section*{Rationale For Family Planning}
1) FP contributes to improving children's health and ensuring that they have access to adequate food, clothing, housing, and educational opportunities.
2) It allows families, especially women, the time to adequately participate in development activities.
3) Allows women and men the freedom to control the number, spacing and the time at which they have children

\section*{Cont'}
4) Helps women and their families preserve their health and fertility and also contributes to improve the overall quality of their lives.

\section*{History of family planning in Kenya}
- The population of Kenya can be classified as "very young"
- It means that at least two thirds of the population is composed of people under 30 years and only 5 percent of the population is above 60 years
- It is due to persistent high fertility that has resulted in a relatively large and increasing youthful population

\section*{Cont'}
- Kenya was the first county in sub-Saharan Africa to establish a National Family Planning programme in 1967
- Between 1977 and 1998, Kenya registered a rapid increase in contraceptive use and a substantial decline in fertility - from an average of 8.1 children per woman in 1977 to 4.7 in 1998
- The contraceptive prevalence rate (CPR) for modern methods increased during this period from a mere $7 \%$ in 1977 to $30 \%$ in 1998.

\section*{Cont'}
$\checkmark$ After 1998, however, the increase in contraceptive use and decline in fertility lostmomentum.
$\checkmark$ Between 1998 and 2003 there was little change in the contraceptive prevalence rate.
$\checkmark$ Meanwhile, the total fertility rate increased from 4.7 in 1998 to 4.9 in 2003 (CBS et al., 2004).
$\checkmark$ It stalled due to inadequate investment in FP, diversion of resources to HIV/ AIDS \& reduced commitment by leaders.

\section*{Cont'}
- According to the Kenya Demographic and Health Survey
- (KDHS) conducted in 2008-2009, contraceptive use has once again registered a significant increase - to $46 \%$ from $39 \%$ in 2003
- The modest decline in fertility from 4.9 births per woman in 2003 to 4.6 in 2008-2009
- However in the last decade there has been tremendous decline in fertility rate to 2.8 births per woman in 2018

\section*{Cont'}
- Currently, the unmet need for family planning currently stands at (18\%)
- It has been attributed to lack of adequate access to FP services at community and facility level, sporadic insecurity of FP commodities and inadequate funding of FP programs.

\section*{Introduction To Fp}

\section*{DEFINITION OF TERMS RELATED TO FP:}
1)Artificial Family Planning Methods refers to a variety of methods used also to plan or prevent pregnancy but are not dependent on a woman's fertile days.
2)Birth control-Voluntary limitation or control/regulation of the number of children conceived, especially by planned use of contraceptive techniques.
3) Contraceptive Prevalence Rate (CPR)- The percentage of married women of reproductive age (15-49) who are using any method of family planning, whether modern or traditional, to space or limit births.
4) Total Fertility Rate $(T F R)$ : The number of children that would be born alive to a woman during her lifetime, taken as an average of a given group of women of reproductive age (15-49 years).
5) Unmet Need For Fp: Term used in the context of family planning where a married woman of reproductive age wants to either space or limit births and is not using any method of family planning, despite the fact that she is sexually active.
6) Reproductive Health: State of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity, in all matters relating to the reproductive system, its functions and processes.
7) Reproductive Rights: Rights, embracing certain basic human rights that are already recognized in Kenyan law and in international human rights documents. These include:-
- The right of the youth to receive adequate information on family planning
- The right of couples to determine responsibly and freely the number of children they would want to have and how to space them.

\section*{Cont'}
- The right of HIV/AIDS infected individuals to receive health care without being discriminated against due to their state, and the right of the spouse or partner to know that their spouse is infected.
- Reproductive rights embrace the medical protocols regarding consent and confidentiality.

\section*{NOTE!!!}

\section*{- The National Policy for Population and Sustainable}

Development makes it dear that abortion will not be used as a method of family planning in Kenya and every attempt will be made to eliminate the need for abortion through reliable information, counselling and services

\section*{COUNSELLING IN FP}

\section*{DEFINITION:}
- It is a person-to-person interaction in which the counsellor provides adequate information to enable the client to make an informed choice about the course of action best for him or her.
- Counseling is the act of working with a patient to help them clarify personal goals and find ways of overcoming their problems with the aim of assisting the individual to change behaviours that are interfering with attainment of basic needs.

\section*{Cont'}
- In FP, counselling is viewed as the art whereby the service provider guides/assists a patient to make an informed choice in matters regarding their RH needs, taking into account all the surrounding circumstances and the patient's personal needs at the time.

\section*{ESSENTIALS OF GOOD COUNSELLING}

A good counsellor is trained to:
$\checkmark$ Understand and respect the client's rights.
$\checkmark$ Earn the client's trust.
$\checkmark$ Understand the benefits \& limitations of all contraceptive methods.
$\checkmark$ Understand the cultural \&emotional factors that affect a client's (or a couple's) decision to use a particular contraceptive method.
$\checkmark$ Encourage the client to ask questions.
$\checkmark$ Use a nonjudgmental approach, which shows respect and consideration to the client.
$\checkmark$ Present information in an unbiased, client-sensitive manner
$\checkmark$ Actively listen to the client's concerns.
$\checkmark$ Understand the effect of nonverbal communication.
$\checkmark$ Recognise when she or he cannot sufficiently help a client and refer the client to someone who can.

For counselling to be effective, observe the following:
$\checkmark$ The right to make an informed decision
$\checkmark$ Process should be confidential
$\checkmark$ Process must be truthful
$\checkmark$ Freedom of expression
$\checkmark$ Genuine communication without emotional involvement
$\checkmark$ Auditory and visual privacy
$\checkmark$ Receptive atmosphere
$\checkmark$ Recognize limitations and refer when necessary

\section*{Benefits of counseling}
- Counseling is a vital part of RH care. It helps patients to:
- Arrive at an informed choice of RH options
- Select a contraceptive method with which they are satisfied
- Use the chosen method safely and effectively

\section*{Client Rights}
$\checkmark$ The right to decide whether or not to practise FP
$\checkmark$ The freedom to choose which method to use
$\checkmark$ The right of privacy and confidentiality
$\checkmark$ The right to refuse any type of examination

\section*{STEPS IN COUNSELLING A PATIENT FOR FP}

There are six steps used in counseling a family planning patient.
$\checkmark$ Greet, welcome and make the client feel comfortable. Establish a good rapport.
$\checkmark$ Ask the patient about themselves and any FP experiences. Get all the information about the patient
$\checkmark$ Tell patient of the available methods and reproductive choices.
- Help the patient make informed choices through history taking, general examination and finding out the real needs.

Avoid biases.
- Explain in detail the method of choice and give detailed instructions on how
to use the method.
- Return visits explained and discussion encouraged

Greet, welcome and make the patient feel comfortable. Establish a good rapport.

Ask the patient about themselves and any FP experiences. Get all the information about the patient.

T
Tell the patient of the available methods and reproductive choices.

H
Help the patient make informed choices through history taking, general examination and finding out the real needs. Avoid biases.

Explain in detail the method of choice and give detailed instructions on how to use the method.

R
Return visits explained and discussion encouraged.
- The service provider should review all the available contraceptive methods that the patient may choose from.
- The counsellor should be aware of the following factors about each patient that may be important, depending on the method to be used:
-The reproductive goal of the woman or couple (spacing or timing of births)

\section*{Cont'}
- Personal factors including the time, travel costs, pain or discomfort likely to be experienced
- Accessibility and availability of other products that are necessary to use the method
- The need for protection against STIs and HIV/AIDS

There are three phases of counseling in FP:
- 1. INITIAL COUNSELLING
- Carried out at reception
- Provider describe all the methods available
- Provider help the patient to choose the method appropriate for themselves.

\section*{Cont'}

\section*{2. METHOD SPECIFIC COUNSELLING}
- Carried out prior to \& immediately following service provision.
- Provider need to give instructions to the patient on how to use the method chosen.
- The possible common side effects specific to the method and actions against these effects discussed.
3. FOLLOW UP COUNSELING
$\checkmark$ counseling occurs during the return visit.
$\checkmark$ Ask the patient about method use, satisfaction
$\checkmark$ Ask any problems that may have occurred.

\section*{Within the context of HIV/AIDS, FP counseling should address the following concerns:}
- Whether the chosen FP method protects against STIs, including HIV
- Safety of the FP method when used by a person living with HIV/AIDS.
- Interactions between contraceptive methods \& some drugs used in treatment for HIV/AIDS, including ARVs \& antiTB drugs

\section*{Cont'}
- Knowledge \& guidance on dual protection practices, emphasizing consistent \& correct use of condoms or abstinence as the most effective means of protection.
- In this regard, appropriate counseling messages depend on the HIV status of the client or couple

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline HIV status of couple & Key counseling messages and emphases \\
\hline Concordant HIVnegative & Use effective contraception. Be faithful. \\
\hline Discordant (one partner HIV-positive) & \begin{tabular}{l}
Use effective contraception. Use condoms for protection of partner. \\
Get medical care and support.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline Concordant HIV-positive & \begin{tabular}{l}
Use effective contraception. Be faithful. \\
Use condoms to avoid infection with new HIV variants. \\
Get medical care and support.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\section*{BARRIERS THAT HINDER COUNSELLING}
$\checkmark$ Age differences
$\checkmark$ Language barrier
$\checkmark$ Educational level
$\checkmark$ Lack of privacy
$\checkmark$ Lack of confidentiality
$\checkmark$ Inappropriate nonverbal behavior
$\checkmark$ Judgmental attitude
$\checkmark$ Religious differences \& gender biases

\section*{HOW TO BE REASONABLY SURE THAT A CLIENT IS NOT PREGNANT}

You can be reasonably sure a patient is not pregnant when she has no clinical features of pregnancy \& exhibits the following
$\checkmark$ Has had no intercourse since her last menses
$\checkmark$ Is within seven days after the start of her menses
$\checkmark$ Is within four weeks postpartum (for non-breast feeding women)
$\checkmark$ Is within seven days post abortion

Cont'
$\checkmark$ correctly consistently using another reliable contraceptive method
$\checkmark$ Is exclusively breast feeding less than six months post partum and has had no menstrual bleeding
- Pregnancy testing is not essential except in the following cases:
1) The woman answered "no" to all questions on the pregnancy checklist.
2) It is difficult to confirm pregnancy (i.e., it is six weeks or less from the LMP).
3) The results of the pelvic examination are equivocal (e.g., the client is overweight, making it difficult to size the uterus).

\section*{Cont'}
$\checkmark$ In these situations, a sensitive urine pregnancy test or ultrasound scan might be helpful if it is readily available and affordable.
$\checkmark$ If pregnancy testing is not available,
a) Counsel the client to use barrier methods
b) Or abstain from intercourse until her menses occurs or pregnancy is confirmed.

Specific examinations and tests provider might perform include:
$\checkmark$ Breast examination
$\checkmark$ Pelvic and genital examination
$\checkmark$ Cervical cancer screening
$\checkmark$ Routine laboratory tests
$\checkmark$ Haemoglobin test
$\checkmark$ STI risk assessment: medical history and physical examination
$\checkmark$ STI/HIV screening: laboratory tests
$\checkmark$ Blood pressure screening

\section*{Note!}
- No contraceptive method with the exception of condoms (and the diaphragm to a lesser degree), provides protection against Genital Tract Infections (GTIs) and other STIs such as Hepatitis B or HIV/AIDS.
- During the counseling sessions, explain to all patients the risks of GTI and STI transmission.

\section*{Potential clients for FP}
- These are clients who are at risk of having unplanned pregnancies:
-Married couples
- The youth
- Men and women of reproductive age ( $15 \mathrm{yrs}-49 \mathrm{yrs}$ )

\section*{Essential messages given to FP clients}
$\checkmark$ Explain all the available methds \& the expected side effects
$\checkmark$ Physical examination including breast examination, pelvicspeculum \& bimanual exam after detailed history taking \& counseling
$\checkmark$ Tailored counseling for informed choice, explaining about the method chosen
$\checkmark$ Tell the importance of follow-up visits

\section*{Cont'}
- Identify \& teach common infections found in the FP clinics
e.g:

○Bacterial-syphilis, chanchroid, chlamydia
○Viral-Hep B, HIV, genital warts
- Parasites-trichomonas, scabies
- Fungal-moniliasis, candidiasis

\section*{FACTORS THAT LEAD CLIENTS TO FP ACCEPTANCE}
$\checkmark$ IEC( information, education $\checkmark$ Social reasons-to fit in a certain and counseling) awareness social class has been created $\checkmark$ Religious reasons
$\checkmark$ Economic reasons- to support $\checkmark$ Beliefs, values, customs and the family adequately taboosfinancially
$\checkmark$ Self esteem
$\checkmark$ Gender sensitivity
$\checkmark$ Employment
$\checkmark$ Health reasons
$\checkmark$ Couple's own choice
$\checkmark$ Peer pressure

\section*{BENEFITS OF FP}

\section*{Medical Benefits}

Medical benefits differ depending on the target population. Some of the benefits of family planning for women are;
- Their health is better as they are protected against unwanted pregnancy, hence death related to high risk pregnancy and abortion is reduced.
- Some methods, such as the hormonal method, have additional (noncontraceptive) benefits, including the reduction of anaemia and cancer of the genital tract.
- Barrier methods minimize the transmission of STIs and HIV/AIDS if used properly.
- Mothers become healthier as they avoid the extremes of maternal age and carry their pregnancies within the optimal child bearing age bracket of 19 to 35 years, before and after which the mothers are at high risk of developing complications related to pregnancy.
- There is a decrease in the risks of abortion as the baby is welcome and the mother well prepared physically and psychologically for the pregnancy.
- There are reduced fertility and mortality rates.
- There are improved health facilities and death related to pregnancy and childbirth is reduced.

There are also medical advantages to the children;
- Children are healthier, since the optimum spacing between births is 27 to 38 months, giving the mother the time to nurse and care for the infant.
- The death related to infections and malnutrition to the under fives is reduced.

\section*{Social Benefits}

The social benefits related to family planning are numerous;
- There is an improved relationship with the spouse and family due to less stress and better social life.
- Socially healthy families are productive and economically more stable as they participate in community development and nation building.
- Women learn to make informed choices.

\section*{National Benefits}

There are several benefits associated with family planning on a national level.
- The country is able to budget for its citizens as the birth rate will be controlled.
- Nationally reduced fertility and mortality rates lessen the burden to the nation

\section*{DISADVANTAGES OF FP}
- The mother forgets her natural role of parenting
- There is an urge for another baby \& regrets the period of waiting esp. if she compares self with other women of the same status
- The man feels hopeless \& experiences a feeling of reduced manhood
- Family labour force is reduced, security is interfered with \& young children run errands

\section*{To the community:}
- Major activities are managed by old people as there are less young people to take over the work

\section*{To the nation}
- A lot of funds will be spent importing labour \& caring for old people \& also money will be spent on research on acceptance \& awareness of $f p$

\section*{PRINCIPLES OF FP}
- Fp clients are not sick \& rarely need evalution of their health but need help in understanding their own reproductive health
- Fp clients need simple clear information to help them make informed decisions
- The success of fp continuity \& effectiveness depends on proper counseling \& instruction on method of choice
- The client must know the needs which must be met or fulfilled by service provider eg understanding own contraceptive needs which are:
- Info about all available methods
-Info on the method chosen
- Informed consent
- Instructions on method use \& continuity
- The service provider must know his/her roles in order to meet with client needs satisfactory eg;
-Hx taking
- Interviewing
- Tailored counseling
- PE
- Help client choose most suitable method
- Ensure informed consent
- Provide the method chosen
- Give client instructions 4 use, ensure safety, continuity \& follow-up
- Clients using methods best suitable to their needs will be these clients most satisfied \& happy to continue practicing fp
- Service providers giving quality care to their clients are happy to have a job satisfaction

\section*{CATEGORY I:}
- Men or women with no surgical or medical condition(s) which would make the method ineffective or worsen the condition. No contraindication

\section*{CATEGORY II:}
- Men \& women with surgical \& medical conditions which cannot be worsened by method used or make the method ineffective but the benefits generally outweigh the risks e.g. HTN, mild toxic goitre, mild varicose veins. No contraindication but observe

\section*{CATEGORY III:}
- Men \& women with medical \& surgical conditions which can or may be worsened by method used or make method ineffective where the risks outweigh the benefits e.g. DM, TB, epilepsy, cardiac disease. Give proper DR. follow up=relative contraindication

\section*{CATEGORY IV:}
- Men \& women with medical \& surgical conditions worsened by method used or make the method ineffective. Do not give! E.g. in pregnancy, severe liver disease, undiagnosed vaginal bleedings, reproductive health cancers=absolute contraindication

\section*{PRE-REQUISITE FOR PROVISION OF FP}
1. Counseling- FP, HIV/AIDS, VCT, PMTCT
2. Provision of contraceptives
3. Follow up referral system- inform client of return dates \& importance of follow up
4. Record keeping. Proper records must be maintained on clients, distribution of contraceptives as per the MOH record keeping guidelines

\section*{Cont'}
5. Supervision. Ensure that the guidelines are followed \& that the needs of clients are met. Facilitative supervision should be encouraged
6. Logistics-maintenance of proper logistic system should be maintained
7. Cost consideration in terms of time \& cost of commodities

\section*{RECORD KEEPING}
- All FP providers should maintain proper records on each client and the distribution of contraceptives.
- Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and the private sector also should follow the Ministry of Health's record-keeping and service provision guidelines

\section*{SUPERVISION}
- Supervision is an essential component of programme monitoring and evaluation
- It ensures that guidelines are being followed and clients' needs are being met.
- Facilitative (supportive) supervision should be encouraged, and the supervisor should be seen as a team member who motivates staff and guarantees the rights of providers and clients.
- Supervision activities should extend to private-sector facilities.

\section*{LOGISTICS}
$\checkmark$ Service providers are expected to have a consistent supply of methods available in order to offer a choice to clients.
$\checkmark$ The Kenya Medical Supplies Agency (KEMSA) is responsible for the procurement, storage, and distribution of contraceptive commodities through warehouses

\section*{RECOMMENDED INFECTION CONTROL MEASURES}
$\checkmark$ Consider every client and staff potentially infectious
$\checkmark$ Wash hands b4 \& after procedure
$\checkmark$ Wear gloves when touching anything wet egg broken skin, mucus membrane, blood \& other body fluids
$\checkmark$ Use safe practices eg not recapping needles or bending them, passing sharp instruments safely
$\checkmark$ proper disposal of medical waste
$\checkmark$ Isolate patients when secretions and excretion cannot be maintained

\section*{PHYSICAL EXAMINATION}

The main objective of carrying out a patient assessment is
$\checkmark$ That the patient is not pregnant
$\checkmark$ If any conditions requiring additional care for a method exist
$\checkmark$ Whether there are any special problems that require further assessment, treatment or regular follow up or referral
$\checkmark$ Whether there are need for HIV/AIDs services and, if so, to provide the services or arrange the appropriate referral

Special procedures a patient may go through to enhance her good reproductive health include:
-General physical examination
-Breast examination
-Pelvic examination
-Papanicolau smear
- A physical examination should be performed either as part of a routine medical examination or in case of sickness.
- You are expected to carry out a systematic head to toe examination, noting:
- Health status
- Nutritional status
- Behavior
- Mental state
- Speech \& Ability to walk
- Do a breast examination by inspection, palpation \& expression \& teach on self breast examination
- Pelvic assessment- do a speculum exam then bimanual or digital exam then a pap smear if indicated

\section*{Clients' Rights}
- Information
- Service providers should ensure that clients receive adequate information regarding the services provided

Access to Services
- All clients, including adolescents and PwDs, have the right to FP services at all levels of care

Informed Choice
- Clients should be counseled on the range of contraceptive options and methods that are available at all levels of care, and should be provided with accurate and complete information to enable them to make an informed decision.
- Safety of Services
- Service providers should adhere to infection-prevention practices $\&$ client instructions for effective use of the contraceptive

Dignity, Comfort, Expression of Opinion
- Clients should be treated with dignity and friendliness.

Precautions should be taken to ensure minimal discomfort.
Clients' opinions should be sought and their wishes respected
- Continuity of Care
- The clients' records and follow-ups should be accurately and completely documented to ensure appropriate client management and clinical safety.
- Privacy and Confidentiality
- Care should be individualized and discrete. Clients should be protected from both auditory and visual exposure.
- Client information should be protected from access by anyone who is not directly involved in his or her care.

\section*{Provider Staff's Needs}

\section*{Supportive Supervision and Management}
- The work environment and facilitative supervisory system should be supportive and emphasise mentoring and joint problem solving. The system should help staff provide the best possible FP services

Information, Training, and Development
- Staff should be knowledgeable and skilled in providing FP, and have ongoing opportunities for training to update and maintain a high level of performance

Supplies, Equipment, and Infrastructure
- Staff should have sufficient and appropriate supplies, instruments, and logistics infrastructure to ensure uninterrupted FP services and the safety of service providers
- Contraceptive Technology

4) Vasectomy
A) Traditional family planning
$\checkmark$ Before the advent of modern contraceptives and up until the present time traditional methods are used worldwide.
$\checkmark$ The efficacy of these methods can not be guaranteed unless certain procedures are followed.
$\checkmark$ There are three types of traditional family planning methods:
a) Locational amenorrhea method (LAM)
- Is the use of breast-feeding as a contraceptive method.
- Its based on the physiologic effect of suckling to suppress ovulation.
- To use breast-feeding effectively as a contraceptive for 6 months after delivery requires exclusive breast feeding.

Advantages
- Contraceptive
$\checkmark$ Highly effective (1-2 pregnancies per 100 women get pregnant
$\checkmark$ Effective immediately
$\checkmark$ Does not interfere with intercourse
$\checkmark$ No systemic side effects
$\checkmark$ No medical supervision necessary
$\checkmark$ No supplies required
$\checkmark$ No cost involved
- Noncontraceptive

For the Child
$\checkmark$ Passive immunization (transfer of protective antibodies)
$\checkmark$ Best source of nutrition
$\checkmark$ Decreased exposure to contaminants in water, other milk or formulas, or on utensils

\section*{Cont'}

For the mother
$\checkmark$ Decreased postpartum bleeding
$\checkmark$ Accelerates involution
$\checkmark$ Increases bonding between mother and child

\section*{Disadvantages}
$\checkmark$ User-dependent (requires following instructions regarding breastfeeding practices)
$\checkmark$ May be difficult to practice due to social circumstances
$\checkmark$ Highly effective only until menses return or up to 6 months
$\checkmark$ Does not protect against STDs (e.g., HBV, HIV/AIDS)
$\checkmark$ Women who are fully (or nearly fully) breast feeding, whose babies are less than 6 months old and whose menses have not returned.
- Who should not use LAM?
$\checkmark$ Women whose menses have returned
$\checkmark$ Women who are not fully breast feeding
$\checkmark$ Women whose babies are more than 6 months old

\section*{Client Instructions}
- For LAM to be effective breast feed the baby on demand about 610 times/day and at least once during the night .
- No more than 6 hours should pass between any two feeds .
- Keep supply of lubricated condoms or other form of contraceptive
- If any of the following occurs consult your health care provider to start other contraceptive methods

\section*{Cont'}
a) If menses returns
b) If you no longer breast-feed fully or
c) if your baby is 6 months old.
d) If you or your partner are at risk of STDs use condoms.

\section*{b. Abstinence}
- Abstinence is a very effective and acceptable method of FP
- Its major problem is that it is only effective if followed without exception.
- Also for many couples, going without sex is not an acceptable
- While abstinence could be encouraged, the provider must deal non-judgmentally with a client who wishes to or already engages in premarital sex.

\section*{Cont'}
- It is important that the patient knows the dangers of unprotected sex which include
$\checkmark$ HIV/AIDS,
$\checkmark$ unwanted pregnancy,
$\checkmark$ unsafe abortion
$\checkmark$ pelvic infection
$\checkmark$ cultural isolation.

\section*{c. Coitus Interruptus}
- Coitus interruptus is the withdrawal of the penis just before ejaculation occurs so that sperm does not go into the vagina.
- It is not a reliable method because there is often preejaculation leakage of sperm which can often lead to pregnancy.
- Therefore, this is not a method that can be recommended

\section*{B) Natural Family Planning Methods (NFP)}
- Aka. fertility awareness methods (FAM)
- Are methods which use the body's natural physiological changes and symptoms to identify the fertile and infertile phases of the menstrual cycle.
- The effective use depends on the client's ability to use calendars, write on charts, \& read thermometer
- Not recommended to a population with low resources and a low rate of literacy.

\section*{Cont'}
- There are 4 main types:
a) The rhythm or calendar method
b) The basal body temperature (BBT)
c) The cervical mucus method (Billings ovulation ) and
d) The sympto-thermal method (combination of BBT and Billings Method)

\section*{Advantages of NFP}

\section*{Contraceptive}
$\checkmark$ Can be used to avoid or achieve pregnancy
$\checkmark$ No method-related health risks
$\checkmark$ No systemic side effects
$\checkmark$ Inexpensive
- Noncontraceptive
$\checkmark$ Promotes male involvement in family planning
$\checkmark$ Improves knowledge of reproductive system
$\checkmark$ Possible closer relationship for couple

\section*{Disadvantages of FP}
$\checkmark$ Moderately effective as a contraceptive (9-20 pregnancies per 100 women during the first year of use)
$\checkmark$ Not recommended for women with irregular cycles
$\checkmark$ Effectiveness depends on willingness to follow instructions
$\checkmark$ Considerable training required to use the most effective types of NFP correctly

\section*{Cont'}
$\checkmark$ Requires abstinence during fertile phase
$\checkmark$ Requires daily record keeping
$\checkmark$ Vaginal infections make cervical mucus difficult to interpret
$\checkmark$ Basal thermometer needed for some methods
$\checkmark$ Does not protect against STDs (e.g., HBV, HIV/AIDS)

\section*{a. The Calendar Method}
- A woman must keep a monthly record of the days she menstruates.
- With the help of a qualified natural family planning counsellor she can estimate when she is most likely to get pregnant if she has sex.

\section*{Method}

To calculate the fertile period:
$\checkmark$ Monitor the length of at least 6 menstrual cycles while abstaining or using another contraceptive methods.
$\checkmark$ Then calculate the fertile days period by the following method
$\checkmark$ From the number of days in the longest cycle, subtract 11 . This identifies the last fertile day of the cycle.
$\checkmark$ From the number of days in the shortest cycle, subtract 18 . This identifies the first fertile day of the cycle.

\section*{Example:}
$\checkmark$ Longest cycle: 30 days minus $11=19$
$\checkmark$ Shortest cycle: 26 days minus $18=8$
$\checkmark$ the fertile period is calculated to be days 8 through 19 of your cycle
$\checkmark$ Abstain from sexual intercourse during the fertile days.
$\checkmark$ N.B- Day 1 is the first day of menstrual flow.
b. The Basal Body Temperature (BBT) Method
- The hormone progesterone which the ovaries secrete after ovulation induces a slight rise in body temperature
- This temp which is maintained until menstruation .
- The fertile phase of the menstrual cycle can be determined by taking accurate measurements of the basal body temperature to determine this shift.

\section*{Method}
$\checkmark$ Take body temp at about the same time each morning (before rising)
$\checkmark$ record the temp on the chart provided by the NFP instructor.
$\checkmark$ Use the temperature recorded on the chart for the first 10 days of the menstrual cycle to identify the highest of the "normal, low" temperatures
- Disregard any temperatures that are abnormally high due to fever or other disruptions.
- Draw a line $0.05-0.10 \mathrm{C}$ above the highest of these 10 temperatures.
- This line is the cover line or temperature line.
- The infertile phase or safe period begins on the evening of the third consecutive day that the temperature stays above the cover line (thermal shift rule).

\end{tabular}
- If any of the temp fall on or below the cover line during the 3 day count, it may be a sign that ovulation has not yet occurred
- To avoid pregnancy, wait until 3 consecutive temp are recorded above the cover line before resuming intercourse.
- After the infertile phase begins, it is not necessary to keep taking temp.
- You may stop until the next menstrual cycle begins \& continue to have intercourse until the 1st of the next menstrual period.

\section*{c. Cervical Mucus (Billings) Method}
$\checkmark$ The cervical mucus method is based on detecting the changes in cervical mucus secretions and sensations in the vagina.
$\checkmark$ Before ovulation, the cervical mucus becomes slippery and stretchy.
$\checkmark$ The mucus changes are greatest around the time of ovulation.
$\checkmark$ After ovulation, cervical mucus becomes thick or may disappear completely.

\section*{Cont'}
- A couple using this method to avoid pregnancy abstain from intercourse when the mucus indicates the woman is fertile.
- They also abstain during menstrual bleeding.
- These couples should avoid intercourse on alternating days before the appearance of cervical mucus so that the presence of semen in the vagina does not change the natural appearance of the mucus.

\section*{Cont'}
$\checkmark$ The woman checks her vaginal discharge every day for consistency.
$\checkmark$ When it is very elastic and thin it indicates that she is about to ovulate.
$\checkmark$ From this she can know when to abstain from sex.
$\checkmark$ The reliability of the mucus method is $97 \%$ or better.

\section*{Mechanism of action}
$\checkmark$ A simple accurate record is the key to success
$\checkmark$ A series of codes is used to complete the record.
$\checkmark$ These codes should be both appropriate to local culture and widely available to NFP users.
$\checkmark$ In some areas, coloured stamps or inks are used ;in others, it is more convenient to develop symbols that are written by hand

Examples
$\checkmark$ Use a symbol * to show bleeding
$\checkmark$ Use the letter D to show dryness
$\checkmark$ Use the letter M with a circle around it or show wet, clear, slippery, fertile mucus
$\checkmark$ Use the letter M to show sticky, white, and cloudy in fertile mucus.

\section*{Definitions}
- Dry days: After menstrual bleeding ends, most women have one to a few days in which no mucus is observed and the vaginal area feels dry.
- Fertile days: When any type of mucus is observed before ovulation, she is considered to be fertile.
- Whenever mucus is seen, even if the mucus is of a sticky, pasty type, the wet fertile mucus may be present in the cervix and fertile days have started.
- Peak day: The last day of slippery and wet mucus is called the peak day; it indicates that ovulation is near or has just taken place.

- Collect data about frequency of coitus, number of sexual partners \& her or her partner's objection to any method
- Assess her level of comfort \& willingness to touch her genital area esp. where thorough physical exam is needed
- Identify misconceptions as well as religious or cultural factors, paying close attention to her verbal \& no-verbal responses to hearing about the various available methods
- Consider her reproductive life span
- Take complete Hx pertaining:- menstrual hx , contraceptive hx \& obstetric hx \& physical exam

\section*{NURSING DIAGNOSIS- ARTIFICIAL CONTRACEPTION.}
- Decisional conflict RT contraceptive alternatives \& partner's unwillingness to a contraceptive method
- Fear RT contraceptive methods side effects
- Risk of infection RT unprotected sexual intercourse, use of contraceptive method and/ or broken skin or mucous membrane after surgery or IUCD insertion
- Acute pain RT post- op recovery after sterilization
- Deficient knowledge RT contraceptive options ....
- Readiness for enhanced childbearing process RT couple's ability to choose a contraceptive method...
- Risk of infection RT post IUCD insertion/non-adherence to aseptic principles
- Risk for spiritual distress RT choice of an artificial family planning method.

\section*{EXPECTED OUTCOME}

The expected outcome includes that the woman or couple will:
- Verbalize understanding about contraceptive methods
- Verbalize understanding of all information necessary to give informed consent
- Use the contraceptive method correctly \& consistently
- Experience no advanced consequences as a result of the chosen method
- Prevent unplanned pregnancy or plan a pregnancy

\section*{INTERVENTIONS}
- Implement the appropriate teaching for the appropriate contraceptive method
- Have the woman perform a return demonstration to assess her understanding
- Give written instructions \& telephone No. for questions
- Offer an opportunity for her to return for further questions

\section*{EVALUATION}
- Care is effective when the patient- centered expected outcomes have been achieved by:-
- The woman \& her partner have learnt about the various method of contraception
- The couple achieves pregnancy only when planned
- They have no adverse complications as a result of the method chosen

\section*{HORMONAL CONTRACEPTIVES}

\section*{INTRODUCTION:}
- Hormonal contraceptives are among the most widely used FP methods worldwide. In Kenya, nearly 75 percent of all women using modern contraceptives choose hormonal methods, with 32 percent and 61 percent choosing the Pill and injectable contraceptives, respectively
- They contain synthetic hormones ( a combination of oeastrogen \& progesterone or progesterone alone).
- Work primarily by preventing ovulation and making the cervical mumcous too thick for sperm penetration
- The following hormonal methods are commonly available in Kenya:
- Combined oral contraceptives (COCs)
- Progestin-only contraceptive pills (POPs)
- Progestin-only injectable contraceptives (DMPA, NET-EN)
- Progestin-only contraceptive implants (Jadelle, Implanon, Zarin)
- Hormone-releasing intrauterine systems (LNG20-IUS)
- Dedicated products for emergency contraception

\section*{COMBINED ORAL CONTRACEPTIVES}
- Combined Oral Contraceptives (COCs) are made up of a combination of synthetic oestrogen and progesterone hormones.

\section*{TYPES OF COCs}
- The monophasic, which include microgynon, neogynon, eugynon and nordette, contain equal strength of oestrogen and progestin
- Biphasic: contain two (diff dose combinations of oestrogen \& progestin eg in a cycle of 21 active pills, 10 pills may contain one combination while 11 contain another eg biphasil, ovarion, normorvlar
- Triphasics, The active pills contain three different dose combinations of oestrogen and progestin. Out of a cycle of 21 active pills, six might contain one combination, five pills contain another combination, while 10 pills contain other combinations of the same two hormones. Examples include Logynon and Trinordial.

\section*{MOA OF COCs}

COCs act in the following manner:
- Slow down the motility of the fallopian tubes thus delaying implantation
- Delay or inhibit ovulation as the Follicle Stimulation Hormone (FSH) production is suppressed, which inhibits maturation of ovarian follicles
- Mucus is too thick to be penetrated by the sperm
- Endometrium is not well prepared for fertilised ovum due to low oestrogen levels

\section*{CONTRACEPTIVE BENEFITS OF COCS}

As a method of contraception, COCs have many benefits:
- COCs are highly effective and are effective immediately when started within the first five days of the menstrual cycle
- COCs are safe for the majority of women.
- COCs are easy to use.
- COCs can be provided by trained non-clinical service providers.
- A pelvic exam is not required to initiate use of COCs.

\section*{NON-CONTRACEPTIVE HEALTH BENEFITS}

COCs offer several non-contraceptive benefits, too:
- Reduction of menstrual flow (lighter, shorter periods)
- Decrease in dysmenorrhoea (painful periods)
- Reduction of symptoms of endometriosis
- Improvement and prevention of anaemia
- Protection against ovarian and endometrial cancer
- Possible protection from symptomatic pelvic inflammatory disease
- Treatment for acne and hirsutism

\section*{LIMITATIONS OF COCS}
- The effect is lowered by other drugs, such as anti-tuberculosis and anti-epileptic drugs
- There can be serious side effects though these are rare (for example, stroke, myocardial infarction, venous thrombosis and adenomas)
- They offer no protection against STIs

\section*{INDICATIONS FOR COCs}

\section*{Client instructions}

When recommending pills to a patient you should make sure that you give them the following instructions and that they fully understand:
- Pills should be taken at about the same time each day preferably at night after meals.
- If one pill is missed it should be taken as soon as it is remembered, even if it means taking two pills the next day.
- If the patient has missed two or more pills in any seven day period she should take the pill at once and continue as usual. However, she should also use condoms or spermicide, or avoid sex for seven days.
- If on a 21 day packet pill, the patient should rest for seven days on completion of a packet, then start the next packet on day eight and continue throughout. If on 28 day packet, the pill should be taken continuously.
- The patient should come to the clinic for a follow up, an annual check up and pap smear

\section*{INCASE OF A MISSED PILL,}
- Take the pill as soon as you remember (this means taking 2 in 1 day)
- If 2 pills in a row missed in the $1^{\text {st }} 2$ wks of the pack $\rightarrow$ take 2 /day for 2 days
- If 2 pills in a row missed in the $3^{\text {rd }}$ wk of the pack $\rightarrow$ thraw the remainder of the pack \& start a new one / use back up contraception in the first 7 days of the new pack
- If 3 pills in a row missed $\rightarrow$ follow steps above
- If intercourse occurred after missing a pill $\rightarrow$ use emergency contraception

\section*{SIDE EFFECTS OF COCs}

Be on the look out for the following danger signs/serious side effects which need urgent medical attention:
- Abdominal pain
- Chest pain and breathlessness
- Headaches- frontal in nature
- Eye disturbance such as blurring or flashes
- Severe calf muscle pain

The above mentioned develop suddenly and are severe in nature. The patient should be advised to stop taking the pills, use a back up method of contraception and consult the doctor or visit a clinic immediately.

\section*{Management of Common Side Effects of COCs}

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline Side effect & Management \\
\hline Nausea and dizziness & \begin{tabular}{l}

\end{tabular}

\section*{PROGESTIN ONLY PILLS (POPS)}
- POPs are pills that contain low doses of synthetic progestin.
- They do not suppress production of breast milk

\section*{MOA}
- POPs prevent pregnancy by thickening the cervical mucus, which prevents the passage of sperm, and suppressing ovulation in about 50 percent of cycles.

\section*{Types of POPs}
- The brands commonly available in the public sector and the local market include Microlut, Micronor, Microval, Ovrette, Norgeston, and Noriday.

\section*{CONTRACEPTIVE BENEFITS OF POPS}
- They are highly effective \& safe (POPs have no known health risks).
-Women return to fertility immediately upon discontinuation.
- A pelvic exam is not required to initiate use.
- They can be given to a woman at any time to start later. If pregnancy cannot be ruled out, a provider can give her pills to take later, when her monthly bleeding begins.
- Taking POPs does not affect milk production or breastfeeding.
- It is safe for breastfeeding women and their babies.
- POPs add to the contraceptive effect of breastfeeding. Together, they provide effective pregnancy protection. Typically, pills lengthen the time during which breastfeeding women have no monthly bleeding.
- Taking POPs does not increase blood clotting.

\section*{NON-CONTRACEPTIVE BENEFITS}
- Do not affect breast feeding
- Lighter, shorter periods
- Decrease in breast tenderness
- Do not increase blood clotting
- Decrease dysmenorrhoea
- Protect against endometrial cancer

\section*{LIMITATIONS OF POPS}
- They provide a slightly lower level of contraceptive protection than COCs.
- They require strict daily pill-taking, preferably at the same time each day.
- They do not protect against STIs, including hepatitis B and HIV/AIDS. Therefore, at-risk individuals should use a barrier method to ensure protection against STIs and HIV/AIDS.
- They may lower effectiveness when certain drugs are taken concurrently (e.g., certain anti-tuberculosis, anti-retroviral and anti-epileptic drugs)

\section*{INDICATIONS FOR POPS}
- Women of reproductive age
-Women of any parity, nulliparous included
- Breast feeding mothers after six weeks post partum
- Heavy smokers of any age
- Women who can't use combined oral pills due to oestrogen related contra indications
- Post abortion patients
- Women with sickle cell disease, hypertension, and valvular heart disease

\section*{SIDE EFFECTS OF POPS}
- Irregular spotting or bleeding, frequent or infrequent bleeding, prolonged bleeding, amenorrhea (less common). Bleeding changes are common, but not harmful.
- Headaches, dizziness, nausea.
- Mood changes.
- Breast tenderness (although less common than with COCs).

\section*{CONTRAINDICATIONS}
- Women who are pregnant or suspected to be pregnant
- Women with unexplained abnormal vaginal bleeding
- Women who have breast cancer or history of breast cancer
- Women with active liver disease

\section*{RELATIVE CONTRAINDICATIONS}
- Severe liver cirrhosis
- Active viral hepatitis
- Benign hepatic adenoma

\section*{Management of Common Side Effects of POPs}

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline SIDE EFFECT & MANAGEMENT \\
\hline Spotting & \begin{tabular}{l}
Reassure client that this is common with POP use. \\
Determine if client had vomiting or diarrhoea recently or is taking any drugs that might interact with POPs. If bleeding starts after several months of normal or no monthly bleeding, or there are other reasons to suspect pregnancy (e.g., client has missed pills), assess for pregnancy or other underlying conditions. Manage condition or refer client to appropriate level.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline Heavy or prolonged bleeding (twice as much as usual or & \begin{tabular}{l}
Reassure client that some POP users experience this type of bleeding, but it is generally not harmful. \\
For modest relief prescribe 800 mg ibuprofen three times a day for five days (or other NSAID except aspirin). \\
If no relief, suggest other type of POPs if available or help to choose another method.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

Amenorrhoea- If client is breastfeeding, reassure her that it is normal not to have monthly bleedings while breastfeeding.
- If client is not breastfeeding, reassure her that some woman stop having monthly bleeding while taking POPs.
- If there are reasons to suspect pregnancy (e.g., the woman has missed pills), assess for pregnancy. If client is pregnant, advise her to stop using POPs and refer for antenatal care (ANC). If she is not pregnant, reassure her to continue POPs.

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline SIDE EFFECT & MANAGEMENT \\
\hline Headache or dizziness & Determine cause. If no cause is found, counsel client and recommend common painkillers. If headaches worsen while using POPs (e.g., she develops migraines with aura), help client select alternative method. Refer if need be. \\
\hline Abnormal suspicious vaginal bleeding & Evaluate client by history and pelvic examination (refer as necessary), including VIA/ VILI and Pap Smear. Treat or refer for treatment as necessary. \\
\hline Mood changes or nervousness & Counsel client. If condition worsens, help client select alternative methods. \\

\section*{What to Do in the Case of Missed Pill(s)}
- If a woman misses one or more hormonal pills, the primary advice is to take the missed pill as soon as possible and keep taking pills as usual, one each day. She may take two pills at the same time or on the same day

\section*{EMERGENCY HORMONAL CONTRACEPTIVE PILLS (ECPS)}

\section*{Description}
- Emergency contraception (EC) refers to the use of certain contraceptive methods by women to prevent pregnancy after unprotected sexual intercourse.
- Hormonal ECPs must be taken within $\mathbf{1 2 0}$ hours (5days) of intercourse, however, the sooner they are taken, the more effective they are. ECPs provide a second chance for preventing pregnancy after unprotected sex, either accidental, coerced sex or rape
- Depending on the regimen used and number of hours passed since unprotected intercourse, ECPs seem to prevent between 75-95 percent of pregnancies that would otherwise have occurred. The average chance of pregnancy resulting from one act of unprotected intercourse in the second or third week of the menstrual cycle is estimated at 8 percent; after emergency oral contraception, it is $1-2$ percent.

\section*{NOTE:}
*The E-pill should not be used on a regular basis (from month to month) because it is less effective than other methods
ECPs do not work once a woman is pregnant-women and girls who are already pregnant should not take ECPs!

\section*{MOA}
- ECPs work in various ways to prevent pregnancy, largely depending on the time in a woman's cycle when she has sexual intercourse.
- ECPs do not cause abortion because they work before implantation.
- Thus ECPs prevent pregnancy by:
- Preventing or delaying ovulation
- Inhibiting or slowing down transportation of the egg and sperm through the fallopian tubes, which prevents fertilization and implantation
- The success of EC depends on the awareness and knowledge of its availability and efficacy prior to an unprotected, unplanned act.
- The method is only effective if potential users are aware of the method by prior information and counseling.

\section*{Types of ECPs and Dosage}
* Combined Oral Contraceptives (Yuzpe Method)
- These contain the hormones oestrogen and progestin, and they prevent about 75 percent of expected pregnancies. Two standard dosage options are available:
- 50 mcg oestrogen pills (e.g., Eugynon): Two tablets to be taken as soon as possible after unprotected intercourse, but within 120 hours. Repeat the same dose in 12 hours. A total of four pills are required.
- 30 mcg oestrogen pills (e.g., Microgynon): Four tablets to be taken as soon as possible after unprotected intercourse, but within 120 hours. Repeat the same dose in 12 hours. A total of eight pills are required.

Progestin-only Oral Contraceptives
- These dedicated ECPs contain the same progestin hormone (levonorgestrel) as some other progestin-only pills, although in higher doses. They are more effective than the combined pills, preventing up to 95 percent of expected pregnancies. Examples of brands of dedicated ECPs that are available in Kenya are Postinor 2, Pregnon, Smart lady, ECee2, and Truston2.

\section*{THE STANDARD DOSAGE IS AS FOLLOWS:}
- One 750 mcg levonorgestrel pill to be taken as soon as possible after unprotected intercourse, but within 120 hours. Repeat the same dose in 12 hours. A total of two pills are required; or
- Two 750 mcg levonorgestrel pills to be taken as a single dose as soon as possible after unprotected intercourse, but within 120 hours. This regimen is to be preferred because it easier to comply with the one-dose regimen compared to the two-dose regimen
- Regular progestin-only pill (POP) may be used: 20 tablets taken within 120 hours after unprotected intercourse. Repeat the same dose in 12 hours. A total of $\mathbf{4 0}$ pills are required.

\section*{Advantages and Benefits of ECPs}
- It is safe, effective, and easy to use.
- No medical examination or pregnancy tests are necessary or required.
- It can be used at any time during the menstrual cycle.
- ECPs are available in government, private, and NGO health facilities; and over the counter at pharmacies.

\section*{Limitations and Side Effects of ECPs}
- ECPs are only effective if used within 120 hours of unprotected intercourse.
- They are not to be used as a regular method.
- ECPs do not protect against STIs, HIV, or AIDS.
- They can cause nausea (more common for the COC regimen).

\section*{INDICATIONS FOR USE OF ECPS}
- Any woman can use ECPs, however emergency oral contraception should not be used in place of regular FP methods. Therefore, it should be used only in emergency situations such as:
- Sex took place without contraception, and the woman wants to avoid pregnancy.
- A woman has run out of oral contraceptives, has missed two or more POPs, or is more than four weeks late for her DMPA injection, and has had unprotected intercourse.
- A woman has had coerced sexual intercourse, such as rape.
- A condom has broken.
-An IUCD has come out of place.

\section*{Women who can use ECPs with some precautions (category 2)}
- Women with a history of severe cardiovascular complications (e.g. CVA or other thromboembolic conditions)
- Woman with Angina Pectoris
- Women suffering from migraine
- Women with severe liver disease (including jaundice)

\section*{Method Prescription and Use}
- EC pills should be started as soon as possible, but within 120 hours of unprotected sex. The sooner ECPs are used after unprotected intercourse, the more effective they are in preventing pregnancy.

\section*{Management of ECP side effects}

\section*{SIDE EFFECT}

Nausea and vomiting (more common with COC regimen)

\section*{MANAGEMENT}

Women should be counselled (at the time of ECP supply) about the possible occurrence of nausea. For women using combined pills or POPs for EC, an anti-emetic may be used before the pills are taken.

If vomiting occurs within two hours, the woman should repeat the previous ECP dose orally as soon as possible.
If she vomits again, give the dose vaginally, placing the needed dose high up in the vagina.

\section*{Condition}

\section*{Slight irregular bleeding}

\section*{Suggested action}

Reassure women that this is not a sign of pregnancy or other condition.
Irregular bleeding due to ECPs is common and will stop without treatment.

Explain that it is not unusual for the next monthly bleeding to start a few days earlier or later than expected.

Assess for pregnancy if woman's next monthly bleeding is more than one week later than expected

Change in timing of next monthly bleeding

\section*{How to address common questions asked about ECPs}
- What are the effects of ECPs on my periods?

ECPs do not cause periods to start immediately. They will come around the normal time, but could be delayed or early by two or three days.
- Can ECPs protect me for the rest of the cycle?

It will not, and any further unprotected acts put the woman at risk. Women should use a regular method of FP or condoms for further protection
-When can I resume or start a regular FP method after taking EC? A woman can resume or start method, such as pills or condoms, immediately. She has to wait until her next period to begin using injections, IUCDs, and implants.
- Can I use ECPs every time I have unprotected sex?

Women and girls should not use ECPs as a regular method. ECPs should be used only in emergency situations. ECPs are less effective than many regular FP methods
-What if I had sex multiple times before taking ECPs?
A woman can still use ECPs if the last time she had sex was within five days. If a woman is already pregnant from an earlier act of unprotected sex, the ECPs will not have any effect

\section*{INJECTABLE CONTRACEPTIVES}
- Injectable contraceptives contain one or two contraceptive hormones and provide protection from pregnancy for one, two, or three months (depending on the type) following an injection
- The most widely used injectable methods contain only a progestin (Progestin only Injectable Contraceptives or POIC). Less common methods are those that contain both progestin and oestrogen (Combined Injectable Contraceptives or CIC).

\section*{ADVANTAGES OF INJECTABLE CONTRACEPTIVES}

\section*{Contraceptive Benefits}
- They are highly effective and safe.
- A pelvic exam is not required to initiate use.
- They contain no oestrogen, so they do not have the cardiac and blood-clotting effects, which are associated with oestrogencontaining pills and injectables.
- These are long-acting methods:each injection provides protection for two or three months, depending on the type.
- Confidentiality highly maintained

\section*{Non-contraceptive Health Benefits}
- Amenorrhea, which might be beneficial for women with (or at risk of) iron-deficiency anaemia
- Decrease in sickle cell crises
- Reduction of symptoms of endometriosis
- Protection against endometrial cancer
- Protection against uterine fibroids
- Possible protection from symptomatic pelvic inflammatory disease
- Possible prevention of ectopic pregnancy

\section*{LIMITATIONS OF INJECTABLE CONTRACEPTIVES}
- The limitations associated with Injectable contraceptives include:
- Return of fertility may be delayed for about four months or longer after discontinuation.
- They offer no protection against STIs, including hepatitis B and HIV; individuals at risk for these should use condoms in addition to injectable contraceptives.
- This method is provider-based, so a woman must go to a health care facility regularly

\section*{SIDE EFFECTS}
- Menstrual changes, such as:
- irregular bleeding
- heavy and prolonged bleeding
- light spotting or bleeding
- amenorrhea, especially after one year of use
- Weight gain
- Headache
- Dizziness
- Mood swings
- Abdominal bloating
- Decrease in sex drive

\section*{When to Start}
- A woman can start injectables at any time if it is reasonably certain she is not pregnant.
- If she starts using an injectable within seven days after the start of her monthly bleeding, she will not need a back-up method.
- If she starts using an injectable more than seven days after her monthly bleeding, she should use a backup method for the first seven days after injection.

\section*{Giving the Injection}

Providers should follow these guidelines for giving injectable contraceptives:
- Use disposable syringes and needles.
- Do not reuse disposable syringes and needles.
- Observe proper handling and disposal of needles and syringes
- Do not massage the injection site, and instruct the client not to massage or rub the site, as this could cause DMPA to be absorbed too fast.

\section*{CONTRACEPTIVE IMPLANTS}

\section*{Description}
- Contraceptive implants are small rods that are inserted under the skin of a woman's upper arm to release the hormone progestin slowly and prevent pregnancy. Contraceptive implants, which are also called sub-dermal implants, do not contain oestrogen; therefore, they are free from the side effects associated with that hormone. The latest implant to be registered in Kenya is the tworod Sino-implant-II (Zarin).
- Contraceptive implants prevent pregnancy primarily by making cervical mucus too thick for sperm to pass through it, and they also suppress ovulation in many cycles.

\section*{INDICATIONS}

The following categories of women can use implants:
- Women of reproductive age
-Women of any parity, nulliparous included
- Breast feeding mothers after six weeks post partum
- Heavy smokers of any age
-Women who can not use combined oral pills due to oestrogen related contraindications
- Post abortion patients
-Women with sickle cell disease, hypertension or valvular heart disease

\section*{CONTRAINDICATIONS}
- Breast feeding mothers less than six weeks post natal
- Pregnant or suspected to be pregnant
- Women with unexplained abnormal vaginal bleeding

\section*{Contraceptive Benefits of implants}
- Contraception is immediate if inserted within the first seven days of menstrual cycle, or within the first five days for Implanon.
- There is no delay in return to fertility.
- They offer continuous, long-term protection

\section*{Non-contraceptive Health Benefits}
- Implants do not affect breastfeeding.
- They reduce menstrual flow.
- They help prevent ectopic pregnancy (but do not eliminate the risk altogether).
- They protect against iron-deficiency anaemia.
- They help protect from symptomatic PID.

\section*{Limitations \& side effects of contraceptive implants}
- Contraceptive implants must be inserted and removed by trained providers. This requires a minor surgical procedure with appropriate infection prevention practices.
- Common side effects of using implants include menstrual changes, such as irregular light spotting or bleeding, prolonged bleeding, infrequent bleeding, and amenorrhea.
- Non-menstrual side effects include headache, dizziness, nausea, breast tenderness, mood changes, weight change, and mild abdominal pain.
- Contraceptive implants do not protect against STIs including hepatitis B and HIV. Individuals at risk should use condoms in addition to the implants.

\section*{Timing for implant insertion}
- If the woman is having her menstrual cycles;

Insert implant within 7 days after the start of her menstrual bleeding (within the first 5 days for Implanon). No additional contraceptive protection is needed.
$\square$ Insert implant any other time if it is reasonably certain that she is not pregnant. If it has been more than 7 days since menstrual bleeding started (within the first 5 days for Implanon), she will need additional contraceptive protection for the next 7 days (e.g., condoms, FAM, or Coitus Interruptus
- If the woman is amenorrhoeic.

Insert implant any time if it is reasonably certain that she is not pregnant. She will need additional contraceptive protection for the next 7 days

\section*{Instructions to Women}
- After Insertion:

- Return to the clinic if the rods come out or if soreness develops after the removal of the adhesive plaster.
- Return to the clinic if she experiences pain, heat, pus, or redness at the insertion site, or if she sees a rod come out.

Instructions for Clients Following Removal of Implants
Instruct on the foll:
- Keep removal area dry for four to five days.
- Remove the gauze bandage after one or two days, but leave the adhesive plaster in place for an additional five days.
- Return to the clinic if swelling and pain develops after the removal of the adhesive plaster.

\section*{SIDE EFFECTS}
- Amenorrhoea
- Irregular spotting or light bleeding
- Heavy or prolonged bleeding (more than eight days or twice as much as her usual menstrual period)
- Recurrent and persistent headaches especially with blurred vision

\section*{INTRAUTERINE CONTRACEPTIVE DEVICES (IUCDS)}

\section*{Description}
- The IUCD is a flexible device that is inserted into the uterine cavity by a trained service provider. It is a safe and highly effective, longacting contraceptive method.

\section*{Types of IUCDs}
- There are two broad categories of intrauterine contraceptive devices (IUCDs): the copper-based and the hormone-releasing devices.

\section*{MOA:}
- These are plastic or medicated plastic objects designed in different shapes and forms which, when inserted into the uterine cavity, prevent pregnancy.
- Spermatozoa immobility as the movement is hindered.
- Ovum motility increased in the fallopian tube so it reaches the uterus prematurely.
- Prostaglandin produced in the uterine cavity aids in expulsion of the zygote.
- Implantation interfered with, as the IUCD occupies the space.
- Endometrium: there is inflammatory process that is hostile for implantation.

\section*{Contraceptive Benefits}
- High effectiveness and safety
- Immediate effectiveness
- Long-acting protection
- Immediate return of fertility upon removal of device

\section*{Other Benefits}
- IUCDs do not interfere with intercourse.
- Women who are breastfeeding can use IUCDs.
- IUCDs help prevent ectopic pregnancies.
- Women can use IUCDs immediately after delivery
- Help protect frm endometrial cancer
- Do not increase menstrual bleeding

\section*{Limitations of the IUCD}
- The device requires a skilled and competent practitioner to insert it in order to prevent infection during insertion and removal.
- It may increase menstrual flow and cramps for the first few months but the patient will eventually readjust.
- The device does not prevent ectopic pregnancy.
- It does not protect against STIs, HIV/AIDS and Hepatitis.
- The device may be expelled or translocated.
- Perforation may occur if inserted by an unskilled provider.

\section*{INDICATIONS}

The following categories of women can use IUCDs:
- Women of reproductive age irrespective of parity
- Women and partners with low risk of STI
- Breast feeding mothers
- Post natal mothers, where a post partum IUCD is inserted from ten minutes to 48 hours post delivery

\section*{CONTRAINDICATIONS}
- Women who have, or whose partners have, multiple sexual partners
-Women who are pregnant or suspect pregnancy
- Those with current, recent (within three months) or recurrent pelvic inflammatory disease
- Women with anaemia
- Women with unexplained abnormal vaginal bleeding
- Women with cancer of the reproductive organs
- Women with congenital uterine abnormalities or fibroids, which distort the uterine cavity
- Recent septic abortion (in the past three months)

\section*{Client instructions}
- She should observe good personal hygiene to prevent infection.
- She may have increased cramps and bleeding for the first three months. Advise her to use analgesics if pain is severe but reassure her that she will adjust with time. Ask her to come to the clinic if pain and bleeding are excessive.
- During menses, check pads before throwing them away to confirm the device has not been expelled.
- Check on IUCD threads once every month after menses while bathing.
- The IUCD failure rate is $1 \%$.
- The first review will be at six months, then yearly when general physical examination and Pap smear are done.

\section*{DANGER SIGNS TO BE REPORTED IN THE CLINIC INCLUDE:}
- These include pelvic pain or painful intercourse, which means the IUCD could be dislodged.
- Any unusual bleeding or bad vaginal discharge could be indications of an infection.
- A missed period or other signs of pregnancy and missing IUCD strings should also be reported

\section*{IUCD Insertion procedure}

The following procedure is to be adhered to when inserting the IUCD.
- After the bimanual examination, reinsert the second speculum
- Screw after visualising the cervix
- Swab the os with antiseptic using the sponge forceps x three
- Apply tenaculum at 10 to 2 o'clock to position the uterus
- Sound the uterus gently to get the measurements of uterine size
- Load the IUCD while inside the pack and measure per uterine sound results, unpack then, without contamination, insert in situ gently as patient pants

\section*{IUCD INSERTION PROCEDURE CNTD'...}
- Release wings by withdrawing the barrel, remove piston, position IUCD by pushing barrel up again (CUT 380A)
- Withdraw barrel and shorten thread
- Remove tenaculum
- Clean cervix with antiseptic and arrest bleeding
- Reinstruct patient and give return appointment
- Decontaminate all the equipment used in the disinfectant using prevention of infection guidelines

\section*{IUCD REMOVAL}
- The IUCD should be removed if the patient decides that they would like to change their contraceptive practices or if the device is causing undesirable effects.
- The main requirements for IUCD removal are similar to the requirements for the pelvic examination in IUCD insertion, excluding:
- Sponge holding forceps
- Artery forceps
- Pair of scissors
- Cusco speculum, Alligator forceps \& Antiseptic and sterile swabs

The mother should be prepared physically and psychologically and placed in dorsal position. The procedure should then be conducted as follows:
- Perform digital and speculum examination
- Clean the cervix and visualise the IUCD thread
- Apply the tenaculum and align the uterus
- Using the artery forceps, grasp the thread and apply traction as the mother pants
- Show the device to mother on removal
- Remove the tenaculum, clean cervix and arrest bleeding
- Remove the speculum and make patient comfortable
- Give a sanitary pad
- Offer an alternative method of contraception if need be

\section*{BARRIER METHODS OF CONTRACEPTION}

\section*{DEFINITION}
- The barrier methods work by barring spermatozoa from getting into the cervix, uterus and fallopian tubes for fertilisation.

\section*{TYPES:}
condoms, spermicides, diaphragm and vaginal sponge

\section*{THE CONDOM}

\section*{DESCRIPTION:}
- This is a sheath that fits over the erect penis or is inserted into the vagina, and acts as a barrier to the transmission of semen into the vagina.
TYPES:
- Male condom
- Female condom

\section*{INDICATIONS FOR USE OF CONDOMS}
- For males who want to participate in family planning
- As a temporary measure when not sure if patient is pregnant
- For sexually active teenagers
- For those patients contra indicated to other methods
- To reduce the spread of STIs, HIV/AIDS

\section*{LIMITATIONS:}
- The condom may slip. The male condom has to be properly applied and withdrawn when the penis is still erect.
- It may tear. You should remove air.
- The user may have an allergy to rubber.
- There is a failure rate of $2-15 \%$.
- It should be used only once and discarded

\section*{MALE CONDOM}
- The male condom is a thin, latex rubber sheath or covering, made to fit a man's erect penis. Some are coated with a lubricant or spermicide. Condoms come in different sizes, colours, and textures.
- condoms help prevent both pregnancy and some STIs, including HIV/AIDS. Condom types in the market include plain, flavoured, coloured, and spermicide-added condoms.

\section*{Advantages of Condoms}

\section*{Contraceptive benefits:}
- Condoms offer contraception only when needed.
- Condoms are easy to obtain and can be used without seeing a health care provider.

Other benefits of using condoms include:
- With consistent and proper use, they are highly effective protection against STIs, including HIV/AIDS.
- Condoms reduce the risk of cervical cancer.
- Condoms prevent premature ejaculation
- Almost every man is eligible to use a condom.
- Condoms are easy to use with a little practice.
- There is no health risk associated with this method.
- Condoms do not interfere with the act of intercourse, as do the foaming tablets.

\section*{Limitations of condoms}
- A new condom must be worn for each act of sexual intercourse.
- Condoms have a higher failure rate if used inconsistently or incorrectly.
- Condoms might reduce sensitivity.
- Condoms might cause itching for a few people who are allergic to latex.
- Condoms are user-dependent.
- Condoms cannot be used with oil-based lubricants.
- Condoms are affected by heat, light, and humidity

\section*{NOTE:}
- Male condoms should not be used with petroleum products and oils, which lead to rapid degeneration and could reduce their effectiveness in preventing pregnancy and protection against STI, including HIV/AIDS

\section*{Men Who Should Use Male Condoms}
- Men who wish to participate actively in FP
- Couples who need a back-up method (e.g., for missed pills)
- Couples who have sex infrequently and who do not need continual protection
- Couples who need temporary methods while awaiting another method
- Couples who want protection from STI/HIV
- Those who are not using another method, or
- Those who are using another method for pregnancy prevention, and are at a risk of acquiring an STI or HIV/AIDS (dual method use)
- Postpartum clients or post-abortion clients before initiating more appropriate methods, or any client who needs more time to make a decision about a contraceptive method
- Couples living with HIV/IADS-whether discordant or concordant

\section*{Men Who Should Not Use Male Condoms}
- Men or couples who want a more effective protection against pregnancy (e.g., when the woman has a condition that makes pregnancy dangerous, and therefore need to consider a more reliable method) should not use male condoms
- If the woman is at risk of STI, her partner should use a condom in addition to the more reliable and effective contraceptive method.

\section*{Management of possible side effects of using condoms}

\section*{SIDE EFFECTS}

\section*{Allergy or irritation (very rare)}

\section*{MANAGEMENT}
- In case of a latex allergy, advise couple to use another method. Rule out infection.
${ }^{-}$If the lubricant is a cause of irritation, suggest using water as a lubricant.
Note: Clients at risk of STI and HIV/AIDS should be counselled to continue to use condoms despite discomfort as long as they are at risk.
${ }^{-}$If irritation is unacceptable to the client, assist in choosing another method, including the female condom, which is made of polyurethane. Rule out infection

\section*{In case of}

\section*{FEMALE CONDOM}

\section*{description}
- The female condom is made of thin, transparent soft plastic (polyurethane)

\section*{Advantages and Benefits}

\section*{Contraceptive Benefits}
- They are effective if used consistently and correctly. The effectiveness of the female condom is slightly less than the male condom. The failure rate is about 5 percent in perfect use, and 21 percent in typical use.
- They offer contraception only when needed.
- Condoms can be used without seeing a health care provider.

\section*{Other Benefits}
- With consistent and proper use, condoms are highly effective protection against STIs, including HIV/AIDS.
- They protect against PID.
- The woman can control this method.
- Almost every woman is eligible to use this method.
- It can be inserted eight hours before an anticipated sexual act.
- There is no need to see a health care provider before use.
- Condoms are easy to use with a little practice.
- No health risk is associated with the method.
- Unlike latex rubber, there is no known allergy to polyurethane, the material from which female condoms are made.

\section*{Limitations of Female Condoms}
- Condom must be inserted before sexual intercourse (although they can be inserted in advance-as much as eight hours).
- Female condoms are expensive.
- A condom can be used only once-it cannot be reused

\section*{Women Who Can Use the Female Condom}
- All women of reproductive age of any parity, including nulliparous women, can use a female condom. The female condom is appropriate in many circumstances:
- Women who need to rule out possible pregnancy before proceeding with another method.
- Women who need a back-up method.
- Women who need temporary methods of contraception.
- Post-abortion clients before initiating other methods.
- Women who need dual protection if they are using another method for pregnancy prevention, but are at a risk of acquiring an STI or HIV/AIDS (e.g., a woman who has more than one partner, or a woman whose partner has more than one partner).

\section*{Women Who Should Not Use a Condom}
- A woman who has one or more conditions that make pregnancy dangerous and needs a more effective method of protection against pregnancy may want to consider other, less client-dependant, methods of contraception

\section*{DIAPHRAGM}
- This is a dome shaped rubber device with a flexible rim inserted into the vagina prior to sexual intercourse to prevent conception by forming a barrier.
- It has to be removed six to eight hours after intercourse.
- Diaphragms are of different sizes so as to fit well the individual patient.

\section*{PRECAUTIONS}
- Efficacy is improved if used with spermicides
- The patient should ensure that it fits well
- There is a failure rate of $2-15 \%$

\section*{CONTRAINDICATIONS}
- Allergy to rubber
- uterine prolapse
- recurrent cystitis
instruct the patient to remove the device six hours post intercourse and to ensure that it is washed and kept dry.

\section*{VAGINAL SPONGE}
- This is a synthetic sponge impregnated with spermicides, which is inserted high into the vagina.
- It is effective for up to 24 hours.
- People who have a vaginal infection or allergies should not use it.
- The device remains in situ for six hours after intercourse, after which it is removed and discarded.
- The main disadvantage of the vaginal sponge is that it is very expensive.

\section*{SPERMICIDES}
- These are usually supplied in the form of gels, aerosols, pessaries or foaming tablets, which are inserted high into the vagina

\section*{Spermicides work in the following ways:}
- They kill spermatozoa and some organisms such as gonococcal bacteria and treponema pallidum
- They are usually applied on condoms and the diaphragm
They have a failure rate of $14-25 \%$

\section*{PERMANENT METHODS OF FP}

\section*{VOLUNTARY SURGICAL CONTRACEPTION}
- Voluntary Surgical Contraception (VSC) includes female and male sterilisation procedures that are intended to provide permanent contraception
- special care must be taken to assure that every client who chooses this method does so voluntarily and is fully informed about the permanence of this method and the availability of alternative, long-acting, highly effective methods

\section*{Remember:}

Sterilisation does not protect against STIs, including hepatitis B and HIV/AIDS. If the client is at risk of contracting one of these, the correct use of condoms is recommended following sterilisation

\section*{The following categories are used for recommending voluntary surgical contraception}
- Accept (Category A): There is no medical reason to deny sterilization to a person with this condition.
- Caution (Category C): The procedure is normally conducted in a routine setting, but with extra preparation and precautions.
- Delay (Category D): The procedure is delayed until the condition is evaluated and corrected if need be. Alternative temporary methods of contraception should be provided.
- Special (Category S): The procedure should be undertaken in a setting with an experienced surgeon and staff, equipment needed to provide general anaesthesia, and other back-up medical support. For these conditions, the provider must be able to decide on the most appropriate procedure and anaesthesia regimen. Alternative temporary methods of contraception should be provided if referral is required or there is otherwise any delay.

\section*{Note:}
- No incentives are to be given to clients to accept any form of contraception or to providers to recruit clients and perform the surgical procedure.
- The client is free to change her mind anytime prior to the procedure.
- Multiple caesarean sections and grand multiparity are not absolute indications for female sterilization.
- Informed consent must be obtained and the client must sign a standard consent form for the procedure. Spousal consent is not mandatory, but counselling should be provided to both partners and consent obtained from both, if possible, and where appropriate

\section*{Bilateral Tubal Ligation (BTL)}

DESCRIPTION:
- Also known as
- Female voluntary surgical contraception
- Female sterilization
- Tubal ligation.
- A Bilateral Tubal Ligation (BTL) is a minor surgical procedure that involves blocking the fallopian tubes to prevent the ovum from being fertilized. It can be done by cutting, burning or removing sections of the fallopian tubes or by placing clips on each tube.
- In Kenya, nearly $14 \%$ of users of modern methods of contraception rely on female sterilization.

\section*{Types of tubal ligation}

There are several ways to perform a TL:
- Minilaparotomy (postpartum, postabortion or interval)
- Laparoscopic tubal ligation (interval)
- In conjunction with a caesarean section or other abdominal surgery

\section*{INDICATIONS}

It is suitable for:
- Those who have had their desired number of children, hence used to prevent a pregnancy.
- Those who have chronic medical conditions such as renal, heart, uterine and ovarian diseases
- Those who want a permanent method of contraception (after counseling)
- Those who understand and voluntarily follow an informed consent procedure after proper counseling

\section*{Advantages of BTL}

\section*{Contraceptive Benefits}
- TL is a highly effective, immediate, and safe form of contraception that offers the following benefits:
$\square$ TL does not change sexual function and does not interfere with intercourse.
$\square$ TL is permanent.
$\square$ TL has few known side effects
$\square$ TL does not affect breastfeeding.

\section*{Other Benefits}
- Women who have TLs have a decreased risk of getting ovarian cancer and have a possible decreased risk of PID.

\section*{LIMITATIONS \& SIDE EFFECTS OF BTL}
- The procedure is generally irreversible and expensive. The success of reversal surgery cannot be guaranteed.
- There are risks and side effects associated with anaesthesia
- Risks related to surgical procedure such as bleeding, haematoma or infection
- The method does not protect against STIs, HIV/AIDS and hepatitis B.
- In rare cases when pregnancy occurs, it is more likely to be ectopic
- Only a trained provider can perform the procedure

\section*{WOMEN WHO SHOULD NOT USE TL}

Providers should not perform TL on certain women:
- Women who are uncertain of their desire for future fertility
- Women who cannot withstand surgery
-Women or girls who do not give voluntary informed consent

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline Side effects & Suggested action \\
\hline Pain at incision site & Determine presence of infection and treat; if no infection, reassure and provide analgesics \\
\hline Wound infection, fever & If skin is infected, clean, dress, and treat with antibiotics; if abscess is present, incise and drain; treat with antibiotics for 7-10 days. \\
\hline Haematoma & Apply warm, moist packs on site, observe for a few days; if increasing, evacuate \\
\hline More serious injuries e.g., bladder or bowel injury & Give appropriate management or refer for competent care in a hospital. \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\section*{Male Voluntary Surgical Contraception (Vasectomy)}
- Vasectomy, or male sterilization, is the surgical process of cutting and tying the vas deferens in order to prevent spermatozoa from mixing with semen.
- Consequently, when ejaculation occurs, the semen will not have any sperms.
- The operation is performed under a local anaesthetic, and it is one of the most effective methods of contraception-it has a reported failure rate of about 0.1 percent.
- The option of a vasectomy would be a good solution when a woman has medical conditions that hinder use of all female methods.

\section*{Correcting myths and misconceptions about vasectomy}
- Vasectomy is not synonymous with castration, and it does not affect a man's sexual ability or desire.
- A vasectomy does not become effective immediately. The client should be instructed to use condoms or another FP method for three months after the operation to be completely safe.
- Reversal surgery cannot be assured. Thorough and careful counselling is needed before making a decision in order to avoid future regret. The procedure must be considered permanent

\section*{Types of Vasectomy}
- There are scalpel and non-scalpel vasectomy techniques.
- A vasectomy is recommended when the family has reached the desired family size, the wife has contra indicated to surgical procedure and male participation is promoted.

\section*{CONTRAINDICATIONS:}
the procedure is contra indicated in the following circumstances:
- A large hydrocele
- Chronic genital tract infection
- Diabetic patient
- Inguinal hernia unless after repair

\section*{Advantages and Benefits of Vasectomy}

Contraceptive benefits of vasectomies include the following:
- The procedure is highly effective and safe.
- There is no change in sexual function-the procedure does not interfere with sexual intercourse.
- It is permanent.

\section*{Limitations and Risks}
- The procedure is virtually irreversible (i.e., success of reversal surgery cannot be guaranteed).
- There are minimal risks and side effects of local anaesthesia.
- There are risks associated with surgical procedures.
- A vasectomy does not protect against STIs, including HIV/AIDS.
- Only a trained provider can offer a vasectomy.
- There is a delay in effectiveness after the procedure has been performed.

\section*{Client instructions}
- Advise the patient to rest for two days and avoid heavy lifting for five to seven days.
- A scrotal support should be used.
- The vasectomy is not effective immediately. The semen has sperms for three to four months, therefore requiring ten to fifteen ejaculations to be free from semen.
The barrier method can be used for protection meanwhile.
- Vasectomy has a failure rate of $0.3 \%$

\section*{Complications of vasectomy}
- Pain and bleeding which occurs due to surgery. Give analgesics for pain and watch for signs of bleeding and arrest it.
- Infections mean a strict aseptic technique should be observed to prevent infection.
- Granuloma/bleeders must be well ligated.
- Medical legal social problems could occur if there is premature sexual intercourse before the semen is sperm free. Counsel, reassure and give proper instruction to the patient.
- Anastomosis increases the failure rate.
- The patient should be reassured with regard to sperm antibodies reaction.
- The patient also needs reassurance, usually psychological about the possibility of impotence/low libido
