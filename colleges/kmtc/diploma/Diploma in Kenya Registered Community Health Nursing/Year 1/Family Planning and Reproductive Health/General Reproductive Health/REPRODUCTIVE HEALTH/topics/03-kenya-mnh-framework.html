                        <p>Evidence has shown that there are 2 key interventions that improve maternal health and reduce maternal mortality, namely:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Skilled attendance at delivery (skills, numbers, enabling environment) and</li>

                        </ul>
                        <p>The term "skilled attendant" refers exclusively to people with midwifery skills (e.g. doctors, midwives, nurses, clinical officers) who have been trained to proficiency in the skills necessary to manage normal deliveries and diagnose or refer obstetric complications.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Enabling Environment</h3>
                        <p>To ensure effective and efficient service delivery, the skilled attendant requires an enabling environment. There is need for appropriate infrastructure as well as ensuring that the continuum of care is connected by an effective referral system, and supported by adequate supplies, equipment, drugs, good management and supportive supervision.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Referral Systems</h3>
                        <p>A key aspect in ensuring a good maternal health service is a functional referral system. Access to a telephone and/or vehicle, with emergency funds or fuel to transfer urgent cases day or night is extremely important. Good record keeping and use of detailed referral letters will assist in reducing delay in the care for women with obstetric emergencies and severely ill newborns. The referring unit should be aware of the capacity of the referral point to manage the client being referred.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Community Action, Partnerships</h3>
                        <p>Involving community members (particularly women and their families, health care providers, and local leaders) in efforts to improve maternal health helps to ensure programme success; Community education about obstetric complications and when and where to seek medical care is important to ensure birth planning/ use of birth preparedness cards, early recognition of complications and prompt care-taking behaviour.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Male involvement and participation</h3>
                        <p>it is evident that for successful programme implementation, male participation in MNH results in good outcomes for both mother and baby. Male involvement and participation is critical in addressing the first and second delay. In the Kenyan context, men have the resources and are the main decision makers in the families and communities on issues relating to MNH.</p>

                        <p>Rights based perspective helps legitimise prioritisation of women's health. It focuses attention on social, economic and geographic inequities. Strong political support and national ownership are essential to create enabling policies to attract resources for maternal and newborn health and to ensure those resources reach groups with the highest maternal mortality and morbidity.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Reproductive Rights</h3>
                        <p>Health care providers should appreciate that most maternal and neonatal deaths are avoidable, and therefore maternal and newborn health must be given its due prominence. Safe Motherhood is a basic human right as women are entitled to enjoy a safe pregnancy and childbirth.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Emergency Obstetric Care (EmOC)</h3>
                        <p>Emergency Obstetric Care refers to a set of minimal health care elements, which should be availed to all women during pregnancy and delivery. It includes both life saving and emergency measures e.g. Caesarean section, manual removal of placenta, etc, as well as non-emergency measures (e.g. use of the partograph to monitor labour, active management of the third stage of labour, etc.). Emergency Obstetric Care functions are generally categorized as Basic Emergency Obstetric Care (BEmOC) and Comprehensive Emergency Obstetric care (CEmOC).</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Basic Emergency Obstetric Care (BEmOC) includes:</h4>
                        <ol>
