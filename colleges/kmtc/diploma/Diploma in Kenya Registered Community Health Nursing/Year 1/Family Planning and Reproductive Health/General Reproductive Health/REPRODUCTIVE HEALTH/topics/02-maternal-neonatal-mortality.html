                        <p>"A maternal death is defined as the death of a woman while pregnant or within 42 days of termination of the pregnancy, irrespective of the duration and site of pregnancy, from any cause related to or aggravated by the pregnancy or its management, but not from accidental or incidental causes."</p>
                        <p>Causes of maternal mortality maybe direct or indirect</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Direct Causes of Maternal Death</h4>
                        <p>These result from obstetric complications of pregnancy, labour and the puerperium and from interventions or any after effects of these events.</p>
                        <p>The Five major causes of direct maternal deaths in order of frequency are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Haemorrhage,</li>
                            <li>Sepsis,</li>
                            <li>Hypertensive disorders,</li>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Indirect causes of Maternal Deaths</h4>
                        <p>They result from previously existing disease or disease that develops during pregnancy which was not due to direct obstetric causes, but which was aggravated by physiologic effects of pregnancy.</p>
                        <p>The major causes of indirect maternal deaths in our set up include:</p>
                        <ul>

                        <p>There are three distinct levels of delay which contribute to maternal morbidity and mortality: (Thaddaeus and Maine, 1994):</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Delay in deciding to seek appropriate care.</strong> This could be due to: socio-cultural barriers, Failure to recognize danger signs, failure to perceive severity of illness, and cost considerations</li>
                            <li><strong>Delay in reaching an appropriate health care facility.</strong> This is due to: long distance to a facility, poor condition of roads, lack of transportation and cost considerations</li>
                            <li><strong>Delay in receiving adequate emergency care at the facility.</strong> This may be due to: Shortage of staff, supplies and basic equipment; unskilled personnel, user fees among others.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <p>Approximately 9 out of 10 (92%) of all pregnant women in Kenya attend antenatal care at least once from a health care provider and 56% make four or more ANC visits.</p>
                        <p>However, only about 44% of all deliveries are attended to by a skilled health provider.</p>
                        <p>In fact since 1990, delivery by skilled attendants has progressively declined in Kenya.</p>
                        <p>Majority of births are therefore occurring at home with no skilled care (KDHS, 2008/9).</p>
                        <p>Among women who deliver outside the health facility, a vast majority (6 out of 10) do not receive postnatal care.</p>
                        <p>Only 42 percent attend postnatal care within two days of delivery, (KDHS 2008/9).</p>
                        <p>This is despite the fact that majority of maternal deaths occur during the postpartum period.</p>
