                        <p>MDGs were set by all Government leaders at the UN Millennium Summit, September 2000. All UN organisations decided to be guided by MDGs in their future action: unity of purpose, coherent action, synergies and strategic approaches by the UN system as a whole (guided by CEB). Leaders pledged to strive, individually and collectively, towards these goals through international, regional and national action, concerted by the UN.</p>

                        <p>The 1990s was a decade of faltering progress on:</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">MDG 5 Status (as of 2008/09)</h3>
                        <p>MDG5 was to improve maternal health with a target of reducing MMR by 75% between 1990 and 2015. For this to be attained there is need for a 5.5% decline in MMR annually from 1990. However, globally the reported annual percentage decline in MMR between 1990 and 2008 was only 2.3%. Among countries with an MMR ≥ 100 in 1990, it is evident that 30 countries have made insufficient or no progress. This list includes 23 countries from sub-Saharan Africa (WHO...Trends in Maternal mortality 1990-2008). Sadly Kenya is among these countries with an MMR of 488 per 100,000 live births, with some regions reporting MMRs of over 1000 per 100,000 live births. (KDHS 2008/09)</p>
                        <p>To accelerate progress towards MDG 5, the UN Secretary-General in 2010 launched the Global Strategy for Women’s and Children’s Health which elements include: Country-led health plans, a comprehensive, integrated package of essential interventions and services, Health systems strengthening, Health workforce capacity building, and coordinated research and innovation.</p>
                        <p>Kenya developed the national RH training plan whose goal is to ensure that health personnel have the knowledge, technical skills and positive attitude, to handle reproductive health issues within a comprehensive and integrated system.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Progress as per KDHS 2014</h3>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Infant and Child Mortality</h4>
                        <p>The KDHS 2014 shows a decrease in the infant mortality rate from 52 to 39 per 1,000 live births, and a decrease in the under-five mortality rate from 74 to 52 per 1,000 live births between 2008 and 2014. These declines have been driven mainly by: enhanced use of mosquito nets, increases in antenatal care, skilled attendance at childbirth, postnatal care, contraceptive use, exclusive breastfeeding practices and a decrease in unmet family planning (FP) needs, as well as overall improvements in other social indicators such as education and access to water.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Neonatal Mortality</h4>
                        <p>The NMR declined from 31 per 1,000 births to 22 per 1,000 live births between 2008-2014. However, during the past decade, the NMR exhibited the slowest decline. Further reductions in infant and child mortality require steeper decline in the NMR, which is closely linked to improvements in maternal health services including intrapartum care.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Maternal Health</h4>
                        <p>The MMR of 362 per 100,000 live births estimated by KDHS in 2014 is still high. Coverage/utilization indicators also show some improvements but much more needs to be done to address inequities and to reach Universal Health Care(UHC). The contraceptive prevalence rate (CPR, any method) among married women has increased to 58% in 2014 from 46% in 2008/9 with a decline in unmet need for FP. Nearly two thirds (61%) of births took place in a health facility and 62% of pregnant women were delivered by a skilled attendant. Postnatal care (PNC) increased from 42% in 2009 to 51% in 2014. The total fertility rate has declined from 4.6 in 2008/9 to 3.9 in 2014; however, there has been no change in teen pregnancy with one in five (18%) adolescents in the 15-19 years age group having started child bearing due to early marriage, high unmet need for contraception and poor access to FP services.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Other Indicators</h4>
                        <p>Nutritional status of children under-five has improved with a decline in stunting from 35% in 2008/9 to 26% in 2014. However, one out of every four children still remains shorter for their age. Nearly half (48%) of households have access to an insecticide treated net; 53% of women and 46% of men were tested for HIV in the past 12 months and received the test results. Overall immunization coverage for basic vaccines increased from 65.3 percent 2008/9 to 71.3 percent in 2014. Prevalence of exclusive breastfeeding among children under 6 months has nearly doubled from 32 percent to 61 percent.</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Child mortality has declined by over 20% since 2008 and the country achieved a total fertility rate (TFR) of less than four.</li>
                            <li>Stunting, which remained stubbornly high over the past two decades, has started to decline.</li>
                            <li>Six out of ten pregnant women now receive skilled care at childbirth and over half get postnatal care.</li>
                            <li>However, despite this progress, Kenya could not achieve maternal and child health Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).</li>
