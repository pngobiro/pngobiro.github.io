                        <p>The absolute number of deaths of children under-five years is projected to reduce from 77,761 to 48,590 and maternal from 5,453 to 3,276 between 2014/15 and 2019/20.</p>
                        <p>Finally, the framework aims to ensure that at least three out of four births will be registered, thereby providing more robust denominators to effectively plan and monitor RMNCAH service delivery.</p>
