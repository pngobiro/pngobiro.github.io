                        <p>The Global Safe Motherhood Initiative launched in Nairobi in 1987 aimed at reducing the burden of maternal deaths and ill health in developing countries.</p>
                        <p>The Safe Motherhood Initiative differed from other health initiatives in that it focused on the well being of women as an end in itself.</p>
                        <p>In the SMI, the prevention of the death of a pregnant woman is considered to be the key objective, not because death adversely affects children and other family members but because women are intrinsically valuable (Thaddeus and Maine 1994).</p>
                        <p>It underscored the fact that Safe motherhood is a basic human right.</p>

                        <p>The 1994 International Conference on Population and Development in Cairo recommended to the international community a set of important population and development objectives.</p>
                        <p>The Programme of Action was striking for the attention it devoted to the issue of women's health.</p>
                        <p>It also included goals with regard to education, especially for girls, and for the further reduction of infant, child and maternal mortality levels.</p>
                        <p>For Kenya, the ICPD recommendations were then translated into the National Reproductive Health Strategy (NRHS 1997-2010) and implementation plan whose goal was to reduce maternal, perinatal and neonatal morbidity and mortality.</p>
                        <p>Another event that followed the ICPD was the Millennium Declaration in 2000 and the development of goals (MDGs) with indicators.</p>

                        <p>A major feature of the NHSSP is the introduction of the Kenya Essential Package for Health (KEPH), which focuses on the health needs of individuals through the six stages of the human life cycle.</p>

                        <p>Kenya Vision 2030 is the country's new development blueprint covering the period 2008 to 2030. The vision is based on three "pillars" namely; the economic pillar, the social pillar and the political pillar. Health is part of the social pillar.</p>
                        <p>To improve the overall livelihoods of Kenyans, the country aims to provide an efficient and high quality health care system with the best standards. This is in order to reduce health inequalities and improve indicators in key areas where Kenya is lagging, especially in lowering infant and maternal mortality.</p>
                        <p>Specific strategies include: provision of a robust health infrastructure network; improving the quality of health service delivery to the highest standards and promotion of partnerships with the private sector. In addition the Government has put in place health financing mechanisms to make quality MNH services affordable and accessible to all especially the poor and vulnerable women. These include the provision of free MNH /FP services at the lower levels, National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF), Health Sector Support Fund (HSSF), Hospital Management Support Fund (HMSF), FIF, Voucher system /Output Based Aid (OBA). The government is also encouraging initiatives that promote community based health financing.</p>
