                        <p>The WHO defines reproductive health as a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being, and not merely the absence of reproductive disease or infirmity. [6, 7, 8] Reproductive health involves all of the reproductive processes, functions and systems at all stages of human life. This definition implies that people are able to have a satisfying and safe sex life and that they have the capability to reproduce and the freedom to decide if, when and how often to do so. Men and women have the right to be informed and to have access to safe, effective, affordable and acceptable methods of family planning of their choice that are not against the law. Furthermore, men and women should have access to appropriate health care services that will enable women to go safely through pregnancy and childbirth, as well as to provide couples with the best chance of having a healthy infant.</p>
                        <p>Reproductive health is a universal concern, but is of special importance for women particularly during the reproductive years. However, men also demand specific reproductive health needs and have particular responsibilities in terms of women's reproductive health because of their decision-making powers in some reproductive health matters. Reproductive health is a fundamental component of an individual's overall health status and a central determinant of quality of life.</p>

                        <p>The WHO's definition of reproductive health specifically highlights the importance of an individual's right to maintain their own sexual health status. Sexual health is the integration of emotional, intellectual, and social aspects of sexual being in order to positively enrich personality, communication, relationships and love. The three fundamental principles of sexual health are: 1) capacity to enjoy and control sexual and reproductive behavior; 2) freedom from shame, guilt, fear, and other psychological factors that may impair sexual relationships; and 3) freedom from organic disorder or disease that interferes with sexual and reproductive function.</p>
                        <p>Reproductive health further implies the right to satisfying and safe sex life. This includes the ability to reproduce, but also the personal freedom to decide if, when and how often to do so. Both men and women have the right to be informed and to have access to safe, effective, affordable and acceptable methods of family planning that are not against the law.</p>
                        <p>Reproductive health should also be understood in the context of healthy relationships in which there is an understanding of the balance between fulfillment and risk. Reproductive health contributes enormously to physical and psychosocial comfort and closeness between individuals. Poor reproductive health is frequently associated with disease, abuse, exploitation, unwanted pregnancy, and death.</p>

                        <p>Reproductive health is a crucial feature of healthy human development and of general health. It may be a reflection of a healthy childhood, is crucial during adolescence, and sets the stage for health in adulthood and beyond the reproductive years for both men and women.</p>
                        <p>Reproductive life span does not begin with sexual development at puberty and end at menopause for a woman or when a man is no longer likely to have children. Rather, it follows throughout an individual's life cycle and remains important in many different phases of development and maturation.</p>
                        <p>At each stage of life, individual reproductive health needs may differ. However, there is a cumulative effect across the life course, and each phase has important implications for future well-being. An inability to deal with reproductive health problems at any stage in life may set the scene for later health problems. This is known as the life cycle perspective for reproductive health.</p>

                        <p>Healthy reproductive systems, processes, and function are imperative components of adequate overall health. However, many internal as well as external factors may challenge an individual's ability to maintain reproductive health. It is important to keep in mind that reproductive health status may be determined by occurrences and exposures from in utero development until the final stages of life.</p>
                        <p>Numerous factors directly effect how well an individual maintains his or her reproductive health status. While some factors may be pre-determined, such as genetic susceptibility to a particular disorder or disease, other factors that relate to the maintenance of reproductive health may be behavioural and involve an individual's participation in risky practices. Furthermore, the environment in which an individual lives, both natural and physical, may present important risk that may directly influence reproductive health. For instance, some occupational exposures (e.g works with hazardous pesticides) can have adverse effects in reproductive life.</p>

                        <p><strong>Fecundity</strong> - the ability of a couple to conceive after a certain time of attempting to become pregnant</p>
                        <p>The World Health Organization defines the term primary infertility as the inability to bear any children, whether this is the result of the inability to conceive a child, or the inability to carry a child to full term after 12 months of unprotected sexual intercourse. Primary infertility is sometimes known as primary sterility. However, in many medical studies, the term primary infertility is only used to describe a situation where a couple is not able to conceive.</p>
                        <p>Secondary infertility is defined as the inability to have a second child after a first birth. Secondary infertility has shown to have a high geographical correlation with primary infertility. Fecundity describes the ability to conceive after several years of exposure to risk of pregnancy. Fecundity is often evaluated as the time necessary for a couple to achieve pregnancy. The World Health Organization recommends defining fecundity as the ability for a couple to conceive after two years of attempting to become pregnant.</p>
                        <p>The terms infertility and infecundity are often confused. Fertility describes the actual production of live offspring, while fecundity describes the ability to produce live offspring. Fecundity cannot be directly measured, though it may be assessed clinically. Typically, fecundity may be assessed by the time span between a couple's decision to attempt to conceive and a successful pregnancy.</p>

                        <p>The World Health Organization describes the term congenital abnormalities as all structural, functional, and genetic abnormalities diagnosed in aborted fetuses, at birth or in the neonatal period. Congenital abnormalities are sometimes known as birth defects.</p>
                        <p>An ectopic pregnancy describes a complication in the early stages of pregnancy when a fertilized egg is implanted in an area outside of the uterine cavity. A majority of ectopic pregnancies occur in the fallopian tube, but may also occur in the cervix, ovary, or abdomen. If not treated properly, an ectopic pregnancy may be life threatening for the woman.</p>
                        <p>Fetal death (commonly known as a stillbirth) occurs when an infant does not survive complete expulsion from the mother or after twenty completed weeks of gestational age. Death is evidenced by a lack of vital signs following separation from the womb, for example, lack of fetal breath, heart beat, umbilical cord pulsation, or definite movement of voluntary muscles.</p>
