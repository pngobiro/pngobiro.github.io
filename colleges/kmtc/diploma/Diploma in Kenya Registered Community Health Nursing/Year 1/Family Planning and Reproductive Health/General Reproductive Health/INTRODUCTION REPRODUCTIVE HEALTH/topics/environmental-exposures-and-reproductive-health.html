                        <p>Reproductive health and the environment focuses on exposures to environmental contaminants during critical periods of human development. These periods are directly related to reproductive health throughout the life course, including the period before conception, at conception, fertility, pregnancy, child and adolescent development, and adult health. Exposures to different environmental contaminants may influence reproductive health status through the process of epigenetics.</p>
                        <p>Environmental toxicants may potentially induce effects in human reproductive processes. However, the extent of this hypothesis must be supported through greater levels of research.</p>

                    <p>Several chemicals, compounds (both synthetic and organic), metals, and other environmental toxicants have been associated with adverse human health effects. Significant scientific concerns over the potential impact of these environmental hazards on reproductive health have increased research and public debate on this issue. For instance, evidence is arising on relationships between spontaneous abortion as well as reduction of anogenital distance and exposure to dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) during pregnancy.</p>

                        <p>An endocrine disruptor is an exogenous substance or mixture that alters the function of the endocrine system and consequently causes adverse health effects in an intact organism, or its progeny, or subpopulations.</p>
                        <p>A potential endocrine disruptor is an exogenous substance or mixture that possesses properties that might be expected to lead to endocrine disruption in an intact organism, or its progeny, or subpopulations.</p>
                        <p>Key issues in understanding the role and action of endocrine disruptors and potential endocrine disruptors are the mechanisms of action and consequences of exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals, including mixture of various chemical compounds, dose response relationships, latent effects, and age of exposure.</p>
                        <p>It is important to acknowledge that the state of science regarding endocrine disruptor research is only beginning and much more is yet to be learned about the specific qualities of these environmental compounds. Endocrine disruption has sometimes been demonstrated for animals (wildlife/in vivo and in vitro studies). For instance, tributyl tin (TBT) originating from antifouling paints used to treat boat hulls induces a form of pseudohermaphroditism (termed imposex) in female gastropods by an endocrine-disrupting mechanism.</p>

                        <p>Specific environmental toxicants directly affect the endocrine system. Endocrine disruptors are exogenous agents that interfere with the synthesis, secretion, transport, binding, action, or elimination of natural hormones in the body that are responsible for the maintenance of homeostasis, reproduction, development, and/or behavior. Endocrine disruptors can change normal hormone levels, stimulate or halt the production of certain hormones, or change the way hormones move through the body.</p>

                        <p>Endocrine disruptors act by mimicking or antagonizing naturally occurring hormones in the body. However, there are different types of hormones in the body as explained in previous slides. For this reason, endocrine disruptors must exert their effects by mimicking or antagonizing specific types of hormones in the body. In fact, endocrine disruptors may be categorized according to their mimicking or antagonizing behavior.</p>
                        <p>The largest body of evidence exists for endocrine disruptors that mimic estrogen. These are called estrogenic or estrogen agonists because they behave similarly to naturally occurring estrogens in the body. Endocrine disruptors that are estrogenic (green molecule) will mimic the naturally occurring estrogen (orange molecule) and bind with the receptor (purple molecule) that was meant for the naturally occurring estrogen.</p>
                        <p>Endocrine disruptors may also antagonize estrogen activity, and are thus called estrogen antagonists. This means that they may bind the same site on the receptor of the agonist does but are incapable of doing the task that the agonist can do.</p>
                        <p>Similarly, this same concept may apply to other types of hormones, including androgens. Endocrine disruptors, through the same principle as described above, can be either androgen agonists or androgen antagonists. The largest body of evidence exists for compounds that are estrogenic in nature.</p>
                        <p>Endocrine disruptors can also affect hormonal mechanisms (e.g thyroid).</p>

                        <p>Some environmental toxicants, such as pesticides, are intentionally released into the environment. Others, however, are released unintentionally during manufacturing, use, and disposal. A few chemicals are created unintentionally as by-products of industrial processes. This is true for a group of chemicals known as "dioxin-like" pollutants. Environmental toxicants that may exert adverse effects on reproductive health are present in media such as the water, air, soil, dust, food, and consumer products. Humans are exposed to these contaminants in the home, community, school, or workplace. To potentially cause harm, a toxicant must come into contact with a individual and enter the body, a step referred to as biologic uptake. Biologic uptake is the moment at which exposure occurs. Toxicants enter the body in one or more of three ways: inhalation, ingestion, or dermal absorption through the skin. Toxicants are then distributed to tissues an organs and subject to metabolism. Toxicants, or their metabolites, travel to target organs, such as the thyroid, ovaries, or testes, where they exert biological effects. Certain toxicants are stored in the body for long periods of time in muscle, bones or adipose tissue.</p>

                            <li>Adults may compensate for endocrine disruptors' effects</li>
                            <li>Exposure when endocrine system is developing may result in permanent damage</li>
                            <li>Exposure to same endocrine disruptors in different stages of life results in different effects</li>
                            <li>Endocrine disruptors do not always affect the system predicted</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Endocrine disruptors may impact physiological processes in multiple ways. However, there are important points that must be stressed. First of all, if exposure to endocrine disruptors occurs in adulthood, the effects of exposure may be compensated for by homeostatic mechanisms and thus may not result in evident health disparities. Additionally, the period in which the endocrine system is being programmed is incredibly vulnerable to damage. Thus, if an individual is exposed to an endocrine disruptor during this stage, permanent damage to the function of hormonal signalling pathways may occur. This can be specifically evident for stimulatory and inhibitory signalling pathways in the endocrine system.</p>
                        <p>It is also important to note that the effects of endocrine disruptors are not ubiquitous throughout the different stages of life. That is to say that exposures to even the same levels of endocrine disruptors in different stages of development may induce different effects.</p>
                        <p>Finally, due to the complexity involved in endocrine signalling, many different organ systems may be affected by a change in the function of one branch of the endocrine system. For this reason, when endocrine disruptors induce effects in the body, the extent of their action is largely unpredictable for other organ systems or hormonal signalling pathways.</p>

                        <p>Dose-response relationships are a critical component in understanding the mechanism of action for many endocrine disruptors. However, due to limited research and evidence from human exposures and effects, the true dose-response nature of many different endocrine disruptors is unknown. It is important to recognize that endocrine disruptors could affect the endocrine system by mimicking or antagonizing the hormones that are already present in the body. Therefore, the concentrations at which human health is affected by endocrine disruptors may be much less than with other environmental contaminants. There is uncertainty regarding the dose-response relationship between exposure to endocrine disruptors and adverse health effects dictated by changes in hormonal function and homeostatic equilibrium.</p>

                        <p>There are two different hypothesized mechanisms of actions of endocrine disruptors on the nervous system. Endocrine disruptors may activate specific properties in adults and produce transient changes in the nervous system, or, exposure to endocrine disruptors during neural development may induce changes in neurobehavioral function, specifically sex-related behaviours.

                        <p>-Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) are widely used flame retardant compounds that are persistent and bioaccumulative and therefore have become ubiquitous environment contaminants. A number of toxicologic studies have demonstrated that exposure to PBDEs may have endocrine-disrupting effects. Most of these studies have focused on thyroid hormone disruption and a smaller number on disruption of the estrogen/androgen hormone system. Animal studies suggest that prenatal PBDE exposure may result in adverse neurodevelopmental effects. A study of 100 children prenatally exposed to PBDE demonstrated that the chemical altered the neurodevelopment of children up to 72 months of age.</p>
                        <p>-At least 10 different phthalates are used commercially as plasticizers and solvents. Human exposure to phthalates can occur through inhalation, ingestion, and dermal contact. Once absorbed, they are rapidly metabolized to monoesters, and the high-molecular-weight monoesters can undergo further oxidation to form oxidative metabolites. Antagonistic effects of phthalates on the thyroid gland in vivo and thyroid tissue in vitro have been reported. Recently, human studies have demonstrated that phthalate exposure in childhood was associated with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Engel et al. determined that behavioral domains adversely associated with prenatal exposure to phthalates are commonly affected in children clinically diagnosed with conduct or attention deficit hyperactivity disorders.</p>

                        <p>The effects of environmental contaminants and potential endocrine disruptors have been studied extensively in wildlife. Specific mechanisms of the endocrine system, as well as hormonal events that regulate reproduction, are quite similar between some wildlife species and humans. Evidence from case studies has shown that wildlife may even be more sensitive to the action of certain environmental contaminants and endocrine disruptors. A specific case study involves a decline in reproductive function of marine seals exposed to increased levels of two organochlorines: PCBs and DDE. Organochlorines are man-made organic compounds commonly used as pesticides. They are extremely persistent in the environment and are known to bioaccumulate in living organisms. It has been demonstrated that the population of Baltic ringed seals has declined significantly in the last century due to reproductive disorders. Specific abnormalities have included partial or complete sterility, interruptions during early pregnancy, and stenosis (abnormal narrowing) or necessary reproductive organs. A time trend study conducted by a team of scientists demonstrated that the seal populations affected by the reproductive disorder contained high levels of PCBs and DDE levels. The results specifically highlight that high levels of PCBs were the leading cause of reproductive malfunction. However, greater research is needed to elucidate the mechanism of action in this case study.</p>

                        <p>A rather famous case study for environmental exposures and effects in wildlife has been the loss of top level predatory birds due to egg shell thinning. Due to their specific feeding behaviour, carnivorous birds are exposed to a higher level of bio-accumulative organic compounds. Numerous studies have observed abnormal reproductive morphologies, deformities, and alterations in behaviour for bird colonies exposed to organic compound contaminants, specifically DDE, the breakdown product of the pesticide, DDT. DDE directly effects the shell gland and results in egg shell breaking or cracking, and thus severe decreases in avian populations. The widespread use of DDT as a insecticide in North America nearly resulted in the extinction of several bird species. However, it is widely understood that birds may be more susceptible to environmental contaminants due to their modes of reproduction, specifically, the vulnerability of egg shells to specific toxicants. However, research still remains inconclusive and greater research is needed in this area to understand the mechanisms of action of these environmental contaminants.</p>

                        <p>In 1980, a chemical spill in the state of Florida in the United States contaminated a stream with very high concentrations of dicofol, including its metabolites DDE and chloro-DDT. Dicofol is an organochlorine pesticide, similar in chemical nature and environmental effects to DDT. After the spill, the alligator population in the region decreased by 90% and adult alligators in the region were found to have high levels of dicofol and its by-products in their bodies. Alligators in the affected region demonstrated numerous reproductive dysfunctions, such as abnormal gonadal morphology and gonadal deformities. Specifically, male alligators in the contaminated area had significantly decreased phallic size and alterations in sperm cells. A proposed hypothesis is that the by-product of dicofol, DDE , may interact with the estrogen receptor and thus affect proper reproductive development in the juvenile alligator.</p>
                        <p>However, it must be stated that this specific case study demands greater research to document a dose response relationship between dicofol exposure and the reproductive health effects witnessed. Large carnivorous reptiles may bioaccumulate greater levels of environmental contaminants due to their feeding habits as well as their long life expectancies in the wild. Studies have shown that in fact, certain reptiles can bioaccumulate and biomagnify environmental contaminants to an equal or even greater scale than birds.</p>

                        <p>Among the most widespread and persistent environmental toxicants are chlorinated hydrocarbons (such as dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and polychlorinated biphenyls), which are known to possess estrogenic potential, i.e., the ability to mimic the biological effects of estrogens. Imbalanced or unopposed estrogen exposure is a leading risk factor for many gynecologic malignancies, as well as benign proliferative disorders such as endometriosis and leiomyoma. The potential impact of these compounds on hormone-dependent physiological processes such as conception and fetal development, as well as on disease processes such as osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease, demands further exploration.</p>

                        <p>Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are toxic compounds used in industrial processes. Many different forms of PCBs exist and persist in the environment today. Because of adverse health outcomes with PCB exposures in the past, many industrial countries decided to decrease or ban its production.</p>
                        <p>Exposure of the general population to PCBs occurs principally through contaminated food items. Babies will be exposed through the mother's milk. Two large episodes of intoxication in humans have occurred in Japan (Yusho) and China, Province of Taiwan (Yu-Cheng).</p>
                        <p>The main symptoms in Yusho and Yu-Cheng patients have frequently been attributed to contaminants in the PCB mixtures, specifically, to Polychlorinated Dibenzofurans (PCDFs). Expert groups concluded that the symptoms may have been caused by the combined exposure to PCBs and PCDFs.</p>
                        <p>In children of Yusho and Yu-Cheng patients, diminished growth, dark pigmentation of the skin and mucous membranes, gingival hyperplasia, xenophthalmic oedematous eyes, dentition at birth, abnormal calcification of the skull, rocker bottom heel, and a high incidence of low birth weight were observed. Whether or not a correlation existed between the exposure and the occurrence of malignant neoplasms in these patients could not be definitely concluded, because the number of deaths was too small. However, a statistically significant increase was observed in male patients, with regard to mortality from all neoplasms, liver and lung cancer.</p>
                        <p>Developmental effects - Four epidemiological studies performed in the Netherlands examine the association between background PCB exposure and thyroid effects. These studies examined thyroid hormone levels in persons exposed to PCBs in utero and found that higher PCB exposure was associated with higher thyrotrophin-stimulating hormone (TSH) and lower T4 hormone levels in infancy and up to one year of age. These changes could affect neurodevelopment in utero as well as in neonatal and infant life. Studies examining neurodevelopment in relation to low level PCB exposure have found hypotonia and psychomotor delays in early life.</p>

                        <p>Certain environmental contaminants, specifically endocrine disruptors, may lead to adverse reproductive health effects in humans. A majority of the reproductive health effects of endocrine disruptors in humans have been witnessed through high exposure scenarios (for instance, the Seveso incident). For this reason, the research concerning low dose exposures is much less conclusive. However, low level exposures may potentially pose the greatest health threat for chronically exposed populations. Even small shifts in reproductive patterns may result in tremendous impacts for the population at large.</p>
