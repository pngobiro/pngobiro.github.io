                        <h3>SUMMARY</h3>
                        <p>This chapter gives step-by-step instructions for performing a circumcision on an infant or young child. Four surgical techniques are described:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>the dorsal slit method;</li>
                            <li>the Plastibell method;</li>
                            <li>the Mogen clamp method;</li>
                            <li>the Gomco clamp method.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Four widely-used surgical techniques for paediatric circumcision are described in this chapter. The recommended techniques are shown in detail so that they can be referred to in the context of a training course. After the initial training, they can be used to reinforce what has been learnt. Surgeons should become expert in the technique most suited to the circumstances of their practice. It is not recommended that a nursing, clinical or medical officer learn all the techniques. It is best to become a master of one. This will produce the best results with the least complications.</p>
                        <p>Circumcision of infants and pre-pubertal boys is simpler than circumcision of older boys and adults, because the penis is relatively underdeveloped and the foreskin less vascular. Healing is quick and complication rates are low. A major disadvantage is that the child cannot give consent for the procedure. In addition, the primary health benefit - reduced risk of HIV infection - is not realized until many years later when he becomes sexually active. Circumcision can be delayed to an older age, when the boy can understand the risks and benefits of circumcision and consent to the procedure himself. Programmes that promote circumcision of young children are likely to have lower morbidity rates and lower cost than programmes targeting adolescents and adults. However, this must be balanced by concerns about consent.</p>

                        <p>The screening procedures for infants and young children are similar to those for adolescents and adults, and are aimed at ensuring that the client is suitable for surgery at the clinic. If there is any doubt, surgery should be deferred or the client referred to a specialist centre. The circumcision team should enquire about the health of the baby or young boy.</p>
                        <p>Neonatal circumcision (within the first 28 days of life) should be undertaken only if the birth was a full-term delivery and the baby has had no significant medical problems. Known haematological disorders and jaundice are contraindications to circumcision. Thus any baby with yellow sclera or purpuric skin lesions should not be accepted for clinic-based circumcision. Any congenital abnormality of the genitalia is a contraindication to circumcision. Only babies with a normal physical examination and an intact, completely normal appearing penis and foreskin should be considered for male circumcision. This is because the foreskin may be needed for plastic surgical repair of the abnormality.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Anaesthesia is recommended for paediatric circumcision. Many studies have shown that babies react to pain, and that an effective method of providing local anaesthesia is with dorsal penile nerve block.<sup>a</sup> The maximum safe dose of lidocaine in children is 3 mg/kg of body weight. For a 3-kg baby, this corresponds to 0.9 ml of 1% solution or 1.8 ml of 0.5% solution (see Table 5.1). Anaesthetic solutions containing epinephrine (adrenaline) should never be used.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Safe injection of local anaesthetic</h3>
                        <p>It is the surgeon's responsibility to check the vial of anaesthetic, to ensure that the correct agent at the correct concentration has been selected, and to check the expiry date. It is important to verify that the anaesthetic is clear and that there are no visible particles, which may suggest that the vial is contaminated.</p>
                        <p>Using a fine needle (e.g. 27-gauge), injections are made at the 10 and 2 o'clock positions. Before injecting any local anaesthetic, the surgeon should gently aspirate to make sure that no blood enters the syringe. This is to ensure that anaesthetic is not injected into a blood vessel. This safety precaution should be repeated each time the needle is moved and before any additional local anaesthetic is injected.</p>

                        </figure>
                        <p>Local anaesthesia alone can be used for most infants (under one year of age) who can be held during the procedure so that they do not wriggle. It can also be used for boys who are old enough to cooperate during the procedure. For children between the ages of about 1 and 12 years, use of local anaesthetic alone is more problematic, since the boy may not remain still during the operation. Sedation may be required in addition to local anaesthesia, but there are risks, particularly of air-way obstruction and anoxia. If sedation is necessary to perform the procedure safely the patient should be referred to an appropriate facility.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">EMLA cream</h3>
                        <p>EMLA 5% cream (eutectic mixture of local anaesthetics, containing 2.5% lidocaine and 2.5% prilocaine) has been extensively used for Plastibell circumcision in children of all ages. It is safe and provides effective anaesthesia when correctly used. It must be applied with care in neonates, because of the potential risk of methaemoglobinaemia from prilocaine metabolites, which can oxidize haemoglobin and dangerously reduce the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood. Care must be taken to ensure that the cream is not accidentally rubbed onto a large area of the baby's body, as a result of the hands and feet wriggling during the procedure. This can be done by covering the penis with a small piece of polythene held in place with a sticking plaster. It has been shown that, provided the cream is applied only to the penis, EMLA is safe for both term and preterm infants.<sup>1</sup> Possible minor adverse events include transient local skin reactions, such as blanching and redness.</p>
                        <p>EMLA cream should be applied to the whole penis 1-2 hours before the procedure. In older boys whose foreskin can be retracted, the cream should be applied to the glans so that the glans and the underside of the foreskin are covered. Depending on local circumstances, it is often possible for the parent to apply the cream at home before coming to the clinic. If this is done, the clinic staff should ensure that the cream has been applied properly.</p>
                        <p>The maximum recommended doses and durations of exposure to EMLA cream are summarized in Table 6.1.</p>

                        <p>In many developed countries vitamin K is routinely given to babies to prevent vitamin K deficiency bleeding in the newborn. Vitamin K at a dose of 1 mg intramuscularly given shortly after birth has been shown in studies in the USA to reduce bleeding after neonatal circumcision. There is a need for evaluation of oral or injectable Vitamin K in the context of neonatal circumcision programmes in developing countries.</p>

                        <p>In infants and children, the foreskin is commonly fused to the glans by fine adhesions. These adhesions are normal. Before circumcision is performed, it is necessary to separate them.</p>
                        <p>Before the foreskin can be retracted it may be necessary to stretch the opening with an artery forceps. Care must be taken to avoid putting the tips of the forceps into the urethral meatus, in order to avoid injury.</p>

                        <p>Once the opening has been dilated, slowly retract the foreskin and separate adhesions by gently running a blunt probe around the glans or using gauze to separate the glans from the foreskin, until the corona is exposed. An alternative to a blunt probe is the tip of a closed pair of mosquito artery forceps. It sometimes helps to moisten the glans with chlorhexidine or povidone iodine, or to apply some sterile gel when separating adhesions.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Four techniques for circumcision of children are described in this section: the dorsal slit method, the Plastibell method, the Mogen clamp method, and the Gomco clamp method.</p>
                        <p>The dorsal slit method with closure of the wound with suture is not typically used for infant male circumcision and is more appropriate for older children, particularly in situations where the surgeon undertakes relatively few procedures so that it is not practical to stock devices. A small dorsal slit is a preliminary step when using the Gomco and Plastibell devices. Typically, in early infancy, the wound does not need to be closed with sutures, regardless of the device used.</p>
                        <p>In babies, the foreskin is long in relation to the penis, and there is little chance of penile erection. This has two important consequences. First, the glans will be further exposed towards puberty, as the penis grows relative to the foreskin. Second, clamping devices that remain on the penis for a few days (e.g. the Plastibell device) are more feasible than with adults, because there is less chance of the device being pushed off by an erection.</p>
                        <p>In early infancy (&lt; 60 days of age), regardless of which technique is used, closure of the wound is typically not necessary. Beyond early infancy (&gt;60 days) better cosmetic outcomes may be achieved if the wound is closed with simple interrupted sutures. The Plastibell provides a unique benefit over the other techniques in that it can be used outside of the early infant period without regularly requiring surgical closure.</p>
                        <p>Extremely rare complications such as loss of the glans, urinary retention and bladder rupture have been reported with the use of the Plastibell device as a result of migration of the ring onto the shaft of the penis, which may happen if the wrong size is used. The Plastibell should only be considered in areas where follow up is both reliable and easily available.</p>
                        <p>The Plastibell is a disposable device, whereas the Mogen and Gomco clamps are reusable. The choice between the different techniques may depend on the cost of the Plastibell, the need to sterilize the Mogen and Gomco clamps, the ages at which circumcision is performed, and the possible need for suturing skills.</p>
                        <p>The advantages and disadvantages of the different methods of paediatric circumcision are summarized in Table 6.2.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Suture material</h3>
                        <p>Sutures are almost always used in the dorsal slit method but are typically not required for the Gomco and Mogen technique when used in early infancy (&lt;60 days of age). The selection of suture size is a compromise between ensuring adequate tensile strength and keeping the amount of foreign material to a minimum. The preferred suture size for paediatric surgery is 5/0 or 4/0 chromic catgut or vicryl rapide. The suture should be mounted on a round-bodied needle.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Dorsal slit method for children</h3>
                        <p>The dorsal slit technique can be undertaken by any skilled surgeon, using standard operating instruments. The technique is useful in clinics undertaking limited numbers of paediatric circumcisions. The penis of an infant is small, and any surgeon who is going to undertake paediatric circumcision should already be competent with general surgical skills and adult procedures. There is a need for fine movements and small tissue bites. In particular, the surgeon must take care in the region of the frenulum, because the urethra is close to the skin, and can easily be injured.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Step 1.</strong> After cleaning, draping, and anaesthesia, a sterile marking pen or gentian violet is used to mark the line of the circumcision over the corona, with no tension on the foreskin, using the technique described in Chapter 5.<sup>e</sup></li>

                        <p>Open and remove the clamp then hold the foreskin with artery forceps on each side of the crushed area, at the 11 o'clock and 1 o'clock positions.

                        </ol>
                        <p>It may be necessary in older boys to trim the mucosal layer of the foreskin to 2-3 mm from the corona. If this layer is left too long, the suture line can slip back over the glans, constricting it and making it appear as if the foreskin has not been removed ("concealed glans"). Control any significant bleeding by clipping the blood vessel with an artery forceps and then tying. Bipolar diathermy may be used, if available. Minor bleeding can be controlled with simple pressure for five minutes.</p>

                            <li><strong>Step 4.</strong> Suture the edges of the incision with 5/0 or 4/0 vicryl or catgut sutures (depending on the age of the child) and a roundbodied needle. Cutting needles should not be used.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Approximate the skin edges and the frenulum using simple sutures; mattress sutures are not necessary. Take great care at the frenulum, because the urethra is near the surface and can easily be injured by too deep a bite. Place all sutures approximately 1 mm from the skin edge. Place the first two sutures at the 12 o'clock and 6 o'clock positions, leaving them long and temporarily held with forceps (Fig. 6.8). This keeps the penis stable while the remaining sutures are completed. In babies, only two further stitches may be needed on each side. In older children, it is helpful to place sutures at the 3 o'clock and 9 o'clock positions, and then to place the final sutures in between.</p>

                        <p>The Plastibell technique is widely used and has been shown to be acceptable and practical in developing country settings. This technique requires less surgical skill than the dorsal slit method to produce a neat result. It can be used in children up to age 10-12 years, and can be used with EMLA anaesthetic cream. However, as for other surgical methods, incorrect technique can result in complications. Any clinic offering Plastibell circumcision needs to have in stock the full range of bell sizes. If the bell used is too small, it may cause pressure necrosis and injury to the glans. If the bell is too large, it may slip over the glans onto the shaft of the penis and cause constriction. In extreme cases this may result in gangrene and loss of the glans and/or urinary retention and bladder rupture.<sup>fgh</sup> For these reasons, the Plastibell technique is only recommended for use in clinics that regularly perform paediatric circumcisions and follow-up can be assured; it is not recommended for occasional use.</p>

                            <li><strong>Step 1.</strong> Select the correct size of Plastibell according to the girth of the glans. The most commonly used sizes are 11 or 13 mm.</li>
                            <li><strong>Step 2.</strong> After cleaning, draping anaesthesia, and marking the line of the circumcision over the corona. retract the foreskin and separate the adhesions to expose the corona, as described above.</li>
                            <li><strong>Step 3.</strong> It is usually necessary to make a dorsal slit (as described above) before the Plastibell can be placed on the glans. The slit needs only to be sufficiently long to allow the Plastibell to be placed over the glans. Each Plastibell is supplied in a sterile packet with a ligature - the Plastibell tie. The procedure is easier if, after opening the Plastibell package, the Plastibell tie is placed loosely around the shaft of the penis before the dorsal slit is made (Fig. 6.10).</li>

                        <p>The Mogen clamp is widely used. There have been several studies comparing it with the Gomco clamp, another widely used device. The Mogen ("shield") clamp compares favourably, because it is easy to use and has no parts to assemble. The fewest complications with this method have been reported in the context of circumcision of 8-day-old babies. Since the Mogen clamp is reusable, careful precautions have to be taken to ensure the device is properly cleaned and sterilized between procedures. Also there is a risk that the glans can be pulled into the slit and crushed or partially severed.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">The Gomco clamp method</h3>
                        <p>The Gomco clamp has different bell sizes that can be used for infants, older children and adults. In addition, the crushing of the foreskin is circular (unlike with the Mogen clamp, which is linear). A disadvantage of the Gomco clamp is that, unlike the Mogen clamp, it consists of four parts - base plate, rocker arm or top plate, nut and bell. A number of bells of different sizes are also needed. There is a risk that parts of the clamp may be mislaid or lost during cleaning and sterilization. Before the start of the procedure and before any anaesthetic is given the surgeon must check that likely sizes of Gomco clamps are available. Once the procedure has started and the correct size has been selected the clamp should be assembled to ensure parts are complete and fit correctly.</p>
                        <p>Meticulous care must be used to not mismatch device parts. If a small bell is used with a larger base plate the device will not crush the foreskin or protect the glans, possibly resulting in haemorrhage and penile laceration. Correctly matched and sized parts must be used.</p>
                        <p>Component parts from different clamps or manufacturers are not interchangeable and care must be taken to ensure that the clamp is assembled only from its original parts.</p>
                        <p>The Gomco clamp should also be thoroughly checked and not used if it has stripped threads, a warped or bent base plate, a bent arm, twisted forks on the rocker arm, or a scored or nicked bell. The clinic may mark clamp parts to ensure that they are correctly reassembled. If so, the manufacturer should be consulted on the best way to do this. Some marking methods may weaken the device or make it difficult to sterilize it.</p>

                            <li><strong>Step 2.</strong> It is usually necessary to make a small dorsal slit to allow the clamp to be placed on the glans. It is important not to make the dorsal slit too long. Otherwise, it will extend beyond the ring of crushed tissue produced by the Gomco clamp and may produce an untidy result with increased risk of bleeding. The dorsal slit should be long enough to allow all adhesions to be divided and the bell of the Gomco clamp to be placed over the glans.</li>
                            <li><strong>Step 3.</strong> Choose the correct size of Gomco clamp bell to fit the glans. For neonatal circumcision, a bell size of 1.1 cm is usually appropriate. Introduce the bell through the aperture in the foreskin and place over the glans. Then pull the foreskin over the bell (Fig 6.22).</li>
                            <li><strong>Step 4.</strong> Place the base plate of the Gomco clamp over the bell, keeping the foreskin pulled over the bell (Figs 6.22 and 6.23). Put the rocker arm of the clamp in position, taking care to place the crossbar at the top of the bell correctly in the yoke. The clamp is now ready for tightening.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Before tightening the clamp, make sure that the foreskin is symmetrical over the bell. The apex of the dorsal slit should be visible. Finally, the crossbar at the top of the bell should sit squarely in the yoke of the clamp, otherwise there will be uneven crushing and a risk of bleeding.</p>

                            <li><strong>Step 7.</strong> Once the clamp has been removed (Fig 6.26), the crushed skin edge will typically have resulted in haemostasis with good tissue alignment. Normally in early infancy, no sutures are required. In older infants (>60 days) it may be necessary to place some 5-0 simple sutures to approximate the edges.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>To obtain a good result with the Gomco clamp, the surgeon must ensure:<br>(a) the dorsal slit is not made too long, the apex must be above the crushed skin edge.<br>(b) the crossbar of the bell is placed evenly in the yoke of the rocker arm, so that there is an even distribution of the crushing force; and<br>(c) the foreskin is symmetrically aligned over the bell.</p>

                        <p>The parents of an infant or child who has had a Gomco clamp circumcision should be told that it is not necessary to use a dressing, and the baby can be looked after in the normal way, including normal washing and the use of nappies. Healing is usually complete after about one week. Bleeding is rare because the clamp crushes the edge of the foreskin. Parents should be told to bring the child back to the clinic if:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>the child appears to be distressed or in pain;</li>
                            <li>the child has fever;</li>
                            <li>the child does not wake for feeding as per his usual pattern;</li>
                            <li>there is any separation of the skin edges;</li>
                            <li>there is any unusual swelling or bleeding;</li>
                            <li>the child has any difficulties with urination;</li>
                            <li>the parents have any other concern about healing.</li>

                        <p>Parents should be given information about circumcision so that they can give informed consent to the procedure. The information should be given verbally in the local language using non-technical terms. In addition, the clinic should have printed information sheets that the parents can take home. Information given needs to be specific to the clinic, and should include the following topics.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>What circumcision is.</strong> Circumcision is removal of the foreskin. This means that the head of the penis is exposed all the time. It does not affect the ability to pass urine normally and does not affect the ability to father children in adult life.</li>
                            <li><strong>The benefits of circumcision.</strong> The main benefits of circumcision are improved penile hygiene, reduced risk of sexually transmitted infections, including HIV, and reduced risk of cancer of the penis.</li>
                            <li><strong>How circumcision is done.</strong> The technique to be used should be described, i.e. dorsal slit with sutures, Plastibell, Mogen or Gomco clamp methods.</li>
                            <li><strong>The risks of circumcision.</strong> It should be explained that complications from male circumcision are extremely rare but can include poor cosmetic outcome, bleeding, infection, or injury to surrounding structures.</li>
                            <li><strong>What to do before circumcision.</strong> No special precautions are needed before the operation. If the child becomes ill before the planned operation date, the parents should contact the clinic to postpone the procedure until after the child recovers.</li>
                            <li><strong>What to do after circumcision.</strong> The instructions will depend on the procedure that has been used (see descriptions of techniques in Chapter 6).</li>
                            <li><strong>What to do if there are any complications or problems after circumcision,</strong> in particular bleeding, infection or other concerns. This will usually be for the family to bring the baby back to the clinic, but if distance makes a return visit difficult then an alternative health facility should be identified.</li>
                            <li><strong>An emergency contact number or information about where to go in an emergency.</strong></li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>I have asked the parent or guardian some questions to make sure that he or she understands the information I have given.</p>
