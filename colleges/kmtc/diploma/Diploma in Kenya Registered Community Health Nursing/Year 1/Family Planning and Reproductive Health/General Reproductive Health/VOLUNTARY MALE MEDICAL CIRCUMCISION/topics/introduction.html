                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Male circumcision has been performed on boys and young men for many years, primarily for religious and cultural reasons or as a rite of passage to mark the transition to adulthood. Data from cross-sectional epidemiological studies conducted since the mid-1980s showed that circumcised men have a lower prevalence of HIV infection than uncircumcised men. This finding was supported by data from prospective studies that showed a lower incidence of HIV infection in circumcised men than in uncircumcised men. Although the analysis adjusted for cultural and social factors associated with male circumcision, it was not clear from these studies whether promoting male circumcision among men who would not otherwise be circumcised would result in a lower incidence of HIV infection. To address this question, three randomized controlled trials were launched in Kenya, Uganda and South Africa in 2004. The results from the South African study were published in late 2005, and showed a 60% lower incidence of HIV infection among men randomly assigned to undergo immediate circumcision compared with those assigned to delayed circumcision. Confirmatory results from the two other trials were released in December 2006. These data led WHO and UNAIDS to recommend in 2007 that male circumcision should be considered an additional way of reducing risk of HIV infection in men and programmes for safe male circumcision should be expanded rapidly in countries and settings with generalized HIV epidemics and low prevalence of circumcision.</p>
                        <p>There is increased demand for male circumcision in several countries with a high incidence of HIV, but there is little technical guidance on how services can be safely expanded given the limited resources available. Reports of high complication rates following circumcisions performed on young men by traditional circumcisers in southern and eastern Africa are common, but the true incidence is not known. Technical guidance on the provision of safe male circumcision services is therefore necessary. Although circumcisions are widely performed by surgeons and general practitioners in an appropriate clinical environment, resources are not currently adequate to meet the anticipated increased demand.</p>
                        <p>This technical manual on male circumcision is aimed at providers of male circumcision services and programme managers. No attempt is made to describe all possible methods for male circumcision. The methods covered have been selected on the basis of their safety and practicality for use in resource-limited settings. The manual forms part of a comprehensive package, which includes training guides and materials, as well as a male circumcision quality improvement framework for use by providers, programme managers and national medical authorities to ensure high-quality services. While providing detailed technical information on the different surgical approaches, the manual also addresses broader issues of sexual and reproductive health of men, and emphasizes that male circumcision must be set within the context of other strategies for reducing risk of HIV infection. A full description of best practices for surgery and anaesthesia in resource-limited settings can be found in the WHO publication, Surgical care at the district hospital (Geneva, WHO, 2003).</p>
                        <p>The manual has been developed by the World Health Organization (WHO), in collaboration with the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) and Jhpiego, as part of work to support countries in providing safe male circumcision services, and ensuring that circumcised men do not perceive themselves as fully protected against HIV and other sexually transmitted infections and consequently forgo other HIV risk-reduction strategies.</p>
                        <p>The manual was developed from reproductive health and surgery training materials, as well as on the basis of experience with service provision in Africa, the Eastern Mediterranean, and developed countries. The manual and materials were reviewed by actual and potential providers of male circumcision services representing a range of health care and cultural settings where demand for male circumcision services is high.</p>
                        <p>This manual is one of several documents and guidelines developed by WHO, UNAIDS and partners to assist countries develop and implement programmes for safe medical male circumcision for HIV prevention within the context of their existing HIV prevention activities, and sexual and reproductive health programmes. All documents can be downloaded from the Clearinghouse on Male Circumcision for HIV Prevention (www.malecircumcision.org), a web site created to share technical and policy guidance, knowledge, tools and experience relevant to implementing male circumcision programmes. The most relevant documents include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>New data on male circumcision and HIV prevention: Policy and programme implications - provides guidance to policy makers and programme managers on issues that need to be considered and addressed when planning for programme scale-up.</li>
                            <li>Operational guidance for scaling up male circumcision services for HIV prevention. This document provides operational and programmatic guidance to decision-makers, programme managers and technical support agencies on scaling up programmes in the public and private sectors.</li>
                            <li>Male Circumcision Quality Assurance: A Guide to Enhancing the Safety and Quality of Services - outlines the roles and responsibilities of national and district programme managers for implementing safe quality male circumcision services and provides guidance for the planning of a national quality assurance programme. It defines ten quality standards against which the quality of services can be measured and used as part of a continuous process of service improvement. The guide is supplemented by the Male circumcision services quality assessment toolkit which is used by facility managers and providers to assess their own performance. It can be used by national and district managers to conduct external assessments of facilities. The toolkit includes a scoring tool, into which users can enter assessment findings and monitor progress towards meeting the standards.</li>
                            <li>Considerations for implementing models for optimizing the volume and efficiency of male circumcision services for HIV prevention. This document provides guidance to help programmes improve the efficiency of clinical and surgical activities so that they can strengthen their capacity to meet demand for male circumcision services. It addresses clinical techniques, staffing, facility space, client scheduling and flow, commodities management, cost efficiencies, and quality assurance. It also includes detailed model lists of equipment and supplies required to support a male circumcision programme.</li>
                            <li>A guide to indicators for male circumcision programmes in the formal health care system lists indicators that programmes can use to monitor and evaluate progress towards their programme objectives. Adaptable to different country situations, the guide includes indicators of demand for, and supply of, male circumcision services, as well as measures to assess secondary effects of the programme, such as changes in sexual behaviours at the individual and community levels.</li>
