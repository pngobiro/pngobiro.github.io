                            <li>Circumcision is the surgical removal of the foreskin, the fold of skin that covers the head of the penis (glans).</li>
                            <li>The benefits of male circumcision include a reduced risk of urinary tract infections in childhood, a reduced risk of ulcerative sexually transmitted diseases in adulthood, protection against penile cancer, a reduced risk of cervical cancer in female sex partners, and prevention of balanitis (inflammation of the glans), posthitis (inflammation of the foreskin), phimosis (inability to retract the foreskin) and paraphimosis (inability to return the retracted foreskin to its original location).</li>
                            <li>Complication rates following male circumcision are very low when it is performed by well equipped and trained health care providers.</li>
                            <li>Numerous regional and global studies since the 1980s have noted a lower risk of HIV infection in circumcised men, as well as lower HIV prevalence in populations where male circumcision is common.</li>
                            <li>Randomized controlled trials in Kenya, South Africa and Uganda have demonstrated that male circumcision reduces the individual man's risk of acquiring HIV infection by 60%.</li>

                        <p>Circumcision is the surgical removal of the foreskin, the fold of skin that covers the head of the penis. It is widely practised for religious and traditional reasons, often within the first two weeks after birth, or at the beginning of adolescence as a rite of passage into adulthood. It may also be performed for medical reasons to treat problems involving the foreskin.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">How circumcision is performed</h3>
                        <p>During a circumcision, the foreskin is freed from the head of the penis (glans) and removed. When done in a newborn baby, the procedure is simpler and quicker than in adolescents and adults. Superficial wound healing after circumcision in adults generally takes 5-7 days. However, about 4-6 weeks are needed for the wound to heal fully. In babies and young boys, the healing time is considerably shorter.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Whether or not circumcision is necessary has been a subject of heated debate in many countries. In some settings, circumcision is widely performed for religious or cultural reasons, while in others it is performed principally on medical grounds. In order to make an informed decision, every potential client or parent is entitled to full information about the benefits and risks of the procedure.</p>
                        <p>The decision of an adult or young man to be circumcised, and the decision of a parent to have his or her son circumcised, should be based on culture, religion, personal preference, and evidence-based information provided by a health care worker.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Benefits</h3>
                        <p>If circumcision is being done for reasons other than the treatment of a specific medical problem, the health benefits are primarily preventive, and may only be realized long after the procedure. Circumcision may reduce the risk of acquiring some infections and related complications, but does not guarantee complete protection. Some of these conditions are common, while others are less so, and the degree of risk of the individual is likely to depend on his behaviour and where he lives. Although the strength of the evidence varies by disease, the benefits of circumcision include the following:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>It is easier to keep the penis clean.</li>
                            <li>There is a reduced risk of urinary tract infections in childhood.<sup>1</sup></li>
                            <li>Circumcision prevents inflammation of the glans (balanitis) and the foreskin (posthitis).</li>
                            <li>Circumcision prevents the potential development of scar tissue on the foreskin, which may lead to phimosis (inability to retract the foreskin) and paraphimosis (swelling of the retracted foreskin resulting in inability to return the foreskin to its normal position).</li>
                            <li>There is a reduced risk of some sexually transmitted infections (STIs), especially ulcerative diseases, such as chancroid and syphilis.<sup>2,3</sup></li>
                            <li>There is a reduced risk of becoming infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).<sup>4, 5, 6, 7, 8</sup></li>
                            <li>There is a reduced risk of penile cancer.<sup>9,10</sup></li>
                            <li>There is a reduced risk of cancer of the cervix in female sex partners.<sup>11</sup></li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Risks</h3>
                        <p>As for any surgical procedure, there are risks associated with circumcision. While the benefits of circumcision may be wide-ranging and long-term, any problems generally occur during or soon after the procedure. They include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>pain;</li>
                            <li>bleeding;</li>
                            <li>haematoma (formation of a blood clot under the skin);</li>
                            <li>infection at the site of the circumcision;</li>
                            <li>increased sensitivity of the glans penis for the first few months after the procedure;</li>
                            <li>irritation of the glans;</li>
                            <li>meatitis (inflammation of the opening of the urethra);</li>
                            <li>injury to the penis;</li>
                            <li>adverse reaction to the anaesthetic used during the circumcision.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>These complications are rare when circumcision is performed by well trained, adequately equipped, experienced health care personnel, and are usually easily and rapidly resolved. Data from controlled trials show that fewer than 1 in 50 procedures result in complications.<sup>4,6</sup></p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>There is currently great interest in the role of male circumcision in preventing HIV infection. Research studies have shown a lower risk of infection in circumcised compared with uncircumcised men, as well as a lower prevalence of HIV infection in populations where male circumcision is common. These data led WHO and UNAIDS to recommend that male circumcision be promoted as an additional method of HIV prevention and that countries or settings with generalized HIV epidemics and low prevalence of circumcision should urgently scale up circumcision services.<sup>12</sup></p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">The evidence linking male circumcision and HIV</h3>
                        <p>A systematic review and meta-analysis of 28 published studies found that uncircumcised men are 2-3 times more likely to be infected with HIV than circumcised men, with the difference being most pronounced in men with high exposure to HIV infection.<sup>5</sup> A sub-analysis of 10 African studies, involving men considered to be at high risk of becoming infected, found a 3.4 times higher incidence of HIV infection among those who had not been circumcised.<sup>5</sup> In a prospective study in Uganda of HIV-negative men whose partners were HIV-positive, none of 50 circumcised men became infected within two years, compared with 40 of 137 uncircumcised men.<sup>13</sup></p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Male circumcision and regional differences in HIV prevalence</h3>
                        <p>The geographical regions in sub-Saharan Africa where men are more commonly circumcised overlap with areas of lower HIV prevalence. An extensive study by the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) investigated behavioural and other factors that could account for the large disparities in HIV prevalence across different African regions.<sup>14</sup> A low prevalence of male circumcision and a high prevalence of genital herpes (which is more common in uncircumcised men) emerged as the principal determinants of the differences in HIV rates.</p>

                        <p>A study in India followed 2298 men attending three STI clinics.<sup>17</sup> A significantly lower incidence of HIV infection was observed among the circumcised men, although rates of STIs, such as syphilis and gonorrhoea, were similar. The similar incidence of STIs in the two groups indicates similar sexual risk behaviour, and suggests a biological rather than a behavioural explanation for the observed lower rate of HIV. However, it is important to note that, of the 191 circumcised men, 62% were Muslim. When non-Muslim men were assessed separately, the circumcised group was small and no significant protective effect was found. This illustrates the difficulty of separating the effect of male circumcision from that of other cultural factors. Only randomized controlled trials can determine the efficacy of male circumcision in reducing the risk of HIV infection.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Randomized controlled trials to assess the efficacy of male circumcision in reducing risk of HIV infection</h3>
                        <p>In July 2005 the results of the Orange Farm Intervention Trial in South Africa were made public; they were subsequently published in November 2005.<sup>6</sup> This was the first report from a randomized controlled trial of male circumcision as a means to prevent HIV infection. A total of 3274 uninfected men, aged 18-24 years, were randomly assigned to undergo circumcision either immediately or after 21 months. The incidence of HIV infection was found to be 60% lower among those who were circumcised. On the strength of these results, the Independent Data Monitoring Committee recommended that the men initially assigned to the delayed circumcision group should be offered the procedure without further delay, without waiting the full 21 months.</p>
                        <p>Two further trials on male circumcision and HIV infection were stopped in December 2006 and published in early 2007. Both trials involved random allocation of HIV-negative volunteers to either immediate circumcision, performed by trained medical professionals in a clinic setting (intervention group), or circumcision delayed for 2 years (control group). The first trial, in Kisumu, western Kenya, was conducted among men aged 18-24 years, and showed a 53% reduction in HIV incidence.<sup>7</sup> The second study was conducted in Rakai, Uganda, among men aged 15-49 years, and showed a 51% reduction in HIV incidence.<sup>8</sup> Following release of the study results, circumcision was offered without further delay to the men in both nonintervention groups.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Possible biological explanations for the protective effect of male circumcision</h3>
                        <p>The primary cells through which HIV enters the body are Langerhans cells. These cells are present in high density in the epithelium of the inner foreskin, and are close to the surface because the layer of keratin is thin.<sup>18,19</sup></p>
                        <p>In an in vitro study, viral uptake by cells from the mucosal surface of foreskin was 7 times more efficient than that by tissue from the female cervix.<sup>20</sup> The inner mucosal surface of the foreskin lacks the thick layer of keratin that covers most exposed skin. This leaves numerous mucosal Langerhans cells and other immune cell targets easily accessible to HIV infection.<sup>21</sup></p>
                        <p>The highly vascularized foreskin mucosa, and in particular the frenulum, is prone to tearing and bleeding during intercourse. These micro-injuries allow easy access of HIV to the bloodstream.</p>
                        <p>A further factor that may facilitate entry of the virus is the presence of an ulcerative STI, such as herpes simplex, chancroid or syphilis, which tend to be more common in uncircumcised men.<sup>5</sup></p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Protection for women</h3>
                        <p>A study in Uganda observed lower rates of male-to-female transmission of HIV if the man was circumcised.<sup>13</sup> Among 47 couples in which the circumcised male partner was infected with HIV and whose viral load was below 50000 copies per ml, none of the female partners became infected in two years. By contrast, 26 of the 147 women whose HIV-infected partners were not circumcised became infected.</p>
                        <p>A subsequent randomized controlled trial of circumcision among men with HIV infection did not confirm this result. It showed there might be a higher risk of HIV transmission to women in the first two years after the operation.<sup>22</sup></p>
                        <p>A further observational study has shown a 40% lower risk of HIV infection in couples where the male partner was infected and the female partner not infected with HIV, but the reduction in risk was not significant.<sup>23</sup></p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Other health benefits of circumcision</h3>
                        <p>A multicountry study<sup>24</sup> found a lower prevalence of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection in circumcised men than in uncircumcised men. HPV infection is a necessary causal factor for cervical cancer and is associated with an increased risk of cancer of the vulva, vagina and anus in women, and of the penis and anus in men. Prospective studies have shown that circumcised men are less likely to have HPV infection.<sup>25,26,27</sup></p>
                        <p>The incidence of invasive penile cancer is significantly lower in circumcised men than in uncircumcised men, though this condition is extremely rare.<sup>28,10</sup></p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Acceptability of circumcision among African men</h3>
                        <p>Surveys and qualitative studies among young as well as older men in six African countries have found that a considerable proportion expressed interest in circumcision, ranging from 45% in Harare, Zimbabwe, to over 80% in a large survey in Botswana.<sup>29</sup> These studies indicate that many men would willingly undergo circumcision if it could be performed safely and at reasonable cost.</p>
                        <p>In the surveys, the men reported that their main interest in circumcision was related to hygiene, infection control and, for some, a belief that condom use is easier for men who are circumcised.</p>
