                        <h3>SUMMARY</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Health care workers need to follow recommended practices for preventing infection, in order to protect themselves, other health care workers, and their patients from exposure to HIV and other infections.</li>
                            <li>Hand hygiene greatly reduces the number of disease-causing microorganisms on hands and arms. It is the most important way of limiting the spread of infection. If hands are visibly soiled, they should be washed with soap and water; otherwise, an alcohol-based handrub should be used.</li>
                            <li>Personal protective equipment should be worn to protect both patients and staff from infectious microorganisms.</li>
                            <li>Gloves should be worn: when there is a reasonable chance of hand contact with blood or other body fluids, mucous membranes, broken or cut skin; when performing any invasive procedure; and when handling contaminated items. A new pair of gloves should be worn for each new patient contact, to avoid spreading infection from person to person.</li>
                            <li>Hypodermic (hollow-bore) needles can cause injuries to clinic staff at all levels: workers can be stuck by hypodermic needles during patient care, cleaning and housekeeping. Staff may be exposed to needle-stick and sharp injuries when washing soiled instruments and disposing of waste material.</li>
                            <li>All staff should be trained in the proper handling of sharp instruments.</li>
                            <li>Soiled instruments and other reusable items can transmit disease if not properly cleaned, disinfected and sterilized (or high-level disinfected). High-level disinfection destroys all microorganisms, except some bacterial endospores. Sterilization destroys all microorganisms, including bacterial endospores.</li>
                            <li>Proper waste management is important to prevent accidental injury to people who handle waste items, and to prevent the spread of infection to health care workers and the local community.</li>
                            <li>Post-exposure prophylaxis for HIV with antiretroviral drugs may reduce the risk of infection after exposure to HIV. It will be effective only if it is started as soon as possible after exposure (within 72 h) and if the full course of treatment is adhered to.</li>
                            <li>Post-exposure prophylaxis for hepatitis B can reduce the risk of hepatitis B infection.</li>

                        <p>Measures to prevent infection in male circumcision programmes have two primary objectives:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>to minimize the risk of infections in people having surgery;</li>
                            <li>to minimize the risk of transmitting HIV and other infections to clients and health care staff, including cleaning and housekeeping staff.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>In the context of circumcision services, there are two important pathways for transmission of infection:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Direct transmission.</strong> Enteric and skin infections can be transmitted by this route, as can bloodborne pathogens, such as HIV and hepatitis B virus, either by direct contact with an open wound or blood, blood products and body fluids, or by accident through a needle stick injury.</li>
                            <li><strong>Airborne transmission.</strong> Pneumonia, pertussis, diphtheria, influenza, mumps, and meningitis can be transmitted through droplets in the air, usually within a range of about 1 m, while active pulmonary tuberculosis, measles, chickenpox, pulmonary plague, and haemorrhagic fever with pneumonia can be transmitted via droplet nuclei (small-particle aerosols) over larger ranges.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>In male circumcision programmes, a major concern is the potential direct transmission of bloodborne pathogens, such as HIV and hepatitis B virus, to health care workers or patients. Exposure may take place during patient care, clinical or surgical procedures, processing of soiled instruments, cleaning and waste disposal. Needle-stick injuries carry a high risk of infection; the actual level of risk will depend on the type of needle, the depth of the injury, the amount of blood or blood product on the needle, and the viral load in the blood.</p>
                        <p>The risk of acquiring HIV from an HIV-infected person through a needle-stick injury is estimated at 0.3% (three HIV infections for every 1000 injuries). The risk of acquiring hepatitis B virus infection, after being stuck with a needle that has been used on a person with hepatitis B infection ranges from 6% to 37%, with an average of 18%. Finally, the risk of acquiring hepatitis C infection after being stuck with a needle that has been used on a hepatitis-C-infected person is 1.8%.<sup>1</sup></p>
                        <p>Most instances of transmission of infection in health care facilities can be prevented through the application of basic infection control precautions. In the circumcision clinic, standard precautions, as described below, should be applied to all patients at all times, regardless of their infection status.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Standard precautions are a set of practices to prevent and control infection. They include the use of personal protective equipment, designed to protect health care workers and patients from contact with infectious agents.</p>
                        <p>Laboratory and health care workers can protect themselves and their patients from exposure to HIV and other infections by following standard precautions.</p>
                        <p>Often, during clinical care, it is not known whether a patient is infected or colonized with potentially pathogenic microorganisms. Every patient, and every member of staff, should therefore be considered at risk, both of infecting others and of acquiring an infection. Standard precautions should be applied during all contact between health care workers and patients, in all health care facilities at all times.</p>
                        <p>The key components of standard precautions are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>hand washing and antisepsis (hand hygiene);</li>
                            <li>use of personal protective equipment when handling blood, blood products, body fluids or excretions, mucous membranes, non-intact skin, or wound dressings;</li>
                            <li>prevention of needle-stick and sharp injuries;</li>

                        <p>Hand hygiene is the single most important and cost-effective measure to eliminate disease-causing microorganisms that contaminate hands, and to limit the spread of infection. Proper hand hygiene can be accomplished by frequent hand washing and frequent use of an alcohol-based handrub.</p>
                        <p>In most clinical situations, an alcohol-based handrub should be used for routine hand antisepsis. Commercial handrubs, liquid soaps and skin-care products are sold in disposable containers, and may be used provided they meet recognized international standards (such as those of the American Society for Testing and Materials or the European Committee for Standardization), and are well accepted by health care workers. Where such products are not available or are too costly, an alcohol-based handrub can be produced locally at low cost.<sup>2</sup></p>
                        <p>Clean water<sup>a</sup> should be available for hand hygiene in all health care settings providing services related to male circumcision (screening, surgery, and follow-up). All staff should wash their hands with soap and water before starting their clinic duties, and whenever hands are visibly soiled. In addition, staff should use an alcohol-based handrub frequently, particularly before and after direct contact with each patient.</p>
                        <p>Hands should be washed or treated with a handrub:</p>
                        <ul>

                            <li>Staff who frequently wash hands or use an alcohol-based handrub should use hand lotions and creams regularly to minimize drying of the skin and reduce the risk of irritant contact dermatitis. Staff with an allergy or adverse reaction to alcohol-based handrubs should use other handrubs or soap and water.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>If potentially infectious blood or other body fluid is splashed onto non-intact skin, or if there is a potentially infective percutaneous injury, do not use alcohol-based solutions or strong disinfectants; wash the affected part with water and soap, and seek advice on the need for post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) (see page 8-16).</p>

                        <p>Personal protective equipment provides a physical barrier against microorganisms, helping to prevent them from contaminating hands, eyes, clothing, hair and shoes, and from being transmitted to patients and staff.</p>
                        <p>Personal protective equipment includes gloves, masks, protective eyewear (face shield or goggles), cap or hair cover, apron, gown, and footwear (boot or shoe covers).</p>
                        <p>Personal protective equipment should be used by health care workers who provide direct care to patients, support staff, including medical aides, cleaners, and laundry staff, and family members who provide care to patients in situations where they may have contact with blood, blood products and body fluids. Laboratory staff who handle patient specimens should always use personal protective equipment.</p>
                        <p>Protective equipment that is designed for single use (e.g. disposable gloves, eyewear, masks, caps, gowns, aprons and footwear) should not be reused. It should be disposed of according to the health care facility protocol. Reusable equipment should be decontaminated according to the manufacturer's instructions or laundered according to the health care facility protocol.</p>

                        <p>The use of gloves does not replace the need for hand hygiene by either hand rubbing or hand washing. Gloves should be worn whenever the person is likely to come into contact with blood or other potentially infectious materials, mucous membranes, or non-intact skin. Gloves should be removed immediately after caring for a patient. Gloves should not be used for the care of more than one patient.</p>
                        <p>Change or remove gloves in the following situations: during patient care if moving from a contaminated body site to a clean body site within the same patient; after patient contact before touching another patient.</p>
                        <p>In countries with a high prevalence of hepatitis B, hepatitis C and HIV infection, wearing two pairs of gloves (double gloving) may be appropriate for surgical procedures lasting more than 30 minutes or involving contact with large amounts of blood or body fluids. This situation is not likely to apply with properly screened patients undergoing clinic-based circumcision.</p>

                        <p>Keep in mind the following:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Wear gloves of the correct size, particularly for surgery.</li>
                            <li>Use water-soluble (non-fat-containing) hand lotions and moisturizers, to prevent skin from drying, cracking, and chapping. Avoid oil-based hand lotions and creams, because they can damage latex rubber surgical and examination gloves.</li>
                            <li>Keep fingernails short: they should not extend beyond the fingertip. Bacteria and other microorganisms that cause disease can collect under long nails. Long nails also tend to puncture gloves more easily.</li>
                            <li>Store gloves in an area where they are protected from extremes of temperature.</li>
                            <li>Glove reprocessing is strongly discouraged and should be avoided. There is currently no standardized, validated and affordable procedure for reprocessing gloves.</li>
                            <li>Using gloves when they are not necessary represents a waste of resources.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Masks, caps and protective eyewear</h3>
                        <p>Masks protect the mucous membranes of the mouth and nose from possible infections, as well as reduce the risks of transmission of infections from the health care worker. They should be worn by anyone undertaking a procedure that is likely to generate splashes of blood, blood products and body fluids. Surgical masks are designed to resist fluids, and are preferable to cotton or gauze masks.</p>
                        <p>Caps or hair covers and eyewear, such as plastic goggles, safety glasses, face shields and visors, protect against accidental splashes, spills and leaks of blood and other body fluids.</p>
                        <p>Protective eyewear should be worn by theatre staff during circumcision surgery. Caps are recommended, but are not essential.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Aprons and the surgeon's gown</h3>
                        <p>Aprons made of rubber or plastic provide a waterproof barrier to keep contaminated fluids off the health worker's clothing and skin. Staff should wear aprons when cleaning instruments and other items used for patient care.</p>
                        <p>If an apron is used, it is worn under the surgical gown. During circumcision surgery a surgeon's gown is recommended, though some surgeons prefer to use a clean or disposable apron.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Footwear</h3>
                        <p>Appropriate footwear is necessary to protect the feet from injury from sharp or heavy items. Rubber boots or leather shoes provide the best protection, but must be regularly cleaned. Avoid wearing sandals, thongs, or shoes made of soft material.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Immunizations</h3>
                        <p>Certain vaccines, such as hepatitis B, can be useful for protecting health care workers and laboratory staff against diseases they may be exposed to during their work.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>All clinic staff should be trained in the safe handling of sharp instruments. Single-use autodisable syringes with integrated needles are safer because they cannot be used again, but are expensive. Hypodermic (hollow-bore) needles are the most common cause of injuries to all types of clinic workers:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Health care workers are most often stuck by hypodermic needles during patient care.</li>
                            <li>Cleaning staff are most often stuck by needles when washing soiled instruments.</li>
                            <li>Housekeeping staff are most often stuck by needles when disposing of waste material.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Tips for safe use of hypodermic needles and syringes</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Disposable needles and syringes must be used only once.</li>
                            <li>Do not disassemble the needle and syringe after use.</li>
                            <li>Do not bend or break needles before disposal.</li>
                            <li>Dispose of the needle and syringe together in a puncture-resistant container.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>In general, it is safer to dispose of a needle and syringe directly into a sharps container without recapping. If a needle must be recapped, use the "one-handed" recapping method:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Place the needle cap on a firm, flat surface.</li>
                            <li>Holding the syringe with one hand, use the needle to "scoop up" the cap (see Fig. 8.3).</li>
                            <li>With the cap over the needle tip, turn the syringe upright (vertical), so that the needle is pointing towards the ceiling.</li>
                            <li>With the forefinger and thumb of your other hand, grasp the cap just above its open end and push it firmly down onto the hub (the place where the needle joins the syringe).</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>Clearly labelled, puncture- and tamper-proof sharps safety boxes or containers are a key component in efforts to keep injuries from disposable sharps to a minimum.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Place sharps containers as close to the point of use as possible and practical (ideally within arm's reach), but away from busy areas. Avoid placing containers near light switches, overhead fans, or thermostat controls, where people might accidentally put their hand into them.</li>
                            <li>Attach containers to walls or other surfaces, if possible, at a convenient height, so that staff can use and replace them easily.</li>
                            <li>Mark the container clearly, so that people will not mistakenly use it as a rubbish bin.</li>
                            <li>Mark the fill line (at the three-quarters full level). Do not shake the container to settle its contents, to make room for more sharps.</li>
                            <li>Never attempt to empty the sharps container.</li>
                        </ul>

                         <span class="heading-text">PROCESSING OF INSTRUMENTS, ENVIRONMENTAL CLEANING AND MANAGEMENT OF SPILLS</span>
                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Soiled instruments and other reusable items can transmit infection if they are not properly reprocessed. Effective and safe reprocessing includes disinfecting instruments and equipment immediately after use, cleaning to remove all organic matter and chemicals, and highlevel disinfection or sterilization for instruments that will be used in normally sterile critical sites, i.e. within the body, in sterile tissue, cavities or the bloodstream. Before sterilization, all equipment must be disinfected and then cleaned to remove debris. Sterilization is intended to kill living organisms, but is not a method of cleaning.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Disinfection</h3>
                        <p>Disinfectant solutions are used to inactivate any infectious agents that may be present in blood or other body fluids. They must always be available for cleaning working surfaces, equipment that cannot be autoclaved and non-disposable items, and for dealing with any spillages involving pathological specimens or other known or potentially infectious material.</p>
                        <p>Used instruments should routinely be soaked in a chemical disinfectant for 30 minutes before cleaning. Disinfection decreases the viral and bacterial burden of an instrument, but does not clean debris from the instrument or sterilize it. The purpose of disinfection is to reduce the risk to those who have to handle the instruments during further cleaning. Disinfection is not a sterilizing process and must not be used as a substitute for sterilization.</p>
                        <p>There are many disinfectant solutions, with varying degrees of effectiveness. In most countries, the most widely available disinfectant is sodium hypochlorite solution (commonly known as bleach or chloros), which is a particularly effective antiviral solution.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Cleaning</h3>
                        <p>All used instruments and equipment must be cleaned with detergent and water after disinfection and before being high-level disinfected or sterilized. Otherwise, organic matter may prevent adequate contact with the disinfectant or sterilizing agent. The organic matter may also bind and inactivate chemical disinfectants.</p>
                        <h4>Instructions for manual cleaning</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Wear thick household or utility gloves.</li>
                            <li>Wear protective eyewear, mask and plastic apron, if available, to prevent contaminated fluids from splashing into your eyes or onto your body.</li>
                            <li>Thoroughly wash items to be cleaned with soap and clean water:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Use liquid soap, if available. Do not use abrasive cleaners or steel wool, especially on metal (they cause scratches and increase the risk of rusting).</li>
                                    <li>Using a soft brush, scrub instruments under the surface of the water to prevent splashing, paying particular attention to any teeth, joints, or screws.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>Rinse the instruments with clean water.</li>
                            <li>Dry the instruments with a towel or allow them to air-dry.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">High-level disinfection</h3>
                        <p>High-level disinfection destroys all microorganisms except some bacterial endospores. It is usually used for heat-sensitive instruments and equipment that are used in critical sites, but that cannot be sterilized. High-level disinfection is the only acceptable alternative to sterilization for heat-sensitive surgical instruments.</p>
                        <p>There is no single ideal disinfectant. Different grades of disinfectants are used for different purposes. However, glutaral (glutaraldehyde) is generally the most appropriate chemical for high-level disinfection. It must be used under very strictly controlled conditions, in a safe working environment, and the manufacturer's handling instructions must be strictly followed.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Sterilization</h3>
                        <p>Sterilization is the destruction of all microorganisms, including bacterial endospores. Sterilization can be achieved by either physical or chemical methods. Sterilization is necessary for medical devices that will be used in sterile body sites.</p>
                        <p>Sterilization can be done using:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>high-pressure steam (autoclave) or dry heat (oven);</li>
                            <li>chemicals, such as ethylene oxide or formaldehyde;</li>
                            <li>radiation.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Sterilization of all surgical instruments and supplies is crucial in preventing HIV transmission. All viruses, including HIV, are inactivated by high-pressure steam sterilization (autoclaving) for 20 minutes at 121-132°C, or for 30 minutes if the instruments are in wrapped packs.</p>
                        <p>Items that have been sterilized need to be properly stored, to ensure that they do not become recontaminated.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The storage area should be clean, dry, and free of dust and lint.</li>
                            <li>The temperature should be kept at approximately 24°C, and the relative humidity at less than 70%, if possible.</li>
                            <li>Sterile packs and containers should be stored 20-25 cm off the floor, 45-50 cm from the ceiling and 15-20 cm from an outside wall.</li>
                            <li>Do not use wooden or cardboard boxes for storage of sterile items, as they shed dust and debris and may harbour insects.</li>
                            <li>Mark the date of sterilization on the package, and use the oldest packages first - "first in, first out". Dates serve as an indicator of when packs should be used, but do not guarantee the sterility of the packs.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Environmental cleaning</h3>
                        <p>Routine cleaning is important to ensure a clean and dust-free clinic environment. Visible dirt usually contains many microorganisms, and routine cleaning helps to eliminate such dirt. Administrative and office areas with no patient contact should be cleaned regularly in the same way as other offices. Most patient care areas should be cleaned by wet mopping; dry sweeping is not recommended. Hot water (80°C) is a useful and effective environmental cleaner. The use of a detergent solution improves the quality of cleaning.</p>
                        <p>All horizontal surfaces and all toilet areas should be cleaned daily. The operating table and instrument trolley should be cleaned with detergent and water between cases.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Management of spills</h3>
                        <p>Any area that is visibly contaminated with blood or body fluids should be cleaned immediately with detergent and water. After cleaning, disinfect the area with 0.5% sodium hypochlorite solution.</p>

                            <li>Place all waste in plastic or galvanized metal containers, with tightly fitting colour-coded covers that differentiate infectious from non-infectious waste.</li>
                            <li>Place all disposable sharps in designated puncture-resistant containers.</li>
                            <li>Place waste containers close to where the waste is generated, in a position that is convenient for users.</li>
                            <li>Ensure that equipment used to hold and transport wastes is not used for any other purpose.</li>
                            <li>Regularly wash all waste containers with a disinfectant solution (0.5% sodium hypochlorite solution), then wash with soap, rinse with water and allow to air-dry.</li>

                        <p>When patients are being cared for at home, contaminated waste, such as dressings and other items that may have been in contact with blood or other body fluids, can be buried in a covered pit or burned in a drum incinerator in the yard.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Disposing of sharp items</h3>
                        <p>Disposable sharp items, such as hypodermic needles, require special handling. They are the items most likely to injure the health care workers who handle them. If these items are disposed of in a municipal landfill, they become a danger to people in the community.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Step 1.</strong> Do not recap a used hypodermic needle or disassemble the needle and syringe.</li>
                            <li><strong>Step 2.</strong> Place the needle and syringe in a puncture-resistant sharps container. The opening should be large enough to allow items to be dropped through it easily, but small enough to prevent anything being removed from inside.</li>
                            <li><strong>Step 3.</strong> When the container is three-quarters full, dispose of it.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>When disposing of the sharps container:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Step 1.</strong> Wear heavy-duty utility gloves.</li>
                            <li><strong>Step 2.</strong> Cap, plug, or tape the opening of the container tightly closed. Make sure that no sharp items are sticking out of the container.</li>
                            <li><strong>Step 3.</strong> Dispose of the sharps container by burning, encapsulating, or burying it.</li>

                        <p>Burning destroys the waste and kills any microorganisms, and is the best method of disposing of contaminated waste. It reduces the bulk volume of waste and also ensures that items cannot be scavenged and reused.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Encapsulating waste containers</h3>
                        <p>Encapsulation is the easiest way to safely dispose of sharps containers. When the container is three-quarters full, pour cement (mortar), plastic foam, clay or other similar material into the container until it is completely full. After the material has hardened, seal the container and dispose of it in a landfill or bury it.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Burying waste</h3>
                        <p>In health care facilities with limited resources, burial of waste (such as excised foreskins) near the facility may be the only practical option for waste disposal. To limit health risks and environmental pollution, some basic rules should be followed:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Restrict access to the disposal site. Build a fence around the site to keep animals and children away.</li>
                            <li>Line the burial site with a material of low permeability (e.g., clay), if available.</li>
                            <li>Select a site at least 50 meters away from any water source to prevent contamination of the water table.</li>
                            <li>Ensure that the site has proper drainage, is located downhill from any wells, is free of standing water, and is not in an area that floods.</li>

                        <p>Health care workers may be accidentally exposed to blood and other body fluids that are potentially infected with HIV, hepatitis virus or other bloodborne pathogens. Occupational exposure may occur through direct contact of non-intact skin with potentially infected blood or body fluids, from splashes into the eyes or mouth, or through injury with a used needle or sharp instrument. Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) can help prevent the transmission of pathogens after such a potential exposure.</p>

                                    <li>If a splash or a spill occurs on the skin, wash the area immediately with soap and water. Do not use caustic agents, alcohol or bleach, because they will irritate the skin and may increase the risk of infection. Do not apply a dressing.</li>
                                    <li>If a splash or a spill occurs in the eyes, the nose, the mouth, or on any mucous membrane, rinse the area with clean water for at least 10 minutes.</li>
                                    <li>If an injury has been caused by a potentially contaminated sharp, wash the area with soapy water, and allow the wound to bleed freely for a few minutes if possible. Then give normal first aid.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Step 2.</strong> Evaluate the risk by determining the type of fluid (blood, visibly bloody fluid, or other potentially infectious fluid), the severity and type of exposure (percutaneous or needle stick, mucous membranes, intact or non-intact skin), and the source of infection.</li>
                            <li><strong>Step 3:</strong> If the source person is identified, it is important to try to obtain information on his or her hepatitis and HIV serostatus and, if positive, an evaluation of the clinical status and treatment history.
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Assess the risk of infection, using available information.</li>

                        <p>The medical response to exposure to hepatitis B virus (HBV) depends on the patient's immune status, as determined by the history of hepatitis B vaccination and vaccine response, and whether the exposure poses a risk of infection. Transmission of HBV may occur following percutaneous injury, or contamination of mucous membranes or non-intact skin. The virus does not cross intact skin. HBV post-exposure prophylaxis is safe for pregnant and breastfeeding women.</p>

                        <p>Post-exposure prophylaxis for HIV is a set of comprehensive actions aimed at preventing infection in the exposed person. It includes first aid care, counselling and risk assessment, HIV testing following informed consent, and - depending on the risk assessment - the provision of a short course (28 days) of antiretroviral drugs, with follow-up and support.</p>
                        <h4>Step 1. First aid</h4>
                        <p>Provide immediate first aid care for the exposure site, as described above.</p>
                        <h4>Step 2. Report and evaluation</h4>
                        <p>After the incident, the exposed person should be referred to a trained service provider, who can give counselling, evaluate the risk of HIV transmission having occurred, and decide on the need to prescribe antiretroviral (ARV) medications to prevent HIV infection. The incident should be reported for further evaluation, according to national requirements regarding recording and notification of occupational injuries and diseases.</p>
                        <p>The recommendation for HIV post-exposure prophylaxis is based on an evaluation of the risk of infection according to the type of exposure and the HIV status of the source (see Table 8.3).</p>

                            <li>Do not delay starting ARVs for PEP while waiting for HIV test results. The exposed person could start taking ARVs for PEP immediately, and stop the treatment if the test results reveal that he or she is already HIVpositive.</li>
                            <li>Antiretroviral drugs for PEP should be started as soon as possible and in any case within 72 hours after exposure.</li>
                            <li>The drugs should be taken continuously for 28 days.</li>
                            <li>Each circumcision clinic should either have the necessary drugs in stock or know where they can be obtained, so that treatment can be started within 72 hours.</li>
                            <li>Whenever possible, the source patient should also be tested, with his or her informed consent. If the test results show that the source person is negative, PEP can be stopped.</li>
                            <li>Counselling should include provision of information on the importance of adhering to treatment, and information on HIV prevention in general and in the workplace. The person should be advised to use condoms, and not to donate blood or organs for up to 6 months after exposure.</li>
                            <li>Women of childbearing age should be advised to use contraception, and alternatives to breastfeeding should be discussed with women currently feeding their infants. There is a high risk of transmitting HIV to the infant if the mother becomes infected during breastfeeding.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Step 4. Antiretroviral medications for post-exposure prophylaxis</h4>
                        <p>If national guidelines on post-exposure prophylaxis exist, these should be followed. If not, WHO recommendations may be applied. WHO recommends a two-drug PEP regimen, unless there is suspicion or evidence of drug resistance. The standard PEP regimen consists of two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs). The possible regimens are given in Table 8.4.</p>

                            <li>Women of childbearing age not using reliable contraception should not be prescribed medications such as the combination didanosine + stavudine. They should be offered a pregnancy test before starting the PEP regimen.</li>
                            <li>Lactating women should be aware that ARVs are excreted in breast milk, and that the virus itself can be transmitted during breastfeeding</li>
                            <li>When and where safe and feasible, alternative feeding options should be discussed with breastfeeding mothers.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Step 5. Follow-up and testing</h4>
                        <p>Follow-up visits should aim to support the person's adherence to PEP, prevent or treat side-effects of the medicines, and detect seroconversion, if it occurs. The following steps are recommended:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>There should be regular follow-up for the first six weeks after starting PEP to support good adherence.</li>
                            <li>Perform HIV-antibody testing at baseline, 6-12 weeks and six months after exposure.</li>
                            <li>Perform HIV-antibody testing if the person develops any illness compatible with an acute retroviral syndrome.</li>
                            <li>Advise exposed persons to take precautions to prevent secondary transmission during the follow-up period. This includes:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>avoiding pregnancy and seeking safe alternatives to breastfeeding;</li>
                                    <li>avoiding donating blood, tissue or sperm;</li>
                                    <li>using condoms during sexual intercourse, until the test at six months confirms that the exposed person remains seronegative.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>Evaluate exposed persons taking PEP within 72 hours after exposure and monitor for drug adherence and possible drug-related side-effects and toxicity for at least two weeks.</li>
                            <li>If the person develops HIV antibodies, he or she should be referred for treatment, care and support.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The incident report and the evaluation of the risk of exposure (see Step 2) should also lead to quality control and evaluation of working safety conditions. Appropriate correctional measures (such as strengthening adherence to standard precautions, if relevant) should be taken to prevent other exposures to HIV and other bloodborne pathogens</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Clinic staff should know their HIV status</h3>
                        <p>It is advisable for all clinic staff who carry out surgical procedures to have an HIV test at periodic intervals, in accordance with national HIV testing guidelines. If a health care worker is known to have recently had a negative HIV test, then post-exposure prophylaxis can be started immediately, if relevant, following exposure to potentially infected blood. In addition, health care workers would be showing leadership in the context of national campaigns to increase awareness of HIV status.</p>
