                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Group education is used to support individual counselling services. It allows clients to be given basic information about male circumcision before an individual counselling session. Counsellors can then work with clients, and/or their parents, on specific issues related to male circumcision, or sexual and reproductive health in general. Group education allows the first counselling session to be shorter, which is an advantage in busy clinics.</p>
                        <p>The information given to clients during an education session may differ slightly from site to site. Counsellors should be familiar with the standard education on male circumcision offered at the place where they work, so that messages and information given are consistent.</p>
                        <p>In conducting group education on male circumcision, the counsellor should include the following main messages:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Underline that, like women and girls, men and boys have sexual health and reproductive health needs.</li>
                            <li>Explain what male circumcision is, outline the benefits and risks, and describe how the surgical procedure is performed and what happens afterwards.</li>
                            <li>Emphasize that male circumcision does not provide complete protection against HIV infection. Explain that circumcised men can become infected and can pass on HIV infection to their sexual partners.</li>
                            <li>Describe the measures that the service takes to ensure that patient records are kept confidential and provide assurance that confidentiality will be maintained.</li>
                            <li>Discuss the importance of knowing one's HIV status. Explain how HIV is transmitted, how a person can protect himself or herself from HIV infection, and where people with HIV infection can find support.</li>
                            <li>Explain that men with an STI have a greater risk of becoming infected with, and transmitting, HIV.</li>
                            <li>Emphasize the importance of avoiding HIV infection and outline different ways of reducing the risk of acquiring the infection.</li>
                            <li>Explain that patients with an STI have a greater risk of becoming infertile in the future.</li>
                            <li>Emphasize that only condoms, consistently and properly used, protect against STIs, HIV, and unwanted pregnancy. Other methods of contraception, even those that are highly effective in preventing pregnancy, do not protect against STIs, HIV or possible future infertility.</li>
                            <li>Emphasize that vasectomy is the most effective and permanent method of contraception available for men, but that it does not protect against STIs or HIV.</li>
                            <li>Emphasize that men should treat women as equal partners in decision-making related to sexual and reproductive health.</li>
                            <li>Emphasize that men should support the sexual and reproductive health of women and the well-being of their children, with equal regard for female and male children.</li>
                            <li>Underscore the importance of not perpetrating gender-based violence, especially against women and girls.</li>
                            <li>Emphasize that responsible men do not force or coerce their partners to have sex against their will (rape).</li>

                            <li>Hello, my name is ____, and I am a ____ here at this clinic.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>For some time we have been aware that the reproductive health needs of men and boys have not been receiving enough attention.</p>
                        <p>At this clinic we provide the following services for men:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>information and education on male circumcision (including the management of postoperative complications);</li>
                            <li>male circumcision for men who choose to have the procedure;</li>
                            <li>information and counselling on sexual intercourse, safer sex, and health problems related to the reproductive system;</li>
                            <li>diagnosis and management of sexually transmitted infections;</li>
                            <li>counselling and testing for HIV and AIDS and referral for care and support;</li>
                            <li>contraception, through vasectomy or the use of condoms; condoms will prevent both pregnancy and STIs.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Physical and sexual maturity comes with many social responsibilities. These include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Recognizing that safer sex can prevent STIs and HIV infection. Safer sex includes using condoms the right way every time you have sex, reducing the number of sexual partners, delaying the start of sexual relations, and avoiding penetrative sex.</li>
                            <li>Never putting yourself in a situation in which you lose control of your judgement, for example because you are under the influence of alcohol or drugs. This may lead to behaviour that will increase your risk of becoming infected with STIs and HIV, such as having unprotected sex with strangers or with multiple sexual partners.</li>
                            <li>Treating women as equal partners in sexual relations and deciding together whether and when to have children.</li>
                            <li>Respecting the sexual and reproductive health rights of girls and women, including the right to refuse sex, both within and outside marriage.</li>
                            <li>Supporting women's sexual and reproductive health. Such support is particularly important during pregnancy.</li>
                            <li>Supporting children's well-being, with equal regard for female and male children.</li>
                            <li>Stopping all kinds of violence against women and girls, and not forcing or coercing girls or women to have sex against their will.</li>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Male circumcision</h4>
                        <p>For those of you who are here to find out more about male circumcision, let's talk a bit about that.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>What is male circumcision?</strong> Male circumcision is the surgical removal of the foreskin of the penis (also called the prepuce). It is one of the oldest surgical procedures in history.</li>
                            <li>Male circumcision has been shown to have several health benefits including:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>a reduced risk of urinary tract infections in childhood;</li>
                                    <li>a reduced risk of some sexually transmitted infections, such as herpes and syphilis;</li>
                                    <li>some protection against cancer of the penis;</li>
                                    <li>a reduced risk of cervical cancer in female sex partners;</li>
                                    <li>prevention of several medical problems of the penis and foreskin, such as inflammation, scarring and swelling of the foreskin.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>Some of you may have heard that male circumcision reduces the risk of HIV infection. This is correct. However, I must remind you that male circumcision does not protect completely against HIV infection - it only reduces the risk of becoming infected by about one half. It is very important to continue using other ways of reducing the risk of infection - using condoms the right way every time you have sex, reducing the number of sexual partners, delaying the start of sexual relations, avoiding penetrative sexual intercourse, and avoiding unsafe injections.</li>
                            <li>As with any surgical procedure, complications may occur after the operation. However, in our clinic we do everything we can to reduce this risk. Possible problems include pain, bleeding, swelling of the penis caused by bleeding under the skin, infection of the surgical wound, and increased sensitivity of the exposed head of the penis (glans). On average, if we operate on 50 men or boys, one will need to come back to the clinic for the treatment of a complication. However, the problems usually settle down quickly with additional treatment.</li>
                            <li>Many men ask how soon after circumcision sex can be resumed. It takes about 4 to 6 weeks for the wound to become strong enough to withstand sex and about 3-4 months for the wound to heal completely. We always advise clients to avoid sex or masturbation for the first 4-6 weeks after circumcision, and to use a condom during sex until the wound has completely healed (at least 6 months). It is always best to use a condom whenever there is any risk of STI or HIV infection.</li>
                            <li>At this clinic, we perform circumcision using local anaesthesia to take away the pain of the procedure. Patients can go home the same day but it is important that they come back for follow-up.</li>
                            <li>Do any of you have any questions or concerns about male circumcision? I know that there are many myths about male circumcision that circulate. For example, some people think that circumcision can cause impotence (failure of erection) or reduce sexual pleasure. Others think that circumcision will cure impotence. Let me assure you that none of these is true.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>If time permits, other sexual and reproductive health topics can be covered (see Appendix 3.1).</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Summary</h4>
                        <p>We have talked about the different services that we offer in this clinic. It is up to you to let us know what services are of interest to you. If you are worried that you may be infected with an STI or HIV, or if you want to be tested, counselling and testing services are available here. If you want to register yourself or your son for circumcision, please let us know. We will be very pleased to assist you in any way you wish.</p>
                        <p>Please take some of the information leaflets we have here. They may answer other questions that you may have. Thank you for your attention.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Basic facts about counselling<sup>b</sup></h3>
                        <p>Counselling is a process in which individual communication is used to help people examine personal issues, make decisions, and make plans for taking action. In some types of counselling, the counsellor and client talk about whatever the client wishes. In counselling for male circumcision, the provider ensures that the client (or, if the client is a child, his parents) has all the information he needs to make a decision about undergoing the procedure.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Counselling is not:</strong>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>telling clients what to do;</li>
                                    <li>criticizing clients;</li>
                                    <li>forcing ideas or values on clients;</li>
                                    <li>taking responsibility for clients' actions or decisions.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>HIV counselling concentrates on helping clients reduce their risk of becoming infected with HIV - or for those already infected - transmitting the virus to others. In family planning counselling, the provider helps the clients make an informed decision based on their reproductive intentions and personal situation.</p>
                        <p>Counselling may involve some or all of the following:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Listening to clients (or parents, for circumcision in boys who are too young to understand fully the reasons for circumcision and the risks associated with it, or who are below the legal age to consent to the operation).</li>
                            <li>Respecting clients' needs, values, culture, religion, and lifestyle.</li>
                            <li>Talking with clients about the risks and benefits of the service requested, in this case male circumcision.</li>
                            <li>Answering questions about the male circumcision procedure and correcting any false information.</li>
                            <li>Allowing clients and/or their parents to make their own informed decision on whether or not to choose male circumcision.</li>
                            <li>Asking clients questions that help them identify behaviour that puts them at risk of STIs or HIV infection, or might do so after circumcision.</li>
                            <li>Helping clients understand the benefits of knowing their HIV status.</li>
                            <li>Helping clients understand their HIV or STI test results.</li>
                            <li>Helping HIV-negative clients understand that male circumcision does not provide full protection against HIV infection, and suggesting how they can stay negative.</li>
                            <li>Helping HIV-positive clients find support and treatment services, and discussing ways to avoid transmitting HIV to others.</li>
                            <li>Helping clients obtain other services, such as family planning, screening and treatment for STIs, and counselling and treatment for alcohol and drug abuse.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><small><sup>b</sup> Adapted from JHPIEGO's Counseling and testing reference manual for lay counselors, 2002. [Full reference required]</small></p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Confidentiality</h3>
                        <p>Confidentiality is an important characteristic of all sexual and reproductive health services. Counsellors should keep all client information private and allow clients to decide when and with whom to discuss their sexual and reproductive health problems. Clients will feel more comfortable about sharing personal information with counsellors and being tested for STIs or HIV if they know that this information will remain secret. This also applies when the client's main interest is male circumcision. An atmosphere of trust will encourage clients to discuss other sexual and reproductive health needs.</p>
                        <p>Another reason why confidentiality is so important is that many people have negative feelings about STIs, HIVIAIDS and sexual health concerns. There is strong social pressure to conform, and considerable social stigma is associated with behaviours or conditions perceived as unusual.</p>
                        <p>Sometimes, health care workers at a clinic need to know a client's HIV status. This happens, for example, when a client is sick and the best treatment depends on knowing whether the person is HIV-positive or HIV-negative. The counsellor should tell the client about this possibility during counselling. An HIV test is recommended for all clients requesting circumcision, but is not required for the operation to go ahead. Male circumcision can be safely performed in men whose HIV status is unknown and in those with HIV infection, provided that they are clinically healthy. However, except in some rare cases where circumcision is necessary to correct a health problem of the glans or foreskin in a man with HIV infection, there are no medical or public health reasons to perform circumcision in men with HIV infection. HIV testing of clients before circumcision is not necessary to protect the clinic or surgical staff during the operation. It is important that the clinic applies high infection-control standards, including proper implementation of universal precautions to minimize the risk of transmission of HIV and other infections to health care workers or other patients. Universal precautions are discussed in full in Chapter 8.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Counselling skills</h3>
                        <p>All counsellors need certain basic counselling skills in order to talk with clients in a helpful way. Some of these skills are explained below.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Empathizing</h4>
                        <p>Empathy is the ability to see the world through another person's eyes and understand how that person feels. Counsellors should listen to clients carefully and show them that they understand without judging. Empathy is not sympathy; it is not feeling sorry for the client. Empathy is understanding the client's feelings.</p>
                        <blockquote><strong>Example:</strong><br>An adolescent says to the counsellor: "My girlfriend keeps asking me to go for circumcision. I feel embarrassed and angry."<br>Counsellor's empathic response: "So you often feel irritated, uncomfortable, and pressured by your girlfriend. That must be difficult for you."</blockquote>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Active listening</h4>
                        <p>Active listening involves paying attention to what a client says and does, in a way that shows respect, interest and empathy. Active listening is more than just hearing what clients say. It is paying attention to the content of the message, as well as the client's feelings and worries that show through his movements, tone of voice, facial expressions, and posture.</p>
                        <blockquote><strong>Example:</strong><br>The client looks very nervous and is biting his nails, but tells the counsellor he is fine.<br>Counsellor: "Sometimes when we think we are relaxed, we can still feel quite anxious inside. I see you are biting your nails. Perhaps something is bothering you that you do not know how to express. Do you have any idea what that might be?"</blockquote>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Open questioning</h4>
                        <p>Open questions are questions that require more than a one-word answer. They usually begin with words such as "how", "what" or "why". Open questions encourage clients to express their feelings and share information about their situation.</p>
                        <blockquote><strong>Examples:</strong><br>"Why have you decided to come for male circumcision?"<br>"How do you think circumcision can reduce your risk of STI or HIV infection?"<br>"What do you do that may make it possible for you to get infected with an STI or HIV?"<br>"What are you currently doing to protect yourself against STIs and HIV? How is this working?"</blockquote>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Probing</h4>
                        <p>Probing is using questions to help clients express themselves more clearly. Probing is necessary when the counsellor needs more information about the client's feelings or situation. Asking a probing question is a good way to follow up on a question that has been answered by "yes" or "no."</p>
                        <blockquote><strong>Examples:</strong><br>"Can you tell me more about that?"<br>"How do you feel about that?"</blockquote>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Focusing</h4>
                        <p>Clients are often overwhelmed by emotional or personal problems related to their particular sexual and reproductive health problems. They may want to address all the issues at once. If clients start to talk about problems or situations that will be discussed later in the session, the counsellor may want to bring the topic of discussion back to the current issue.</p>
                        <blockquote><strong>Example:</strong><br>At the beginning of the first counselling session, the client begins talking about the most recent situation when he may have been exposed to HIV. He asks about where and how he can get condoms.<br>The counsellor does not want to interrupt the flow of the discussion, so says: "Using condoms is an excellent way to reduce your risk of getting an STI or HIV infection. We can talk about that in a few minutes. Right now, let's continue talking about your HIV situation."</blockquote>
                        <p>If the client wants to talk about other emotional or personal issues, such as problems at home or a partner's drug use problem, the counsellor should help the client find appropriate support.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Affirming</h4>
                        <p>Affirming is congratulating or complimenting clients on the positive actions that they have taken. It is important to encourage success. Complimenting clients helps them feel respected and valued and encourages them to try to make other changes to reduce their risk of HIV infection. It may also make them more willing to share information about other actions they have taken.</p>
                        <blockquote><strong>Example:</strong><br>Client: "I've recently started using condoms each time I have sex".<br>Counsellor: "That's a really positive step in protecting yourself against HIV and sexually transmitted infections. Well done!"</blockquote>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Clarifying</h4>
                        <p>Counsellors clarify in order to make sure that they understand a client's statements or questions. Clarifying also helps the client understand his own situation or feelings better and identify uncertainty or conflict between his thoughts and behaviour.</p>
                        <blockquote><strong>Example:</strong><br>Client: "My partner gave me gonorrhoea. I'm afraid of getting HIV. But I'm also afraid that, if I use condoms when I have sex with her, she'll think I am not faithful."<br>Counsellor: "Help me understand this. You are afraid you might get HIV from your partner, but you do not want to use condoms with her."</blockquote>
                        <p>Pointing out a conflict may help the client identify which of two issues is more important to him. It is better than the counsellor telling the client to do something that he is not ready to accept. Clarifying also helps clients make their own choices and draw their own conclusions. Saying "help me understand this" is a good way to begin this type of discussion.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Correcting false information</h4>
                        <p>It is important to provide correct information to clients and to correct any myths and false information. There are many incorrect rumours about HIV, AIDS, sexually transmitted infections, male circumcision and vasectomy. These should be corrected. However, this needs to be done in a sensitive way, without making the client feel stupid or defensive. Counsellors should acknowledge false information and then correct it quickly. It is not necessary to give detailed explanations.</p>
                        <blockquote><strong>Example:</strong><br>Counsellor: "You mentioned that it is possible to cure HIV by having sex with a child or virgin. Many people believe this, but it is untrue. Firstly sex with a child is wrong and is a crime. Second, it has no benefit to you - at present, there is no cure for HIV or AIDS. Third, and most important, you are likely to transmit the virus to the child"</blockquote>
                        <blockquote><strong>Example:</strong><br>Counsellor: "You mentioned that you want to have a circumcision in order to prevent you from getting HIV from your multiple sexual partners. I think you need to know that male circumcision does not fully protect a man against HIV infection. Circumcised men who do not use protection or who engage in risky sexual behaviour are more likely to contract HIV infection than circumcised men who practise safer sex. Having sex with multiple sexual partners certainly is risky behaviour. You can reduce your risk of HIV infection by cutting down on the number of your sexual partners, avoiding full sexual intercourse (penetrative sex) and using condoms correctly every time you have sex."</blockquote>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Summarizing</h4>
                        <p>Counsellors summarize in order to present the main points of the conversation to the client. Summarizing can be useful when moving to another topic or ending the session, and to make sure that counsellor and client have understood each other correctly. Summarizing also helps clients see the whole picture and understand the situation better.</p>
                        <blockquote><strong>Example:</strong><br>Counsellor: "We have discussed several ways in which you can reduce your risk of getting infected with an STI or HIV. For example, you seem comfortable with starting to use condoms during sex and drinking less alcohol when you go out with friends. You have many choices and we will develop a specific plan later. First, let's talk about HIV testing because your plan could change depending on your test result."</blockquote>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">General</h3>
                        <p>Clients (or parents, in the case of a child) must give informed consent before a circumcision is performed. Health care providers should give clients all the information they need to make a fully informed decision. The following elements should be included.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Provide information. Clients (or parents) should be given an explanation, in plain language, of male circumcision and the nature of the surgery. They should be informed about the risks and benefits of the procedure and of other ways to reduce the risk of HIV infection. They should know that they can choose not to be circumcised.</li>
                            <li>Assess whether the client understands the information provided.</li>
                            <li>Assess the capacity of the client to make the necessary decisions.</li>
                            <li>Assure the client that he is free to choose whether or not to be circumcised. If there is any suggestion that the client is not ready to provide consent, advise him to reflect on it for a few days.</li>
                            <li>Ask clients who decide to undergo circumcision to sign a consent document.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The goal of this consent process is to ensure that the clients (or parents) understand the surgical procedure. At the same time, they should be given the opportunity to make use of other sexual and reproductive health services.</p>
                        <p>Only clients who have appropriate decision-making capacity and legal status can give their informed consent to medical care. Where a child (usually defined as a person under the age of majority in national law) lacks the legal status required to provide independent, informed consent, or lacks the capacity to appreciate the risks and benefits associated with the procedure, written consent based on full information must be obtained from the parent or legal guardian. The parent or legal guardian should make the decision according to the best interests of the child.</p>
                        <p>Children nevertheless have a right to participate in decisions affecting their health, according to their evolving capacities. Even where the law does not allow a child to give his own consent, providers of circumcision should explain the risks and benefits to the child in a way appropriate to his capacity. If the child has sufficient capacity, he should be given the opportunity to give or withhold assent to the procedure.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Adolescent boys: consent and confidentiality</h3>
                        <p>Male circumcision is often performed during adolescence or early adulthood. It is important that health care workers know how to respond to an adolescent boy's request for circumcision in a way that respects confidentiality, but does not put the health care worker in conflict with the law.</p>
                        <p>Health care workers need to know what the law says about consent for minors. They need to know at what age and in what circumstances minors can legally make an independent decision to seek clinical or medical services without the agreement of their parents or guardian. The age at which an adolescent is allowed to give his own consent may differ for different procedures. For example, in some countries, an adolescent may be able to consent to be tested for HIV or receive condoms at a younger age than that at which he can consent to circumcision. The Ministry of Health and the National Medical or Nursing Associations should be able to provide information on national rules and regulations.</p>
                        <p>Adolescent boys who are mature enough to appreciate the risks and benefits associated with a medical procedure, such as circumcision or HIV testing, should not be subjected to the procedure without their informed consent, whether or not parental consent is required by law. All health services provided to adolescents should be confidential. Where the law allows minors to provide independent informed consent, providers must ensure that information is not disclosed to the parents without the child's consent.</p>
                        <blockquote>"Children are more likely to use services that are friendly and supportive, provide a wide range of services and information, are geared to their needs, give them the opportunity to participate in decisions affecting their health, are accessible, affordable, confidential and non-judgemental, do not require parental consent and are not discriminatory."<br><small>Committee on the Rights of the Child. General Comment No. 3: HIVIAIDS and the rights of the child. Thirty-second session, January 2003 (UN Document CRC/GC/2003/3) para. 20.</small></blockquote>
                        <p>Health care workers should be guided in their response to adolescents by human rights principles: all adolescents have a right to use health services. Health care workers should act in the best interest of the adolescent with an understanding of his evolving capacities and ability to make independent decisions. In some situations, health care workers may need to judge whether an adolescent has the maturity to request, and consent to, circumcision, independent of his parent or guardian.</p>
                        <p>Circumcision is an opportunity to make contact with adolescent boys, and provide them with information and counselling about their own sexual and reproductive health and that of their current or future partners. Adequate time should be allowed for counselling before and after the operation. Adolescents should be advised that it is important to return after the procedure for a check-up and further counselling and information on condom use and other aspects of sexual and reproductive health.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Documenting informed consent for surgery</h3>
                        <p>The circumcision team should ensure that the client has been informed about the risks and benefits of male circumcision, that the information has been given in an understandable way, using everyday local language. The oral information should be backed up by written information sheets in the local language (see the sample information sheet for adult and adolescent clients in Appendix 3.2). After receiving the information the client should be allowed to ask questions. He should then be given time to reflect before being asked to sign the consent document (see the sample certificate of consent for adults and adolescents in Appendix 3.3).</p>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>In some communities, groups of boys are circumcised at the same time, by a traditional circumciser who uses a traditional technique without anaesthesia. This group activity coincides with the "rites of passage" from adolescence to adulthood, and often takes place in circumcision "camps" or ceremonies. The event is usually both festive and educational for the participants and the community. The goals are to acknowledge the boy's physical and emotional maturity and readiness to face the challenges of adulthood, as well as to support him during the painful circumcision procedure. In the camps, young boys attend various civic education classes, facilitated by the traditional circumciser, community leaders or event organizer. Essentially, they are taught how to behave as men.</p>
                        <p>Some parents prefer to have their sons circumcised individually. They may take the boy to a hospital or clinic, and have a health care provider perform a medical circumcision under local anaesthesia. If they choose to have the boy circumcised at home, they may engage either a nurse or a traditional circumciser. They may also specify which technique they prefer.</p>
                        <p>The increasing interest in medical circumcision in communities with a culture of traditional circumcision provides an opportunity to integrate the traditional event with safer clinical procedures including appropriate follow-up. There are many reports of high complication rates following traditional circumcision ceremonies and circumcisions performed by traditional providers. Safety can be improved by introducing medical circumcision into traditional ceremonies, or by performing the circumcision under local anaesthesia in a clinic separate from, but linked to, the traditional ceremony.</p>
                        <p>Educational topics during a circumcision event may include the following:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>the physical and psychological changes that occur in boys and girls during adolescence;</li>
                            <li>sexuality and gender issues;</li>
                            <li>male and female sexual and reproductive health and rights;</li>
                            <li>sexually transmitted infections;</li>
                            <li>HIV infection;</li>
                            <li>safer sex practices (correct and consistent use of condoms, reducing the number of sexual partners, delaying the start of sexual relations, and avoiding penetrative sex);</li>
                            <li>family planning;</li>
                            <li>substance use (drugs, alcohol, tobacco);</li>
                            <li>violence, including gender-based violence;</li>
                            <li>community expectations of men;</li>
                            <li>goal-setting and decision-making.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Health institutions that want to organize group circumcision events should do so in partnership with traditional circumcisers and the community. A joint educational programme can be drawn up, under shared responsibility. The decision to circumcise boys in camps will depend on resources, customs and traditions in the community. A mobile outreach service during the holidays is a convenient way to reach many boys and their parents. Whichever approach is adopted, the quality of the clinical circumcision should be ensured, in order to build and maintain confidence in the community regarding the safety and advisability of medical circumcision.</p>

                            <li>You have all probably heard of HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. We do not talk about it much in the community, but we are going to talk about it here because it is important to your health.</li>
                            <li>HIV is increasing all over the world. How many of us know family members or friends who have HIV or who have died from illnesses related to HIV and AIDS?</li>
                            <li>During this session, I will give you some basic information about HIV and AIDS and how being tested for HIV can be beneficial to you, your partner, family and community. You will also learn about the relationship between male circumcision and HIV infection.</li>
                            <li>I will also tell you about services that are available locally, especially about the counselling and testing services that are offered here or at ____ facility. We will also talk about family planning.</li>
                            <li>HIV testing is recommended for individuals who are at risk of HIV infection, for example by having unprotected sexual intercourse with an HIV-infected person or with someone whose HIV status is unknown. Using non-sterile needles to inject drugs is another risk for HIV.</li>
                            <li>For those who are tested and find out they have HIV, there are medicines that help them stay healthy longer and that may reduce the risk of infecting others with HIV.</li>
                            <li>People living with HIV have the same rights as everyone else. Discrimination against people living with HIV is against the law. There are organizations such as ____ that can provide legal and other types of support for people with HIV infection.</li>
                            <li>While medicines do not provide answers to all of our problems in dealing with HIV, they do allow people with HIV to live longer, healthier and productive lives. Before going into detail about the services we offer, here are a few facts about HIV and AIDS.</li>

                            <li>HIV stands for human immunodeficiency virus. It is the virus that causes AIDS. HIV is a slow-acting virus and it is possible for a person to be infected with HIV for many years without knowing it or feeling ill. AIDS is a condition caused by HIV. AIDS stands for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. Immune deficiency means that the immune system, which protects your body from infection, does not function properly. AIDS develops because HIV weakens the body's defence system.</li>
                            <li>There is no cure for HIV infection, but medicines are available that can help prevent other infections in people who are living with HIV. Other medicines can slow down the virus and help HIV-infected people stay healthy longer.</li>
                            <li>The increasing availability of medicines and other resources to support people with HIV means that more and more people with HIV infection can live a full and productive life, including a healthy sexual life.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Country statistics on HIV</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Here is some information on HIV infections in our country and region. (Share with the group recent national statistics on the prevalence of HIV and the numbers of clients with HIV in antenatal and STI clinics.)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">How HIV is transmitted</h4>
                        <p>HIV is transmitted:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>through unprotected sexual intercourse, vaginal or anal, with a person who has HIV infection;</li>
                            <li>through infected transfused blood or blood products, or by using needles that an HIV-infected person has already used for injecting drugs, body piercing or tattooing; and</li>
                            <li>from an infected mother to her baby during pregnancy and childbirth and through breast milk.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>HIV is not transmitted through mosquito bites, everyday contacts, sharing workplace or home utensils, hugging or kissing.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Sexually transmitted infections</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Sexually transmitted infections are quite common in our community. The most common STIs are syphilis, gonorrhoea, chlamydia and herpes.</li>
                            <li>It is important that these infections are promptly diagnosed and treated, in order to avoid complications such as infertility.</li>
                            <li>Men should be responsive to requests from STI clinics to come for testing if their spouse or partner is diagnosed with an STI. Treatment of both partners is an important element of STI control in the family and the community at large.</li>
                            <li>Having a sexually transmitted infection (especially one that causes sores or ulcers on the genital area) increases the risk of getting HIV by up to five times. People living with HIV are more likely to infect others when they also have such an STI.</li>
                            <li>Individuals with a sexually transmitted infection should carefully consider the benefits of HIV testing.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Preventing HIV infection and reducing risk behaviour</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>A person may be exposed to HIV once or many times before he or she becomes infected. The more often exposure occurs, the more likely a person is to become infected. Most people do not know their HIV status or whether they have been infected, and may continue to behave in a way that puts them at risk of infection or risks giving HIV to others.</li>
                            <li>HIV infection can be avoided by avoiding penetrative sexual intercourse, by having only one partner, who is HIV-negative and faithful, by using condoms the right way every time you have sex, and by using only clean needles for injections.</li>
                            <li>Correct and consistent condom use prevents not only HIV, but also other sexually transmitted infections (thereby protecting future fertility) and unwanted pregnancy. When used correctly every time, condoms are an excellent method of family planning and help prevent the spread of HIV and other STIs.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Reducing the risk of getting infected with HIV</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Do you know of ways in which people can reduce their risk of getting infected with HIV? (Add to participants' suggestions: not having sex with high-risk partners, talking to a partner about testing, talking about HIV concerns with a partner or friend, decreasing alcohol or drug use, increasing condom use, avoiding places where you often have high risk behaviour, abstaining from sex, avoiding penetrative sex, correctly using condoms every time until you and your partner have been tested, etc.)</li>
                            <li>Try to think of some ways in which you personally could decrease your risk of getting infected with HIV.</li>
                            <li>When you think of some ways that you can reduce your risk of getting infected with HIV, share them with someone you trust, such as a close friend.</li>
                            <li>Now I will show you the proper use of a condom. (Include a condom demonstration here if appropriate. Use models and ask participants to do some demonstrations themselves.)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">HIV testing</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Our health facility offers HIV testing and counselling. Each person has the right to choose whether or not to be tested for HIV.</li>
                            <li>Before you make a decision about HIV testing, you will have the chance to talk with a counsellor about your specific situation with regard to STI and HIV infection, and about ways to reduce your risk of getting infected.</li>
                            <li>The test result shows your HIV status as of 3 months earlier. If you became infected in the 3 months before your test, it may not be detected. For this reason, some people will need to be retested.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>For example, if you had unprotected sex in May and were tested in June, you may want to be tested again in August.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>A positive HIV test means you have been infected with HIV. It does not mean you have AIDS, and it does not tell us when you were infected or when you will get sick.</li>
                            <li>A negative HIV test means you have not been infected with HIV or were infected too recently for the test to detect your infection. (Share information on how to remain HIV-negative).</li>
                            <li>If you are ill with signs and symptoms of HIV infection, medical staff will recommend an HIV test in order to determine the best way of treating and helping you.</li>
                            <li>[Only relevant if the country has adopted a national policy of provider-initiated testing and counselling at all contacts with health-care services]: It is the policy of our country to routinely offer an HIV test for all people who come to health care services, even if it is for reasons not linked to HIV infection. This policy has been adopted to encourage more and more people to know their HIV status. Those who are infected with HIV will then be able to take better care of themselves, their partners and their family members For those who are not infected, a negative test will be a strong motivation to remain free from HIV infection and can reinforce good practices that reduce the risk of infection.</li>
                            <li>Here is how the testing works at our facility. (Describe the testing process at your clinic. Emphasize the confidentiality of test results).</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Medicines</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>In this facility, medicines are available to slow down the progression of HIV infection to AIDS and therefore prolong life. The medicines are safe to take.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Discuss the medicines that are available in your country for people who test positive and how to get them.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Contraception for men</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Two methods of male contraception are available in this clinic: a temporary method (male condoms) and a permanent method (male sterilization or vasectomy).</li>
                            <li>The male condom is suitable for those wanting to space pregnancies, to protect themselves against STIs and HIV, and to preserve their future fertility. In fact, the condom is the only method that both prevents pregnancy and provides protection against HIV and other sexually transmitted infections.</li>
                            <li>Vasectomy is a surgical procedure, in which the tubes (vas deferens) that transport sperm cells from the testes to the penis are cut and tied off (show drawing of male reproductive system to illustrate vasectomy). Vasectomy is a permanent method of contraception, and should be used only by men who are very sure that they do not want to have more children. You will still need to use a condom to protect yourself against STIs, including HIV.</li>
                            <li>Vasectomy is done in this clinic as an outpatient procedure under local anaesthesia. That means that patients go home the same day.</li>
                            <li>Vasectomy does not change a man's ability to have erections and does not interfere with sexual intercourse.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>The head (glans) of the penis is covered by a fold of skin (foreskin). As the penis becomes erect, this skin withdraws freely so that the head of the penis is fully exposed.</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_08_28_398c86f803fa38555eb0g-053-1.jpg" alt="Diagram showing a normal uncircumcised and circumcised penis." class="content-image">

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">What is circumcision?</h4>
                        <p>Circumcision is surgical removal of the foreskin. It is an ancient practice that has its origin in religious and traditional rites. Many parents have their sons circumcised for religious reasons. More and more men are now choosing circumcision for health and hygiene reasons.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Who will do the operation?</h4>
                        <p>A specially-trained member of the circumcision team will do the operation.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Is circumcision a painful operation?</h4>
                        <p>Normally, circumcision is done with a local anaesthetic. This is given by injection through the skin near the base of the penis. Although you will be awake during the operation, you will not feel it being done. When the local anaesthetic wears off after the operation, it is usual to feel some discomfort; this can be reduced by taking pain-relieving tablets. For some clients, it is preferable to do the operation in a hospital or under general anaesthesia, rather than in a clinic.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Effects of circumcision</h4>
                        <p>After the operation, the head of the penis is exposed all the time. The skin on the shaft of the penis is left intact. In adults, it is left slightly loose to allow enough skin for erection. The penis looks different and this may take some getting used to. It takes some months for the stitch marks to fade completely.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Benefits of circumcision</h4>
                        <p>There is more and more evidence that men who are circumcised have a lower risk of catching HIV infection. In countries where most men are circumcised, the number of people with HIV is much lower than in countries where most men are not circumcised. However, male circumcision gives only partial protection against HIV infection; correct and consistent use of condoms is the best form of protection. Other ways of reducing the risk of acquiring HIV infection include not having sex and reducing the number of sexual partners. Sexual behaviour remains the most important factor in HIV transmission. Avoiding multiple partners and high-risk sexual behaviour, and always using condoms, reduce substantially the risk of acquiring or transmitting HIV.</p>
                        <p>Circumcision also reduces the risk of some other sexually transmitted infections, such as herpes and genital ulcers.</p>
                        <p>Sometimes circumcision is performed for medical reasons, such as when the foreskin is too tight to be pulled back from the glans. After circumcision, it is much easier to wash the head of the penis and keep it clean.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Problems and complications after the operation</h4>
                        <h5>Immediate problems</h5>
                        <p>Some swelling and discomfort can be expected after the operation, but this normally gets better after the first day or two. No special treatment is needed.</p>
                        <p>One of the possible complications of circumcision is bleeding or accumulation of blood under the skin. This is because the skin of the penis is less tight than other parts of the body and has a very good blood supply. If a large blood clot forms, it is sometimes necessary to perform another small operation to remove it. If this happens, it may be necessary to stay in hospital for a few days and rest for a week or two.</p>
                        <p>The wound can become infected, particularly in men with diabetes. The operation is performed in sterile conditions, but the penis is in an area that is not as clean as other parts of the body. The first signs of infection are increasing pain, redness and swelling at the site of the operation. If this happens, you should return to the clinic for follow-up, as antibiotic treatment may be needed. Antibiotics are not given routinely and antibiotic ointment should not be used unless given to you by a nurse or doctor. The actual risk of having a complication, such as bleeding or infection, is about one for every fifty men who have the operation.</p>
                        <p>If you are unable to pass urine or have any difficulty in doing so, you should return to the clinic for assessment.</p>
                        <p>Most men get erections during the night while sleeping. If this occurs after the circumcision operation, you may experience some minor discomfort because of pulling on the stitches. This is nothing to worry about.</p>
                        <h5>Other complications</h5>
                        <p>Occasionally the head of the penis may remain very sensitive after the operation. This increased sensitivity will become less over the first few weeks, as the skin of the glans becomes slightly thicker.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Instructions to follow before the operation</h4>
                        <p>Please bring a pair of well-fitting clean underpants to wear after the operation. They will hold the wound dressing in place for the first day or two. A day or two after the operation, once the dressing has been removed, it is better to wear loose underwear. On the morning of the operation, wash the genital area and the penis carefully with water and mild soap, giving special attention to the area under the foreskin. If you have long pubic hair, it is a good idea to clip this with scissors before the operation, so that it does not interfere with the dressing that will be put on after the circumcision. There is no need to shave your pubic hair in advance of the operation.</p>
                        <p>You will be more comfortable if you empty your bladder before the operation.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Instructions to follow after the operation</h4>
                        <p>In the first three days after the operation, it is helpful to avoid strenuous physical activity and rest at home. Lying on your back means that the penis is the highest point in your body and this takes the pressure off the area. However, you should also walk about regularly, for example to get meals or visit the toilet. You should not ride a bicycle for the first five days after the operation.</p>
                        <p>Keep the area of the operation dry for 24 hours. Keep the area clean. Do not use any antiseptic cream, ointment or any other substance. If clean water is available, wash carefully twice a day in a shower or sitz bath (a warm-water bath taken in the sitting position, in which the hips and buttocks are in the water). Do not remove the bandage until told to do so by the clinic staff.</p>
                        <p>The circumcision wound is closed with absorbable stitches. These dissolve by themselves and it is not necessary to return to the clinic to have them removed.</p>
                        <p>You should return to the clinic if any of the following occurs:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Continued bleeding from the wound.</li>
                            <li>Formation of a large blood clot under the skin near the site of the operation.</li>
                            <li>Pain (you will feel some pain when the local anaesthetic wears off, but this should diminish after the first few hours. However, if the pain comes back, return to the clinic).</li>
                            <li>Swelling (after the procedure some swelling is normal and return to normal over the first few days. If the swelling gets worse, return to the clinic).</li>
                            <li>Discharge of fluid or pus; this may indicate infection.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Avoid any sport or other strenuous activity for 4-6 weeks. The healing process will be well advanced after 7 days, but it takes 4-6 weeks for the wound to become strong. Full healing takes longer (3 to 4 months). It is best to avoid sexual intercourse or masturbation for the first four to six weeks after circumcision. It is very important to use a condom during sexual intercourse to protect the healing wound for at least six months after the operation. It is always wise to use a condom whenever there is any risk of STI or HIV infection.</p>

                        </ul>
                        <p>I have given the client an opportunity to ask me questions about all the above.</p>
                        <p>I have asked the client some questions to make sure that he understands the information I have given.</p>
                        <p>To the best of my belief the client is capable of giving consent and has enough information to make a proper decision about whether to proceed with the operation of circumcision (removal of the foreskin).</p>
