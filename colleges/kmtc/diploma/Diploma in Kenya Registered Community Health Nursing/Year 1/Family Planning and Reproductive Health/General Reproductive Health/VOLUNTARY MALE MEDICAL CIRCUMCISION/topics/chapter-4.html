                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>This chapter describes the facilities and equipment needed to perform male circumcision safely in a clinic setting. The clinic should be equipped with a narrow operating table, which is high enough to allow the surgeon to operate without stooping or bending. Ideally, this should be a purpose-built operating or minor procedures table, which can be pumped up and down according to the surgeon's height. Also, ideally, the table should tip so that, if the client feels faint, he can be put in the headdown position. However, such tables are expensive and circumcision under local anaesthetic can be safely performed with a fixed-height table. Steps can be provided for the client to climb up onto the table, and bricks can be put under the table legs to create the head-down position.</p>
                        <p>An instrument trolley or table is required on which the instrument tray can be unpacked.</p>
                        <p>The procedure room floor should be made of material that can be easily cleaned and disinfected. Between cases the instrument trolley and the operating table top should be disinfected. If there is any spillage on the floor, this should be mopped with clean water and detergent and then disinfected. At the end of the operating day, the procedure room should be thoroughly cleaned and disinfected starting at the top and continuing to the floor, including all flat surfaces. A liquid disinfectant should be used, diluted as recommended by the manufacturer. Other parts of the clinic, such as the waiting and recovery areas, should be cleaned regularly with water and detergent.</p>
                        <p>The lighting in the procedure room should be arranged so that the penis is well lit, and the surgeon can see what he is doing. Ideally, the clinic should be equipped with an operating theatre minor procedures lamp, but these are expensive. Adequate illumination can be provided by fluorescent lighting over the operating table.</p>
                        <p>Emergency medications and equipment for managing anaphylactic reactions<sup>1</sup> should be available in or near the procedure room. These should be kept in a clearly labelled box, and the contents should be checked periodically (at least every 6 months) to ensure that they are complete and that none of the medications are approaching or beyond their expiry date. The box should be kept in a cool place, away from direct sunlight. In addition, it is important to have available, in or near the procedure room, alternative antiseptic surgical cleaning solution, such as chlorhexidine, for patients allergic to povidone iodine, and spare sutures and needles.</p>
                        <p>The following equipment and instruments are required for standard adult male circumcision:<sup>2</sup></p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The circumcision team needs to ensure that clients are fit for surgery, are well informed about the surgery and are suitable for circumcision under local anaesthesia in their clinic. If there is any doubt as to a client's suitability, he should be referred to the district hospital or higher level of care.</p>
                        <p>The circumcision team should take a focused medical history and perform a clinical examination of the penis. Both the history and the examination should be documented (see sample record form in Appendix 4.1).</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">History</h3>
                        <p>When taking the medical history, enquire about:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>current general health;</li>
                            <li>whether the client is taking any medicines;</li>
                            <li>whether the client has any known allergies to medicines;</li>
                            <li>history of haemophilia, bleeding disorders or anaemia;</li>
                            <li>any current genital infection, ulcer or penile discharge (see Chapter 2);</li>
                            <li>whether the client has problems with penile erection or any other concerns about sexual function.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>There are few medical contraindications to circumcision under local anaesthesia. However, as for all elective surgery, circumcision should not be performed on anyone suffering from an acute disorder, infection or febrile illness. In this case, the operation should be postponed until the problem has been resolved.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Physical examination</h3>
                        <p>The anatomy and structure of the normal penis are described and illustrated in Appendix 4.3. When examining the penis, retract the foreskin and inspect the glans. The urinary opening (urethral meatus) should be near the tip of the glans, and should not be scarred or diseased. The foreskin should be easily retractable and not inflamed or narrowed. If the penis, glans, meatus and foreskin are healthy, the client is suitable for circumcision in the clinic.</p>

                        </figure>
                        <p>Absolute contraindications to clinic-based circumcision include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Anatomical abnormality of the penis.</strong> Men whose urethral meatus is on the underside of the penis (hypospadias) or on the upper side of the penis (epispadias) must not be circumcised, because the foreskin may be needed in a repair operation (see illustrations in Appendix 4.4).</li>
                            <li><strong>Chronic paraphimosis.</strong> In this situation the foreskin is permanently retracted. It is thickened and swollen, and the client will indicate that this is a longstanding problem (see illustration in Appendix 4.4).</li>
                            <li><strong>Genital ulcer disease.</strong> This should be investigated and treated (see Chapter 2). Once treatment has been completed, the client may be suitable for clinic-based circumcision.</li>
                            <li><strong>Urethral discharge.</strong> This should be investigated and treated (see Chapter 2). Once treatment has been completed the client may be suitable for clinic-based circumcision.</li>
                            <li><strong>Other obvious visible pathology,</strong> such as penile cancer. The client should be referred to a specialist.</li>
                            <li><strong>Chronic disorders of the penis and foreskin,</strong> such as filariasis (a parasitic infestation that blocks the lymph ducts and prevents drainage). The client should be referred to a specialist.</li>
                            <li><strong>Bleeding disorders,</strong> such as haemophilia. The client should be referred to a higher level. Careful preoperative assessment and medical preparation are required, and there may be a need to give a preoperative infusion of factor VIII, or to give vitamin K or other medication.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>There are a number of relative contraindications to clinic-based circumcision. Whether circumcision can go ahead in these circumstances will depend on the experience of the surgeon. They include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>A tight foreskin as a result of scar tissue (phimosis).</strong> This may make it impossible to retract the foreskin (see illustration in Appendix 4.4). If there is a history of penile discharge or repeated infections (balanitis), the client should be referred to a specialist. Thick adhesions between the glans and foreskin may also require referral to a specialist.</li>
                            <li><strong>Scar tissue at the frenulum.</strong> Sometimes young men suffer from repeated tearing of the frenulum. This can result in thick scar tissue in the frenulum area and may make circumcision and healing more difficult.</li>
                            <li><strong>Penile warts.</strong> Penile warts can cause a lot of bleeding. Whether the circumcision can proceed will depend on the extent of the warts. It is usually possible to proceed with circumcision if there are one or two small warts on the foreskin, as these will be removed with the foreskin. However, if there are extensive warts, circumcision is best undertaken in a specialist hospital where diathermy is available.</li>
                            <li><strong>Balanitis xerotica obliterans.</strong> This is a plaque of scar tissue that extends onto the surface of the glans and involves the urethral meatus and the foreskin. It is also called lichen planus et atrophicus. In mild cases, circumcision can proceed as normal. If the process involves the urethral meatus, the client should be referred to a district hospital or specialist centre where, in addition to the foreskin being removed, the meatus may be widened.</li>
                            <li><strong>Other abnormalities of the genitalia,</strong> such as hydrocele causing scrotal swelling. The patient should be referred to a specialist centre for assessment.</li>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">HIV testing and informed consent for surgery</h3>
                        <p>All men requesting circumcision for HIV prevention should be offered an HIV test, and appropriate post-test counselling. The purpose of this test is to ensure that more people in the community know their HIV status and are thus better able to take care of themselves, either to remain free of HIV infection, or to take medicine that will slow the progression to AIDS.</p>
                        <p>While an HIV test is recommended for all men requesting circumcision to reduce their risk of HIV infection, the test is not mandatory before the operation can be performed. No person should be forced to have an HIV test against his or her will, and men have the right to refuse without affecting their clinical care. The purpose of the HIV test is not to protect the clinic staff from HIV infection - they should, in any case, take standard precautions to avoid infection with HIV and other organisms, and to avoid passing such infections from one patient to another. Men who are found to be infected with HIV can safely have a circumcision procedure, provided they are clinically healthy, but there is no point in having a circumcision to reduce the risk of acquiring or transmitting HIV infection. It is most important that men with HIV infection take steps to reduce the likelihood of transmitting the virus to others by avoiding penetrative sexual intercourse or always using condoms.</p>
                        <p>The circumcision team should ensure that the client has been informed about the risks and benefits of male circumcision as described in Chapter 3. This information should be given in an understandable way, using everyday local language. The oral information should be backed up by written information sheets in the local language. After receiving the information the client should be allowed to ask questions. He should then be given time to reflect before being asked to sign the certificate of consent. An example information sheet and consent certificate can be found in the appendices to Chapter 3.</p>

                        <p>Surgical gloves prevent transmission of HIV, hepatitis and other infections through contact with blood. However, there is always a possibility that a glove will be accidentally punctured. If this happens during an operation, promptly remove the glove, rinse the hand with antiseptic, and put on a new sterile glove. If the glove has leaked as a result of the puncture, re-scrub before putting on new gloves. Patient safety is of primary concern; do not compromise it. Change gloves only when it is safe for the patient. For example, if the patient is bleeding a lot, stop the bleeding with an artery forceps before changing the punctured glove.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Whether to use a gown</h3>
                        <p>A surgical gown is recommended, though a circumcision operation may be performed with the surgeon wearing sterile operating gloves but without a sterile gown, or using full operating theatre gowning techniques. It is less expensive to use gloves only, and this is the practice in many clinic settings. The surgeon should, in any case, wear a clean theatre uniform, cap and theatre shoes. If a surgical gown is not used, it is important that the surgeon wears a clean apron to protect clothes from splashes during the operation.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Face masks and protective eyewear</h3>
                        <p>Face masks are recommended, as they reduce droplet contamination if the surgeon coughs or sneezes, and protect the surgeon's mouth from any spray of blood droplets. Eyewear is also recommended, and should be worn (together with a mask) whenever an accidental splash of blood onto the face is likely.</p>

                        <p>It is important for the surgeon to have a good understanding of penile anatomy before undertaking male circumcision.</p>
                        <p>The penis is composed of two interconnected erectile bodies, the corpora cavernosa, which are attached and thus anchored to the underside of the front of the pubic bones. During erection, these bodies fill with blood, making the penis rigid. The wall of the erectile bodies is made of tough elastic tissue - the tunica albuginea. The urethra is on the underside of the corpora cavernosa. Surrounding the urethra is a quilt of erectile tissue, the corpus spongiosum, which continues and expands at the distal end of the penis to form the glans; this is like a helmet across the ends of the corpora cavernosa. The corpus spongiosum contributes to engorgement of the glans and to some expansion of the girth of the penis, but does not contribute significantly to its rigidity.</p>
                        <p>The urethra runs along the underside of the penis to the tip of the glans. The urethral meatus should be at the tip of the glans. In the malformation called hypospadias, it may emerge on the underside of the glans in the corona. Minor variations in the position of the urethral meatus are very common and do not require any treatment, provided that the man is able to pass urine freely and has a straight penile erection. The foreskin is the fold of skin that covers the glans when the penis is soft; during sexual intercourse, the foreskin is pulled back away from the glans. In the midline of the underside of the penis, there is a band of skin - the frenulum - which helps the foreskin to return to its usual position. Immediately underneath the frenulum is the frenular artery, which can cause troublesome bleeding during circumcision procedures. Immediately underneath the frenular artery is the urethra. It is important to understand the relative positions of the urethra, the frenular artery and the frenulum, because the urethra can easily be injured during attempts to stop bleeding from the frenular artery. The urethra is also vulnerable to injury in babies, because the tissue between the frenulum and the urethra is very thin and delicate.</p>
                        <p>The erectile bodies (corpora cavernosa), the urethra and its erectile tissue (corpus spongiosum) are in turn held together by a tough penile fascia (Buck's fascia). The penis has a plentiful blood supply from the internal iliac arteries in the pelvis via the pudendal arteries. These in turn divide to give rise to the dorsal penile artery on each side and an artery in the centre of each erectile body. In addition there are many small arteries linking these.</p>
                        <p>The dorsal penile nerves are located on the upper aspect of the penis, slightly to the side of the midline and deep to the penile fascia. At the base of the penis, these nerves are relatively compact but as they run towards the glans the nerve fibres fan out. This is why, in a penile block, most of the local anaesthetic is injected at the 1 o'clock and 11 o'clock positions at the base of the penis (see Chapter 5).</p>
