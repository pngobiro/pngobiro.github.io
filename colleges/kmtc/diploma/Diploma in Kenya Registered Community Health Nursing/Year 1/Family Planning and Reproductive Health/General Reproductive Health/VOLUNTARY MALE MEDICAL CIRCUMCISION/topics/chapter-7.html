                            <li>Possible complications of male circumcision include excessive bleeding, formation of haematoma, infection, an unsatisfactory cosmetic effect, lacerations of the penile or scrotal skin, and injury to the glans.</li>

                            <li>Complications of circumcision can be avoided by ensuring asepsis during the procedure, performing careful and accurate excision of the inner and outer preputial layers, ensuring adequate haemostasis, and paying attention to the cosmetic result.</li>

                        <p>It is very important to monitor the client for at least 30 minutes after surgery, because it is during this period that the effects of surgical trauma and other complications become apparent. Nurses or other staff members can carry out the tasks related to postoperative recovery and discharge, but the surgeon is ultimately responsible for the quality of post-circumcision care.</p>
                        <p>The summary below assumes that the circumcision has been performed in a clinic under local anaesthetic. If circumcision was performed in a hospital under general anaesthetic, the normal hospital recovery room protocols should be followed.<sup>a</sup></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Receive the client from the theatre; review the client record.</li>
                            <li>Monitor the client's vital signs: check blood pressure, breathing, and pulse twice, at 15-minute intervals.</li>
                            <li>Check the surgical dressing for oozing or bleeding.</li>
                            <li>Ask the patient if he has any pain.</li>
                            <li>Observe the general condition of the client.</li>
                            <li>Administer any drugs or treatment prescribed.</li>
                            <li>Provide bland carbohydrates (such as a biscuit) and liquids to raise blood sugar levels unless medically contraindicated.</li>
                            <li>Handle the client gently when moving him.</li>
                            <li>Make the client comfortable, according to the climate.</li>
                            <li>Complete the client record form.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>All men have occasional penile erections during sleep, and young men frequently get erections during the day. After the circumcision, the man will still have erections, which will not disrupt the process of wound healing. If, during the immediate recovery period, there is a particularly prolonged or painful erection, it can be stopped by letting the client inhale one ampoule of amyl nitrate.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Instructions for the client</h3>
                        <p>It is very important to inform the client that he should avoid sexual intercourse and masturbation for 4-6 weeks after the procedure, to allow the wound to heal. A condom should then be used to protect the wound during every act of sexual intercourse for at least six months. Thereafter condoms should always be used to prevent sexually transmitted infections, HIV or unwanted pregnancy.</p>
                        <p>The dressing applied during surgery should be removed 24-48 hours later, provided that there is no bleeding or oozing. If there is any bleeding or oozing, a new dressing may be applied for a further 24-48 hours, and then checked again. Once bleeding has stopped, no further dressing is necessary and the patient should be instructed to wear freshly laundered, loose-fitting underwear. Underwear should be changed each day. After the dressing has been removed, the man can shower twice a day, and should gently wash the genital area with mild soap (baby soap) and water. (This advice may be adapted according to local conditions, including the availability of facilities for washing and showering.)</p>
                        <p>Before discharging the client, make sure that he understands that complications are infrequent, but that he should:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>look for signs of potential problems, namely:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>increasing bleeding,</li>
                                    <li>severe pain in the penis or genital area,</li>
                                    <li>inability to pass urine, or severe pain when passing urine,</li>
                                    <li>discharge of pus from the surgical wound</li>
                                    <li>increased swelling;</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>return to the clinic immediately or seek emergency care if a problem develops.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Make sure the client knows where to go if complications arise. Give the client postoperative instructions, verbally and in writing, if appropriate (see Appendix 7.1). Ask him to repeat the instructions, to make sure that he has understood them. Give him any medications prescribed, and arrange an appointment for follow-up (see below). Check that a responsible adult is available to accompany the client home (this is of particular importance for clients who are below the age of consent). It is helpful if the instructions given to the client are also given to any accompanying adult.</p>
                        <p>The surgeon or designated member of the team should assess whether the client is ready for discharge.</p>
                        <p>Finally, the client record should be completed.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Transfer of client records</h3>
                        <p>All client records should be kept at the service site where the procedure took place. If the follow-up visit will take place at another facility, the client should be given a card to give to the follow-up provider. The card should indicate the date of the procedure, the type of procedure, and any special instructions. If it is necessary to transfer the client's records, a copy should be made and the original kept at the facility where the surgery took place.</p>

                        <p>Ideally, the surgeon who performed the circumcision should conduct the follow-up examination. However, if this is not possible, a trained non-physician can perform the examination and manage minor complications. If the client goes to a different health centre for followup, it is important that the staff at that facility are trained to do a careful follow-up examination and report any complications to the facility where the circumcision took place.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Routine follow-up</h3>
                        <p>The follow-up visit should be within 7 days of surgery. The provider should assess the progress of healing and look for signs of infection. The operation site should be examined, and additional examinations should be done as required by the case history, symptoms or complaints of the client. If the client has a problem that cannot be resolved, another visit should be scheduled or he should be referred to a higher level of care.</p>
                        <p>At the follow-up visit:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Check the medical record or referral form for background information on the client and the surgical procedure.</li>
                            <li>Ask the client if he has had any problems or complaints since the surgery. Specifically, ask if he has experienced any of the following:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>discharge or bleeding from the wound,</li>
                                    <li>difficulty urinating,</li>
                                    <li>fever,</li>
                                    <li>pain or other distress, or</li>
                                    <li>swelling of the penis or scrotum.</li>

                            <li>Examine the operation site to assess healing and ensure that there is no infection.</li>
                            <li>Treat any complications found during the examination (see below), or refer the client to a higher level.</li>
                            <li>Ask the client whether he is satisfied with the service provided or has any comments to make that will help improve the service.</li>
                            <li>Document the follow-up visit in the client's medical record, including any complaints, diagnosis, treatment and comments.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>Clients who come for an emergency follow-up visit should be seen immediately. Staff should be alert to the possibility of excessive bleeding or infection.</p>
                        <p>At an emergency visit:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Examine the client immediately. Check all areas related to his complaint.</li>
                            <li>Read the medical record, if available.</li>
                            <li>Ask the client about the sequence of events since the operation. Ask about: any problems during the surgery or in the recovery period; how problems developed; any increase in discomfort; and any medication taken or other treatments obtained.</li>
                            <li>Arrange for treatment of any problems that can be handled on an outpatient basis.</li>
                            <li>Refer the client to a higher level of care for treatment of potentially serious complications.</li>
                            <li>Note on the client record all problems and actions taken.</li>
                            <li>Inform the facility where the male circumcision was performed about the emergency follow-up visit (if applicable).</li>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>This section describes the complications that can be managed in the clinic setting, and the indications for referral to a higher level of care.</p>
                        <p>If complications occur during or after the circumcision, the team should take the time to inform the client, and if possible his family, about what has happened and the plans to deal with the complication. Anxiety and fear of the unknown add to the distress caused by complications. These can be greatly reduced if the client is given clear explanations about what is happening.</p>
                        <p>For example, a complaint of increasing penile pain and fever 4-5 days after surgery is indicative of wound infection. If there are signs of infection on examination, the client should be given antibiotics and the situation reviewed after 24-48 hours, depending on the severity of the complaint. In these circumstances, the client and his family should be told there is an infection, that antibiotics are needed, and when the situation will be reviewed.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Organizing referrals</h3>
                        <p>A circumcision team working in a clinic setting should have a formal arrangement with the nearest referral centre, so that there are no bureaucratic obstacles when referral is required. When strengthening or establishing national or local circumcision services, adequate funding for referrals should be included as part of the cost of the circumcision service.</p>
                        <p>Many complications can be managed in the clinic setting, but occasionally emergency transfer may be needed. When there is a need for emergency transfer, the following general rules apply:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The client should be transferred by ambulance, lying flat.</li>
                            <li>The client and his family should be given a full explanation of what is happening and why.</li>
                            <li>A clear note should be sent to the referral centre with the client.</li>
                            <li>The client should be told not to eat and, depending on the length of the journey, not to drink, as a general anaesthetic may need to be given at the referral centre. Any accompanying family member should also be given this information.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Complications occurring during surgery</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Excessive adhesions.</strong> If the client has phimosis, so that the foreskin cannot be retracted prior to surgery, there is uncertainty about what will be found once the dorsal slit has been made and the foreskin retracted. If there are excessive adhesions, it may be difficult to separate the foreskin from the glans. Depending on the experience of the circumcision team, it may be better to stop the procedure and refer the man to a hospital. In this situation, the dorsal slit will have to be repaired, using stitches to stop bleeding. It will not be possible to put on a dressing because the man will need to urinate. Nevertheless, the area should be kept as clean as possible. The wound should be covered with a gauze swab, which the man can keep in place by wearing tight underpants. Arrangements should be made for the man to attend the local referral hospital as soon as convenient, and in any case within 24-48 hours.</li>
                            <li><strong>Excess bleeding during surgery.</strong> If there is excessive bleeding during the surgery, the first rule for the surgeon is not to panic. More damage is caused by panic attempts to stop bleeding than by the original injury. Place a swab under the penis and a second swab over the bleeding point, apply firm pressure, and wait five minutes (timed by the clock). After five minutes, slowly lift off the swab. Often, the bleeding will have stopped Do not be tempted to look under the swab before five minutes have elapsed. If the bleeding has not stopped after five minutes, the site of the bleeding will be obvious. Apply a haemostatic artery forceps to the bleeding point. If this does not control the bleeding, apply pressure over a swab for a further 5 minutes (timed). At the end of this time, gently lift the swab again, and under-run the bleeding area with a suture. Remember that the larger blood vessels generally run along the length of the penis, and place the suture proximal to the bleeding (that is, on the side towards the base rather than the tip of the penis). It is very likely that these measures will control bleeding. If, exceptionally, the bleeding continues, the man should be transferred to a referral centre as an emergency, or a more experienced surgeon should be called to help.</li>
                            <li><strong>Bleeding from the frenular artery.</strong> If there is excessive bleeding from the frenular artery, an under-running haemostatic stitch should be used to occlude the artery (Fig. 7.1). Great care is needed not to bite too deeply, because the urethra is near to the surface skin and can easily be damaged.</li>

                            <li><strong>Accidental injury.</strong> Accidental injury can include injury to the glans (e.g. partial severing of the glans) or too deep an incision, resulting in bleeding that is difficult to control. Any bleeding should be controlled by applying pressure over a piece of gauze, and the man should be transferred as an emergency to a referral centre. If the transfer time is likely to be long, insert a urinary catheter, wrap the penis in sterile gauze, and tape the gauze in place. During the transfer, the client should lie flat. At all times, the client and his relatives should be kept informed about what has happened and what is going to be done. The risk of such accidents is reduced if the surgeon has received proper training and certification, and if there is a system of ongoing appraisal and recertification. Risks are higher if the surgeon becomes overconfident, or when timetable constraints result in operations being done in a hurry. To avoid this, countries need to have established and well-funded training and recertification procedures, and clinics need to ensure that adequate time is allowed for surgery.</li>
                            <li><strong>Severing of the glans.</strong> If part or all of the glans has been severed, it should be wrapped in a sterile paraffin gauze to prevent drying and placed in a polyethylene bag. The man and his glans should be transferred as soon as possible to a referral centre, where it may be possible to reattach the glans.</li>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Complications occurring within the first 48 hours after surgery</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Bleeding</strong> is the most likely complication during the first 24-48 hours. A small amount of bleeding onto the gauze dressings is usual, but may alarm the client. If he comes back to the clinic with blood-soaked dressings, these should be removed and the circumcision wound inspected for an obvious bleeding point. If there is fresh blood from the skin edge, a further suture should be inserted. This will require a full sterile procedure, as for the original circumcision, including local anaesthesia and sterile draping. Usually, placing one or two additional mattress sutures over the area will stop the bleeding.</li>
                            <li><strong>Haematoma</strong> may form and may be associated with considerable bruising and skin discoloration. In general, haematomas are best left alone, unless they are very large or there is continued bleeding. The choice is between applying a further clean dressing and reviewing the situation in 24 hours, or applying a clean dressing and sending the client to a referral centre. If the circumcision team is relatively inexperienced, it is safer to send the man to the referral centre.</li>
                            <li><strong>Wound disruption</strong> is unusual in the first few days, but is sometimes seen in association with subcutaneous bleeding and haematoma formation, when the stitches cut out. In this situation the man should be sent to a referral centre. The specialist at the referral centre may decide either to suture the wound or to leave it to heal by secondary intention, depending on the state of the skin edges. If the disruption occurs within 48 hours of the operation, it is usually better for the clinic surgeon to explore and re-suture the wound.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Complications that occur within the first two weeks after surgery</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Infection.</strong> After 2-3 days, the most likely problem is wound infection. An infection often causes increasing pain, and there may be visible signs, such as redness or purulent discharge. The patient should be given an appropriate antibiotic and advised to take frequent showers and to put a clean dressing on the wound between showers. If the infection is severe, the man should be advised to lie on his back, so that his penis is the highest point of his body. This promotes drainage of lymphatic fluid and speeds up the healing process. Sitting in a chair is a bad position. Alternatively the wound can be left without a dressing, but should be protected from flies.</li>
                            <li><strong>Wound disruption and cutting out of stitches.</strong> When stitches cut out, this usually indicates that there is an infection, and the patient should be given antibiotics (see above). If more than 48 hours have passed since the operation, do not try to re-suture the wound, as the new stitches are likely to become infected and also cut out, making the situation worse. The wound should be left to heal by secondary intention. The man should be seen at the clinic as often as necessary until the wound has healed. In general, the healing process after infection leaves an untidy result, at least for the first few months. The man should be reassured that the appearance will usually become normal after about a year.</li>
                            <li><strong>Worsening wound infection with signs of gangrene.</strong> A rare risk of genital surgery is infection with multiple bacteria, causing progressive skin loss. In this situation, the blood supply is cut off, and the skin becomes necrotic and turns completely black. This condition is known as Fournier's gangrene (synergistic gangrene or necrotizing fasciitis) and is more common in men who have diabetes. Any man with signs of spreading infection or black gangrenous skin should be urgently transferred to a referral centre. At the referral centre, it is usually necessary to give a general anaesthetic and remove all the dead skin.</li>

                        <p>In the long term, the client may complain of:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>decreased sensitivity of the glans;</li>
                            <li>oversensitivity of the glans;</li>
                            <li>unsightly circumcision wounds, ragged scars or other cosmetic concerns;</li>
                            <li>persistent adhesions at the corona and inclusion cysts. These problems can be avoided if the foreskin is fully retracted during the operation and all adhesions carefully divided;</li>
                            <li>discomfort during erection from the scrotal being skin pulled up the shaft of the penis and a tight scrotal sac. This can result from removal of too much skin during the circumcision. These problems can be avoided by careful preoperative marking of the incision lines.</li>
                            <li>torsion (misalignment) of the skin of the penile shaft. This can be avoided by taking care during the operation to align the midline raphe with the frenulum.</li>
