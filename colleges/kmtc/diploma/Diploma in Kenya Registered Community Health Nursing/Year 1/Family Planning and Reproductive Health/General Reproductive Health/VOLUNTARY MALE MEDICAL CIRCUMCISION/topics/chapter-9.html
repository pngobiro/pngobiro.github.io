                            <li>The manager of a clinic circumcision service has a number of roles. These include ensuring quality of services, making sure that good quality records are kept, monitoring and evaluating the programme, and carrying out supportive supervision.</li>
                            <li>To meet these responsibilities, the clinic manager must set the desired levels of performance for the services provided, assess current levels of performance, work with other clinic staff to analyse the causes of inadequate performance and find solutions for identified problems.</li>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The clinic manager should ensure that the health care providers maintain adequate records on all clients. Records should include information on the identity of the client, the type of service provided, and any special circumstances associated with it. Sample record forms to assist this task are given in Appendices 9.1 (stock card), 9.2 (stock-taking card for consumables), 9.3 (adverse event form) and 9.4 (register).</p>
                        <p>A more detailed account of indicators and monitoring and evaluation of male circumcision programmes is given in the WHO/UNAIDS publication A guide to indicators for male circumcision programmes in the formal health care system, which can be downloaded from the Clearinghouse on Male Circumcision for HIV prevention (www.malecircumcision.org).</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Indicators</h3>
                        <p>Health care facility managers need detailed information to allow them to make decisions about how best to use scarce resources. They might want to know the answers to questions such as:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Are we reaching our target audience?</li>
                            <li>Can we provide the necessary services (for example, do we have the appropriate equipment, staff and medications)?</li>
                            <li>Are our services of high quality (for example, do they meet national and international standards)?</li>
                            <li>Do our services meet the needs of our clients?</li>
                            <li>Are we referring clients who need it?</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>For each question, managers should develop one or more indicators to monitor the services or the impact of changes. For example, to assess the quality of the circumcision service provided, an appropriate indicator might be the percentage of male circumcision clients who are re-admitted or referred for management of an adverse event.</p>
                        <p>Answering these questions depends on careful record-keeping by staff who understand the purpose of the records.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">What is monitoring?</h3>
                        <p>Monitoring is the routine assessment (e.g. daily, monthly, quarterly) of information or indicators related to ongoing activities.</p>
                        <p>Monitoring helps to:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>track progress towards the programme targets or performance standards; and</li>
                            <li>identify aspects of the programme that are working according to plan and those that are in need of adjustment.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">What is evaluation?</h3>
                        <p>Evaluation is the measurement of how much things have changed as a result of the interventions implemented.</p>
                        <p>There are, of course, many factors that can cause things to change. A formal evaluation tries to demonstrate how much a specific intervention contributed to an observed change.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Why evaluate male circumcision programmes?</h3>
                        <p>The purpose of evaluating a male circumcision programme is to:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>assess progress made at particular points in time;</li>
                            <li>assess progress towards objectives;</li>
                            <li>provide feedback on whether targets are being met;</li>
                            <li>identify reasons for successes and failures; and</li>
                            <li>provide a basis for future planning.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">What is a monitoring system?</h3>
                        <p>Collecting information to track indicators requires the collaboration of dedicated and knowledgeable staff. Obtaining and reporting the required information represent an extra burden of work, and may even be impossible unless an effective monitoring system is in place. This implies:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>All those involved know what information is needed and by whom.</li>
                            <li>The tools needed to collect the information are available.</li>
                            <li>All those involved know how and when to report the information.</li>
                            <li>One person is responsible for making sure the system is working, i.e. that indicators are up to date, that records are being properly kept, and that data are reported to appropriate partners.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The person responsible for the monitoring system must keep clinic staff informed about what needs to be recorded and reported. He or she must also adjust monitoring tools to reflect the information required.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Monitoring performance in male circumcision programmes</h3>
                        <p>Fig. 9.1 is a graphic representation of how monitoring through routine data collection can help identify how programme performance (represented by the thick arrow) relates to programme objectives, using as an example the cumulative number of circumcisions performed per month.</p>

                        <p>Evaluation can be done by:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>reviewing available records and reports (client record forms, clinic register, theatre register, adverse events forms, drug inventory forms, referral forms, etc.);</li>
                            <li>conducting supervisory assessments;</li>
                            <li>having staff conduct self-assessments;</li>
                            <li>conducting peer assessments;</li>
                            <li>obtaining feedback from clients (e.g. through exit interviews);</li>
                            <li>surveying community perceptions of the service;</li>
                            <li>comparing the clinic's services with those of other facilities.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">What are "good data"?</h3>
                        <p>A monitoring system will provide useful information only if the data recorded are "good". Clinic managers should ensure that staff are aware of the following:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Understanding the data.</strong> Staff responsible for keeping records should know exactly what information is needed, for example, adverse events associated with male circumcision.</li>
                            <li><strong>Recording the data every time.</strong> Every time a staff member performs a procedure, sees a client, prescribes medication, receives a test result, or makes a referral, it should be recorded on the appropriate form.</li>
                            <li><strong>Recording all the data.</strong> All the information requested on the monitoring forms should be completed. This might require noting when a particular treatment was not provided.</li>
                            <li><strong>Recording the data in the same way every time.</strong> The same definitions, rules, and tests should always be used for reporting the same piece of information. In the long term, this may not be possible, as tests and definitions change, treatment evolves and new technologies are developed. When it is not possible to record data in the same way, a note should be made describing the change.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>It is not the role of clinicians (surgeons or medical, clinical and nursing officers) to develop a functional monitoring system for the facility. That is the role of the health planner or clinic manager. However, the clinicians need to know who is responsible for the monitoring system, to record data accurately and reliably, and to know how and when to report information related to the service or to patients.</p>
                        <p>Clinicians can also help those responsible for the system by providing feedback about how the system is working, how information is shared with other clinicians, and how easy the various forms are for clinicians to complete accurately and reliably. In this way, the monitoring system to be as accurate and reliable as possible.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Using monitoring information for intervention-related decisionmaking</h3>
                        <p>In the context of record-keeping and monitoring, information is good only if it can be used. Data that cannot be used should not be collected.</p>

                        <p>Quality assurance is the assessment or measurement of the quality of care and services and the implementation of any necessary changes to either maintain or improve the quality of care rendered. Quality assurance has also been defined as a systematic process for closing the gap between actual performance and desirable outcomes.</p>
                        <p>The quality of male circumcision services can be defined through the development and communication of standards. Quality can then be measured by determining whether the standards are being met. Various methods can be used to measure quality, e.g. self-assessment, peer assessment and external assessment. Quality improvement methodology can be used to continuously improve the quality of male circumcision care and services.</p>
                        <p>WHO has developed a comprehensive guide to quality assurance<sup>1</sup> for male circumcision programmes. The guide defines ten service standards that each programme should meet (Box) and includes the essential competences for male circumcision service provision. In addition it outlines the process of quality assessment and includes guidance for facility managers and staff. The guide is supplemented by a toolkit<sup>2</sup> to assist managers and staff assess the quality of services.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Traditional approaches to supervision emphasize inspecting facilities and checking individual performance. They focus on finding fault or errors, and sanctioning those responsible, or thought to be responsible. This type of supervision often causes negative feelings and rarely results in an improved service.</p>
                        <p>In contrast, supervision for performance and quality improvement focuses on:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>the goal of providing high-quality health services;</li>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">The goal</h3>
                        <p>The goal of supervision is to promote and maintain the delivery of high-quality health services. In a traditional system of supervision, this goal is often lost, or at least is not apparent to those being supervised. By clearly stating that the goal of supervision is the delivery of high-quality health care services, the supervisor can transform the sometimes negative impression of supervision into a positive one.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">The style</h3>
                        <p>Supervision for performance and quality improvement should be done in a style that involves as many stakeholders as possible, achieves results through teamwork, and provides constructive and useful feedback. The underlying assumption is that people work better when they actively participate and are listened to, treated well, encouraged to do a good job, and recognized for a job well done.</p>

                        <p>Supervisors can use the step-by-step process of performance and quality improvement presented here to help achieve a high-quality service. The process is illustrated in Fig. 9.2.</p>
                        <p>The process involves a cycle of logical steps, which are repeated until the desired performance is achieved. The cycle can be used to solve any type of performance problem, for instance involving infection prevention practices, management of stocks, or counselling.</p>

                        <p>The performance and quality improvement process involves the following steps.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Define desired performance.</strong> In order for people to perform well, they must know what they are expected to do. Performance standards need to be set. Staff must know not only what their duties are, but also how they are expected to perform them. The desired performance should be realistic and based on common goals, the expectations of the community and the resources available. Examples of desired performance standards related to male circumcision are:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>All clients over the age of 18 years must complete a written informed consent form before undergoing male circumcision.</li>
                                    <li>Instruments used during a male circumcision procedure must be decontaminated in 0.5% sodium hypochlorite solution for 10 minutes before being cleaned and sterilized.</li>
                                    <li>All clients undergoing male circumcision (and/or their parents) should be counselled about HIV.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Assess performance.</strong> The team should continually assess its own performance in relation to how it is expected to perform. This assessment can be done on a continuous basis informally, or more formally at periodic intervals, by monitoring specific activities and steps, conducting self-assessments or obtaining feedback from clients. Using the above desired standards as examples, performance assessment may show the following:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>76% of clients over the age of 18 years completed a written informed consent form before undergoing male circumcision (a gap of 24%).</li>
                                    <li>Instruments used during male circumcision procedures were decontaminated in 0.5% sodium hypochlorite solution for 10 minutes before being cleaned and sterilized 50% of the time (a gap of 50%).</li>
                                    <li>36% of clients undergoing male circumcision (and/or their parents) were counselled about HIV (a gap of 74%).</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Find the causes of performance gaps.</strong> A performance gap means that what is occurring does not meet the performance standards that have been set. If this is found to be the case, the manager needs to explore with staff why the gap is occurring. Sometimes the reasons for poor performance are not immediately obvious, and it may take some time to find the real cause. For example, if 74% of clients undergoing male circumcision are not being counselled about HIV infection, analysis of the gap may reveal the following possible causes:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>shortage of staff (especially counsellors and nurses);</li>
                                    <li>a high client load;</li>
                                    <li>no space in the clinic for counselling clients;</li>
                                    <li>a shortage of test kits for HIV;</li>
                                    <li>staff not aware of facility policy; or</li>
                                    <li>no one in the facility has been trained in counselling and testing.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Select and implement interventions to improve performance.</strong> Once the causes of the performance gap have been determined, the manager and staff will need to identify, put in order of priority, plan and implement interventions to improve performance. These interventions can be directed at improving the knowledge and skills of staff, or the environment and support systems. Many different types of interventions can improve worker performance. To make the best use of resources, it is important to select the most appropriate ones.</li>
                            <li><strong>Monitor and evaluate performance.</strong> Once an intervention has been implemented, it is important to determine whether it has had the desired result. In other words, did the intervention lead to improved performance? Did the team come closer to meeting established standards? If not, the team will need to look again at what is hindering performance, to make sure that the interventions were targeted at the real cause of the performance gap. If performance has improved, it is important to continue monitoring to make sure that the level of performance is maintained.</li>
