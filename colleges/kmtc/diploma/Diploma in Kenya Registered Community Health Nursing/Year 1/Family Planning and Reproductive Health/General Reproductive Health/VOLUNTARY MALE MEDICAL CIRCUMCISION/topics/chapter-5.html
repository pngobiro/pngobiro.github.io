                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Anatomy of the penis and choice of surgical technique</h3>
                        <p>It is important to have a good understanding of penile anatomy before undertaking male circumcision. This is described and illustrated in detail in Chapter 4 and Appendix 4.3. Variations in technique for minor abnormalities of the foreskin are described in Appendix 5.1.</p>
                        <p>Three widely-used surgical techniques for adult and adolescent circumcision are described in detail in this chapter. They have been selected on the basis of extensive experience worldwide, as well as the results from three randomized controlled trials of circumcision in Kenya, South Africa and Uganda. It is not recommended that a nursing, clinical or medical officer learn all three surgical techniques - it is best to become a master of one adult technique and, if appropriate, one paediatric technique. This will produce the best results with the least complications. Providers should become expert in the technique most suited to the circumstances of their practice or the preferred technique adopted nationally. All three recommended techniques are fully illustrated and can be referred to in the context of a training course. After the training the illustrations and step-by-step guide can be used to reinforce what has been learnt and for retraining. Experienced surgeons should be able to perform all three techniques with little difficulty, and to train less experienced providers in any of the three techniques described.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Tissue handling</h3>
                        <p>The surgeon should handle tissue gently. Unnecessary crushing of tissue causes more scarring, delays healing and increases the risk of infection. Use dissecting forceps (tweezers) to hold the skin edge when suturing the circumcision wound; do not use artery forceps. Place haemostatic sutures accurately, taking care to avoid inserting the needle too deep into the surrounding tissue.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Haemostasis<sup>a</sup></h3>
                        <p>Minimizing blood loss is part of good surgical technique and safe medical practice. It is very important, particularly for men who are anaemic. (Ideally, these men should not be circumcised in the clinic, but should be referred to a hospital.) Another important reason to minimize blood loss is to reduce contamination of instruments, operating theatre drapes and gowns, to lower the risk of transmitting blood-borne diseases, such as HIV and hepatitis B, to theatre staff.</p>
                        <p>The following techniques can be used to reduce blood loss.</p>
                        <p><strong>Compression.</strong> After the incision has been made, and at any time during the procedure, oozing of blood from cut surfaces can be controlled by applying pressure over a gauze swab for a few minutes. Usually, this will stop the bleeding.</p>
                        <p><strong>Temporary occlusion of blood vessels.</strong> Control individual bleeding vessels by applying an artery forceps to the blood vessel (Fig 5.1), grasping a minimal amount of adjacent tissue.</p>

                        </figure>
                        <p>An alternative technique is to pick up the vessel using forceps (tweezers) and then apply an artery forceps (Fig 5.2).</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_08_28_398c86f803fa38555eb0g-083-1.jpg" alt="Picking up a blood vessel with forceps to facilitate placing of the artery forceps" class="content-image">

                        </figure>
                        <p><strong>Tying and under-running.</strong> Either tie the vessel or under-run and tie it. The simplest procedure is to tie the vessel below the artery forceps (Fig. 5.3). The basic tie consists of two throws (Fig. 5.3A), but many surgeons make a third throw (Fig. 5.3B) to give the knot extra security.</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_08_28_398c86f803fa38555eb0g-083-2.jpg" alt="Simple tie knot for a blood vessel" class="content-image">

                        </figure>
                        <p>It is important to ensure that the tie is securely placed and not liable to slip off, particularly in the first few days following the operation during a penile erection. If there is any doubt about the security of the tie, it is better to use the under-running technique (Fig. 5.4). Secure the bleeding vessel with an artery forceps. Pass the suture needle just beneath the artery (not too deep!) and pull through, leaving enough suture material for the tie. Then pass the suture beneath the vessel a second time, pull gently to occlude it, and tie a knot, as above.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Diathermy</h3>
                        <p>In surgical diathermy coagulation is achieved by creating heat with an electrical current passing through the tissue. The techniques described in this manual can all be undertaken safely without diathermy equipment and any surgeon undertaking male circumcision should be adept at stopping bleeding without diathermy. Diathermy has the advantage of decreasing haemostasis time thereby reducing the total procedure time.</p>
                        <p><strong>Monopolar and bipolar diathermy:</strong> There are two diathermy electrical circuits in common use - monopolar and bipolar. With monopolar diathermy the current runs from the machine through the diathermy forceps, through the tissue held by the forceps, through the patient's body to a grounding plate, and then back to the machine. In bipolar diathermy the current runs from the machine to one of the two prongs of the diathermy forceps, through the tissue grasped between the prongs and then back through the other prong to the machine. With both types care must be taken to ensure that the patient is not in contact with any metal or conducting material as there is a risk of earth leakage and burns at the point of contact. This risk is greatest with monopolar diathermy. Whenever diathermy is used, care must be taken in positioning on the operating table, the choice of operating table and clinic construction to prevent current leakage to earth. Some monopolar diathermy machines include automatic safety switch off in case of earth leakage, disconnected grounding plate, or poor contact between the grounding plate and skin. The grounding plate should be placed to ensure the whole surface is in contact with the patient's skin, usually on the thigh or buttocks. It may be necessary to shave hairs to ensure good contact.</p>
                        <p>If the machine fails to respond when the surgeon activates the current or there is no obvious and immediate visual evidence of coagulation, the surgeon should immediately stop applying current and check all connections. If current continues to flow, burns may occur where resistance is greatest, most commonly where the grounding plate is in contact with the body, or where the body is in contact with metal. In rare circumstances the burn may occur elsewhere in the body. Monopolar diathermy should not be used for infant circumcision because the point of greatest electrical resistance may be at the base of the penis with risk of coagulation and loss of the whole penis.</p>
                        <p>Further technical description of the current types is beyond the scope of this manual but the circumcision surgeon should be aware that many diathermy machines have different settings for coagulation or cutting currents. Only the former should be used for haemostasis.</p>
                        <p><strong>Diathermy technique:</strong> When using diathermy, the surgeon should apply the forceps as precisely as possible. The best results will be obtained if the blood vessel is grasped between the diathermy prongs with minimal other tissue, and the current activated for the shortest time required to ensure haemostasis. If too much tissue is grasped, diathermy will not stop the bleeding because the heat is too diffuse. Prolonged diathermy causing large black burns should be avoided as these may increase the risk of infection, post operative pain or scar tissue formation. Particular care must be taken near the frenulum because there is a risk of burning through to the urethra which is near to the surface and creating a fistula. Diathermy should also be used with caution close to the skin and mucosal edges as transmitted heat may cause burns. Diathermy can be used to stop bleeding from small blood vessels, but it is safer to apply an artery forceps and tie or under-run larger vessels as described above.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Suture material</h3>
                        <p>Suture size is a compromise between ensuring adequate tensile strength and keeping the amount of foreign material to a minimum. Larger suture sizes produce a more unsightly scar, and small lumps can persist when large-size sutures have been used to tie the blood vessels. The preferred suture size for adult male circumcision is 3-0 or 4-0 chromic gut or vicryl rapide. Vicryl rapide is more expensive than chromic gut. The suture may be mounted on a taper-cut, round-bodied or reverse-cutting needle, according to the surgeon's preference. The taper-cut needle passes more easily through the skin, but easily tears the skin on the inner aspect at the corona.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Suturing</h3>
                        <p>The following are the basic suturing techniques:</p>
                        <p><strong>Simple interrupted suture.</strong> This is the simplest type of stitch and results in good apposition. The point of the needle should pass through the skin at 90 degrees to the skin surface and exit at the same angle (Fig. 5.5). The nearer to the skin edge the needle goes in, the better the skin edge apposition but the higher the risk of the stitch cutting out. If the stitches are placed at a greater distance from the wound edge, there is a risk of inversion (burying) of the skin edges and poor healing. For this reason, in male circumcision, a combination of simple and mattress sutures is recommended.</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_08_28_398c86f803fa38555eb0g-086-1.jpg" alt="Simple interrupted suture technique" class="content-image">

                        </figure>
                        <p><strong>Mattress sutures.</strong> Mattress sutures give a more precise apposition of the wound edges and reduce the risk of burying the skin edges. They are more complex than simple interrupted sutures, and therefore more time-consuming to put in.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Vertical mattress suture</h4>
                        <p>The technique is illustrated in Fig. 5.6.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Start the first bite wide of the incision and pass to the same position on the other side of the wound.</li>
                            <li>Start the second bite on the side of the incision where the needle has just exited the skin. Pass the needle through the skin between the exit point and the wound edge, in line with the original entry point. From this point, take a small bite; the final exit point is in a similar position on the other side of the wound.</li>
                            <li>Tie the knot so that it does not lie over the incision line. This suture approximates the subcutaneous tissue and the skin edge.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>When suturing the circumcision wound, vertical mattress sutures are usually placed in the 12 o'clock, 3 o'clock and 9 o'clock positions (taking the frenulum as the 6 o'clock position).</p>

                        <p>Prepare the skin with povidone iodine antiseptic solution, starting with the glans and the shaft of the penis, and moving out to the periphery. Holding the penis with a swab, retract the foreskin in order to clean the glans. The prepared area should include the penis, the scrotum, the adjacent areas of the thighs and the lower part of the abdomen (suprapubic area), so that there is no risk of the surgeon touching unprepared skin during the procedure. If the patient has a history of allergy to iodine, use an alternative solution, such as chlorhexidine gluconate. The solution should remain wet on the skin for at least two minutes.</p>

                        <p>Circumcision can be done under general or local anaesthesia. Local anaesthesia is preferred, because it is less risky and less expensive. There are two possible techniques for local penile anaesthesia: the penile nerve block and the ring block. The ring block technique is used for circumcision of adults and adolescents and described below. The penile nerve block is used for circumcision of infants and described in Chapter 6.</p>

                        <p>The nerve supply of the penis is the twin dorsal penile nerves. These nerves are located on the top and sides of the penis, at the 11 o'clock and 1 o'clock position near the base of the penis. They fan out towards the glans.</p>

                        <p>Lidocaine with epinephrine must not be used because there is a risk of constriction of the blood vessels to the whole penis, which can cause gangrene and loss of the penis.</p>
                        <p>The advantage of lidocaine is that it works rapidly. An alternative is a mixture of 5 ml of lidocaine, 1%, and 5 ml of plain bupivacaine, 0.25%. This is more expensive but has the advantage of providing longer-lasting anaesthesia (up to 4-5 hours after the operation).</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Safe injection of local anaesthetic</h3>
                        <p>It is the surgeon's responsibility to check the vial of anaesthetic, to ensure that the correct agent at the correct concentration has been selected, and to check the expiry date. It is important to verify that the anaesthetic is clear and that there are no visible particles, which may suggest that the vial is contaminated.</p>
                        <p>Once the needle is in place, but before injecting any anaesthetic, the surgeon should gently aspirate to make sure that no blood enters the syringe. This is to ensure that anaesthetic is not injected into a blood vessel. This safety precaution should be repeated each time the needle is moved, before any additional anaesthetic is injected.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Additional analgesia</h3>
                        <p>Analgesics, such as paracetamol, may be given after the operation. However, best practice is to give one paracetamol tablet (adult dose 500 mg) 1-2 hours before surgery, and one tablet for the patient to take 6 hours later. This produces better postoperative analgesia than postoperative tablets alone.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Ring block technique</h3>
                        <p>Using a fine (23-gauge) needle, inject approximately 0.1 ml of anaesthetic subcutaneously at the 11 o'clock position. Then, without withdrawing the needle, advance it into the subdermal space, making sure that the needle is freely mobile. At this point, inject 2-3 ml of anaesthetic to block the dorsal penile nerves (Fig. 5.13). Then advance the needle subcutaneously around the side of the penis and inject an additional 1 ml of anaesthetic. Withdraw the needle and repeat the procedure, starting at the 1 o'clock position so as to complete a ring of anaesthetic. In some cases it may be necessary to make an additional injection on the underside of the penis to fully complete the ring of anaesthetic. After injection, massage the base of the penis for 10-20 seconds to increase the diffusion of the lidocaine into the surrounding tissues. Once the anaesthetic has been injected, the surgeon should wait for 3-5 minutes (timed by the clock). A common mistake is to start the procedure before the anaesthetic has had time to work. Sensation should be tested before starting the surgery. This can be done by gently pinching the foreskin with an artery forceps. If there is any residual sensation, the surgeon should wait for a further 2-3 minutes and test again. If there is still sensation, more local anaesthetic should be given. Sometimes, it helps to give additional local anaesthetic separately to the frenulum area, but usually the ring block at the base of the penis is sufficient.</p>

Care must be taken to stretch just the aperture of the foreskin and not to push the forceps in too far, because there is a risk of dilating the urethra and causing injury to the urethra and glans.</p>

                        <p>This step is common to all the methods of circumcision described below. With the foreskin returned to a natural "resting" position, indicate the intended line of the incision with a marker pen. The line should correspond with the corona, just under the head of the penis (Fig. 5.17). Some uncircumcised men have a very lax foreskin, which is partially retracted in the resting position. In such cases it is better to apply artery forceps at the 3 and 9 o'clock positions, to apply a little tension to the foreskin before marking the circumcision line (illustrated in Fig 5.28 below). However, it is important not to pull the foreskin too hard before marking the line, as this will result in too much skin being removed.</p>
                        <p>If a marker pen is not available, dabs of gentian violet may be applied with a blunt probe, the tip of an artery forceps or other sterile instrument. Pinch marks made with a toothed forceps are also an alternative.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Three widely used methods of circumcision are described below. All three methods produce a good long-term result, but require different levels of skill. The sleeve method produces an excellent result, but requires the highest level of surgical skill. The forceps-guided method produces a less tidy result initially, but has the advantage that it is a simple technique suitable for a clinic setting. In clinical trials it has been shown to produce consistently good results with low complication rates. It cannot be used for men with phimosis, since the foreskin cannot be fully retracted. The dorsal slit method is probably the most widely used method worldwide.</p>
                        <p>At present, devices similar to those used for paediatric circumcision (see Chapter 6) are either not available or not suitable for adult circumcision. Evidence is needed from clinical trials before such devices can be recommended.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Forceps-guided method of circumcision</h3>
                        <p>This is a simple step-by-step procedure, which can be learnt by surgeons and surgical assistants who are relatively new to surgery. It can be used in clinics with limited resources, and it can be done without an assistant. A disadvantage of the procedure is that it leaves between 0.5 and 1.0 cm of mucosal skin proximal to the corona. The forceps-guided technique was used in the South African and Kenyan trials of circumcision and HIV infection. The version described here was standardized by the Kenyan study team.</p>
                        <p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Prepare skin, drape and administer anaesthesia, as described above.</p>
                        <p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Retract the foreskin and separate any adhesions, as described above.</p>
                        <p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Mark the intended line of the incision, as described above.</p>
                        <p><strong>Step 4.</strong> Grasp the foreskin at the 3 o'clock and 9 o'clock positions with two artery forceps. Place these forceps on the natural apex of the foreskin, in such a way as to put equal tension on the inside and outside surfaces of the foreskin. If this is not done correctly, there is a risk of leaving too much mucosal skin or of removing too much shaft skin.</p>
                        <p><strong>Step 5.</strong> Put sufficient tension on the foreskin to pull the previously made mark to just beyond the glans. Taking care not to catch the glans, apply a long straight forceps across the foreskin, just proximal to the mark, with the long axis of the forceps going from the 6 o'clock to the 12 o'clock position (taking the frenulum as the 6 o'clock position). Once the forceps is in position, feel the glans to check that it has not been accidentally caught in the forceps.</p>

                        <p><strong>Step 6.</strong> Using a scalpel, cut away the foreskin flush with the outer aspect of the forceps. The forceps protects the glans from injury, but nevertheless, particular care is needed at this stage.</p>

                        <p><strong>Step 7.</strong> Pull back the skin to expose the raw area. Clip any bleeding vessels with artery forceps. Take care to catch the blood vessels as accurately as possible and with minimal adjacent tissue. Tie each vessel (see Fig. 5.3 and 5.4) or under-run with a suture and tie off. Take care not to place haemostatic stitches too deeply. When dealing with bleeding in the frenular area or on the underside of the penis, care must be taken not to injure the urethra.</p>

                        <p>When placing the frenulum suture, take care to align the midline skin raphe with the line of the frenulum (Fig. 5.23). A common error is to misalign the frenulum and the midline skin raphe, which results in misalignment of the whole circumcision closure.</p>

                        <p><strong>Step 9.</strong> Place a vertical mattress suture opposite the frenulum, in the 12 o'clock position (Fig. 5.24). The suture should be placed so that there is an equal amount of skin on each side of the penis between the 12 and 6 o'clock positions. The technique of vertical mattress suture is shown in Fig. 5.6. Place two further vertical mattress stitches in the 3 o'clock and 9 o'clock positions (see Fig. 5.8).</p>

                        <p>It is helpful to leave a long end on the horizontal mattress suture at the frenulum (at the 6 o'clock position) and on the vertical mattress suture opposite (at the 12 o'clock position). The long ends of the sutures can be held by an assistant with artery forceps to stabilize the penis during suturing (Fig. 5.25).</p>

                        <p><strong>Step 10.</strong> After placement of the sutures at the 6, 12, 3 and 9 o'clock positions, place two or more simple sutures in the gaps between them. The technique of simple interrupted sutures is shown in Fig. 5.5.</p>
                        <figure>

                        <p>Depending on the skin pigmentation, there may be a strong contrast between the colour of the penile shaft skin and the remaining mucosa. With time the exposed mucosal skin will become darker and the contrast less marked.</p>
                        <p><strong>Step 11.</strong> Once the procedure is finished, check for bleeding. If there is none, apply a dressing (see "Dressing" at the end of this chapter).</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Dorsal slit method of circumcision</h3>
                        <p>The dorsal slit method requires more surgical skill than the forceps-guided method. It is helpful to have an assistant present during the procedure, although it can be done without one. There is a risk that more skin is cut away from one side than the other, giving an asymmetric result. Nevertheless, the technique is widely used by general and urological surgeons throughout the world. It is the technique illustrated in the WHO manual, Surgical care at the district hospital.<sup>1</sup></p>
                        <p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Prepare skin, drape and administer anaesthesia, as described above.</p>
                        <p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Retract the foreskin and remove any adhesions, as described above.</p>
                        <p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Mark the intended line of the incision, as described above.</p>
                        <p><strong>Step 4 (optional).</strong> Some surgeons prefer to mark the line of incision by making a very shallow incision using a scalpel. This is useful on a deeply pigmented man on whom it is difficult to see the line of the marking pen or dabs of gentian violet. Before making the shallow incision, check carefully that the incision line is level with the corona and that even amounts of skin are marked for removal from each side of the penis. The incision should be made just through the skin; it is very important not to cut too deeply and divide blood vessels (Fig. 5.27).</p>
                        <p>One disadvantage of marking the line of incision with a scalpel is that there may be an increased risk of accidental injury to the surgical staff. In addition, a relatively inexperienced surgeon may cut too deeply. However, these risks must be balanced against the risk of a poor result of the circumcision operation if the marking is difficult to see and too much or uneven amounts of skin are removed.</p>

                        <p><strong>Step 5.</strong> Grasp the foreskin with artery forceps at the 3 o'clock and 9 o'clock positions. Take care to apply the artery forceps so that there is equal tension on the inner and outer aspects of the foreskin (Fig 5.28).</p>

                        <p><strong>Step 6.</strong> Place two artery forceps on the foreskin in the 11 o'clock and 1 o'clock positions (Fig. 5.29).

                        <p><strong>Step 7.</strong> Between the two artery forceps, in the 12 o'clock position, use dissection scissors to make a cut (the dorsal slit) up to but not beyond the previously marked incision line (Fig. 5.30).</p>

                        <p>The sleeve resection method requires good surgical skill and is better suited to a hospital rather than a clinic setting. The technique requires an assistant. If bipolar diathermy is available the procedure can be virtually bloodless. Although the cosmetic results are better than with the other two techniques, there is more room for surgical error, either by cutting too deep when making the two circular incisions or cutting too deep when dissecting the skin flap free.</p>
                        <p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Prepare skin, drape and administer anaesthesia, as described above.</p>

                        <p>The dressing should be left in position no longer than 48 hours. Either the patient can return to the clinic where the circumcision was performed, or go to another clinic for postoperative follow-up and removal of the dressing. If the dressing has dried out, it should be gently dabbed with antiseptic solution (aqueous cetrimide) until it softens. It can then be removed gently (Fig 5.42). It is important not to disrupt the wound by pulling at a dressing that has dried to the wound.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">VARIATIONS IN TECHNIQUE FOR MINOR ABNORMALITIES OF THE FORESKIN</h3>
                        <p>The techniques described in this manual assume that the foreskin and frenulum are normal. However, clinic-based circumcision can be undertaken in the presence of minor abnormalities, if the circumcision team has sufficient experience. Any abnormalities should be detected in the preoperative examination of the penis, which should include full retraction of the foreskin. Two abnormalities - both of which are common indications for circumcision require a slight variation in technique.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Phimosis</h4>
                        <p>Phimosis is scarring of the aperture of the foreskin to the extent that the foreskin cannot be retracted. Often the tip of the foreskin will appear white because of scar tissue. If the scar tissue is extensive, then the man is not suitable for clinic-based circumcision and should be referred to a higher level of care.</p>
                        <p>The first step in all circumcision operations is to mark the foreskin with the line of the incision. If the sleeve resection method is used, the phimosis will prevent retraction of the foreskin and the line of incision near the corona cannot be marked. In this case, a small dorsal slit should be made, which is just long enough to allow the foreskin to be retracted. Once retracted, any adhesions can be divided and any debris under the foreskin cleaned with a swab soaked in povidone iodine or cetrimide. Once all adhesions have been divided, the second line of incision on the foreskin near the corona can be marked and the circumcision operation can proceed as usual.</p>
                        <p>In the forceps-guided or dorsal slit methods, the line of incision is marked on the outer aspect of the foreskin in the normal manner. However, with minor degrees of phimosis, it may be necessary to make a small dorsal slit to allow full retraction and cleaning under the foreskin before proceeding with the operation. The forceps-guided method should not be used if there is evidence of extensive scarring.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Tight or scarred frenulum</h4>
                        <p>All males have a band of tissue (the frenulum) on the ventral side of the penis, just below the glans. Usually the frenulum does not interfere with retraction of the foreskin. During early sexual experiences, the frenulum may be stretched as the foreskin is retracted, and minor tears are a frequent problem. Such tears can heal, leaving inelastic scar tissue, which tightens and makes further tearing and scarring more likely. The problem can be seen when the foreskin is retracted during physical examination. Instead of the normal pink frenulum, a tight band of white tissue is seen (Fig. 5.43A). This restrictive frenular band can be easily corrected during circumcision.</p>
                        <p>Spread open the foreskin and retract it ventrally to put the frenular band under tension. Using dissection scissors, snip the band at its centre, taking care not to injure the urethra, which is just under the frenulum. Any bleeding from the frenular artery should be controlled by careful tying or under-running. After the frenulum has been cut, there will be an inverted V-shaped defect (Fig. 5.43B).</p>
                        <p>The circumcision can then be performed as usual. In this case, however, do not suture the penile skin up to the edge of the foreskin defect, since this will cause increased tension on the ventral side. This tension may cause curvature of the penis or possibly make erection or coitus uncomfortable. Instead, close the V-shaped defect by placing the frenular suture 1-2 cm (depending on age and penis size) back from the apex of the V, taking both sides of the defect (Fig. 5.43C). The V incision is thus converted into an inverted T. Suture the rest of the skin as in a normal circumcision (Fig. 5.43D).</p>
