                        <ul>
                            <li>Men have different sexual and reproductive health needs at different ages.</li>
                            <li>Male circumcision reduces the risk of acquiring HIV infection by 50-60%, but does not guarantee complete protection. In addition, it may provide some protection against other sexually transmitted infections, such as syphilis and herpes, but offers little or no protection against gonorrhoea and chlamydia.</li>
                            <li>Male circumcision does not prevent unwanted pregnancy. Comprehensive education and information programmes, and the provision of services for contraception and STI prevention and management, are needed to address male sexual and reproductive health needs.</li>
                            <li>WHO and UNAIDS recommend HIV testing and counselling for all patients who have signs and symptoms of HIV infection. In certain epidemic situations, they recommend routinely offering an HIV test at every contact with health services.</li>
                            <li>WHO and UNAIDS recommend that all men who request circumcision to reduce their risk of HIV infection should be offered an HIV test.</li>
                            <li>The core goals for male sexual and reproductive health services include promoting responsible male sexual behaviour and encouraging men to support their female partners and children in meeting their sexual and reproductive health needs.</li>
                            <li>Sexual and reproductive health education and services are important for men and adolescents, as well as for women. A wide range of people and organizations can provide information and services, including parents, teachers, nongovernmental organizations, churches and youth groups, as well as health care providers in outpatient, family planning, STI, and HIV clinics. Every opportunity to provide education and services should be taken.</li>
                            <li>Male circumcision services for older boys and young men offer an opportunity to provide sexual and reproductive health education and counselling to these key groups.</li>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>For many men, accessing circumcision services may be their first contact with health services. This contact offers an opportunity to address other aspects of men's sexual and reproductive health.</p>
                        <p>As noted in Chapter 1, male circumcision does not provide full protection against HIV, but appears to reduce the risk of infection by 50-60%. It gives little or no protection against STIs that affect the urethra, such as gonorrhoea and chlamydia. It provides no protection against acquisition of HIV infection from unsafe injections, from infected blood products, or through receptive anal intercourse. It also does not prevent pregnancy.</p>
                        <p>To reduce the risk of STIs, including HIV, and unwanted pregnancy, comprehensive education and information programmes are needed, as well as services for contraception and STI prevention and management. A possible consequence of promoting male circumcision for HIV prevention is that circumcised men may perceive themselves as immune, and subsequently increase their exposure to HIV, ignoring other important strategies to reduce risk. These strategies include delaying the onset of sexual activity, reducing the number of sexual partners, and using condoms correctly and consistently every time they have sex.</p>
                        <p>In many societies where male circumcision is performed at the beginning of adolescence, as a rite of passage to adulthood, the circumcision festival period is used also to educate young men about various health and social issues. These cultural traditions can be harmonized with modern clinical practice, to ensure the safety of circumcision, and to use the opportunity to educate the young men about a number of sexual and reproductive health issues.</p>
                        <p>Male circumcision should therefore be regarded as an entry point for sexual, reproductive and other health services for men (Fig. 2.1), including:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>sexual and reproductive health education and counselling;</li>
                            <li>screening and treatment for sexually transmitted infections;</li>
                            <li>counselling and testing for HIV (with referral for care and support for those testing positive);</li>
                            <li>family planning education, counselling and services, including provision of condoms and vasectomy;</li>
                            <li>evaluation and management of infertility;</li>
                            <li>counselling on gender issues, including promotion of respect for women's and girls' sexual and reproductive health needs and rights and the importance of preventing gender-based violence;</li>
                            <li>education about cancers of the male reproductive organs (testes, penis and prostate);</li>
                            <li>counselling for alcohol dependence and other substance abuse, which are associated with a number of health risks.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>No opportunity should be missed for education and counselling about male sexual and reproductive health issues, before and after the initiation of sexual intercourse.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Counselling and testing for HIV Infection</h3>
                        <p>Men considering circumcision do not need to know their HIV status; circumcision can be offered to men irrespective of whether they are infected with HIV or not. The procedure can be performed safely on men who have HIV infection, and may confer some benefit by reducing the risk of HIV transmission to their female partners. The surgical staff who perform male circumcision should take full precautions to avoid acquiring HIV infection during surgery ("universal" or "standard" precautions).</p>
                        <p>WHO and UNAIDS promote testing and counselling for HIV at all contacts with health services, particularly in settings with high HIV prevalence and incidence.<sup>1</sup> However, clients should have the option to refuse an HIV test, without affecting the care and services they receive. This approach is referred to as "routine offer of testing with optional opt-out".</p>
                        <p>It is estimated that fewer than 10% of people in developing countries are aware of their HIV status, and access to, and uptake of, counselling and testing services are limited. Knowledge of HIV status is important, so that those infected can seek advice, support and proper care, and can take measures to avoid passing the infection to others. Care includes prophylaxis with cotrimoxazole to reduce the rate of progression to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), and antiretroviral treatment when clinically indicated. These treatments are becoming more widely available in developing countries. Specific information and messages can also be given to people known to be uninfected with HIV to help them remain free of infection.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Barriers to male sexual and reproductive health services</h3>
                        <p>There are a number of barriers to the development and use of reproductive health services for men, including:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>a lack of information on men's needs and concerns that could be used to design appropriate programmes and services;</li>
                            <li>embarrassment and alienation among men about using health facilities that are primarily designed to address women's reproductive health issues;</li>
                            <li>men's reluctance to seek medical care;</li>
                            <li>inadequate training of health workers to address men's sexual and reproductive health issues;</li>
                            <li>limited availability of contraceptive methods for men;</li>
                            <li>negative attitudes of policy-makers and service providers towards men; for example, viewing men as irresponsible, or not interested in playing a positive role in support of women's reproductive health needs, or not an appropriate clientele for sexual and reproductive health services;</li>
                            <li>unfavourable legal and policy constraints, such as bans on promotion of condoms;</li>
                            <li>logistic constraints such as lack of separate waiting and service areas for men, lack of trained male staff, lack of male-friendly clinics, and inconvenient clinic hours.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>These barriers must be addressed if men are to become more involved in sexual and reproductive health matters.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Access to sexual and reproductive health services is a human rights issue for women, men and young people. The lack of services to address the sexual and reproductive health needs of men contributes to stress and anxiety among them.<sup>2</sup> Various strategies have been used to extend sexual and reproductive health services to men, and to engage men as partners in improving women's sexual and reproductive health:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Services for men may be offered in existing clinic-based services.</li>
                            <li>Separate services may be established to provide information, education and counselling on sexuality, physiological development, family planning, STIs and HIV, genital health and hygiene, interpersonal communication, and sexual and reproductive behaviour.</li>
                            <li>Special services may be established to offer diagnosis and treatment of sexual dysfunction, STIs and HIV, cancer of the prostate, testis and penis, and medical indications for male circumcision.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Other approaches include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>community-based distribution and social marketing of condoms;</li>
                            <li>reaching men with information and services through the workplace, the military and men's groups;</li>
                            <li>special outreach campaigns to young men;</li>
                            <li>educational campaigns through the media;</li>
                            <li>special initiatives, such as outreach through football matches or other popular sporting events;</li>
                            <li>promotion of vasectomy.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Because gender inequality has a strong influence on women's sexual and reproductive health, programme managers need to consider the needs and perspectives of men, women and young people. It is also important to use gender-related and gender-disaggregated indicators when evaluating programmes.</p>

                        <p>Men can influence women's health in numerous ways.<sup>3</sup> As husbands, boyfriends, fathers, brothers, and friends, men can have a positive effect on women's health by:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>preventing the spread of STIs by using condoms consistently and correctly and supporting and encouraging regular condom use by others;</li>

                            <li>supporting women to take decisions about their health without reference to their partner;</li>
                            <li>responding to the physical and emotional needs of women prior to and following miscarriage and abortion;</li>
                            <li>refraining from, and insisting others avoid and prevent, all forms of violence against women and girls;</li>
                            <li>working to end harmful sexual practices, such as female genital mutilation and "dry sex";</li>
                            <li>sharing financial resources with women, and supporting the notion of shared property rights;</li>
                            <li>supporting women's full participation in civil society, including their access to social, political and educational opportunities, many of which have a direct or indirect impact on women's health;</li>
                            <li>supporting the rights of daughters to the same health care, education, and respect as sons.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Who should provide sexual and reproductive health services and information to boys and men?</h3>
                        <p>A wide range of people and organizations can provide sexual and reproductive health services and information to boys and men. Some of the key providers are listed below.<sup>4</sup></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Parents.</strong> Ideally, boys and young men should receive information and basic education on sexual and reproductive health from their parents. However, available data suggest that less than half of boys and young men discuss HIV/AIDS, STIs or family planning with their parents.</li>
                            <li><strong>Teachers.</strong> Many adolescent boys now receive some education on health, family life and sexuality in school. However, for some, the instruction comes after they have begun having sexual intercourse.</li>
                            <li><strong>Peers.</strong> Boys and men of all ages often get information on sexual and reproductive issues from their peers. Much of this information, however, may be inaccurate. One approach is to educate key youth leaders, who can then pass on accurate information to their peers. This has to be an ongoing process, to reach each new generation or group of young men.</li>
                            <li><strong>Community-based organizations.</strong> Places of worship and youth groups are important sources of information, and also provide an opportunity for counselling and skill-building in relation to sexuality, relationships, marriage and parenting. In some cases, the only method taught for preventing pregnancy and STIs is sexual abstinence, despite the fact that young people find it difficult to adhere to abstinence. As a result, they may not know how to protect themselves from risk when they become sexually active.<sup>5,6</sup></li>
                            <li><strong>Family planning clinics.</strong> Some family planning clinics reach out to men, particularly to the partners of their female clients. The availability of male health care providers and separate consultation sessions for men may encourage men to use these services. Although family planning clinics have a long history of providing both medical and counselling services, many men see them as being only for women; equally, some providers may be uncomfortable serving men.</li>
                            <li><strong>Youth-friendly services.</strong> Some countries have developed programmes that specifically address the needs of young people, either through special "youth-friendly services", or by making existing services more welcoming and accessible to young people. Such programmes are an important way of reaching young men who often feel excluded from family planning and other reproductive health services;</li>
                            <li><strong>STI clinics.</strong> These facilities have a long experience addressing sexual health matters, and many men are comfortable seeking services in such settings. However, STI clinics tend to focus on treatment and secondary prevention. Primary prevention of STIs must, therefore, be addressed through other mechanisms.</li>
                            <li><strong>HIV services.</strong> HIV testing and counselling centres can also provide counselling on sexual and reproductive health. If such centres are integrated within primary health care services, they can also provide some sexual and reproductive health services. Facilities providing care for patients with HIV infection and AIDS also have a role to play in promoting sexual and reproductive health for men, women and young people.</li>
                            <li><strong>Physicians, clinical officers, nurses and other health care professionals.</strong> Health care professionals play a critical role, not just as health care providers, but also as educators and counsellors. Urologists and other specialists commonly deal with certain aspects of male sexual and reproductive health, such as diagnosing and treating prostate cancer and performing circumcision or vasectomy. Primary care physicians treat large numbers of men for their general health needs, but may not have the necessary training to provide comprehensive sexual and reproductive health education and services, or be comfortable doing so. Staff providing male circumcision services should be trained to educate and counsel men about their sexual and reproductive health, and should take the time to do this.

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Some common reproductive health problems are described below.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Sexually transmitted infections</h3>
                        <p>More than twenty species of microorganisms are known to be transmissible through sexual intercourse.</p>
                        <p>STIs in men include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>gonorrhoea;</li>
                            <li>chlamydial infection (this is the commonest cause of nongonococcal urethritis);</li>
                            <li>balanitis caused by Candida albicans;</li>
                            <li>trichomoniasis;</li>
                            <li>chancroid (soft chancre);</li>
                            <li>syphilis</li>
                            <li>lymphogranuloma venereum;</li>
                            <li>granuloma inguinale (donovanosis);</li>
                            <li>genital herpes;</li>
                            <li>genital warts (condylomata acuminata).</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The most common symptom of an STI is pain on urination, a burning sensation in the penis, or an ulcer on the genitals. Male patients who complain of urethral discharge or pain when passing urine should be examined for evidence of a discharge. If none is seen, the urethra should be gently massaged from the ventral part of the penis towards the meatus. Examination of a urethral smear under a microscope may show an increased number of polymorphonuclear leukocytes. In men, a finding of more than 5 polymorphonuclear leukocytes per highpower field (x1000) is indicative of urethritis. A Gram stain may demonstrate the presence of gonococci.</p>
                        <p>If a urethral discharge or genital ulcer is confirmed, the patient should be managed according to local treatment guidelines and procedures (syndromic approach). For both conditions, non-medically indicated male circumcision should be delayed until the condition has been satisfactorily resolved.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Balanitis</h3>
                        <p>Balanitis is an inflammation of the foreskin and the glans of the penis. The condition occurs most often in men and boys who have not been circumcised and who have poor personal hygiene. The inflammation can occur if the sensitive inside surface of the foreskin is not washed regularly.</p>
                        <p>Symptoms of balanitis include redness or swelling, itching, rash, pain, and foul-smelling discharge.</p>
                        <p>Factors that predispose to or cause balanitis include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Phimosis.</strong> This is a condition in which the foreskin is too tight to be retracted. Dead skin cells, smegma (a white substance excreted by small glands around the corona of the glans penis) and bacteria accumulate under the foreskin. It is difficult to keep the area clean and inflammation can easily develop.</li>
                            <li><strong>Dermatitis.</strong> This is an inflammation of the skin, with irritation, itching and rash, often caused by an irritating substance or an allergic reaction to chemicals in certain products, such as soaps, detergents, perfumes and spermicides.</li>
                            <li>Infection with the yeast <strong>Candida albicans</strong> can result in an itchy, spotty rash.</li>
                            <li>Certain sexually transmitted infections (including gonorrhoea, herpes and syphilis) can produce symptoms of balanitis.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>In addition, men with diabetes are at greater risk of balanitis. Glucose (sugar) in the urine that is trapped under the foreskin serves as a breeding ground for bacteria.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Treatment for balanitis</h4>
                        <p>Treatment for balanitis depends on the underlying cause. If there is an infection, treatment should include an appropriate antibiotic or antifungal medication, according to national guidelines. In cases of severe or persistent inflammation, or if there is difficulty in retracting the foreskin, circumcision is usually recommended.</p>
                        <p>If the diagnosis or treatment of balanitis is uncertain, the patient should be referred to a higher level of care. Maintaining good personal hygiene can help prevent balanitis. In addition, the patient should be advised to avoid strong soaps or chemicals, especially those known to cause a skin reaction.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Phimosis</h3>
                        <p>Phimosis is a condition in which the foreskin of the penis is so tight that it cannot be pulled back (retracted) from the head of the penis (Fig. 2.2).</p>

                        </figure>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Causes of phimosis</h4>
                        <p>Phimosis can occur at any age and may be present at birth. It may be caused by an infection (balanitis) or by scar tissue formed as a result of injury or chronic inflammation. A tight phimosis can interfere with urination, resulting in a thin urinary stream. In extreme cases, urine may collect between the foreskin and the glans, causing ballooning of the foreskin. In this situation an urgent circumcision is necessary, usually using the dorsal slit method.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Treatment for phimosis</h4>
                        <p>If seen at a peripheral health facility, adult patients with phimosis should be referred to a higher level of care for proper assessment and treatment; this will usually involve circumcision.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Paraphimosis</h3>
                        <p>Paraphimosis occurs when the retracted foreskin cannot be put back in place because of swelling (Fig 2.3). This usually occurs when the penis is erect and during sexual intercourse. The retracted foreskin swells and tightens around the penis. This tightening in turn causes more swelling. Men with paraphimosis should be referred to the district hospital for emergency treatment. If left untreated the condition can result in serious complications, such as skin loss and infection; in extreme cases, it could result in loss of the penis.</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_08_28_398c86f803fa38555eb0g-032-1.jpg" alt="Fig. 2.3 Paraphimosis. A tight band of foreskin constricts the shaft of the penis; the foreskin is swollen with oedema beyond the band." class="content-image">

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Treatment of paraphimosis</h4>
                        <p>Treatment depends on how long the paraphimosis has been present. For acute paraphimosis, wrap the swollen area in gauze and apply increasing pressure on the gauze to squeeze the tissue fluid (oedema) out of the penis. This may take 10-15 minutes. Once the fluid has been squeezed out, it is usually possible to replace the foreskin over the glans. Circumcision can then be done as a planned procedure a few days later. If this procedure fails, or in cases of chronic paraphimosis, the man should be sent to the nearest surgical referral centre.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Urinary tract infections</h3>
                        <p>Urinary tract infections are infrequent in adult men, but more frequent in children and older men. Usually there is an underlying cause, for example, kidney or bladder stones. Symptoms include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>frequent urge to urinate;</li>
                            <li>pain and a burning feeling in the area of the bladder or urethra during urination (dysuria);</li>
                            <li>feeling tired, shaky, and weak (malaise);</li>
                            <li>feeling pain in the bladder or urethra even when not urinating;</li>
                            <li>passing only a small amount of urine, despite an intense urge to urinate;</li>
                            <li>milky or cloudy urine; sometimes urine may be reddish, indicating that blood is present;</li>
                            <li>fever (suggesting that the infection has reached the kidneys);</li>
                            <li>pain in the back or side, below the ribs;</li>
                            <li>nausea;</li>
                            <li>vomiting.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Urinary tract infections in men should be distinguished from urethral discharge caused by an STI. A patient with a urinary tract infection should be told to drink plenty of water, starting immediately. He should also be given an appropriate. Men and boys with recurrent urinary tract infection, or who do not respond to treatment at the first level of care, should be referred for further investigations.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Infertility</h3>
                        <p>Between 60 and 80 million couples around the world are infertile, and most of them live in developing countries. Infertility is defined as failure to conceive after at least 12 months of unprotected vaginal intercourse. A large proportion of cases of infertility in developing countries are attributable to STIs, which can damage the fallopian tubes in women and obstruct the sperm ducts in men, particularly when left untreated. Reproductive tract infections in men can affect the prostate (prostatitis), the epididymis (epididymitis), and the testes (orchitis). In many societies, childlessness is highly stigmatizing, and the couple's emotional response to their infertility is often exacerbated by family, peer and media pressure. Frequently the female partner is considered responsible for the failure to conceive, commonly resulting in marital tension, divorce, polygamy or ostracism. However, a WHO investigation of 5800 infertile couples found that reduced male reproductive capacity was a contributory factor in at least 50% of infertile couples.<sup>7</sup> In order to provide more efficient, systematic and cost-effective care for infertile couples, and to improve the accuracy of diagnoses, health care providers managing an infertile couple should ensure that all essential information is collected. The WHO Manual for the Standardized Investigation and Diagnosis of the Infertile Couple provides clear guidelines and a logical sequence of steps for clinicians to follow in evaluating both partners in an infertile couple.<sup>8</sup></p>
