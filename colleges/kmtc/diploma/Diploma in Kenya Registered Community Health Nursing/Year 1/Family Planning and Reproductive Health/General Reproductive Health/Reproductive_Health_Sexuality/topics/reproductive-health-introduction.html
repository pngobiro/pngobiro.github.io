                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>According to the World Health Organization (WHO), reproductive health is a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity in all matters related to the reproductive system, its function and processes. This implies that people are able to have a satisfying and safe sex life and that they have the capability to reproduce and the freedom to decide if, when and how often to do so.</p>
                        <p>Reproductive health addresses the reproductive processes, functions, and systems at all stages of life. It is a universal concern but holds special importance for women, particularly during their reproductive years. Men also have specific reproductive health needs and responsibilities. Fundamentally, reproductive health is a core component of an individual's overall health and a central determinant of their quality of life.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">The Life Cycle Perspective</h3>
                        <p>Reproductive health needs differ at each stage of life, from infancy to old age. The health status in one phase can have cumulative effects and implications for well-being in later phases. For example, health during childhood is crucial during adolescence and sets the stage for health in adulthood. An inability to address reproductive health problems at any stage can lead to future complications.</p>

                            <li><strong>Infertility and Fecundity:</strong> Primary infertility is the failure to bear any children after 12 months of unprotected intercourse, while secondary infertility is the failure to conceive after a first birth. Fecundity refers to the ability of a couple to conceive over time.</li>
                            <li><strong>Issues During and After Pregnancy:</strong> These include congenital anomalies (structural, functional, or genetic abnormalities at birth), ectopic pregnancy (implantation outside the uterus), fetal death (stillbirth), and spontaneous abortion (miscarriage).</li>

                        <p>Reproductive health encompasses a wide range of services and information. The key components include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Safe Motherhood:</strong> This includes pre-natal, peri-natal, and post-natal care, as well as breastfeeding support and neonatal care.</li>

                            <li><strong>Reproductive Tract Infections:</strong> Prevention and management, especially for Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs) including HIV/AIDS.</li>
                            <li><strong>Cancer Screening:</strong> Early detection of cancers of the reproductive system, such as cervical and breast cancer.</li>
                            <li><strong>Menopause Care:</strong> Management of health issues like osteoporosis and atherosclerosis.</li>
                            <li><strong>Gender-Based Violence:</strong> Addressing and preventing violence related to gender.</li>

                            <li>Lead a responsible, satisfying, and safe sex life.</li>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Major Obstetric Causes of Maternal Mortality</h3>
                        <p>Maternal mortality is defined as the death of a woman while pregnant or within 42 days of the end of a pregnancy, from any cause related to or aggravated by the pregnancy or its management. The five major direct causes are:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Hemorrhage (pre-natal, peri-natal, or post-natal)</li>
                            <li>Sepsis (infection)</li>
                            <li>Pregnancy-induced hypertension (especially in first-time mothers)</li>
                            <li>Unsafe abortion</li>
                            <li>Obstructed labor</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Indirect causes include pre-existing diseases aggravated by pregnancy, such as malaria, HIV/AIDS, and anemia.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">The Three Delays Model</h3>
                        <p>Maternal and neonatal mortality is often attributed to three distinct levels of delay:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Delay in deciding to seek appropriate care:</strong> This can be due to socio-cultural barriers, failure to recognize danger signs, or cost considerations.</li>
                            <li><strong>Delay in reaching an appropriate health care facility:</strong> This is often caused by long distances, poor roads, lack of transportation, and cost.</li>
                            <li><strong>Delay in receiving adequate emergency care at the facility:</strong> This may result from shortages of staff, supplies, and equipment; unskilled personnel; or user fees.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Key Strategies and Policies in Kenya</h3>
                        <p>Kenya has implemented several strategies to improve maternal and newborn health, guided by frameworks like the Kenya Essential Package for Health (KEPH) and Vision 2030.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>The Kenya Maternal and Newborn Health (MNH) Pillars:</strong> These pillars provide a comprehensive approach, including Family planning, Focused Antenatal Care, Essential Obstetric Care, Essential Newborn Care, Targeted Postpartum Care, and Post Abortion Care.</li>
                            <li><strong>Skilled Attendance at Delivery:</strong> Ensuring that deliveries are managed by professionals with midwifery skills (e.g., doctors, midwives, nurses) is a key intervention to reduce maternal mortality.</li>
                            <li><strong>The Community Strategy:</strong> This approach empowers households and communities to take an active role in health, addressing issues at level 1 of the KEPH service delivery model.</li>
                            <li><strong>Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs):</strong> Following the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), the SDGs (2015-2030) continue to prioritize health, with Goal 3 aiming to "Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages."</li>
